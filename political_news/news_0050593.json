Statistics are broken down into micro levels â€” by county, by city, by city blocks and micropolitan and metropolitan areas. The interactivity of the site speeds up basic demographic research new and existing businesses use to formulate expansion and relocation plans, Hosemann said. \"What used to take two weeks now takes two minutes,\" he said at the site's unveiling in Ridgeland. YallBusiness does all of your research for you. Information is the key to profitability. As this concept evolved, we decided we wanted to provide as much information as we could to Mississippians. We want to arm our local businesses with information so they can compete not only here but across the world.\" ClarionLedger Posted October 1, 2015 - 5:09 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
