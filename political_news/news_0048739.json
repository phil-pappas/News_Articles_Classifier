Another man comes from across the street to say hello. \n\"Joe\" a passerby shouts from his car, extending a \"thumbs up\" sign from the open window. \nThe scene reveals just how well-known Hogsett is in Indianapolis. And it plays out over and over again during this long day of campaign stops for the Democrat mayoral candidate, a day that wouldn't conclude until late that night. \nTo a political candidate, the kind of name-recognition Hogsett enjoys is a currency that can be as good as gold. It's a commodity he has carefully and consciously cultivated over more than three decades as a political and public figure. And it's one of the main things that sets him apart from Republican opponent and political newcomer Chuck Brewer. \nAs he works the campaign trail, Hogsett, 58, is repeatedly asked whom he's running against. But in an election where turnout is expected to be low, Hogsett knows the name-recognition advantage he holds over Brewer is not necessarily enough on its own to win the race, even though he is widely considered the heavy favorite. \nHogsett knows from experience that his fortunes in electoral politics can change dramatically. After being anointed a Golden Boy of Indiana politics for his behind-the-scenes role in Evan Bayh's political rise, then defeating former Indianapolis mayor William Hudnut in the 1990 race for Secretary of State, Hogsett's political career took a decidedly downward turn at the polls. \nHe lost a 1992 Senate race to Dan Coats, a 1994 Congressional race to David McIntosh and a 2004 race for Indiana attorney general to Steve Carter. \nIn those races, however, Hogsett faced well-financed opponents. That's not the case in the mayor's race against Brewer, where Hogsett's nearly $4 million war chest is quadruple that of his opponent. \nThat financial advantage has allowed Hogsett to further promote his image as a federal prosecutor who was tough on crime while also cutting spending each of his four years as U.S. Attorney. Fighting crime and fiscal accountability are key elements of his platform, which includes: hiring more police officers and initiating neighborhood-based prevention and early intervention programs; directing more attention to redevelopment, economic opportunity and educational options in struggling neighborhoods; and a focus on ethics, streamlining services, accountability and wise fiscal management throughout city government. \nBut Hogsett's long career in politics also is his critics' biggest target. \nThey're banking on the hope people will see Hogsett as a career politician, albeit largely unsuccessful, and be turned off at a time when the national electorate has taken a shine to outsiders such as GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. \n\"It's not surprising that folks know about Joe Hogsett, especially since this is the fourth or fifth time he has run for public office,\" said Marion County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Walker. \n\"He also has a lengthy list of special interest groups and others folks he can get money from to pay for TV commercials to keep his name out there. But I don't know if anyone really knows what his plan is, or where he stands on many of the important issues Indianapolis is facing.\" \nWalker said it won't be money or feel-good TV commercials that will count when Indianapolis voters select a new mayor Nov. 3, only the final vote tally. \nHogsett, though, isn't counting on just the commercials or his name ID, either. \nHe's been campaigning at full steam for the past year, showing up for parades and shaking hands at homecoming events, neighborhood forums, church services and fish frys in all corners of the city.

In some ways, though, it seems he has spent his whole life campaigning, even though his stint as U.S. Attorney from 2010-2014 prevented the Rushville native from direct involvement in political activity. \n\"Joe's always been a very focused person,\" said lifelong friend Brian Bess, who grew up with Hogsett in Rush County. \nAs many of their high school buddies were looking toward graduation, but unsure what they wanted to do with the rest of their lives, Bess said Hogsett had already set his eyes on a high bar. He wanted to be president. Of the United States. \n\"Joe just always seemed to know what he wanted to do,\" Bess explained. \"He's always had that passion for politics and public service.\" \nAnd he went for it, getting involved in student government at Indiana University, where he graduated with honors in 1978. As an undergrad, he spent the summer of 1977 interning in Washington, D.C. with then-Indiana Congressman Phil Sharp. And his senior year, Hogsett was elected president of the Student Foundation. \nHogsett graduated from the Indiana University Maurer School of Law in Bloomington in 1981 and went to work for the Indianapolis law firm Bingham Summers Welsh & Spilman , where he focused on labor law. But he also kept his fingers in politics. \n\"Joe is certainly one of the brightest people I have ever known,\" said Indianapolis attorney Bill Moreau, a friend who worked with Hogsett at the law firm. \n\"He has a restless mind, as evidenced by his three master's degrees achieved after he had racked up an enviable academic and extracurricular record at IU for both his undergraduate and law degree -- and while he was working full time.\" \nHogsett's intellect is matched by an amazing energy and work ethic, said Moreau, who also teamed with Hogsett on Bayh's 1986 campaign for Secretary of State and 1988 campaign for governor. \n\"I'm not as smart as Joe,\" he said, \"but I always tried to outwork him -- and always failed.\" \nAfter Bayh was elected governor in 1988, Hogsett, just 32 at the time, was named to fill the remainder of Bayh's term as secretary of state. Two years later, Hogsett defeated Hudnut, winning his first -- and only -- statewide race. \nMoreau said Hogsett's subsequent defeats were the product of some bad advice and poor timing, including jumping into races in two election cycles where almost all Democrat candidates took a shellacking. \nThe candidate running for mayor of Indianapolis is the same smart, hard-worker that Hoosiers have come to know, Moreau said, but with some subtle differences. \nBecoming a parent has added to Hogsett's perspective and outlook, he said. Moreau also believes Hogsett's experience as U.S. Attorney changed him. \n\"Joe saw with his own eyes the impact of crime upon innocent victims, especially the most vulnerable of all, the victims of child pornography,\" Moreau said. \nAs U.S. Attorney, Hogsett maintained a significantly higher profile that his predecessors, fueling speculation -- and gripes -- he was using the office to set the stage for another run for elected office. Hogsett resigned his job as U.S. Attorney in July 2014, and just weeks later announced the formation of an exploratory committee for his mayoral run. \nOn the campaign trail just weeks before the election, it's clear Hogsett is back in his element. He's a consummate campaigner who seems to have never met a stranger. \n\"What you see is the same Joe people have seen for the last 30 years -- the Joe everybody knows and loves,\" said Hogsett's campaign manager Thomas Cook. \"He's still going 100 miles an hour He's just a little older and wiser.\" \nHogsett demonstrates his skill as he makes his way through the throng of tailgaters outside Hinkle Fieldhouse before Butler's homecoming game. From students chugging beer through funnels to well-heeled alumni, many seem to know Hogsett. Many want a picture, and he gladly obliges. \nWearing a Butler sweatshirt -- Hogsett insists it's not a campaign ploy since he earned a master's degree from the university in 1987 -- the candidate spots a familiar face and veers through the crowd. He greets Shawna Lester-Scalf, 40, with a smile and hug, just as he'd done a few minutes earlier with an old friend from his days as a high school student in Rushville. Hogsett makes small talk with the Indianapolis woman for several minutes, before Cook subtly urges him to move on. \n\"He's old-school. Down to earth,\" Lester-Scalf said after Hogsett moves back into the crowd. \nWhen asked how long she's known the candidate, Lester-Scalf looked puzzled. They had only met one time, she said, a couple weeks earlier when Hogsett visited Trinity CME church. \n\"He took time out to talk to everybody,\" she said. \nFighting crime \nCrime is a common theme that Hogsett hammers on as he works the campaign trail. \nThe almost-daily shootings and other violent incidents that fill the headlines represent one of, if not the biggest issue that the new mayor will face, Hogsett said. And while he and Brewer share many similar positions on the issue -- including the need for more police officers on the streets -- Hogsett said there is one major difference. He has the track record to do something about the problem. \n\"There's no magic wand,\" Hogsett explained after meeting with about 20 police officers, who complained of low morale and a desperate need for more help. \n\"But my work as a federal prosecutor brings a level of credibility. They know I've dealt with the knuckleheads and the problems they've had to clean up. There's a level of credibility and trust I bring to addressing these issues.\" \nWalker, the county GOP chairman, said he's not so sure about Hogsett's claim. \n\"I think his time as U.S. Attorney could have been better spent had he actually prosecuted more gun-related crimes eligible for stiffer federal penalties, rather than rushing to find a camera to make an announcement,\" he said. \nWalker admitted he was unable to provide data that would counter claims that Hogsett increased gun-crime prosecutions, but said he's seen and heard plenty of anecdotal evidence to the contrary from law enforcement officers and officials disappointed with Hogsett's record. \nHogsett said he's trying to stay above campaign slams and negative attacks. Instead, he said, his focus is on finding solutions to the city's crime problem -- the product of a complicated mix of social and cultural issues that can't be solved simply by making more arrests. His 14-page public safety plan issued in June is front-loaded with proposals aimed at addressing challenges facing the city's youth and investment in neighborhoods where crime often looks like the best opportunity. \n\"It seems to me we should be looking at how do we keep our kids out of the criminal justice system. We need to invest in our neighborhoods and our kids, hopefully encouraging them to stay away from bad decisions,\" he said. \n\"We're not going to solve this problem overnight. But it didn't come to be overnight either.\" Buy Photo Joe Hogsett, Democratic candidate for mayor of Indianapolis, prepares to participate in a live debate on Oct. 16, 2015, at the WISH-TV studios in Indianapolis.
