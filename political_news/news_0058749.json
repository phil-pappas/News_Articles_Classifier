One nurse described seeing six patients \"burning in their beds\" in the hospital's intensive care unit.\nSome details of the airstrike are hazy. U.S. military officials initially said they were called in to protect U.S. ground forces under attack by Taliban insurgents, then changed their story the next day and said Afghan forces called for the strikes. Some Afghan leaders suggested that the Taliban were using the hospital as a base, which Doctors Without Borders has vehemently denied.\nIt is also unknown why the hospital was targeted, given that Doctors Without Borders provided military officials with their GPS coordinates both before and during the strikes.\n\"The facts and circumstances of this attack must be investigated independently and impartially, particularly given the inconsistencies in the U.S. and Afghan accounts,\" Doctors Without Borders International President Dr. Joanne Liu said in a statement. \"It is unacceptable that the bombing of a hospital and the killing of staff and patients can be dismissed as collateral damage or brushed aside as a mistake.\"\nAn independent investigation should be a minimal first step. Such incidents generate more ill will and enemies -- \"blowback,\" in intelligence parlance -- than our military actions can remove.\nPresident Obama is reportedly rethinking a complete pullout of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, but the hospital bombing should reinforce the notion the U.S. \"war of choice\" in Afghanistan is not worth the costs. We only compound our moral culpability for such incidents the longer we remain engaged there.\n(c)2015 The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.)\nVisit The Orange County Register (Santa Ana, Calif.) at www.ocregister.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1738986", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1738986&h=No+excuse+for+US+bombing+of+Afghan+hospital", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1738986&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:52:52.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
