Bernie Sanders raised more than $24 million for his presidential campaign in the past three months, his campaign said Wednesday, nearly matching the $28 million take of Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nThe bulk of Clinton’s $28 million total came from fundraisers hosted by big donors across the country, many held in the traditionally Democratic treasure-chests of Manhattan and Hollywood. She raised at least $19 million from about 60 events where admission typically cost $2,700, the biggest donation allowed by law.\nSanders’ total was fueled almost entirely by small donations, underscoring the draw of his insurgent campaign among the grassroots of the Democratic Party. On Wednesday alone, the campaign raised at least $1.5 million, the result of tweets and emails imploring supporters to give before the midnight close of the fundraising period.\nSanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs said most of the contributions came online.\n“We have a chance to send an unmistakable message about the size and strength of our campaign,” Sanders tweeted on Wednesday.\nWhile Clinton’s total for the past three months is just a little more than half of the $47.5 million she raised during the previous fundraising period, it’s almost exactly what she brought in during the same period during her 2008 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nA key difference: In the previous campaign, she simultaneously raised money for the primary and general election, the latter of which she wasn’t able to use after losing to Barack Obama. This time, Clinton is raising only money for the primary election — meaning she can use every penny in her bid to secure her party’s nomination.\nClinton’s campaign has set a goal of bringing in $100 million by the end of the year, a sizable sum intended to fund the hundreds of staffers and massive infrastructure her team has placed across the country.\n“Thanks to our supporters, we are able to meet our goals and build an organization that can mobilize millions of voters to ensure Hillary Clinton is their fighter in the White House,” campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/30/DetroitNews/B99310193Z.1_20150930212710_000_G19JLTLJ.2-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c48158a81b74fdf3126504210342c20c16dee98b/c=136-0-2864-2046&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/09/30/DetroitNews/B99310193Z.1_20150930212710_000_G19JLTLJ.2-0.jpg", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-01T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:48:34.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
