Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks during the CNN Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday in Las Vegas.\nBy Joseph P. Williams Oct. 14, 2015 | 1:08 a.m. EDT + More When he took the stage in Las Vegas for the first Democratic presidential debate there were a lot of chips on the table for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the man chasing Hillary Clinton for the 2016 presidential nomination.\nGiven a prime-time opportunity to simultaneously expose his polarizing, vulnerable rival and define socialism to millions of skeptical viewers, pundits wondered: Would Sanders go big and attack? Or would he stick to the wealth-inequality script that's catapulted him from obscurity to a political stardom, a phenom who's packing them in by the thousands at rallies from Arizona to South Carolina?\nSanders went with the latter route, largely choosing not to make his case at Clinton's expense. And he had plenty of opportunities to attack Clinton on her relationships with Wall Street, her vote for the Iran War, her husband's decision to deregulate the big banks, campaign finance reform and the role of capitalism in widening the gap between rich and poor in the U.S.\nRELATED\nIn Debate Hillary Clinton Reminds Democrats Why She's the Front-Runner Instead of swinging a haymaker, however, the senator delivered Clinton a ready-made political ad when moderator Anderson Cooper asked about her Achilles' heel: the slow-moving, Republican-led investigation of her use of private email servers during her time as secretary of state.\n\"I think the secretary is right -- the American people are sick and tired of hearing about the damn emails,\" Sanders said. The crowd roared. Clinton, who'd just finished defending herself on the question, grinned and laughed, then shook Sanders' hand.\nThe strategy, an attempt by the senator to focus on \"the serious issues' rather than political gamesmanship, probably won't win Sanders much of a bump when the post-debate polls come out; he didn't have a breakout moment, and his defense of Clinton was the line of the night. But it's the same script that has been working for Sanders, who's leading Clinton in New Hampshire and gaining ground on her in Iowa, even if she still leads him nationally by double digits.\nAlthough analysts credited Sanders after the debate for sticking to his clean-elections, issues-only-please principles, however, he didn't do much to distinguish himself from Clinton -- or explain himself to casual observers wondering what all the fuss is about. Sanders and Clinton seemed to agree more than not on topics like climate change, wealth inequality and how Republicans had, in their views, ruined the nation.\n[ READ: The Lineup for the First Democratic Debate ]\nEven their competing plans for free college for any high school graduate who qualifies wasn't a distinct difference; both have similar plan to draft legislation to tax Wall Street to pay for it. They quibbled a bit over the details; Sanders says Clinton's plan doesn't go far enough, while Clinton says her plan keeps the children of the wealthy from taking advantage.\nYet Clinton forced Sanders to stumble on perhaps his biggest vulnerability: his long-time aversion to the kind of full-scale gun control liberals are clamoring for in the wake of the latest mass shooting in Oregon. Though he argued he has a D-minus rating from the powerful National Rifle Association, Sanders hedged on whether he'd call for stronger gun control laws, insisting the best way to prevent crime is by \"coming together\" with gun owners and anti-gun advocates.\nAsked to explain his vote against a bill that would have allowed crime victims to sue gun manufacturers, Sanders said it was a \"complicated\" bill that would have produced unintended consequences for a rural state like Vermont, where guns are considered sacrosanct.\n\"This was a large and complicated bill,\" he said. \"For example, do I think that a gun shop in the state of Vermont that sells legally a gun to somebody, and that somebody goes out and does something crazy, that that gun shop owner should be held responsible? I don't.\"\nClinton -- who last week called for tougher gun laws -- saw an opening. Asked if Sanders was tough enough on guns, her answer was simple: \"No, not at all.\"\nRELATED\nLive: Democratic Presidential Debate 10/13/2015 On foreign policy, Sanders was challenged on whether, as a socialist who sought and obtained a deferment to serve in VIetnam, he was qualified to serve as commander in chief.\n\"I am not a pacifist,\" Sanders declared, reminding viewers that he'd voted for use of force in Afghanistan and Kosovo. But, he added, \"I happen to believe from the bottom of my heart that war should be the last resort that we have got to exercise diplomacy But yes, I am prepared to take this country into war if necessary.\"\nSanders drew applause for not hesitating to respond that Black Lives Matter, for reiterating his position as a self-described Democratic Socialist and for reminding audiences \"where we were when Bush left office.\"\n\"Are we better off today than we were then? Absolutely,\" he said. \"But the truth is that for the 40 years, the great middle class of this country has been disappearing. And in my view what we need to do is create millions of jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure; raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour; pay equity for women workers; and our disastrous trade policies, which have cost us millions of jobs; and make every public college and university in this country tuition free.\"\nIt was preaching to the choir, for Sanders supporters. But for the rest of the country, it was an introduction to what the \"Feel the Bern\" fans are cheering about.\nTAGS: Sanders, Bernie debates Clinton, Hillary democracy", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6f16%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Bernie%20Sanders%20Holds%20His%20Own%20in%20First%20Democratic%20Debate&summary=Hillary%20Clinton%E2%80%99s%20main%20rival%20even%20came%20to%20her%20defense%2C%20making%20himself%20look%20good%20in%20the%20process.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6f16%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6f16%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6f16%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Bernie%20Sanders%20Holds%20His%20Own%20in%20First%20Democratic%20Debate", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6f16%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6f16%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Bernie%20Sanders%20Holds%20His%20Own%20in%20First%20Democratic%20Debate"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:27:44.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
