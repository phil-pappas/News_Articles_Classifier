As a result, the disadvantages a child faces in school are even greater and his or her chances for success are greatly diminished.\nMr. Morse explained, \"As the father of three girls, I know how important and exciting the first day of school can be. I want it to be that way for every kid. My firm's and my goal is to increase a child's chances by leveling the playing field right from the outset. We want to let them know that someone cares.\"\nWhile Mr. Morse and his law firm continue their drive to secure donations for more students both in and outside of Detroit , he is pleased and humbled to receive recognition for his efforts thus far.\n\" The Spirit of Detroit statue has always been an inspiring landmark to me,\" Morse explained. \"It represents everything that makes this city great, from generosity and character to passion and tenacity. To receive this award for simply repaying the city that has already given me so much feels like a double win for me. I am honored, to say the least.\"\nThe award presentation meeting will take place at 10:00 am on Tuesday, October 20 on the 13 th floor of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, 2 Woodward Avenue, Detroit , 48226. Members of the public are welcome to participate.\nThe Mike Morse Law Firm is Michigan's largest personal injury firm, specializing in Auto and Social Security Disability Claims.
