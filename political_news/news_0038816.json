Attacks on Civilians, From Afghanistan to Iraq One of the most chilling experiences I've ever had was visiting the site of the Amariyah air raid shelter in Baghdad, Iraq - now a memorial - just a few weeks before the 2003 US invasion of that country. My husband, George Sapio, and I were catching up on a lot of history, learning about how US bombs in 1991 and throughout the Clinton years, in combination with US-imposed sanctions, had devastated Iraqi society. What happened at Amariyah was horrific. This is what I wrote then, in a piece for Salon: We went to the site of the Amiriya [sic] bomb shelter, where at 4:30 on the morning of Feb. 13, 1991, more than 400 people, mostly women and children, were vaporized by a U.S. \"smart bomb\" as they slept in this \"safe place\" where they'd sought refuge. The bomb caused the temperature in the shelter to rise to 900 degrees Fahrenheit in moments; the bodies were incinerated, the remains blasted into the concrete floor. We stared at the outlines of the children sleeping curled up or stretched out, some of them hugging a sister or brother or mother. One woman was standing, breast-feeding her baby, when the bombs hit. Her image is burned into the concrete wall, her mouth frozen in a scream. My heart remains heavy for the people of Iraq, who still have no infrastructure. (In most of the country, electricity is two hours on, two hours off, at its best, even when summer temperatures soar to the 110s Fahrenheit and higher, and winter temperatures sink into the 50s and 40s.) And for the people of Afghanistan, and Syria, and all the places where terror - much of it fomented by my own government - is the way of life for all civilians, whether they remain in their ancestral homes or have been forced into displacement in their own or strange lands . .. Profits over people applies ESPECIALLY to our wars. We can't chide anyone else until we behave like civilized beings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:24:40.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
