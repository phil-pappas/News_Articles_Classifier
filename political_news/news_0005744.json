She claimed it had only been forced to fold after details were leaked that Scotland Yard had launched an investigation into historical sexual abuse at the organisation. More Sturgeon cautious on referendum timing \nThe timing of the leak was “suspicious”, she told members of the Commons public administration committee on Thursday, as it came just hours after the charity received a £3m government grant. \n“Only our finance person and the Cabinet Office knew that the money had hit our account. Suddenly out of the blue we get allegations that we don’t even know relate to sexual abuse,” she said. \n“Within hours, it was all over the BBC and news outlets that these related to allegedly sexual abuse against children by Kids Company. That was the kiss of death for a charity dealing with children.” \nMr Yentob, who is also the BBC’s creative director, tried to be more emollient before the committee but he, too, said he believed the leak was malicious. While he said that the allegation of sexual misconduct had not come from “anywhere near the Cabinet Office”, it had come “from a source which obviously wanted to damage Kids Company”. \nOnce it became public the charity was under investigation, he added, it had been impossible for them to accept a series of donations lined up from private benefactors and they had to shut down. Until late 2014, the charity’s finances had been in good shape, he insisted. \nChallenged about a memorandum sent to the Cabinet Office warning that communities helped by Kids Company could descend into savagery, looting and arson if it closed, Mr Yentob said it was describing a “worst-case scenario”. \nNevertheless, five days after the charity shut down, he said a boy had been murdered, while there were stabbings and four suicide attempts as the “consequence of the absence of a place for these children to go”. \nMs Batmanghelidjh repeatedly accused the MPs of failing to understand the charity’s work, saying their evidence was based on negative reports in the Daily Mail and a group of other media. “You haven’t done the rigorous research in order to be able to determine that the charity and its structures were failing,” she said. \nShe added: “Some civil servants have been absolutely malicious and unprofessional and have behaved in ways that isn’t respectful of a democracy and you need to look into this.” \nChallenged by committee chairman Bernard Jenkin as to what evidence she had for her allegations, she replied: “I will produce it.” \nThe MPs in turn expressed frustration at her failure to answer their questions, accusing her of “psychobabble”. At one point she was warned by Mr Jenkin: “You are aware that it is a contempt of parliament to mislead this committee and that is a very serious thing.” \nMr Yentob rejected claims he had sought to use his position as a senior BBC executive to influence the corporation’s coverage of the problems of the charity. But he acknowledged that when Ms Batmanghelidjh was interviewed on the Radio 4 Today programme, he had stood alongside the producer — a move which he accepted could have been seen as intimidatory. “If it was intimidating, I regret it,” he said.
