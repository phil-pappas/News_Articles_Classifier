Among the updates members will receive is a briefing from Sewerage and Water Board Director Cedric Grant.\nGrant is expected to share more details on short- and long-term measures the S&WB is taking to address recurring problems at the water treatment plant. A power outage on the night of Sept. 23 caused pumps at the plant to shut down long enough that a boil-water advisory was issued -- the 10th in the past five years .\nAt a press conference last week, Grant and Mayor Mitch Landrieu said the immediate solutions that are being put in place will take six to nine months to complete, while permanent fixes for water pressure will be complete in 2018 and the plant's power system upgrade will be done by 2019.\nThe council committee will also receive updates on the city's hazard mitigation plan from Aaron Miller, interim director of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, and David Lessinger, director of planning and strategy for New Orleans Redevelopment Authority.\nCol. Mark Jernigan, director of the Public Works Department, is also scheduled to brief council members on the city's ongoing traffic study and street repairs.\nWhat questions do you have for S&WB Director Cedric Grant about the city's water system?
