A viewer could be forgiven for asking this question as the five presidential candidates filed onto the stage at the Wynn Las Vegas in essentially similar combinations of navy, dark gray and white. The effect was to make them look, startlingly enough, as if they were on the same page. It was a message later belied, in most part, by their words, though it did reflect a debate that lacked the showboat style that has characterized the Republican get-togethers so far. See More » Consider: There were none of the usual pops of look-at-me color we have grown used to, courtesy of Carly Fiorina and the male candidates’ ties. No red, the color of the conservatives, to demonstrate bipartisanship (the way Republicans sometimes like to adopt blue). Not even a magenta. None of Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s head-to-toe brights, such as the tangerine she wore during a Democratic debate in 2007, or even the cerulean blue she has often worn on the campaign trail. Instead, the most vivid shade onstage on Tuesday came courtesy of the moderator Anderson Cooper ’s purple tie. The rest was muted and party loyal, save for the green-eggs-and-ham neckwear of former Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, and the — what was it, beige? — tie of former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia. The latter was notable less for its noncolor than for the size and strength of its knot. (Mr. Webb’s tie, and its tightness around his neck, came in for the most social media commentary I saw regarding any of the candidates’ clothing.) But if the optics were boring (and they were, a bit, especially against a background of CNN blue), that does not mean there lacked method or meaning in the choices. The selection by former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland of a trademark Obama-blue tie with his navy suit and white shirt, for example, planted the suggestion that he was more like the party powers than many might have assumed. As for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, his rumpled shirt and it-doesn’t-quite-fit-me-because-I’m-not-a-Wall-Street-fat-cat-with-a-personal-tailor suit (phew! but it was all that) underscored his positioning. And Mrs. Clinton’s collarless navy pantsuit and white shirt were as unruffled as she was. Still, the event was not entirely without clothing controversy. Earlier in the evening, Huma Abedin, an aide to Mrs. Clinton, entered the venue pre-debate wearing a white floral dress by the British designer L. K. Bennett that has previously been seen on Catherine , the Duchess of Cambridge. As it happened, Ms. Abedin had just returned from a fund-raising trip to Britain for her candidate. The dress was an interesting diplomatic choice. Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:41:30.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
