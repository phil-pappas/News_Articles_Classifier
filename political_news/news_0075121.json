But for one night this month, Boulder will briefly and improbably swing into the center of the conservative orbit as presidential candidates and hundreds of journalists gather Oct. 28 at the University of Colorado’s campus here for the third Republican primary debate. Residents and students are preparing an oh-so-Boulder welcome wagon. Immigrant groups and anti-fracking activists are organizing a march that they hope will draw thousands of people. Labor unions will rally in a “free speech zone.” College students who could not get one of the scarce tickets into the debate arena are writing indignant letters and waging protests for a louder voice at the event. There will be original artwork and maybe an installation on white privilege, organizers said. A “rehumanizing zone” is being planned if people want to share personal stories of trauma or discrimination. There will even be protest clowns with wigs and red noses to offer a “peaceful, out of the box, Boulder-style reception.” Photo Aaron Estevez-Miller, an economics major at the University of Colorado Boulder, at a student government meeting last week.

Colorado may be a narrowly divided swing state, but in Boulder, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans five to one. There is one Republican on the City Council, none elected countywide, and running as a Republican usually amounts to a “suicide mission,” said Ted Hine, the treasurer of the Boulder County Republican Party . Conservatives here are accustomed to losing votes on bike lanes and open-space preservation, fracking bans and carbon taxes. “We’re definitely a minority,” Mr. Hine said. “When we take our booth around to public events, street fairs, people walk by and say, ‘I didn’t know there were any Republicans in Boulder County!’ ” As the debate approached, some residents grumbled about their town’s becoming a stage for the Republican candidates. But many said they were thrilled by the spotlight, even if they were die-hard supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the candidate for the Democratic nomination who calls himself a socialist . Many said they were frustrated that they would not be able to attend. Debate organizers are allowing about 1,000 audience members. The university received 100 tickets, at least half of which will go to students. To Mr. Estevez-Miller and many other students here, that is not nearly enough.

We want our voices to matter.” \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:15:20.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
