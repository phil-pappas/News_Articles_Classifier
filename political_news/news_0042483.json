Your Right to Know Enlarge Image Request to buy this photo AP file photo \nThe state budget office estimates legalized marijuana sales in Ohio could produced nearly $300 million in new tax revenue, most of which would go to townships, cities and counties. The estimate by the Office of Budget and Management was based on potential marijuana sales of about $2 billion a year. New revenue would come primarily from a special excise tax on marijuana sales. The state budget agency did the estimate based on specifics in State Issue 3, a proposed constitutional amendment by ResponsibleOhio, to legalize the sale and use of recreational marijuana for those 21 and over and medical marijuana as prescribed by a physician. The agency is required by state law to estimate costs and revenue from proposed ballot issues. The estimate said a new state agency, the Ohio Marijuana Control Commission with 86 employees, would cost about $17.7 million annually to operate. The money would come from tax revenue from marijuana sales. The total new revenue was estimated at from $133 million to $293 million per year. At the upper end of the estimate, cities and townships would get $161 million per year, counties $88 million and the marijuana control agency $44 million. ResponsibleOhio issued a statement calling the tax revenue a “wildly pessimistic projection” because it didn’t use what the group said were accurate federal government figures for estimated marijuana consumption. The group projected a heftier $554 million in tax revenue. ajohnson@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:30:07.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
