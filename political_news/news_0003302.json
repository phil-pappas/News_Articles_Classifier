National’s support partners needed to step up and back Auckland.” \nMark Thomas said the Commission’s report made too many recommendations that rely on New Zealand’s 78 councils taking action. \n“34 of the 59 recommendations require councils to change how they operate and the history of our planning system shows councils can be too slow to act.” \nThomas said National campaigned on reforming the RMA in last year’s election and had received a great deal of public support for that. It should use the Commission’s ‘call-for-action’ to renegotiate the confidence and supply agreements with the Maori Party and United to support RMA reform. The Act party agreement already included this. \nends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:21:02.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
