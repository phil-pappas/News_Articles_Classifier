They’ve spent the last three days retrofitting it to create an art installation on wheels that they hope will spark conversations on political rhetoric, misogyny and xenophobia. \n“The notion is to kind of drive Mr. Trump possibly out of the race,” said David Gleeson, the artist managing the effort. “I think a lot of people expect him to eventually leave the race, and maybe this can help to initiate that process.” A look inside the remodeled bus Buy Photo \nA campaign bus used for the presidential hopeful Donald Trump in Iowa was bought by t.Rutt a writer, entrepreneur, economist, and artist (according to his website).

(Photo: Rodney White/The Register) \nOn Monday morning, Gleeson and fellow artists Mike Stevens and Sarah Muehlbauer worked on the bus in a parking lot behind an abandoned fast food restaurant on Des Moines’ east side. They painted over Trump decals and put the finishing touches on large signs that will be part of an interactive exhibition. \nGleeson said they’re working at the direction of a conceptual artist known as t. Rutt, who previously produced a financial art project using Tesla electric vehicles to question complex financial industry instruments like derivatives. \nThey plan to bring the bus to a Chris Christie campaign event in Newton on Wednesday and then drive it to Philadelphia, with several stops along the way. Ultimately, the bus will go to Miami for Art Basel Miami , one of the biggest art shows in the country. \nThe t. Rutt group has modified the navy blue MCI motorcoach in several ways – primarily by altering the massive “T-R-U-M-P” logos across its sides and painting over other campaign messages with bright red paint. \nInside the bus, Gleeson showed off two large vinyl signs onto which he had stitched in absorbent cloth the words “t. Rutt” and “T. Rump.” When the bus makes stops during its journey back east, the signs will be hung from the exterior of the bus and passersby will be invited to hurl fruit punch at it, with the idea of staining the absorbent white fabric. \nFollow Iowa Caucus news, photos, videos with Iowa Caucuses App: iPhone or iPad | Android \nAlso visit: DesMoinesRegister.com/IowaCaucuses | Candidate tracker and calendar in Iowa | Sign up for Caucuses Newsletter \nT. Rutt (the name is a pseudonym , and a play on a famous piece of art produced by Marcel Duchamp) was inspired to create a Trump-themed work of art after the first Republican presidential candidate debate. After that debate, Trump criticized Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and seemed to suggest that she asked challenging questions because she was menstruating. \n“The larger message is really that this sexual-gender-based or sexual-putdown culture that emanates from a small minority of men is both harmful to women and demeaning to women and harmful to men and very limiting to men,” Gleeson said. \nHe added, “This idea of squirting red punch on these letters just became a wonderfully absurd way of trying to take hold of that stupid imagery in a more artistic way.” \nThe Trump campaign hashtag previously printed on the bus, #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, has been modified to read #MakeFruitPunchGreatAgain. \n“The idea is to finally have a little moment of expression about this political bewilderment that seems to be playing out in the country,” Gleeson said. \nThe journey back to Philadelphia is to be known as the “Hasta La Vista, Donny” tour – an invocation of the Spanish language meant to bring attention to Trump’s rhetoric about Latinos and hardline positions on immigration. \nAdditionally, Gleeson said he has been instructed to stand on top of the bus every evening during the trip and drive a Trump-branded golf ball into the sunset. The artists are also talking about setting up an easel next to the bus on which the public can write passages of the U.S. Constitution translated into various languages.
