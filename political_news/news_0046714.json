The first of its kind in a resort setting, The Grow House is a repurposed shipping container with the capacity to grow one acre of produce.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151001/273008\nUtilizing a hydroponic vertical growing system, The Grow House consumes 90 percent less water than a traditional farm or garden of equal size. Additionally, every aspect of the growing process is controlled – from temperature to water PH and lighting – allowing for a 100 percent pesticide free product. Unlike traditional gardens, the fully controlled environment makes it possible to grow climate sensitive crops year-round such as lettuces which thrive in cool soils or mushrooms which require consistent humidity.\n\"The addition of the Grow House complements our relationship with local farms and further supports our goal to provide guests with the finest and freshest ingredients,\" said George Fistrovich executive chef for The Ritz-Carlton Resorts of Naples.\nCrops currently growing in The Grow House include Bibb and romaine lettuce, cilantro, arugula, spinach, cabbage and assorted micro-greens. These highly flavorful greens may be enjoyed throughout the resort's restaurants including the Italian-inspired Terrazza.\nAbout The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C.\nThe Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C., of Chevy Chase, Md. , currently operates 90 hotels in the Americas, Europe , Asia , the Middle East , Africa , and the Caribbean .
