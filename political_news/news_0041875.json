The PM's statement suggests so.\n\"We strongly oppose this and will make representation to the EC soon and raise this issue inside and outside Parliament,\" Tyagi, flanked by Congress leader R P N Singh and eminent lawyer K T S Tulsi, told reporters.\n\"This is the effective implementation of Mohan Bhagwat's demand for a review of the reservation policy and the Prime Minister has to respond to the voters,\" he said.\nTyagi also accused the EC of going \"soft\" on BJP and the PM. The grand alliance had petitioned the poll panel earlier this month seeking a ban on live telecast of Modi's election rallies on days when polling is held in the state. It had also sought a ban on his 'Mann Ki Baat' address contending he would try and influence voters through it.\nTulsi, a Rajya Sabha MP, accused Modi of poll code violation with his announcement on abolition of interviews, saying the Election Commission had already made it clear that the government cannot announce launch of any new scheme when the poll process is underway.\n\"Neither BJP leader Sushil Modi or PM Modi is fearful of law. EC had given notice to Sushil Modi but it has served no such notice to the PM,\" he alleged.\nTyagi demanded a role for the opposition in appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and other members of the poll panel through a collegium system so as to ensure fairness in their functioning.\n\"The Election Commission cannot dare to issue a notice to the PM,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:18:49.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
