Most concerning is that just one phone call would have thwarted Smith’s plans to flee New Zealand. \n\"The Government must make urgent changes to ensure this never happens again,\" Jacinda Ardern says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:39:50.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
