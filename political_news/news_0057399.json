The three other children - a 10-year-old boy, an 8-year-old girl and a 3-year-old girl - were taken to a hospital but were not injured, police said.\nThe woman was taken from the home in the Fordham Heights neighborhood to a hospital for an evaluation. No charges have been filed.\nThe Fire Department said a call came in about a child outside a window shortly before 2 p.m. at the building on Tiebout Street.\nThe baby was taken to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead, police said.\nA witness told WABC that the woman had been dangling the child outside of the window.\n\"And then that's when the neighbors started screaming, 'No, no, no, no!'\" Lizette Rodriguez said. \"They were yelling at her, 'Don't do it! Think about it.'\"\nRodriguez said the woman said, \"'I'm going to throw the baby out the window,' and the woman was screaming, 'We're all gonna die!' And that's when I figured, OK, this is time to call 911.\" She said she heard the baby hit the ground while she was dialing.\nCarol Watson, who lives in the building, told The New York Times that she knew the woman to be protective of her children.\n\"Something must have snapped,\" Watson said. \"She was a good mother and very protective of those children. All I can tell you is that something must have snapped. She must have had a breakdown or something.\"\nLast month, a newborn girl with her umbilical cord still attached was found dead outside an apartment building in the University Heights section of the borough. Authorities arrested her mother on murder and manslaughter charges, saying she hid her pregnancy and threw the child to her death from a seventh-story window shortly after giving birth.\nIn August, police arrested a Queens woman in connection with the death of her month-old son. According to court papers, she told authorities an evil spirit had possessed the boy and she was \"stopping the pain\" when she threw him from the fourth-floor window. Investigators were looking into whether postpartum depression was a factor, but no clinical diagnoses had been made.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the woman is 27, not 25, based on updated information from police.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
