Researchers visiting Husseiniya saw ruins of destroyed homes and interviewed eyewitnesses. \n“They pulled us out of our homes and began burning the home… they brought the bulldozers... They demolished home after home until the entire village was destroyed,” said one witness. \nIn villages south of the town of Suluk, some residents said YPG fighters had accused them of supporting IS and threatened to shoot them if they did not leave. \nWhile in some cases residents acknowledged that there had been a handful of IS supporters in their villages the majority were not supporters of the group. \nIn other cases, villagers said YPG fighters had ordered them to leave threatening them with US coalition airstrikes if they failed to comply. \n“They told us we had to leave or they would tell the US coalition that we were terrorists and their planes would hit us and our families,” said one resident, Safwan. \nThe YPG has justified the forced displacement of civilians by saying it was necessary for the civilians’ own protection or militarily necessary. \n“It is critical that the US-led coalition fighting IS in Syria and all other states supporting the Autonomous Administration, or co-ordinating with it militarily, do not turn a blind eye to such abuses. \n\"They must take a public stand condemning forced displacement and unlawful demolitions and ensure their military assistance is not contributing to violations of international humanitarian law,” said Lama Fakih. \nIn one particularly vicious attack, YPG fighters poured petrol on a house, threatening to set it alight while the inhabitants were still inside. \n“They started pouring fuel in my in-laws’ house. My mother-in-law was there refusing to leave and they just poured it around her… They found my father-in-law and began hitting him on his hands… I said, ‘Even if you burn my house I will get a tent and pitch it. This is in my place. I will stay in my place,” said Bassma. \nAlthough the majority of residents affected by these unlawful practices are Arabs and Turkmen, in some cases, for example in the mixed town of Suluk, Kurdish residents have also been barred by the YPG and Asayish, the Autonomous Administration’s police force, from returning to their homes. \nElsewhere, for example in Abdi Koy village, a small number of Kurdish residents have also been forcibly displaced by the YPG. \nIn an interview with Amnesty International, the head of the Asayish admitted civilians had been forcibly displaced but dismissed these as “isolated incidents”. The spokesperson for the YPG repeated claims that civilians were being moved for their own security. \nHowever, many residents said they were forced to leave even though their villages had not been the site of clashes, or were at a distance from the frontline and there was no danger from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) laid by IS. Forcibly displacing civilians without imperative military necessity is a violation of international humanitarian law. \n“The Autonomous Administration must immediately stop the unlawful demolition of civilian homes, compensate all civilians whose homes were unlawfully destroyed, cease unlawful forced displacements, and allow civilians to return and rebuild,” said Lama Fakih. \nNew Zealand’s role \nNew Zealand, as an elected member to the UN Security Council, has a key role to play in upholding the international laws of war. New Zealand must publicly condemn war crimes committed by all parties to the conflict, including allies of the US-led coalition fighting against the Islamic State (IS), and work towards accountability and justice for all such crimes. \nThe suffering of civilians in Syria will continue unabated as long as perpetrators feel safe in the knowledge that their crimes will go unpunished. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:04:58.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
