They could get a better financial package for a site in the West Midlands. This was kite-flying.” Share article \nHe said he was confident a new firm will be announced soon to take on the site and plough millions of pounds into it, adding: “We want there to be the same number of jobs as the Ford factory had which are equivalent in skilled labour. \n“Any additional jobs will be a bonus.” Promoted Stories Aston Martin has ruled out building a new factory on the former Ford site in Southampton   skeptik 6:40am Wed 21 Oct 15 \nWhen will this childish game of 'they did it Miss' like some playground spat. What an appalling standard politics has descended to in recent decades. Most if not all electors want to see a return for their efforts all we get is third rate second rates playing games. We have far too many politicians which has diluted the standard where those seeking a status in life head for politics where ability very obviously plays a small part.
