The Government has done the right thing to sign up. It converts a considerable investment by successive governments over many years. “As a trade dependent nation we needed to be in the room, and in the game from the start,” said Mr. Futter. \nThere may be concessions, but just as happened with other FTA’s we can keep the work going to improve the arrangements as we move forward. We need to look at the facts not at the myths. We need to look at the long-game not be scared off by short-term issues and academic detractors seeking to scare us into jumping ship. \nTTP detractors need to get some perspective and look at the total picture of New Zealand’s long-term interests. The bottom line is that as a trading nation, a Trans-Pacific Partnership puts in place potential for thousands of jobs and billions of foreign exchange earnings for this country. \nIt would have been totally remiss of Government if had stepped away from signing into the deal. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:55:21.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
