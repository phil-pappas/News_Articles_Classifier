It would send the clearest possible signal to Spain that we are absolutely serious about defending our strategic interests in Gibraltar and defending our people there. \n“As history has proven countless times, weakness is provocative. I think we should make the rules of engagement for our naval vessels more robust, for clarity and to act as a deterrent. \n“I fear there will be a tragedy sooner or later as a result of the aggressive illegal Spanish incursions with lives lost if we are not clear about how serious we are.” \nMr Lopresti noted that since 2011 the Spanish ambassador had been summoned at least five times, adding: “This puts Spain in the same category as North Korea and Syria, a completely ridiculous situation.” \nHe said: “Gibraltar has been British for longer than the US has been a nation, it is time for the Spanish Government to stop using Gibraltar to mask their own problems and inadequacies and start behaving like a true Nato and European ally.” \nThe MP for Filton and Bradley Stoke added: “I understand that there were 285 unlawful incursions of Spanish state vessels into British Gibraltarian waters in the first eight months of this year, and over 80 alone in September.” \nShadow Europe minister Pat McFadden said: “Spain is trying to put the squeeze on Gibraltar through these measures”, adding Parliament should send a signal out that there is “no point” in putting a squeeze on Gibraltar because its status will not change unless the people of Gibraltar decide that it should.“ \nEurope minister David Lidington said the UK Government had promised it would protect the right of the people of Gibraltar to determine their own political future. \nOn incursions, Mr Lidington paid tribute to the “vigilance and sheer hard work” of the Royal Navy’s Gibraltar squadron. Britain, he said, made a formal protest against every unlawful incursion by Spanish state vessels. \nHe said: “While any incursion is a violation of sovereignty, incursions do not threaten or weaken the legal basis of British sovereignty...but this kind of behaviour by Spanish state vessels is unacceptable.” \nThe MoD he said “keep under constant review” the number and type of vessels available in Gibraltar, adding: “The nature of the assets that we have in Gibraltar is subject to regular reassessment.” \nOn incursions, he said in 2013 there were an average of 40.5 incursions a month, 32.3 in 2014 and 37.4 by the end of August 2015. \nHe said: “The bonds between the UK and Gibraltar are strong... It is a relationship that has stood the test of time and I believe that it will continue to withstand the challenges that face it today.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:44:32.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
