Jim Webb announced Tuesday he was withdrawing from the 2016 White House race, but said he was considering other options, a hint he may try again as an Independent.\n\"I'm stepping aside from the Democratic primary process,\" he said.\nHe said he would take a few weeks to talk to people as he decides how to proceed next.\n  1:12 PM Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio both took eight percent, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul at five percent. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Fiorina all each pulled in four percent, while Ohio Gov. John Kasich garnered three percent, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum won two percent, and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham had just 1 percent.\nThe new poll will help solidify who will be part of next week's CNBC Republican debate. Huckabee, Paul, Christie and Kasich are all at three percent or above in an average of qualifying public polls, and the cutoff is 2.5 percent to participate in the main GOP debate.\nGraham, who was at zero percent in each of the first seven national polls, may now have enough support for the undercard debate, where he will join Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York GOv. George Pataki. Former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore (zero percent) still fails to qualify for the debate.\nThe CNN/ORC telephone poll of 465 registered Republicans and independent voters leaning Republican was conducted Oct. 14-17 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner U.N. chief calls for peace in Israel Ban Ki-Moon visited Jerusalem to talk to Israeli and Palestinian leaders about reducing violence.\nBy Kelly Cohen â€¢ 10/20/15 1:06 PM Top Story Biden: 'I actually like Dick Cheney'   Hillary Clinton's skills working with others.\n  11:33 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:28:48.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
