And the company maintains mutual assistance agreements with peer utilities in the region to secure crews and equipment, as needed, to further enhance response efforts.\nAs Duke Energy prepares its response to Hurricane Joaquin, the company urges customers to do the same in advance of the storm:\nCheck supplies of flashlights, batteries, bottled water, non-perishable foods, medicines, etc. Also, ensure a portable battery-operated radio, TV or NOAA radio is on hand. Families who have special medical needs or elderly members should closely monitor weather forecasts and make plans for potential alternate arrangements should an extended outage occur. Charge cell phones in advance of the storm to stay connected to important safety and response information. Stay Safe\nOf particular concern is the already saturated ground from multiple days of rain across the Carolinas. The wet ground, coupled with the potential for high winds, may result in downed trees and lines as the storm passes.\nStay away from any downed power lines and assume they are energized. Report downed power lines to Duke Energy. If a power line falls across a car that you're in, stay in the car. If you MUST get out of the car due to a fire or other immediate life-threatening situation, jump clear of the car and be sure that no part of your body is touching the car when your feet touch the ground.
