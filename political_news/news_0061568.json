But, India is actually waiting for Dawood's arrest. Chhota Rajan's arrest is insignificant. We want a terrorist to be arrested, which Dawood is. \n\"Thus, we want people like Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon to be arrested and brought back to India,\" Sena MP Sanjay Raut told PTI. \n\"Dawood's name has cropped up to be behind the Mumbai bomb blasts. We have not heard Chhota Rajan's name to be behind it (the blasts). As per law, action will be taken against Chhota Rajan, but the entire country is waiting for Dawood's arrest,\" he said. \nSupporting the Sena's views, Congress said the BJP-led government (at the Centre), before coming to power had promised the arrest of Ibrahim and that people are waiting for it to happen.

We are waiting for that to happen. In this case, Chhota Rajan is also a criminal whose right place is behind bars,\" Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said. \nThe NCP however, crossed swords with the Sena over the issue and said that a criminal is a criminal and that no criminal should be considered small. \n\"Any gangster who is a fugitive is an achievement for the country. No criminal is big or small,\" NCP leader Jitendra Awhad said. \nChhota Rajan, one of India's most wanted gangster, has been arrested in the tourist town of Bali, Indonesia on a Red Corner Notice issued by Interpol after eluding law enforcement agencies for over two decade. \nFugitives Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon are accused to be the masterminds of the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:19:57.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
