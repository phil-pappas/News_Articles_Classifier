The event was attended by Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson .\nThe funds were awarded to the Old Fort Housing Coalition (Coalition) to help renovate a 127,000-square-foot building, previously used as a furniture manufacturing plant. The first phase of the $2.9 million project involves the remodeling of approximately 30,000 square feet.\n\"As governor, when I see the Federal Home Loan Bank (of Dallas ) and the First National Bank of Fort Smith partnering together to support something that might not create thousands of jobs, but helping people in the trenches that are having a hard time in life, that is really extraordinary and an example for other financial institutions to follow,\" said Governor Hutchinson. \"The support of this homeless, comprehensive shelter means not only a place for someone who's homeless, down on their luck, to have a place to stay, but also to receive the services that are so much needed to get them back on their feet to (help) them contribute, to help them have the job training that's needed. That's exactly what they need. And I'm so delighted with the Federal Home Loan Bank supporting this effort.\"\nFNB Fort Smith President and CEO Samuel T. Sicard joined the governor and representatives from FHLB Dallas at the groundbreaking event yesterday.\n\"This effort will significantly improve chances of the Fort Smith homeless population moving out of homelessness into productive lives,\" Mr. Sicard said. \"We are grateful to FHLB Dallas for helping make this project possible.\"\nIn addition to the beds, the Riverview Hope Campus will include showers, bathrooms, a kitchen, dining area, outdoor gathering spaces, library, a medical facility staffed by a local hospital, and room for other organizations to provide services, all under one roof.\nKen Pyle , former executive director of Fort Smith Housing Authority, retired in late September, but remains on the board of Old Fort Homeless Coalition and Riverview Hope Campus. He said: \"The groundbreaking marks a milestone in meeting the needs of the homeless population in Fort Smith .\"\nMr. Pyle estimated that every night at least 90 to 100 individuals sleep unsheltered. The greater Fort Smith metro area, the second largest in the state, encompasses nearly 280,000 people.\n\"There's still a lot of work to do, but we can get it done if we work in a thoughtful, merciful fashion. The key is to show mercy, not judgment.\" said Mr. Pyle.\nCoalition President Karen Phillips , who also serves on FHLB Dallas' Affordable Housing Advisory Council, said the Riverview Hope Campus project has been a community vision for a long time. \"We have a growing amount of street homelessness in our area, and this is an opportunity to provide not only a safe place for the homeless to rest their heads, but also to give them hope. Throughout the years, we have really noticed certain needs that are not being met. To remedy that, there have been some amazing people who have joined together to be champions for those who don't usually have a voice.\"\nThe annual AHP grants assist in the development of affordable, owner-occupied, rental, and temporary housing for very low- to moderate-income households located across FHLB Dallas' five-state District of Arkansas , Louisiana , Mississippi , New Mexico , and Texas . In 2015, FHLB Dallas awarded $7.4 million in AHP grants to 32 projects that will result 965 new or renovated housing units.\nGreg Hettrick , vice president and director of Community Investment at FHLB Dallas, said the needs are great throughout the District, but FHLB Dallas' members are committed to providing funding for projects, such as Riverview Hope.\n\"Our District continues to see a shortage of housing for homeless people. Through our valued partnership with FNB Fort Smith, 75 additional beds will be available to serve the homeless population in Fort Smith . Making a difference in each affected person's life is the real objective.\"\nAbout First National Bank of Fort Smith\nThe First National Bank of Fort Smith was organized February 29, 1872 , as \"The National Bank of Western Arkansas .\" A charter was issued by the Comptroller of the Currency, authorizing the bank to commence business on March 22, 1872 .
