Brauchler would have been a clear front-runner if he had run. \nBrauchler says it's not the right time for him or his family to run. He did not elaborate. \nThe decision puts the Republican primary contest in flux. A state lawmaker and an unsuccessful 2012 U.S. House candidate are the only announced candidates so far. U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman announced earlier this year that he wouldn't run for Senate. \nBennet is seeking a second term in the battleground state.
