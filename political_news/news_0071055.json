The State Patrol began experimenting with the policy in 2012 in the agency's Southwest Region. It requires troopers to make one traffic stop per hour, one citation every 1.8 hours and one warning about every hour.\nThe State Journal (http://bit.ly/1hSVRL5 ) reports the troopers' lawsuit says a number of factors can influence those requirements; including work shift, weather conditions and traffic volume. The lawsuit says Wisconsin law bars state agencies from requiring quotas for enforcement of traffic laws.\nA state transportation spokeswoman says the agency has not yet reviewed the lawsuit.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1hSVRL5"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:51:09.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
