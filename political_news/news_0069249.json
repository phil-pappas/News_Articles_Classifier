An inquest in Milford Haven was told Wayne Anthony Young was drunk when he entered the water and drowned at Mill Pond in Pembroke on 1 January, 2015. Mr Young was the first person out of three to die in the pond, resulting in calls for barriers and other safety measures. The death of 57-year-old John Lyall was also ruled an accident in August. An inquest is due to be held in November into the death of Robert Mansfield, whose body was found in the water in July after he had been out celebrating his 18th birthday.
