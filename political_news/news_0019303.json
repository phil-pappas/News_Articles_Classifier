It begs the question why hasn’t Nicola Sturgeon said this before now?”\nHe added: “While the Scottish Government has been spending millions of pounds and investing countless hours in trying to break Britain apart, standards have slipped. As a consequence our schools, hospitals and roads are not doing as well as they should be.”\nIan Murray for Scottish Labour insisted it was now time for the SNP Government to be judged on its record on health and education.\n“The truth is that in our schools the gap between the richest and the rest is growing and our hospitals are struggling,” declared the Shadow Scottish Secretary.\n\"Just this week we saw specialist support sent to Scotland’s £850 million flagship hospital for the second time in four months after the hospital had the worst waiting times it had ever had with almost a quarter of patients waiting more than four hours for treatment.\n“Today, we see Scotland lagging behind the rest of the UK for jobs figures. The SNP have been in government for eight years now, they are starting to look like the establishment in Scotland, an establishment that is running out of ideas,” he added.\nMs Sturgeon will describe the scale of the SNP’s three-day conference as “awesome” with 3500 delegates and almost 1000 observers, exhibitors and journalists. It will be, she will boast, the “biggest ever gathering in the history of the SNP”.\nThe fact that the SNP is now, with 55 MPs, Britain’s third party has prompted moves to get the timetable of the party conference season changed.\nAt present, the UK Parliament goes into recess for several weeks in the autumn while the Liberal Democrats, Labour and the Conservatives each hold their consecutive annual conferences.\nBut a senior party source pointed out that there was a growing feeling within the SNP hierarchy that, given the scale of its Westminster representation, the conference season should be moved to reflect the fact that the Nationalists were now the third party and not the Lib Dems.\nShare article “The annual conference is an opportunity to showcase policies with broadcasting time and press coverage. It is only right that the SNP, as Britain’s third party, is now included. Colleagues are working on it,” said the source.\nAny change, agreed by the parties themselves in conjunction with the Commons Speaker, could mean the usual Westminster conference recess being put back, starting from late September to late October, so that the Lib Dems are excluded and the sequence becomes Labour, Tories and SNP. But any such move would be strongly resisted by Tim Farron and the Liberal Democrats.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-15T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:34:32.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
