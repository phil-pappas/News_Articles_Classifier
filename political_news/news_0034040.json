The Perecman Firm created the $1,000 scholarship to recognize an outstanding student dealing with autism enrolled full time in a university.\n\"I've never been what you would call a 'normal' kid,\" writes Peter in his submission essay.\nHe went on to explain what it was like before he was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome around the 1 st grade.\n\"My own thoughts became a prison,\" he writes, \"a constant reminder that I didn't belong in the outside world with the 'normal' people. It was a lonely existence. I continually failed to comprehend what everyone else seemed to learn so easily, like they all read an instruction booklet for life that I never got.\"\nPeter recounted how, after his diagnosis, he not only worked to survive his condition, but thrive. He even joined a local group for children with Asperger's and became a mentor to youths who were just like he once was. Peter is now an advocate for Asperger's awareness, and a strong defender of the truth that everyone, no matter how different, is capable of being extraordinary.\nPeter exemplifies the spirit of the Avonte Oquendo Memorial Scholarship for Autism. The Perecman Firm represents the family of Avonte Oquendo , a 14-year-old autistic boy who went missing from his school on October 4, 2013 and was never seen alive again. Because Avonte was not properly supervised as he should have been, his family lost him far too soon.\nIn 2014, New York City enacted Avonte's Law, legislation that aims to prevent similar tragedies from happening to other families. The Perecman Firm is a strong advocate for Avonte's Law, and hopes that it will preserve Avonte's legacy for years to come.\nTo learn more about The Perecman Firm, P.L.L.C. in New York City , visit http://www.perecman.com/ or contact (212) 577-9325.\n releases/the-perecman-firm-announces-2015-avonte-oquendo-memorial-scholarship-for-autism-winner-300153453.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA18685&Transmission_Id=201510021300PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA18685&DateId=20151002", "http://www.perecman.com/", "http://www.perecman.com/avonte-oquendo/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-perecman-firm-announces-2015-avonte-oquendo-memorial-scholarship-for-autism-winner-300153453.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:39:34.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
