Getty Images The National Bureau of Statistics said property investment rose by just 2.6 per cent over the first nine months of the year, down from 12.5 per cent during the same period last year.\nAs property accounts for around half of China's steel consumption, it shows why few are optimistic on the outlook for iron ore prices.\nBut the collapse of Farun, which was China's biggest glass maker for the last 13 years, can also be seen as a positive.\nIt shows a willingness by the government to allow market forces to eliminate some excess capacity from the system. While one example does not make a trend, it is noteworthy the local government did not engineer a bail-out given the jobs and tax revenue the company was providing.\n This suggests authorities are sufficiently confident employment in other areas of the economy is strong enough to counter such a large hit to jobs.\nAt its brief press conference on Monday, the National Bureau of Statistics said the government's job creation target for 2015 had already been met.\nThat means around 10 million new jobs were created in the first nine months of the year, more than for all of 2014.\nWhile such claims are hard to independently verify it does suggests the job market is holding up despite the slow-down in property and manufacturing.\nThis is supported by growth in disposable incomes, which was up 9.2 per cent over the first three quarters of the year according to the NBS.\nWhile few believe Monday's headline number showing the economy grew at a surprisingly strong 6.9 per cent in the third quarter, the jobs data and income growth indicate the government is so far managing the slow down.\nCapital Economics made this point in a note to clients. While it was quick to say it does not believe the headline GDP number, it said underlying conditions in the economy are \"subdued but stable\".\nStability is the key word here. If the government believes the economy is not falling into a deep hole, it should allow a gradual slow down of over the coming years.\nThis is exactly what needs to happen if China is to wean itself away from an economy which is overly reliant on construction and investment to one driven by the service sector and consumption.\nAnd the world should not be surprised or complain about this slowing, as it's exactly what global institutions have been calling for over the last decade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:03:23.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
