Delicately produced last April at Gung Ho Studio in Eugene, Ore., these songs are charmers and the product of an artist living an enchanted life who also packs a blue-collar work ethic. \nBut even dreams come with a price tag. Vogelzang’s $20,000 Kickstarter for Hiker launched Tuesday. \nVogelzang is a multitasker. She infuses her music with ukulele, guitar, banjo and a Hobbit hutch full of little percussive instruments. Away from the music, Vogelzang is a tireless organizer of nonprofit events, from the annual Second Harvest Christmas benefit concert known as Wintersong to producing Wisconsin’s presence in the yearly Folk Alliance International Conference. As for Hiker , she says, “I’ve never been more proud of a record.” \nShe credits project producer Todd Sickafoose for helping her take it to a new level. Sickafoose is Ani Difranco’s stage and studio collaborator, which makes sense, since Vogelzang’s sound shares the same edgy beauty. Sickafoose has also performed and worked with a constellation of indie stars including Andrew Bird, Nels Cline, Laurie Lewis and Tony Furtado. \n“It’s also the only record that I’ve ever made as a live band, which was scary and exhilarating,” says Vogelzang. “I think that energy comes out on the album.” \nA ton of energy apparently went into the album, too. Vogelzang wrote more than 70 songs in 2014 — more than a song per week — in part by participating in the RealWomenRealSongs project. Last spring, Sickafoose, who also played bass on Vogelzang’s Canary in a Coal Mine record, hand-picked the 12 songs he wanted to work with, and they took it from there. \nKickstarter funds will enable the art to become product by paying for final mastering, artwork, layout and printing. \nAs part of her Kickstarter kick-off, Vogelzang is throwing a musical brunch this Sunday at Gib’s Bar on Williamson Street. She’s playing live sets at 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 and 1:30 p.m. “I’m doing three sets because I wanted it to have an open house feel, so that people can come and go as they please.” There will be pledging stations set up for donations. \nMeantime, the multitasking continues. Vogelzang is deep in the planning for the Dec. 12 Wintersong production at the Barrymore Theatre. Performances are confirmed from a who’s-who of Madison indie musicians, including Love High, Corey Mathew Hart (who brought the sold-out crowd to its knees last year with his heaven-sent version of “Little Drummer Boy”), Faux Faun and Crane Your Swan Neck. Very special additional guest artists will be announced just before Thanksgiving.
