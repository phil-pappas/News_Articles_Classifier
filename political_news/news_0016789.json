Two young girls — a toddler and a 5-year-old — have been raped in separate attacks in New Delhi, police said Saturday, in the latest incidents of sexual violence against girls and women in India. A 2 1/2-year-old girl who was playing outside her home was raped in a west Delhi suburb Friday evening, said Delhi Police deputy superintendent Pushpendra Kumar. Family members found the child lying unconscious and bleeding in a park three hours after she went missing during a power outage in the neighborhood. Police have detained a few men but have not yet made any arrests in the incident, Kumar said. Meanwhile, police said they were questioning three men arrested in the gang-rape of the 5-year-old Friday evening in east Delhi. Both girls were in stable condition at hospitals, police said. (AP Photo via APTN)\nAssociated Press Oct. 18, 2015 | 2:45 a.m. EDT + More NEW DELHI (AP) — Two teenagers have been arrested and were being questioned Sunday for allegedly raping a toddler, in the latest incident of sexual violence against a young child in the Indian capital.\nPolice had formed 15 teams and questioned more than 250 residents of the western Delhi neighborhood where the 2 &frac12;-year-old girl was raped and left bleeding in a park on Friday night, police said.\nThe two 17-year-old boys were arrested late Saturday, said Dependra Pathak, a top police officer.\nThe toddler was playing outside her home on Friday when she went missing during a 10-minute power outage in the neighborhood. Family members found the child lying unconscious and bleeding in a park three hours later.\nIn a separate incident, police on Saturday arrested three men for raping a 5-year-old in an east Delhi suburb.\nThe rape of the two little girls comes a week after a 4-year-old girl was found dumped near a railway track after being raped and slashed with a blade.\nThe assaults have caused uproar, with Delhi residents accusing the city's government of failure to protect women and girls.\nIn December 2012, the fatal gang-rape of a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus led to a national outcry. In response to that attack, the government doubled the maximum prison term for rape to 20 years, created special courts to prosecute cases more quickly, and made voyeurism and acid attacks specific crimes under the law.\nIndia's National Crime Records Bureau says more than 2,000 girls and women were raped in New Delhi in 2014.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
