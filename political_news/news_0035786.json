Sony India is the one of the fastest and highest growth markets for our parent company and currently, we stand at No. 4 position in contribution to global sales. Sony believes in customer satisfaction and we plan to cater to our customers' requirements effectively as we move ahead and continue to invest in the market. Sony India has been constantly achieving about 20% year-on-year sales growth. With many flagship launches this year in the smartphone, TV and camera business, we plan to continue the growth momentum in India.\nSales growth of most consumer electronics companies has slowed down in this financial year compared to the previous year. Is this a one-off dip in growth or are we going to see the decline stay for some time?\nLast year was a significantly positive for the consumer electronics industry as it was laced with major sporting events like Cricket World Cup and Fifa World Cup. These events boost sales of televisions, which move off the shelf faster than usual. This year, however, there are no such sporting events that could motivate sales and it is one of the significant reasons for a relatively flat year. Nevertheless, we cannot ever undermine the demand that arises during the festival season in India and we are positive to achieve at least 30% higher sales than usual during this time.\nHow stiff is the competition in the consumer electronics industry?\nElectronic goods sector is a booming sector in India. With continuous inflow of disposable income and the advancement of technology, the need for the varied consumer durable goods is also increasing. This, in turn, is leading to a strong competition among the different consumer durable brands available in the country. It is without doubt that competition is aggressive today and it is a dynamic environment, however, at Sony, we are strong believers of quality. The USP of our products is that they are premium and that's what makes us stand apart.\nYou have already begun sourcing a lot of your components and parts from India in support of the government's Make-in-India programme. What kind of localisation do you expect to reach in the next few years? Are there any plans to make India a manufacturing hub for Sony products?\nWe are very happy with the government's Make-in-India initiative and in view of the same, we recently commenced local manufacturing for our Bravia televisions in August this year. The TVs manufactured at the Chennai factory will be for the Indian sub-continent market. To us, margins are important but prime focus currently is on catering efficiently to the Indian consumers here. However, we are always open to investment and also looking at other product categories, if the circumstances are favourable and we feel it's the opportune time.\nWhich new products have been lined up for a launch in India in the current fiscal?\nSony will be launching its premium and flagship products in the mobile handset space very soon this year. Additionally, we aim to bring cutting edge and innovative product in other categories such as TV, digital imaging and audio category this fiscal year.\nYour online sales stand at 2-3% today. Where do you plan to take it? What are you doing to increase online sales?\nThe recent surge of e-commerce has definitely helped the consumer brands have a deeper penetration. Sony is working on respective e-player's marketplace with our official authorised online partners, to reach out to customers through online channel. We believe that this will help in dealing with issues related to availability of a wide variety of products and associated service issues.\nWhat are your expansion plans in India? What kind of investment do you plan to bring into the country?\nWe continue to expand our footprint in India and our recent announcement of manufacturing in India underlines our continued commitment to this market as well as our alignment with the Make-in-India programmne. It is also reflective of ease of doing business in India and we believe it will change the way business operates in India and take the country to greater heights in terms of development and economic stability. For us, India is a key market and we shall continue to invest in the market and the categories in the near future.\nWhich are the verticals driving growth in India?\nKey product categories contributing to sales are Bravia TVs and Xperia smartphones, which constitute about 75% of our total business in India.\nIndia has moved 16 notches up to 55th position on World Economic Forum's Global Competitive Index (GCI). Is it easier to do business now compared to before?\nThe Jump in India's position can be attributed to the positivity that the current government is bringing to investors. The government has brought ease of business in India and with strong initiatives such as Make-in-India, it is improving the country's business environment. There are more companies than before that are making significant investments in the country to set up manufacturing facilities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:13:17.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
