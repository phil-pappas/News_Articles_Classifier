(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)\nAssociated Press Oct. 8, 2015 | 2:49 p.m. EDT + More MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Grizzlies forward Matt Barnes says the NBA is investigating what happened with his former teammate, Knicks coach Derek Fisher, in California and called the incident a \"personal matter\" involving someone who was a good friend at one point.\nBarnes spoke Thursday after the Grizzlies' morning shootaround.\n\"Life happens, and being a professional athlete, you have to be able to maneuver and separate your personal life from your professional life,\" Barnes said. \"And I'm here to play basketball, so there won't be any distractions.\"\nThe veteran said in video posted by The Commercial Appeal that he has not spoken with the NBA yet.\n\"All the real details will come out at some time,\" Barnes said.\nA person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the incident occurred last Saturday while Fisher was attending a gathering at the home of Barnes' estranged wife, Gloria Govan. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no details were publicly released about the incident.\nFisher and Barnes were teammates with the Los Angeles Lakers from 2010-12. The Grizzlies wrapped training camp in Santa Barbara earlier last Saturday.\nMemphis acquired Barnes in a draft-day trade in June. Coach Dave Joerger told reporters Thursday that the Grizzlies support Barnes, and the veteran said the support of his new team feels good.\n\"I explained to them what happened, and they completely understand and had my back,\" Barnes said.\nFisher is in his second season with the Knicks after spending most of his playing career in Los Angeles, where his children remain. Fisher missed practice Monday — the team announced at the time it was for personal reasons — and led the Knicks in their exhibition opener Wednesday night against a Brazilian club team.\n___\nAP Basketball Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report from New York.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
