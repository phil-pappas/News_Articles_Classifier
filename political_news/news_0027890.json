He said the country squandered a golden opportunity during the boom to diversify an economy long dependent on mining for most of its export earnings.\nTwenty-three percent of Peruvians are poor by IMF definition. Many of the 40 percent in the next bracket — the \"emerging middle class\" earning $4 to $10 a day — are now at risk of joining them.\nEnrique Felix, a 50-year-old security guard where the meetings are being held, is one of them. He earns about $340 a month and his soiled shirt and rusted eyeglass frames attest to it.\n\"We're a middle class that rents, where no one owns their home and children get lousy educations,\" he said as delegates arrived in black limos. \"If my kids get sick I don't know what I'll do.\"\nFelix's wife was 37 when kidney disease took her two years ago.\nHe has worked for 20 different companies — as waiter, construction worker, messenger and shop clerk. He has a two-hour commute to work on rickety buses and only sees his 12- and 15-year-old children for an hour a day, time he spends cooking for the next day: \"Soups generally, and a bit of potatoes.\"\nAcross all of Latin America, the anti-poverty charity Oxfam says 200 million people, or one-third of the population, live in similar conditions.\nWe're talking about people with very precarious incomes,\" said Oxfam economist Armando Mendoza. They have no savings or access to decent health care. \"A family member's job loss or a serious illness throws them into poverty.\"\nMore than 60 percent of Peruvians workers are in the informal economy, according to U.N. figures, spending on health care and education are below regional averages and most government revenues come not from income tax but rather taxes on sales and consumption.\nThat puts the burden disproportionately on the poor in the region with the world's most unequal wealth distribution. Latin America's richest 10 percent hold 71 percent of its wealth, Oxfam says in a new report. In Peru, 515 multimillionaires have riches equal to 32 percent of gross domestic product, it says.\nFinance Minister Alonso Segura said in an interview that Peru is in good shape to weather the biggest flight of capital from emerging markets in a quarter century. It has reserves of more than $60 billion, or about 30 percent of gross domestic product.\nWith 2.4 percent growth forecast this year, the Peruvian economy will still easily outperform Latin America, whose overall output the IMF expects to shrink by 0.3 percent.\nThe country also gets something of a boost from cocaine, of which it is the world's top producer, although Segura declined to estimate how much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:07:04.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
