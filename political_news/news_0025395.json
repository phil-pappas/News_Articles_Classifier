(Evan Vucci/Associated Press) October 12 at 5:01 PM Regarding the Oct. 9 editorial “ A House in peril ”:\nSidelining the roughly 40 Republican members of the far-right-wing Freedom Caucus requires ending their extortionist approach to the legislative process. Call the bluff. Tell the Freedom Caucus to leave the Republican Party; it can caucus as members of the new “Freedom Party.” If its members would like to vote against the Republican caucus choice and put the Democrats in control of Congress, do it.\nLegendary former House speaker Sam Rayburn observed, “A jackass can kick a barn down, but it takes a carpenter to build one.” In its quest for a new speaker, the House needs a leader who has the skill of a carpenter — to take out the rotting boards of a house divided and rebuild. The new speaker will succeed only by earning respect from both sides of the aisle, thus demonstrating to the American people that hope and change are possible. A speaker who puts country ahead of party will find both stronger in the long run.\nElliott Millenson , Potomac\n●\nMuch handwringing has gone on about the tendency of the Freedom Caucus to make it impossible to govern [“ With echoes of the presidential race, an angry insurgency takes no prisoners ,” front page, Oct. 9]. Those commentators are entirely accurate but entirely missing the point. The Freedom Caucus doesn’t want the people to be subject to the will of the federal government, also known as being governed; it wants to allow the people to govern themselves, also known as freedom. It also would like to see the system run according to the clearly articulated principles upon which the nation was founded.\nThose who have become accustomed to the unprincipled practice of acquiescing to less transparent notions or manipulating positions of power to advance their own agendas are understandably upset — and will continue to be frustrated until they see the wisdom of sticking to established principles and governing the lives of others less.\nDavid Crawley , San Jose", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:32:55.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
