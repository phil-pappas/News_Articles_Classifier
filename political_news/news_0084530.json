Employment growth cooled in September, and revisions to previous months' data knocked away tens of thousands of previously reported jobs.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 2, 2015 | 9:37 a.m. EDT + More August and September were the worst two months for domestic job growth in more than a year, according to an underwhelming employment report released Friday by the Labor Department .\nThe U.S. economy generated only 142,000 jobs in September, well shy of the 200,000 to 225,000 new positions analysts expected to be created last month. And August's additions, which originally clocked in at a disappointing 173,000, were revised down even further to 136,000.\nRevisions also knocked off 22,000 previously reported jobs to July's employment figure. With September's report, the government estimates it previously overshot labor conditions by nearly 60,000 jobs.\n\"Over the past three months, job gains have averaged 167,000 per month,\" the report said. \"Thus far in 2015, job growth has averaged 198,000 per month, compared with an average monthly gain of 260,000 in 2014.\"\nRELATED\nFederal Reserve Stands Pat on Interest Rates as an Anxious World Waits For comparison's sake, the economy averaged more than 237,000 monthly additions over July, August and September 2014.\n\"Any month of positive job creation is far from terrible,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, wrote in a research note Wednesday in response to a weaker-than-expected ADP preliminary jobs report .\nThat report estimated the U.S. economy tacked on 200,000 jobs in September. Analysts were disappointed by such growth, though they'd surely take that number over the data released Friday.\n\"Health care added 34,000 jobs in September, in line with the average increase of 38,000 jobs per month over the prior 12 months,\" the report said. \"Employment in professional and business services continued to trend up in September [with 31,000 additions].\"\nBut the manufacturing, mining and logging, wholesale trade and utilities sectors were all among those that experienced monthly losses in payrolls. Job creation has slid precipitously in the past two months, as construction and motor vehicle and parts manufacturing were two of the only sectors that in September outpaced their job gains seen in July.\nRELATED\nAugust Income, Consumption Rise Despite Pessimistic Outlooks \"This was a below-par jobs report,\" Joseph Lake, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told U.S. News in an email Friday. \"However, the U.S. could not continue to create jobs at the rapid pace it was previously. As the recovery progressed, unemployment fell, and the job market tightened, the rate of job creation would have to slow. We do not expect a return to the record-breaking job growth of 2014.\"\nThe unemployment rate stayed the same at 5.1 percent, though that's at least in part because September ended with 579,000 more people outside of the labor force than in August. The number of unemployed people in the market counted by the Labor Department actually declined by 114,000 between August and September, but that only counts individuals who have actively looked for work in the last four weeks.\nThe labor force participation rate, already hovering near historic lows, plunged even further to 62.4 percent after spending the last two months at 62.6 percent. That's the lowest the participation rate has been since October 1977.\nstunning: factor in whatever and just stunning here is labor partic back to 1977 pic.twitter.com/rbaoOqp2po\nâ€” tom keene (@tomkeene) October 2, 2015 Given this month's underwhelming report and the surprising downward revision to August, it's hard not to think that the Federal Reserve knew what it was doing in its decision last month to delay America's first interest rate liftoff since 2006. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has repeatedly said the labor market still has room for improvement, while inflation is nowhere near where the Fed wants it to be. Friday's disappointing jobs data certainly supports a decision that many argued was overly cautious.\n\"If you just look at their mandate, there's really no reason to be particularly concerned about moving anytime soon,\" says Tara Sinclair, chief economist at jobs site Indeed.com. \"They have a mandate that says that they're supposed to be targeting full employment and low and stable inflation, but the data aren't behaving at all in the normal, expected way. Tightening doesn't seem right at this stage.\"\nThe Federal Open Market Committee will again meet at the end of October, but this is the only major monthly jobs report they'll see between now and then. So many expect October is almost certainly off the table, which essentially kicks the can to December.\n\"The poor job numbers have removed the possibility of an October rate hike for the Fed,\" Lake said, though he notes that the economy's \"decent momentum\" should ensure that December is still an option. \"With the unemployment rate at 5.1 percent, its lowest level in seven years, this soft report would not be enough to persuade the Fed that it needs to keep interest rates at rock bottom in order to help the labor market. It has largely achieved its target on the employment side of its mandate.\"\nTAGS: economy unemployment Bureau of Labor Statistics", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtlhi%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtlhi%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtlhi%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Participation%20Rate%20Lowest%20in%20Decades%20in%20Disastrous%20Jobs%20Report", "https://twitter.com/tomkeene/status/649924987265118208", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtlhi%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtlhi%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Participation%20Rate%20Lowest%20in%20Decades%20in%20Disastrous%20Jobs%20Report&summary=The%20unemployment%20rate%20remained%20unchanged%2C%20but%20labor%20force%20participation%20hit%20its%20lowest%20level%20since%201977.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm", "http://t.co/rbaoOqp2po", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtlhi%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Participation%20Rate%20Lowest%20in%20Decades%20in%20Disastrous%20Jobs%20Report"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:15:24.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
