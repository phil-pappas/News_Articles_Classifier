If investigations are ongoing, Ms Waiguru should have stepped aside when police started investigating her docket to prove that the law is applicable to all” Mr Ruto said. \nURP leaders led by Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter have called for the removal of Ms Waiguru over allegations of abuse of office and misuse of funds. \nMr Keter has already drafted a motion seeking to impeach her. \nOn Saturday, Mr Ruto said President Uhuru Kenyatta has put himself at risk of impeachment through some of his actions. \n“There are many instances where the President has disregarded courts orders. Everyone must obey the law and respect the courts,” he said. \nHe urged President Kenyatta to 'lead from the front’ by respecting court orders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:43:22.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
