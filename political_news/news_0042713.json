Paul Ryan (R-WI) decides not to enter the race. \nRep. McCaul is seriously considering a bid for Speaker of the House if Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan decides not to run. Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) announced in September that he would resign the post at the end of October amid party infighting. After Rep. Kevin McCarthy's (R-CA) successor bid imploded following rumors of scandal, Ryan's name rose to the top of the conversation. \nThe chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee vows to back Ryan, the party's 2012 vice-presidential nominee, if he agrees to run. Stressing the importance of bringing the party's estranged elements back together, McCaul said he's been approached by multiple members to run if Ryan declines. Unlike Boehner, McCaul said if elected he would employ a more \"bottom-up\" approach to the job. \n\"I think I would empower the members more,\" said McCaul. \"I think I would listen to them more. I'm in a sort of unique situation from a skill set standpoint. I believe I've commanded some respect up there but I'm also not labeled in any particular group and I think I'm the type of leader up there that could bring all these factions together, which I think is so desperately needed right now in our Congress.\" \nMcCaul calls Ryan \"uniquely qualified\" for the job, and believes his intentions will likely become more clear next week. If the race opens up without Ryan, McCaul believes he could find the support to win the post himself. \n\"I think I would have the votes,\" said McCaul. \"I would think I would have the appeal throughout the conference. I believe that I don't have a lot of enemies out there. I've made a lot of friends and I'm also somebody who can I think bring together our party and lead it in the right direction.\" \nIn addition to ongoing problems facing the nation, including Russia, ISIS, Al Qaeda -- items the chairman is well-acquainted with through his committee -- McCaul said the next Speaker will have to pass a budget as well. After years of mounting dysfunction, such a feat would be considered a major accomplishment by any Speaker. \n\"I think I have the right skill set to do it,\" he said. \nWatch the full interview with Rep.
