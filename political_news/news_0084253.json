We have millions and millions of people, we have millions and millions of sick people all over the world. It can happen all over the world and it does happen all over the world, by the way. But this is sort of unique to this country, the school shootings. And you're going to have difficulty no matter what,\" Trump said in a telephone interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\nIt will \"probably\" come out, Trump predicted that the shooter was like others who have committed similar acts in that \"they were loners and they were probably sick.\"\n\"You know, oftentimes this happens and the neighborhood says, you know, we sort of saw that about him, and it really looked like he could be a problem. But it's awfully hard to put somebody in an institution for the rest of their life based on the fact that he looks like he could be a problem. So it is a terrible situation. It's huge mental illness. You're going to have things happen, and it's a horrible thing to behold,\" he added. \"Horrible.\"\nAdding that it's not \"politically correct to say\" that people will slip through the cracks of the mental-health system, Trump said there will always be difficulty, \"and that would be for the next million years ... people are going to slip through the cracks.\"\n\"Even if you did great mental health programs, people are going to slip through the cracks. I'm sure it's going to be found that this guy was probably, you know they seem to be loners, they have all sorts of difficulties, they call people and nobody wants to go out with them, you know, it's the same old story. But what are you going to do? Institutionalize everybody?\" Trump asked. \"You're going to have difficulties with many different things ... that's the way the world works, and that's the way the world has always worked.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:22:50.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
