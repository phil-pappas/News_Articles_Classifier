(AP) — A new poll shows that 50 percent of New Hampshire residents surveyed think U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta should resign amid his campaign finance troubles and 4 percent said they would back his re-election bid next year. The Republican said the $355,000 he reported loaning himself for his 2010 campaign was his because for years he contributed to and managed a \"family pot\" of money. The Federal Election Commission concluded Guinta broke the law by accepting donations above the legal limit from his parents and fined him. In a WMUR Granite State Poll released Thursday, 56 percent said they'd vote for someone else if Guinta's on the ballot. Twenty-four percent were unsure. The telephone poll of 286 First District residents was conducted by the UNH Survey Center from Sept. 24-Oct. 2, with a sampling margin of error of plus or minus 5.8 percentage points. seacoastonline.com Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 9:56 AM » Comment or view comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:21:14.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
