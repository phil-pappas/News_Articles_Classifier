His task was to help move massive amounts of earth; what Mr. Morales did instead was strike gold. Immediately he starting combing the area and, by the end of the day, had rescued some 22 pounds worth of gold objects made sometime between the 10th and the 13th centuries. More pieces emerged in the ensuing months, providing tantalizing glimpses into a sophisticated and enigmatic culture that thrived long before the Spanish arrived in the 1500s.\nPhilippine Gold: Treasures of Forgotten Kingdoms\nAsia Society\nThrough Jan. 3. 2016\nENLARGE Kinnari (c. 10th-13th century).

At the Asia Society Museum, “Philippine Gold: Treasures of Forgotten Kingdoms” presents what scholars know of pre-colonial royalty on Mindanao and neighboring islands.\nThe galleries feel as dark as night except for constellations of necklaces, belts, pendants, sculptural dagger handles and all manner of ornaments, some in pyramidal shapes meant to hang at the end of cloth belts. We pause before a diadem here, clusters of earrings there, and thin sheets of gold hammered into death masks. There is enough diversity among the 120 or so pieces to enthrall the eye and engage the mind. Some pendants have reliefs in repoussé depicting sea creatures or floral motifs, while woven belts sport geometric patterns made with granulated gold. Dangles in the shape of birds embellish some ear ornaments like charms on a bracelet, while a number of rings and earrings have such bold, abstract forms they would be at home in a modernist collection.\nOf the show’s many bright stars, some have the gravitational pull of suns. Notable for its impressive presence is a handsome 5-foot-long, square-shaped cord that weighs almost 9 pounds. At its core is a thick, loop-in-loop chain, a technique used in the Mediterranean as early as the seventh century B.C. Here, artisans have encased it using slimmer chains and elongated beads that create a strong, rhythmic pattern. This piece may be a sash, but scholars believe it might be a ceremonial rendering of the sacred thread worn by men of the high-ranking Hindu Brahmin caste.\nCurators Florina H. Capistrano-Baker of the Ayala Museum and Adriana Proser of the Asia Society highlight this interpretation by draping the massive chain across a display bust. In so doing, they reinforce the message that these ancient islanders were engaged in exchanges with India and other cultures. A small section on trade includes a dagger from Persia with a locally made gold scabbard along with a scale—also crafted from the precious metal—presumably used by merchants to measure out payments in gold dust.\nAnother piece you want to orbit around is a vessel in the shape of a female figure—not quite 5 inches high—with a delicately modeled face and the body, now somewhat crumpled, of a bird, feathers etched onto folded wings. Part of the 1981 trove, she represents a kinnari, a figure from Indian mythology popular across Southeast Asia. The headdress suggests some Khmer influence and the workmanship is highly refined. By contrast, a plaque discovered at the same site has the feel of folk art. It, too, features a woman, this one with hands raised, fingers splayed in what might be a gesture of worship, the whole rendered with charming exuberance. Might there have been a distinction between the makers of regalia and those charged with expressing religious devotion?\nNot enough material has survived the ravages of colonialism and the melting pots of greedy looters for scholars to have all the answers. Even though gold deposits pepper the archipelago and archaeologists have found crucibles and goldsmith tools in a Mindanao port, there is still no proof that everything was locally made. Even the dating is relative, based on imported Chinese pottery found with some of the gold objects. And there is yet another mystery: The 1981 discoveries in Mindanao have such a range of sizes they could not have belonged to a single person, which rules out a burial chamber. Was this the site, then, of a palace repository? Were the objects buried here for safekeeping in a time of war?\nSadly, there is no contextual information for much of the ancient gold. On the plus side, however, many gold works ended up in the hands of Leandro and Cecilia Locsin. He was a prominent architect, she an archaeologist. In 2008, Cecilia, by then widowed, made their collection of 1,000-plus objects available to the public through the Ayala Museum in metropolitan Manila. It lent many of the objects on display, and a smaller number came from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Gold Collection. Most are traveling outside the country for the first time, united here with about a dozen of the earliest gold discoveries made by a French explorer in 1881 and now housed in the Musée du quai Branly in Paris.\nWhile some works look to an Indian model or another Southeast Asian style, many appear to be “of local inspiration,” as scholar John Miksic writes in “Philippine Ancestral Gold,” a 2012 book about the Locsin collection. But in the near total absence of a written record and scant archaeological evidence, we are left with no more than educated speculation. As frustrating as this might be, it is nevertheless hard not to feel grateful that, if only one thing could survive, it was the gold.\nMs. Lawrence writes about Asian and Islamic art for the Journal.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-CD782_philip_JV_20151014164408.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:12:07.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
