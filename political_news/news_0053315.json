The congressman famous for sending racy photos in direct messages over Twitter took a snarky tone in critiquing some of the questions by Republicans on the committee:\nIs it a given that 5 times more security in Benghazi would not have resulted in 5 times more loss of life of Americans?\n— Anthony Weiner (@anthonyweiner) October 22, 2015 For reference, they usually reserve the big issues at a hearing for the chairman. Gowdy is doing Blumenthal emails. Wow.\n— Anthony Weiner (@anthonyweiner) October 22, 2015\nThe frequency of Weiner's tweets varied throughout the day. He took a break for a few hours before tweeting again.\nParts of this hearing are actually interesting. Being Secretary of State is F'ing difficult.\n— Anthony Weiner (@anthonyweiner) October 22, 2015 And at one point Weiner weighed in while Rep. Peter Roskam was questioning Clinton:\nOh this is rich. A Congressman critiquing someone else's press clips.\n— Anthony Weiner (@anthonyweiner) October 22, 2015 Roskam's questions are clearly about getting answers for the families of the slain Americans. Thanks.\n— Anthony Weiner (@anthonyweiner) October 22, 2015\nWeiner is the husband of Huma Abedin, a longtime top Clinton aide.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/anthonyweiner/status/657282756137865216", "https://twitter.com/anthonyweiner/status/657242547518119936", "https://twitter.com/anthonyweiner/status/657280522989797376", "https://twitter.com/anthonyweiner/status/657233504254730240", "https://twitter.com/anthonyweiner/status/657279244066754560"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:44:41.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
