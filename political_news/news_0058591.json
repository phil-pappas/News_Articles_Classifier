The film is the story of \"a six-man US security team who fought to defend the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi following an attack by radical Islamist terrorists on September 11 2012.\" The trailer shows the team battling to save “36 American lives in the face of gun-toting insurgents on the streets of Benghazi (though the film was in fact shot in Malta), against a backdrop of exploding vehicles and flaming buildings.\" But, Libya’s culture and information minister Omar Gawaari told the Associated Press, the movie shows the US contractors “who actually failed to secure the ambassador ... as heroes”, adding that Bay “turned America’s failure to protect its own citizens in a fragile state into a typical action movie all about American heroism.\"\nHurricanes Wreak Economic Havoc as World Warms [Climate News Network]\nAnalysis of insurance data appears to indicate that global warming \"could already be costing the US billions of dollars each year in hurricane damage alone.\" Economists believe that somewhere between $2bn and $14bn of the financial costs of hurricane damage in 2005 could be attributed to the impact of global warming. The economists also \"see the fingerprint not of climate variability − the meteorological throw of the dice that sends a hurricane to a city centre rather than a deserted coast − but of underlying climate change.\" And that was 2005. What might the total be in 2015?\nCorey Jones didn't fire his gun, attorney says [Various]\nAdd another name to the growing list of seemingly innocent people killed by police. Florida drummer Corey Jones was awaiting a tow truck after a show when he encountered Norman Raja, a plainclothes police officer. Details are of course sketchy but early reports indicate that he may have had a (legal) gun and he may not have known Raja was a cop.\nBandmate Mathew Huntsberger told The Washington Post that he left Jones at around 2:30 a.m. Roughly 45 minutes later, Jones was dead. “When I left him he was sitting in his car calling roadside assistance. I never would have thought that someone was going to come kill him,” Huntsberger said.\nBrooklyn Museum Has a Pristine Postmodernist Apartment Tucked Away in Storage [Observer]\n\"Oh, the treasures that can be found in museum storage! Word trickled out recently that the Brooklyn Museum has been hiding something very special: a rare example of Postmodernist residential architecture has been tucked away in a warehouse for nearly three decades. A completely intact apartment by American Postmodern architect Michael Graves has been in storage at the Brooklyn Museum since it was acquired in 1986. Similar to other Postmodern designs by Graves, the apartment features ornamental design, an eclectic blend of classical references and muted color palettes.\"\nObviously Drivers Are Already Abusing Tesla’s Autopilot [Wired]\nAnd so it begins in earnest. Although Tesla's Autopilot is intended for highway usage only, there is apparently no means to stop anyone who wants to do pretty-much whatever they want to do with it. So a Tesla Model S P85D was used to drive across the country in record time for an EV, and Tesla owners are posting videos of themselves driving with theirs hands off the wheel, sometimes with hairy results like being pulled over for speeding and nearly steering into an oncoming car. Another video is featured on this page.\nJames Porteous is editor and curator of @TheNewsNomad , a daily list of stories that might be overlooked by the mainstream media and a Contributing Writer for RYOT .", "external_links": ["https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/175/545_609x263_292384665_609x263.jpg", "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/22/michael-bay-13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi-libyan-politicians-bloggers-criticism-social-media?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/175/547_582x337_439995324_582x337.jpg", "http://www.ryot.org/author/james-porteous", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/175/530_599x237_117917027_599x237.jpg", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/175/540_600x346_121345248_600x346.jpg", "http://www.wired.com/2015/10/obviously-drivers-are-already-abusing-teslas-autopilot/", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/175/563_1936x1936_405864697_900x900.jpg", "http://www.wpbf.com/news/officer-shot-at-corey-jones-five-times-two-separate-instances/35942092", "http://observer.com/2015/10/brooklyn-museum-has-a-pristine-postmodernist-apartment-tucked-away-in-storage/", "http://fair.org/home/fox-daily-beast-stories-on-cubans-in-syria-lack-one-thing-evidence-of-cubans-in-syria/", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/175/536_799x276_227739933_799x276.jpg", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/175/518_726x364_448796830_726x364.jpg", "http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/10/22/poli-o22.html", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/175/523_612x343_417042938_612x343.png", "http://bit.ly/1Olkhth", "http://climatenewsnetwork.net/hurricanes-wreak-economic-havoc-as-world-warms/"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:20:27.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
