(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News) October 19 at 5:21 PM Regarding Kenneth R. Harney’s column in the Oct. 17 Real Estate section, “ New rules for lenders seem to be raising costs for mortgage customers ”:\nIf recent changes enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) had been rolled out 10 years ago, they would have prevented the housing market collapse in 2008.\nThe average real estate transaction in this area is $479,000. A $500 increase in closing costs translates to 0.001 percent. This is a very small price to pay considering the guarantees given to buyers. The longer rate-lock periods mentioned in the column are a personal choice, not a requirement.\nBased on my recent purchase, a good negotiator can get the rate-lock charge reduced or waived.\nThe CFPB is bringing uniformity to real estate settlements. We’ve heard horror stories about mortgage lenders and brokers charging all kinds of junk fees with no accountability or penalties for violations. I am thankful for the protection offered by the new CFPB rules. The CFPB is a much-needed counterweight to the powerful home-builder and mortgage lobby.\nVidhi Mehta , Ashburn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:52:18.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
