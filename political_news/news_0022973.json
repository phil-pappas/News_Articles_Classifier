(Multnomah County Sheriff's Office/Portland police via AP)\nAssociated Press Oct. 12, 2015 | 8:16 p.m. EDT + More By PAUL ELIAS, Associated Press\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” A California prosecutor said Monday he has filed murder charges that could lead to the death penalty for three young transients accused of gunning down a Canadian backpacker and a yoga instructor walking his dog.\nThe three were arrested last week in Oregon. They are expected to be booked in Marin County jail Monday.\nMarin County District Attorney Ed Berberian said each suspect is charged with two counts of murder with special circumstances, including lying in wait. The suspects are 24-year-old Sean Michael Angold, 23-year-old Morrison Haze Lampley and 18-year-old Lila Scott Alligood.\nThey are expected to appear in court sometime this week. It's unclear if they have retained lawyers.\nThe body of Audrey Carey, 23, was discovered in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park the morning of Oct. 3. She was shot once in the head, police said.\nInvestigators believe Carey was camping in the park, which was hosting a free, three-day bluegrass festival.\nTantric yoga instructor Steve Carter, 67, was found dead two days later along a popular hiking trail in Marin County, 20 miles north of San Francisco. He was still clutching the leash of his dog, the Marin County Sheriff's Office said. The dog also was shot but is expected to survive.\nSan Francisco Police Commander Toney Chaplin said the same gun was used in both killings.\nAuthorities found the weapon when they arrested the suspects Wednesday outside a Portland, Oregon, soup kitchen, he said. The three also were found in possession of Carter's car and some of Carey's camping gear.\nChaplin said the gun was reported stolen from an unlocked car parked in San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf neighborhood.\nThe Marin County district attorney added a special circumstance of multiple killings to each of the transient's murder charges, enabling him to prosecute both shooting deaths in one trial.\n\"We will be monitoring the prosecution and will be cooperating with the Marin County DA's office to bring justice to these victims' families,\" San Francisco district attorney spokesman Alex Bastian said.\nCarey had just left her home in the Canadian province of Quebec to go backpacking in the U.S. and Europe when she was killed.\nCarter lived near the hiking trail where he was shot and drove there to walk his dog. He was living with friends while caring for his wife, who has cancer.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the name of a suspect is Sean Michael Angold, not Michael Angold.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
