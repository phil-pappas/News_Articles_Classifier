The Pennsylvania Judicial Conduct Board's chief counsel said in a statement Friday that the attorney general's office didn't give it \"all of the information\" from its computer servers about Justice Michael Eakin when it investigated him last year. Chief counsel Bob Graci says recent disclosures, including news accounts, have prompted the new investigation into Eakin. Eakin is declining comment. Attorney General Kathleen Kane delivered more than 1,000 emails to the board last week and described some as racially offensive and misogynistic pornography. Kane's office says it's looking into what it provided to the board last year.
