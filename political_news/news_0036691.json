Speaking to LGBT advocates the same night, Biden sounded more and more like a candidate. \n\"The American people are already with you,\" Biden said to raucous applause at the Human Rights Campaign's annual dinner. \"Look at the numbers. There's homophobes still left. Most of them are running for president, I think.\" Clock ticking on Biden 2016 decision \nA new ad launched by a super PAC attempting to draft Biden into Democratic primary features the vice president candidly discussing the family tragedy that changed his life. It was pulled at Biden's request before it was scheduled to air. The decision whether to run could come over the weekend as Democrats prepare for their first debate on Tuesday. \n\"I think the biggest thing he's juggling is if his heart is in it,\" said Progress Texas executive director Ed Espinoza. \"He knows that he's capable of the job, he's got the experience, but does he really have the fire in the belly to go the distance of a presidential campaign and then serve four to eight years in that position.\" \nThe latest Democratic primary survey by Public Policy Polling shows Biden around 20 percent support, still four points behind runner-up Sen. Bernie Sanders. Still the front runner by a wide margin, Clinton's numbers have dipped to 42 percent of Democratic voters. \nIf Biden is to run, another crucial date is swiftly approaching. The Nov. 10 filing deadline for the Texas primary is just around the corner. \n\"He has to make a decision soon,\" said Espinoza. \"Because you've got 208 Democratic delegates on the line that day, and that's going to be the biggest haul on Super Tuesday.\" \nThe clock is ticking. Hosted by CNN, the first Democratic debate begins 8 p.m. CT Tuesday in Las Vegas.
