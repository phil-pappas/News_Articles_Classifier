Rise for Youth, which includes Newport News Sheriff Gabe Morgan, also hopes to change a handful of state codes that members believe put young people behind bars unnecessarily. \nNationally there is momentum on the left and the right for criminal justice reform regardless of age, but a number of influential Virginia Republicans say many of the problems driving that movement aren't issues in Virginia. \n\"The general notion of over criminalization and mass incarceration is not playing out in Virginia,\" said Del. Todd Gilbert, a GOP leader on criminal justice issues. \"It's really hard to go to prison in Virginia.\" \nGov. Terry McAuliffe's administration says change is a high priority, particularly in the juvenile system, but won't announce new policies that may be in his coming budget for weeks, or even months. The Shad Plank: Local Politics Blog Open link \nRise for Youth members said they hope to see \"real change\" in that budget. \nOne of the biggest changes the coalition wants is an increase in Virginia's lowest-in-the-nation threshold for felony larceny. A theft of $200 or more qualifies as a felony in Virginia, and Rise for Youth would like to see it raised to $500. \nGroup members said this is one of the largest drivers of youth prison figures. \nHouse Republicans rejected this very change early this year . The bill had bipartisan support in the state Senate but Del. Rob Bell, who chairs a key House subcommittee and is a likely 2017 candidate for attorney general, dubbed the legislation \"a cost-of-living allowance for people to steal.\" Read the story \nRepublicans have also cast a wary eye toward a McAuliffe commission reconsidering the state's no-parole policy. That effort focuses more on adults than juveniles, but the philosophy turns on the same question: Is locking people up as often as we do the best use of taxpayer dollars? \nAccording to a trio of groups from both sides of the aisle, the answer for Virginia's juvenile justice system is no. The right-leaning Thomas Jefferson Institute, the national conservative group Right on Crime and the more left-leaning Justice Fellowship all signed on to a report titled \"Juvenile Justice Reform in Virginia.\" \n\"The current system of youth incarceration is not successfully using taxpayer money,\" the report, released last month, states. \"For example, while several states are experiencing lower recidivism rates, Virginia's re-arrest rates three years after release from juvenile correctional centers is at approximately 80 percent. \n$150,000 a year \nRise for Youth's top priority is closing the state's last two youth prisons, located in Bon Air and Beaumont. \nTogether they housed 386 people as of late last week, down from roughly 600 last year. The state spends about $150,000 a year housing young people there, the Juvenile Justice Reform report says, about double the average across the United States. \nVirginia has closed five prison facilities and two halfway houses since fiscal 2005, coming \"a long way\" on this issue, according to Kate Duvall, a lawyer who works with young people. The two remaining facilities, though, \"very much stick to the prison model\" and \"are not built to be therapeutic environments,\" she said. \nSheriff Morgan told an example story last week during a Rise for Youth conference call with reporters. There was a kid who started stealing cars at 14, Morgan said. While he was locked up, a more experienced criminal told him his mistake was leaving witnesses. \nWhen he got out, Morgan said, he started robbing people. \n\"The difference now is he basically shot each of his victims,\" Morgan said. \"Many times what we see is that young people are influenced in the wrong way when they're incarcerated in these large facilities.\" \nGilbert, R-Woodstock, acknowledged this sort of problem, but he also said first-time offenders rarely end up in a state facility. Young offenders in particular get many chances, he said, but he also said his party is open to some system reforms. \n\"There's a constant effort to try and treat juvenile offenders like children,\" Gilbert said. \"In recent history public policy has moved in the other direction. … And, you know, not all of these so-called children deserve a pat on the head. A lot of them are violent predators.\" \n\"But if the pendulum has swung too far in one direction,\" Gilbert said, \"I think we're open to some corrective action.\" \nHampton and Newport News have a local facility that could be used to house area youths who would otherwise be shipped to Bon Air or Beaumont, Morgan said. Policy now limits stays in these local facilities to 180 days, though, and the area needs more services to rehabilitate offenders, Morgan said. \nNearly 70 percent of youth offenders in prison are believed to have mental issues, according to the state. \nA kink in state policy also encourages localities to send offenders to the state facilities, coalition members aid. Virginia taxpayers cover costs at Bon Air and Beaumont, but localities have to pay most of the costs in local facilities and community-based treatment programs, members said. \nFrom school house to police precinct \nA national report released earlier this year put Virginia at No. 1 in the nation when it comes to referring school children to law enforcement. \nThe report was based on statistics from the 2011-12 school year, and the state has cut referrals since then from a high of nearly 13,500 to 11,576 in the 2013-14, according to the Virginia Department of Education. \nThe state has also seen a downward trend in suspensions and expulsions, but there is more work to be done, DOE spokesman Charles Pyle said. \nMorgan said his department and the school division recently retrained all of Newport News' school resource officers, telling them to \"be more of an extension of the schools and be law enforcement as a last resort.\" \nState law doesn't always provide leeway, though, coalition members said. It requires school officials to report a wide range of offenses to law enforcement, including assaults and batteries that cause injury, stalking, all threats against school personnel and \"any conduct involving alcohol, marijuana or steroids.\" \nThe group would also like to see a new state definition for disorderly conduct. The current rule \"vacuums up a lot of young people who just engage in a lot of generally childish behavior in the classroom,\" Duvall said. \nAndrew Block, whom McAuliffe tapped last year to lead the state's Department of Juvenile Justice, said the department is working now to reform its re-entry system and better help young people adjust to leaving custody. Virginia was recently one of three states to win a federal grant in this area, Block said. \nRise for Youth has focused on the system's front end, and Block said that needs work as well. \n\"We need, across the commonwealth, to provide judges in communities with choices and with effective alternatives to having to confine youth,\" he said. \"Evidence says that works better.\" \nSpecific proposals will come, Block said. There are plans to shift funding from corrections into intervention, and there's a program underway wherein the state pays localities to house offenders locally. \n\"Do I have 10 programs that I can tell you about that today? No,\" Block said last week. \"But is that the direction that we're moving? Definitely.\" \nFain can be reached by phone at 757-525-1759.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:21:00.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
