Maggie Hassan announced Monday she will run against Sen. Kelly Ayotte, giving Democrats a potential boost as they attempt to retake the Senate next year.\nHassan cited her work freezing college tuition, the success of the New Hampshire economy and other measures from her two terms as governor as reason to send her to Washington.\n\"Now to continue working to realize our state's potential, we need a response from Washington that meets the progress we're making here at home, and that's exactly why I'm running for the United States Senate,\" Hassan said in a video posted Monday morning .\nManchester, New Hampshire, station WMUR first reported Hassan's entry into the race.\nHassan marks a big-name pickup for Senate Democrats.
