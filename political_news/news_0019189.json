Could not subscribe, try again later Copyright Collins Photo Agency Fianna Fail deputy Michael McGrath \nSneaky income tax hikes of €300million were hidden in the Budget, it has been claimed. \nUniversal Social Charge taxes for all workers earning under €70,000 were cut in Tuesday’s Budget. \nBut Fianna Fail has accused the government of burying €300 million of tax hikes deep in the documents. \nThe party’s finance spokesman Michael McGrath crunched the numbers. \nHe said that tax bands should have bee increased to make sure they are in line with inflation as the economy recovers. \nHe explained: “The Economic and Fiscal outlook which accompanies the budget sets out the impact of budget tax measures. \n“There is a cut of €595million in income tax which relates changes to USC rates / bands. However there is also a provision for €300million being raised from non-indexation of the tax system. \n“This is a stealth tax as it has the effect of raising Government tax revenue without explicitly raising tax rates. \nTaxpayers will pay more tax as the income tax bands are not being adjusted to take account of expected inflation. Collins Photo Agency Taoiseach Enda Kenny \n“According to the document the Department of Finance projects that inflation will be 1.2 per cent in 2016. To protect taxpayers from the loss of real income from inflation the entry point for the top tax rate should have been increased by €400 for a single person and €800 for a married couple. \n“The various personal and PAYE tax credits should also have been increased to mitigate the impact of inflation. \n“Essentially the Minister for Finance is taking back half of the USC tax cut this way. The biggest losers are those earning around the entry point to the top rate, €33,800. \n“Many extra taxpayers will be now pushed into the top tax bracket if they get a modest pay increase. \n“I am calling on the Minister to clearly state how many more people will be paying tax at 40 per cent as a result of his failure to index bands.” \nA spokesman for the Department of Finance said: “The only tax increase in Budget 2016 is a 50c increase in the price of 20 cigarettes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:05:28.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
