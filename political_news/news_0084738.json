I did say it was a mistake.\"Clinton said it wasn't the best choice, \"I have been as transparent as I know to be\" noting the release of 55 thousand pages of emails from the server.But it was the reaction of fellow presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders that made for a moment of unity between the two candidates.\"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about the... emails\" he said, as Clinton agreed.\"Thank you\" she said, \"Me too. Me too.\"Defending her position, Clinton noted recent statements made by House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , on the creation of the House select committee investigating the 2012 attacks on American government outposts in Benghazi.\"Let's just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee\" she said to an applauding audience.Clinton, reiterating the committee was meant to \"drive down my poll numbers.\" \"[Benghazi] committee is basically an arm of the RNC—I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people.\" -Hillary — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 14, 2015 \n\"Big surprise. And that is what they have attempted to do.\"Already Sanders' campaign team has emailed the moment, asking for more support in his quest for the White House.
