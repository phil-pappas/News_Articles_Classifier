Paul Ryan made headlines on Tuesday after expressing willingness to serve as the next Speaker of the House Republicans, but only if his conditions are met. \nThe well-known Republican laid out his guidelines in a closed-door meeting with the full House GOP conference after a bevy of senior members of his party lobbying for him to take the role in leading the divided conference – despite Ryan numerously declining any interest in the position. \n“I came to the conclusion that this is a very dire moment — not just for Congress, not just for the Republican Party, but for our country,” Ryan told reporters. “And I think our country is in desperate need of leadership.” \nAs far as Ryan’s conditions are concerned, the Republican will only run if he’s supported by three groups inside the House Republican conference: the House Freedom Caucus, the Republican Study Committee and the moderate Tuesday Group, his spokesman Brendan Buck said. \nRyan also delved out a few more demands. \nHe wants changes to House rules made as a team – a major demand of the House Freedom Caucus; he wants to make it harder to overthrow a speaker, and he wants a better balance between work and his personal life. \nHe stressed the importance of thorough support for the next speaker, reiterating to his colleagues that he’s willing to “take arrows in the chest, but not in the back,” a GOP source said. \n“I am happy and willing to get to work,” said Ryan, should the conference agree to his stipulations. \nHouse Freedom Caucus member Rep. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) said he still needs to iron some things out with Ryan before deciding whether to support his bid. The conservative caucus had endorsed Rep. Daniel Webster (R-FL) for speaker and has yet to move away from that endorsement. \nAnd while Ryan wants a unified support, that might easier said than done. \n“I have concerns with anybody who is not going to give us a reform agenda,” Rep. Raul Labrador said. “If anybody thinks we are just going to get behind somebody just because they have a national name, they are sadly mistaken.” \nAlabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks, also a member of the House Freedom Caucus, suggested Ryan’s past support for immigration reforms as a reason he’s skeptical of Ryan. \n“There is growing concern in my district, as more and more people become aware of Paul Ryan’s amnesty and open borders immigration position and that concerned deepened when Luis Gutierrez endorsed him for speaker,” Brooks said. \nOn Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner set a date for Republicans to vote on his successor, hinting that Boehner is confident that Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan will agree to run. \n“I hope he does decide to run, and if he does, I think he’ll be elected,” Boehner said.
