Ghana has an Electoral Commissioner that is independent and does not consult the president to do anything. \n\"It is a relatively young register because we have only used it for only one election and it was a register that has been biometrically compiled… It is for the EC to decide what to do”, he said. \nSome critics have condemned portions of the president's remarks which suggested that the register was a new one and had to be improved not changed. \nMr Pratt said the critics are wrong.“What is wrong with what the president said…the constitution says that that decision ought to be made by the electoral commission and that is what the president said…or do we want the constitution to be violated”, he queried. \nHe said the NPP should not expect that a new register will be created simply because they think that is the right way to go. \n“it seems to me that what they want simply is for all of us to shut up and accept what they are proposing without questions even if what they are proposing does not make sense. \n“How can you run any country or institution like this where one segment of the society – even if they are in majority – that when they speak no one else has the right to speak, when they come to conclusions we should all follow them like sheep. They say they want a new voters register so everybody shut up let’s go and get a new voters register”, he said. \nHe called on the general public to allow the EC room to take a decision on whether or not it is necessary to create a new register. \nStory by Ghana | Myjoyonline.com | Naa Sakwaba Akwa | [email protected]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:29:38.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
