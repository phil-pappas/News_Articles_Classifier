The first Democratic contest saw a confident and substantive performance from the former secretary of state, who said she would not be seeking voters' approval based on her last name. \n\"I'd ask them to listen to what I'm proposing, look at what I've accomplished,\" Clinton said during the debate. St. Edward's University political science Professor Brian W. Smith suggests by finishing without a noticeable gaffe or stumble, the front runner walked away with a win. Hillary Clinton remains on top after debate \nRunner-up Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders continues to draw crowds attracted by his far-left politics, explaining Tuesday night, \"What Democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent.\" \nYet Sanders passed on the chance to go for the jugular against Clinton, stating, \"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damned e-mails.\" \nSpeaking to the media after the event, Sanders said the debate was very different from the previous two Republican contests. \n\"I would hope that the American people see the difference between people who are trying to address real issues rather than call people names,\" Sanders told reporters. \n\"At the end of the day he did okay,\" said Smith of Sanders. \"But he didn't do tremendous, and his poll numbers aren't going to increase dramatically because of that.\" \nIt was a case of wasted opportunity for also-rans Jim Webb, Lincoln Chafee, and Martin O'Malley. While the former Maryland governor turned in a decent performance, Smith contends, \"He really didn't connect overwhelmingly with voters to say this is his Carly Fiorina moment from where he goes from the bottom up to one of the top candidates.\" \nThe biggest question is still Joe Biden. The vice president praised all five candidates' performance Wednesday, yet time is quickly running out to decide whether he will run. \n\"He's in the exact same place he was on Monday, but he's just two days closer to Iowa without a campaign staff, without any fundraising,\" Smith said. \"So he's got to decide, 'Am I going to enter the race? And if so, I have to make that decision quickly.' And last night didn't make that choice any easier for him.\" Read or Share this story: http://kvue.tv/1Lvlyx9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:11:27.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
