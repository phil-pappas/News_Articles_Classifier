I know I’m very biased, and I actually think I’m even more biased now as a mom than as a daughter because I feel like I have a different stake in the future because of my daughter, Charlotte,\" she said in an interview with \"CBS This Morning.\" \"And so, I have no doubt on Thursday she will ... be remarkable and that Americans will really see why I so strongly believe that she should be our next president.\"\nClinton said she \"mainly\" talks about her daughter and family with her mother, not presidential politics.\n\"I think because she has so many advisers who know this terrain better than I do, but she only has one daughter and one granddaughter. And I want to create and protect that space for our family,\" she said. \"I see my mother so much more now than before Charlotte.\"\nAsked how she felt about constant criticism of her parents' political careers, Clinton said she has steeled herself over the years.\nThe rise of the 'zombie' earmark By Austin Wright and Jeremy Herb\n\"I mean, I don’t remember a time when people weren’t attacking my parents.

I think we'll have to see,\" she said. \"As my mom has said, that's very much up to the vice president.\"\nClinton, who has remained friends with Donald Trump's eldest daughter Ivanka, said their relationship \"is so much more important than anything that happens in politics.\"\n\"So you don't call her and say, could you ask your dad to stop talking?\" Clinton was asked by co-host Gayle King. \"We don't talk about that,\" she responded.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:53:15.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
