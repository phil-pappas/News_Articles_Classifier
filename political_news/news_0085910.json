Additional photos, a video, an infographic and more below. SeekingArrangement.com In recent months, the hack of Ashley Madison , a website that promotes extramarital hookups via slogans such as \"Life is short, have an affair,\" revealed the personal data of as many as 70,000 users in the Denver area .\nHas this breach reduced the number of metro-area cheaters? Not according to SeekingArrangement.com , a rival of sorts to Ashley Madison that's devoted to pairing self-proclaimed sugar daddies (and a few sugar mommies) with students and other young people willing to trade companionship for financial support.\nA release from the company claims that \"the number of Sugar Daddies in the area has increased by 37 percent since last year.\"\nHowever, the site's numbers also show that Denver's ranking among top sugar daddy cities has fallen since October 2014, when, as we've reported , the Mile High City placed twelfth by Seeking Arrangement's estimate.\nSeekingArrangement.com How reliable is such data? In the case of Ashley Madison, plenty of questions have been raised about its claims. Note that its hackers say the vast majority of female profiles included on the site were fictional.\nRelated Stories Photos: Top Cities for Sugar Daddies -- and Where Denver Finishes Update: Ashley Madison Hackers Dump Data on Up to 70,000 Denver Cheaters Brandon Wade, founder and CEO of Seeking Arrangement, makes an allusion to this situation in a note on his site's home page. It reads: \"Unlike other dating websites, it's my commitment to operate our business ethically. This means caring about your privacy, encrypting identifiable data, and never employing fake profiles or software bots. When we say there are more women than men, we guarantee it.\"\nWhatever that means.\nSeekingArrangement.com In any event, the site's annual sugar daddy study maintains that Austin, Texas, is now the top sugar-daddy city in the country, displacing Atlanta. Here are its estimates for the number of sugar daddies per 1,000 adult males:\n1 Austin 23.24\n2 Atlanta 21.60\n3 Las Vegas 19.23\n4 Boston 18.25\n5 Orlando 18.10\n6 Dallas 16.83\n7 Vancouver 15.36\n8 Tampa 14.59\n9 Chicago 14.53\n10 San Francisco 14.21\n11 Houston 12.64\n12 Seattle 10.82\n13 Washington 10.72\n14 Denver 8.97\n15 Portland 7.11\n16 Edmonton 6.24\n17 Charlotte 5.75\n18 Phoenix 5.66\n19 Los Angeles 5.48\n20 Toronto 5.37\n21 San Antonio 5.11\n22 San Jose 5.05\n23 San Diego 4.73\n24 Saskatoon 4.71\n25 Victoria 4.67\n26 New York 4.52\n27 Calgary 4.02\n28 Philadelphia 3.98\n29 Winnipeg 3.92\n30 Ottawa 3.37 SeekingArrangement.com As you can see, Denver is currently listed at number fourteen, as opposed to number twelve last year. In 2014, though, the percentage of sugar daddies in Denver was put at 6.54 per 1,000 males â€” lower than the current 8.97 figure.\nLast year, the site provided specific sugar daddy demographics for major cities. Not so this year. Instead, Seeking Arrangement offers a description of the average sugar daddy: a 45-year-old who spends an average of $4,252 per month on his companion.\nOh yeah: From May to June, 39 percent of sugar daddies were married, but that number decreased to 34 percent at the end of August...after the Ashley Madison hack.\nLook below to see a Seeking Arrangement video about the latest findings, followed by a new infographic about sugar daddies.\nSeekingArrangement.com\nContact: Michael Roberts Follow: Michael Roberts Westword Westword", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michael-RobertsWestword/111180895657427", "http://www.twitter.com/denverwestword", "https://www.seekingarrangement.com/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1Loa2AmzUQ", "https://www.facebook.com/DenverWestword"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:16:32.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
