We are part of a WhatsApp group of friends who grew up together; it’s also a group that I feel like exiting at least once a week. But this is not a piece about what to do with friends and family who show no tolerance for your idea of India (I’m still trying to figure that one out). This is about the one thing Sameer and I don’t argue about.\n“India needs a Kachra Minister,” he said over lunch the other day. I couldn’t agree more. An urban development minister or a water and sanitation minister is too sanitized a title for someone in charge of cleaning up our garbage, faeces, urine, paan spit, filth and all-round grossness. Kachra Minister, on the other hand, sounds like a no-nonsense person who does not have a public relations budget.\nHe could even be anonymous like members of The Ugly Indian, a Bengaluru-based citizen’s clean-up group. Imagine a nameless and faceless Kachra Minister who appears stealthily in his kachramobile whenever you flash him the kachra signal, a stylized image of an Indian man peeing. The ghost who sweeps (yes I know I’m mixing my superheroes but I really do see him as a mix of Batman and Phantom). Litterbugs will FEAR the Kachra Minister.\nThere’s no doubt that Swachh Bharat, that great big plan to clean up India that finally got a name one year ago, is a great idea. But that image of a dapper prime minister wearing a powder-blue sleeveless jacket over an all-white ensemble and tan shoes while daintily attempting to launch the campaign’s sweeping message didn’t work for me. And have you seen the length of the brooms used by politicians and other celebrities in the photo ops that followed this past year? Zero bending required.\nIndia needs a lithe, almost springy Kachra Minister—one whose belly doesn’t come in the way when he lowers himself to make contact with a dustpan or bends forward to fish sludgy water hyacinth out of our lakes with a pole. Someone who doesn’t wrinkle up his nose at the smell of Indianness. Someone with the nervous energy of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal or Times Now news anchor Arnab Goswami—but a mute version please.\nHe must be male and upper caste, because that’s the group that has traditionally distanced itself from dirt in our country. This profile of a Kachra Minister will make maximum impact on our hierarchy-conscious society. If he can do it….\nIndia’s toilet crisis too has always been about its men—women want to take their business indoors. It’s only fair that a man take responsibility for making the country open-defecation free (no using India as an open-air toilet) by 2019, a target set by the Swachh Bharat scheme.\nThe Kachra Minister must not fear authority because it will be his job to immediately remove all those preachy and pompous Films Division movies on Swachh Bharat and replace them with more innovative films like Amiya Patra’s short film Susu Donor . In the film a man who wants to pee by the side of the road is told he can make money if he donates his urine in the nearby toilet. Is that really possible, he wonders, and heads off to find out.\nPatra, a lieutenant commander who quit the navy to make films three years ago, entered this short for the annual 101-hour social film-making challenge by Yes Foundation, run by Yes Bank. Half a million people made 15,000 films for this challenge; the winners will be announced in December.\nOur Kachra Minister must be someone who understands Indian behaviour as intuitively as the funny guys at All India Bakchod, that social media comic factory, or sexologist Mahinder Watsa. When you hear his name your first thought should be: Now that’s a guy who gets us.\nThe Kachra Minister must have the ability to stay in the good books of the Prime Minister because the minister will require all the help he can get in the social networking department. He needs Narendra Modi’s 15.5 million Twitter followers to help spread his message.\nThirty-two-year-old Temsutula Imsong, who has been in the news this year because of her successful efforts to clean up Varanasi with nothing more than some friends and some brooms, got a Twitter shout-out from the Prime Minister in April. The subsequent support on social media (look up #MissionPrabhughat on Twitter) made a huge difference to their work, she tells me over the phone.\nImsong and her friend Darshika Shah did similar work in Varanasi in 2012, but they were not active on social media and not many people noticed. Now she follows the Prime Minister’s mantra: Always post before-after pictures so people can see the difference.\nOur Kachra Minister already has the manual written for him. “If you see a problem, go fix it. Nobody stops you. Don’t waste your time complaining. You can actually make a change,” says the mask-wearing Anamik Nagrik (anonymous citizen), a member of The Ugly Indian, in a TEDx talk titled “Why Is India So Filthy?” His other tips: Don’t talk, only do; don’t expect credit or applause; don’t take anybody’s money; use Facebook to create belief that it can be done with before-after photos; the government loves it if citizens engage; if you want to change the world, start with your own street.\nIn Varanasi, Imsong did the same. “So far we have not approached any government agency to help us. When you have the intent to do something, money is irrelevant,” she says. A bunch of friends pooled in their own money. Most citizens who have cleaned up their neighbourhoods will tell you it doesn’t cost much. And that when people see you cleaning, they join in. Imagine if the Kachra Minister could actually tap into the movement that’s already under way.\nNothing is impossible, says Imsong. “You just have to institutionalize cleanliness, whether it is at school or within a community.” I hope our future Kachra Minister is listening.\nPriya Ramani will share what’s making her feel angsty/agreeable every fortnight.
