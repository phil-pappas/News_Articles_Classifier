We are still relying on the clips that are available online, for our investigation,” said NCIC Commission Secretary Hassan Mohammed. \nKenyans took to social media to express their disappointment at the statements made by Mr Aladwa through the hashtag #ArrestAladwa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:08:26.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
