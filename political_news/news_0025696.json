The law required candidates to report \"late contributions\" of $250 or more received the last 16 days before an election. \nBut only one candidate in the last two years, former District 5 Councilman Xavier Campos, managed to follow the law, which was adopted in 2011. The problem came to light after a citizen filed a complaint against Councilman Manh Nguyen, who contended that nearly all other candidates flouted the city rule. Nguyen was slapped with a $10,000 fine by the commission, while others walked away scot-free because the panel can only investigate when a complaint is filed. \nWithin months, someone submitted a complaint against Nguyen's opponent in the District 4 special election, Tim Orozco. To stop people from filing individual complaints against each of the dozens of violators -- prompting countless investigations and penalties -- the commission initiated the unprecedented broad probe. Commissioners won't act on the Orozco complaint until the bigger investigation is done. Advertisement \nSteven Miller, an attorney with Hanson Bridgett, the San Francisco law firm contracted to investigate, said in a letter Wednesday the firm has made contact with candidates included in the investigation. But depending on how quickly they respond or their willingness to be interviewed, Miller wrote, delays could be expected. The firm is pushing to complete the report by the commission's next meeting, tentatively set for Nov. 12. \nThe cost of the unique broad investigation -- footed by San Jose taxpayers -- is weighing on some commissioners' minds. Hanson Bridgett gets paid $415 per hour if a partner works on the investigation; $360 if it's senior counsel; $315 for an associate; and $185 for a political compliance specialist. The contract, which expires June 2016, caps the firm's total compensation at $250,000. \nChairman Michael Smith, who requested a 30-day extension for the attorneys to complete their work, said the firm is aware the commission doesn't want to \"break the bank\" and has taken steps to control costs. \n\"The one difference between this one and the others,\" said Smith, \"is a large part of the labor is stuff that's done by a non-attorney. So that will keep the costs down.\" Follow Ramona Giwargis at Twitter.com/ramonagiwargis or contact her at 408-920-5705.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:40:01.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
