The broadcast said the facility is one of hundreds of underground missile bases around the country. It didn't disclose the location but said it was 500 meters (1,600 feet) underground.\nAmir Ali Hajizadeh, head of the Guard's aerospace branch, boasted that the facility is the \"tip of the iceberg\" of the Guard's military might.\nThe broadcast appeared aimed at showing that the Guard will continue its missile program despite U.N. Security Council resolutions and despite Iran's nuclear deal with the West. Days earlier, Iran said it successfully test-fired a new long-range surface-to-surface missile.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6q7q%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Iran%20shows%20off%20underground%20missile%20base&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6q7q%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6q7q%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6q7q%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Iran%20shows%20off%20underground%20missile%20base", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6q7q%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6q7q%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Iran%20shows%20off%20underground%20missile%20base"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:30:31.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
