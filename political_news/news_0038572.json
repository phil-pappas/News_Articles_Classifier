Haslam's Trouble With Transparency Posted By Amanda Haggard on Mon, Oct 19, 2015 at 1:12 PM Gov. Bill Haslam is having a rough month. Most recently, he got caught insisting to reporters plans to outsource management of more state-owned buildings are still up in the air days after outlining to New York bond-rating agencies how outsourcing is one of the Haslam administration's key ways to \"reduce cost and improve productivity.\" But that's not all. At the end of last week, the Associated Press reported that Haslam thinks it's also totally fine to tell new government employees to avoid using email to discuss divisive issues. From the AP: The Republican governor told reporters after an economic development conference this week that it's a standard practice of \"sharing some wisdom\" with new employees who have come to government from the private sector that all of their correspondence is subject to Tennessee's open records laws. \"Any government that comes into office, the very first day they say, careful what you put in that email, because unless you want to see it in the newspaper, don't put it in that email,\" Haslam said Wednesday. \"It's just part of the world we live in.\" But Haslam also reiterated his administration's long-held position that the public records law requiring disclosure of deliberative material applies to everyone in state government - except him. \"If this is part of our deliberative process and we're discussing things back and forth - unless it's with the governor - then that's open to a records request,\" Haslam said. Haslam's words on transparency come after Terry Cowles, head of the governor's Strategies for Efficiency in Real Estate Management office, told reporters the administration instructed officials to avoid using email to deliberate on the possible privitization of several government agencies. A few stray thoughts on Haslam's troubles with transparency: 1.) What's the point of open records laws at all if douchey politicians keep finding ways to circumvent the public's knowledge of their discussions? 2.) There's a bit of a difference between letting new government employees know their emails are subject to open records and telling them to avoid using email to discuss certain subjects. 3.) Dismissing open records laws as just \"part of the world we live in\" is just plain — as the youngins say — basic. 4.) It's worrisome that Haslam, and other politicans, are so paranoid about their ideas and deliberations getting into newspapers. And frankly, the state's top guy should be setting an example for every other politician in the area of transparency. It all goes back to that whole nothing-to-hide thing. 5.) Yes, Haslam, reporters do have the \"luxury\" of not being subject to open records. Want to know why? Well, because we're not the ones deliberating on and making policy. 6.) In a lot of ways, the deliberations are more important to the public than even the outcome of whatever the discussion may be. Basically, once you completely bake the shit pie, the public wants to know which turds you used as ingredients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:47:41.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
