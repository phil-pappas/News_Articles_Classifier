(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File)\nAssociated Press Oct. 21, 2015 | 8:35 a.m. EDT + More By TOM KRISHER, AP Auto Writer\nDETROIT (AP) — General Motors' third-quarter profit fell slightly, but the company rode strong North American sales to overcome $1.5 billion in costs from its deadly ignition switch recall. Its shares rose almost 4 percent in premarket trading Wednesday.\nThe Detroit automaker's net income slipped 1.4 percent from a year ago, but still was $1.36 billion, or 84 cents per share. That compares with $1.38 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year ago.\nWithout the recall costs, GM would have made a $1.50 per share, soundly beating Wall Street expectations. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $1.18 per share.\nThe company posted a record $3.3 billion pretax profit in North America, more than offsetting a small decline in China and a loss in South America.\nThe news pushed GM shares up 4.5 percent, or $1.52, to $35 in premarket trading about an hour before the markets opened Wednesday.\nChief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said the GM's North American profit margin, the percent of revenue it gets to keep, hit a record 11.8 percent for the quarter. The company had set a goal of 10 percent North American margins by next year, but Stevens said GM will achieve the target a year early.\nRevenue from July through September fell 1 percent to $38.8 billion, but still beat analysts' forecasts. Almost three quarters of GM's revenue came from North America.\nIn China, GM reported pretax income of $463 million, down 4 percent from a year ago, but profit margins rose from 9.6 percent to 9.8 percent because the company sold more expensive Cadillacs and SUVs. \"China has not fallen off the cliff as everyone had expected,\" Stevens said.\nSouth America, though, is still the big trouble spot for GM and other companies. The company lost $217 million in the region, almost seven times the loss from a year ago, and Stevens said there isn't an end in sight to economic troubles there.\nIn Europe, GM's loss narrowed to $231 million and Stevens said GM is still on track to be profitable there next year. GM Financial, the company's auto loan arm, posted a 13 percent profit gain to $231 million.\nThe recall costs included $900 million to fend off criminal prosecution over the ignition-switch scandal and about $600 million to settle multiple wrongful death and shareholder lawsuits stemming from the problem.\nThe switches in older model small cars such as the Chevy Cobalt can slip out of the \"run\" position and cut off the engine. They have been linked to at least 169 deaths.\nGM said in September that ignition-switch scandal cost it over $5.3 billion. Even with the settlements, GM cannot close the books on the scandal. It still faces more than 400 death and injury cases that have yet to be settled. Six cases are scheduled for trial, including one in January.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
