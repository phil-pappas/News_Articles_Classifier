Rep. Kevin McCarthy, of California, was elected to replace him, allowing newcomer Steve Scalise, R-La., to ascend to the leadership post of majority whip.\nSome longtime Capitol Hill insiders say the House GOP is now facing turbulence not seen since the days of former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who weathered one coup attempt by his rank-and-file before being forced out days after losing seats in the November 1998 election.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Voting Rights Act unlikely to be part of Obama legacy Next year's presidential election is on track to be the first conducted without the law's full protection.\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/05/15 12:01 AM Boehner has been very successful at increasing the GOP House numbers, helping the party win back the House majority in 2010 and overseeing a 13-seat increase in the 2014 election.\nAmong the newly elected members are some of the conservatives who tried to push Boehner out of office.\n\"We've never had a rogue group like this,\" said former Rep. Bob Livingston, of Louisiana.\nLivingston is all too familiar with coups, having led the rebellion that forced out Gingrich after the House GOP suffered a net loss of five seats in the midterm election during President Bill Clinton's second term.\nAt the time, House Republicans faulted Gingrich over the tactics he employed in challenging Clinton to reduce government funding, which resulted in a Christmas-time government shutdown and muddled the GOP's message.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Can Clinton delete her past? Clinton's campaign is in a constant struggle to supplant negative narratives with positive ones.\nBy Sarah Westwood • 10/05/15 12:01 AM Livingston said current House conservatives aren't going to change much by ousting Boehner because Senate Democrats will block legislation or President Obama will use his veto pen.\n\"People are justifiably upset that Washington has not been adhering to the goals set out when we took the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014, and we didn't reverse everything Obama put in place,\" said Livingston, now a lobbyist. \"But, that is because the system didn't allow it.\"\nConservatives tell the Examiner they simply want a bigger voice in the process in order to help advance the priorities of their constituents, who light up the Capitol switchboard and send thousands of emails demanding Republicans fulfill the promises they made in November.\n\"It's really up to the leadership to define what the goals are,\" Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., who in July introduced a resolution to depose Boehner, told the Examiner . \"When you make statements that we are going to fight tooth and nail and we don't fight tooth and nail, that creates expectations that have to be fulfilled.\"\nTop Story Defiant   calls Fiorina a liar Cecile   \"deceptive.\"\n  3:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:19:50.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
