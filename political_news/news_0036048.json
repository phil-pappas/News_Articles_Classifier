It's hard to actually imagine the singer's everyday life because one presumes she spends it shooting helicopters from the sky and crying individual tears into eggshell-blue ceramic jars, ones she'll wrap in tissue and twine to then mail to her former lovers. But we learn in a new Billboard cover story on the star that ha ha, no, her daily life is not so different from yours or mine:\nI go for long walks, long drives. I’ll get in the car and drive the streets, feeling for places. I go to Big Sur. I love Big Sur, but it has gotten so touristy. I went to the General Store, and there were hordes . On a Monday! But I’m drawn there. Sometimes I go to write. I’ve been thinking it might be time to do a longer video, a 40-minute video. I was watching The Sandpiper , and I was working on something kind of based on that.\nOh, yeah. I did all of those things just last weekend. What is it that young Lizzy Grant feels about Big Sur? \"Big Sur challenges me to surrender. What draws me is ... the curves. I’m really drawn to the curves.\" Perfect. Thank you.\nShe is also \"terrified of sharks.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnxpHIl5Ynw", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/cover-story/6737539/lana-del-rey-billboard-cover-pop-stardom-relationships-anxiety"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:07:17.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
