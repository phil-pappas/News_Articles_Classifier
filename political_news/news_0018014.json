Sensing the tricky political situation, the Shiv Sena and BJP also joined in, and supported the demand for an inquiry.\nDevendra Amberkar, Leader of the Opposition in BMC, made a statement during the corporation's meeting and said a criminal complaint should be registered against the contractor, and that the civic officials involved in the scam should be suspended. He also proposed that the Mayor should be felicitated for the courage she showed.\nRais Shaikh, the Samajwadi Party leader in the BMC, said said the excavation scam was very serious and the Mayor should insist on detailed information and inquiry. \"Construction of roads in Mumbai is more expensive than any other city in the country or even in the world, if parameters such as barricades, excavation and transportation of debris are concerned. The scam mentioned by the Mayor in the letter is only the tip of the iceberg, she has opened the Pandora's box,\" he said.\nSandeep Deshpande, the MNS party leader in the civic body, said the Mayor has raised a genuine issue fit for her post. \"What is wrong if she raised the issue? Why is Shiv Sena so unnerved about it? Road contractors charge fee for each and every thing from BMC,\" he said.\nBJP leader Manoj Kotak and Kishori Pednekar, along with other corporators from the ruling Shiv Sena and BJP, also supported the demand for an inquiry. \"Let the administration conduct a thorough inquiry and let the culprits be booked under the law,\" said Kotak.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/1/104164532788541805272/posts"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:39:30.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
