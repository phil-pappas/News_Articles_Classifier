He has already been forced to apologise over extravagance in the departmental refit that included a $67,000 sign, a $23,000 fridge and top of the line hair-straighteners. \n\"Other expenses uncovered have included a $73,000 reception desk, $16,553 of soft furnishing and tables for the reception and just last week, the most expensive media monitoring enterprise in Government. \n\"While Steven Joyce might bleat on about this blow-out being a one off $260,000 sundecks and $140,000 TV screens don’t lie. \n\"He should face ramifications or have his pay docked. \n\"At the very least, the Minister will be lambasted by a public tired of careless spending of hard-earned taxpayer dollars. \n\"This is sheer nonsense from a department which should be sticking to its knitting, not trying to pull the wool over our eyes.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:41:54.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
