Provided by Allan Crew Mitchell and Brandon Brinkhaus are “a couple big kids who love the outdoors,” says their cousin Allan Crew. Hunting, snowmobiling, dirt biking. Last weekend the Bloomington brothers were at a friend’s house in Litchfield with plans for a Saturday morning duck hunt.\nAs Crew understands it, the Brinkhauses and two others were doing recon on possible hunting sites Friday afternoon and evening. But a late-night accident thwarted their woodsy weekend.\nAround 12:40 a.m. Saturday, 23-year-old Mitchell and Brandon, 20, were riding in the back of a utility vehicle. While the brothers sat in a space meant for cargo, their friends sat in the vehicle’s side-by-side seats.\nProvided by Allan Crew Neither remembers much about what happened after the crash, Crew says. Brandon and Mitchell were first taken to the small Meeker Memorial Hospital in Litchfield, where their parents rushed to meet them. Both were eventually transported to Hennepin County Medical Center.\n“From what they heard from the smaller hospital, they were told that they had neck injuries,” Crew says. “So, you don’t know if there’s spinal injuries, you don’t know if they’re going to become paralyzed.”\nBoth brothers suffered fractured vertebrae, while Mitchell also fractured his shoulder, sustained a compound fracture in his arm, and required stitches in his head. With torn ligaments between his vertebrae, Brandon has to wear a halo for the next three months, followed by another 90 days in a neck brace. Despite the severity of their injuries, Crew says both are in stable condition and starting to walk again (albeit gingerly). They were likely to be discharged from the hospital Tuesday or Wednesday.\n“You never know how severe anything is until you see it, see what happened,” Crew says.\nProvided by Allan Crew On Sunday, Crew launched a crowdfunding page to help Brandon and Mitchell, who both work construction jobs, and their family deal with medical expenses. By Tuesday afternoon it had raised nearly $4,000.\nContact: Michael Rietmulder Follow: @mrietmulder City Pages City Pages", "external_links": ["https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/xvfb/brinkhaus-family-fundraiser?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=fb_sharer&utm_campaign=php_fundraiser_main-carebears&og_action=hug&fb_ref=sharer-carebears&t=3", "https://twitter.com/mrietmulder", "https://www.facebook.com/citypages", "http://www.twitter.com/citypages"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:30:21.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
