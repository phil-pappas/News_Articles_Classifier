Report Score: -3 Buckmas 7:43pm Fri 2 Oct 15 \nThe worry I have is although I fully support ANY updates to this wonderful park is just how much money will be spent to decide what to do, how many consultations and meetings will be paid for prior to a spade being lifted. I fear millions spent and then no actions followed. What happened to the idea of a ski and ice rink to be based at the site of the Council works in lower town by the Itchen Bridge. Plans were made and I dare say money spent to get nowhere. I remember going to the Sports Centre as a young child and being in wonder at its shear size. The Its a knockout contests in probably the 70s drew thousands there. I wonder how many people within our City don't even know the Sports Centre exists ! Don't take this the wrong way I fully support the ideas - But worry who will fund the consultancy phase. How about a few functions there first to get people to the area. Do the Schools still have an athletics meeting there each year ? How well are events published ? If you have to travel over to the General Hospital for any reason, it's a fantastic place to go to with or without children. Great to walk round even as it is BUT where is the publicity ? We have a great number of students in our town do they know where it is ? Why not have inter-university events at the sports centre ? Apart from this story can the Echo tell me the last time the Sports Centre was detailed in its pages ?
