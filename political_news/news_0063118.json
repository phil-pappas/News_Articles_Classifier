I mean, he hadn’t printed up any tour T-shirts yet. But former Gov. Lincoln D. Chafee had been traveling throughout Iowa and New Hampshire, and on Tuesday he was stepping onto the national stage in Las Vegas — for a prime-time CNN debate between the Democratic presidential candidates — to once again tell the world why he was right to vote against the Iraq War and why Hillary Clinton was wrong to vote for it. He was going to tell Democratic voters how he’d been vindicated in his opposition to all things Bush/Cheney, and he was going to tout his “Prosperity through Peace” plan as the right approach for the future. It didn’t matter that he stood little or no chance of becoming president. It didn’t matter that he had raised just about enough money to run for a General Assembly seat. It didn’t matter that he’d left the State House with dismal job-approval numbers and probably couldn’t win his home state. And it didn’t matter that he’d been a Democrat for just a little longer than Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have been married (speaking of presidential candidates). Point is: Chafee was finally going to rise above the political opponents who had skewered him, the talk-radio critics who had ridiculed him, the business community know-it-alls who had questioned his “urgency.” This was Chafee’s big moment. And for awhile, at least, things were going pretty well. He was standing on stage with Hillary Clinton and telling everyone that he is the only presidential candidate — in either party, mind you — who has been a mayor, a U.S. senator and a governor. He was letting CNN viewers know about his high ethical standards. And he was informing Anderson Cooper that he had once chaired the Middle East Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But the first sign of trouble came when Cooper asked a question that Chafee surely knew was coming: “Governor Chafee, you’ve been everything but a socialist,” he said, noting Chafee is a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat. “Why should Democratic voters trust you won’t change again?” “Anderson,” Chafee replied, “you’re looking at a block of granite when it comes to the issues.” Well, Cooper cracked, “It seems like pretty soft granite.” “Did you hear what I said?” Chafee shot back. “I have not changed on the issues. I was a liberal Republican, then I was an independent, and now I’m a proud Democrat. But I have not changed on the issues.” OK, so I’m not sure the “block of granite” line plays well outside the Granite State. But that is the state with the first presidential primary, after all. And the exchange could have been rockier. In any case, Chafee's moment arrived soon afterward when Dana Bash asked him why the Iraq vote should disqualify Clinton from being president. Chafee noted Sen. Bernie Sanders had just called that “the worst decision in American history,” and he said, “That’s an indication of how someone will perform in the future.” The attack could have been much stronger. But Chafee got another chance to pounce when Cooper invited him to explain why Clinton’s private email server is a big issue. “There’s an issue of American credibility out there,” he replied. “I think we need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president.” So there it was: Chafee's chance to compare his courageous vote and his ethical standards with Clinton's. In other words: sweet vindication. But then Cooper said, “Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond?” “No,” is all Clinton said, with a smile, drawing applause and laughs, succinctly deflating Chafee’s attack as not worth responding to. Then the Vindication Tour took a real detour when Cooper asked Chafee why he had voted to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, “the Depression-era banking law repealed in 1999 that prevented commercial banks from engaging in investment banking and insurance activities.” (Many say the repeal was a key factor in the 2008-09 financial crisis.) “The Glass-Steagall was my very first vote,” Chafee replied. “I’d just arrived, my dad had died in office, I was appointed to the office, it was my very first vote.” Wait, what? Cooper asked, “Are you saying you didn’t know what you were voting for?” “I’d just arrived at the Senate,” Chafee reiterated. “I think we’d get some takeovers, and that was one. It was my very first vote, and it was 92-5.” (I’m guessing he meant “do-overs,” not “takeovers,” but he seemed rattled). Cooper zeroed in, asking, “What does that say about you that you’re casting a vote for something you weren’t really sure about?” “I think you’re being a little rough,” Chafee told Cooper. If it had been a boxing match, that would have been the moment to call the fight. If it had been an ice-skating competition, it would have been the moment when the skater goes for the triple Salchow and wipes out as audience members look away, whispering, “Oh, that’s just a shame.” I mean, you have to feel sympathy for any son who lost his father, and Chafee’s father was the beloved former Governor/U.S. Sen. John H. Chafee. But if you come to a debate to criticize a presidential candidate (Clinton) for going along with the crowd on an important vote (Iraq), you'd better be prepared to defend your own decision to go along with the crowd on an important vote (Glass-Steagall). And when the debate is on CNN, you don’t get do-overs. “Holy cow,” the Washington Post’s Chris Cillizza wrote . “I had low expectations for the former Rhode Island governor going into the debate, but he managed to underperform even those.” He called Chafee’s explanation for his Glass-Steagall vote “one of the five worst debate answers I have ever heard.” At the end of Tuesday’s debate, the New York Times tallied how much speaking time each candidate had during the debate. Clinton led with 31 minutes and 5 seconds. Chafee was last with 9 minutes and 11 seconds (which seems roughly equivalent to the amount of time devoted to discussing Denmark). Jim Webb spoke for 15 minutes and 35 seconds -- and squandered much of it bellyaching about not having more time. But Chafee should thank Cooper for ignoring him for long stretches because, given the direction things were heading on the Vegas stage, more time might not have helped Chafee’s Vindication Tour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:28:22.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
