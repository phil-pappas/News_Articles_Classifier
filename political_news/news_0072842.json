In addition to that the 2 rivers (1160 km length of Euphrates inside Iraq, and 1400 km for Tigress inside Iraq) supplying enough quantity of water needed for agriculture, with enough water in reservoirs.\nThe third important point is the wide range of medium and light industry that fits the internal needs, I can mention here: petrochemicals, textile factories, vegetable oils, detergents, drug industries, domestic apparatuses such as refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, heaters, radios, in addition to that: carpets factories, sugar factories, food canning factories, fertilizers, . etc. What else can be considered as a strength point in Iraq?\nAn army with a huge arsenal? Enough number of well trained pilots with enough number of jet fighters? Civil squadrons of airplanes with well trained pilots? A huge army of engineers, doctors, and academic professionals? Sober and serious universities? Good infrastructure? Governmental establishments with minimum disemployment? A good financial balance of gold and foreign currency in governmental banks with serious and sober banking system? A deep historical heritage? A number of good universities with sober staff masters? What more?\nNow let`s go back firstly to the 8 years Iraq-Iran war and check, we will see a mill for both countries armies with burning billions and billions of dollar without any real winner. Then in the second war after Iraq invaded Kuwait we will see another mill burning and destroying the big military arsenal of Iraq rather than the army itself. One of my relatives told me some strange story, he, with other 3 soldiers, was fighting in a tank near Basra (south of Iraq) then saw an American helicopter pilot waving to them to leave the tank, then attacked the tank with a rocket after they had left it running away of the tank. I heard same similar stories from more than one in different battles. What did that mean? This war was a mill for the military arsenal. Putting in mind attacking the infrastructure specially bridges, roads, factories, refineries, oil producing fields, electrical power plants etc. this will lead also that infrastructure destroying is a part of destroying the important strength power of Iraq.\nAt embargo period, specially the nineties, I was in my town Hilla (in the middle of Iraq) watching with a big surprise the trains going south with a number of date palms, then the surprise disappeared after knowing that Iraqi farmers sold the trees to Gulf countries to face the embargo crisis, if we knew Iraq was having 32 million fruitful date trees, now less than 8 million, we understand what a big loss.\nDuring the comic tragedy embargo novel and the smart sanctions, Iraq prevented from importing the technology, under reason of preventing Saddam from having the mass destruction weapons, and later all the world recognized that Iraq is empty of these weapons, all this led to a secret victory for America and alliances, that is most of Iraqis was under a huge pressure to accept any new regime instead of Saddam, but the result was a new corrupted politicians that stolen billions and billions invested out of Iraq leaving the country without any infrastructural investment.\nIt happened twice during American forces invasion of Iraq, I noticed the American soldiers watching and encouraging urchins stealing money from banks, heritages from museums, and Specialist machines from factories. Was it kind of destruction? Of course it`s a kind of compulsory programmed destruction.\nLowering the prices of global market prices of oil led by the USA and Saudi Arabia, contributed to a huge inability of governmental budget of Iraq, especially with a bleeding war with ISIS that needs more money to cover this war. Emptying Iraq from the main power is running gradually.\nAfter Saddam regime dropped, Iraq passed a critical period by assassination of many pilots who shared attacking Iran during the Iraq-Iran war period in eighties, one friend of mine explained this as a revenge of Iran, but that was half of the truth, Iran is a main player in region, overcoming a weak country (like Iraq) is easier than strong one----;---- pilots are part of strong Iraq! Iraq is the forehead defense line that Iran defend itself! Followed this assassination of high ranked officials, DG`s, engineers, doctors, . Etc. then emptying the country from the elite.\nNow turning back to Turkey huge dams on Euphrates and Tigress, plus the big crises of water leakage in the 2 rivers in Iraq, created big problems in agriculture (Iraq now imports most needs of vegetables and strategic crops), big problems in environment (destroying marsh lands in south and affecting the wild life of birds and animals), big pollution of water (causing health problems to people), reducing saved quantities of water in resorviors then reducing electricity production in hydro power plants, etc. what is happening? Stealing another strength point in Iraq?\nAfter Saddam regime dropping, new phenomena appeared in Iraq, that is investing in high education by establishing private colleges and universities feed the governmental establishments and enterprises with graduates with a very bad levels, then affecting the quality of governmental achievement, in other way issuing laws that allow every official to study and upgrade his degree! More money added to his salary for nothing! It`s kind of disemployment that I mentioned in an article (in Arabic), is it kind of destruction?\nThe most dangerous step for destroying Iraq, is trying to destroy its unity textile by seeding sectarianism seeds and let people fight each other.\nWhat for all this is happening? This issue needs a separate article.", "external_links": ["http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/translate_beta_res.gif", "http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.ahewar.org/eng/show.art.asp%3Ft%3D0%26aid%3D2172&langpair=en%7Car&hl=en&ie=UTF8"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:51:39.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
