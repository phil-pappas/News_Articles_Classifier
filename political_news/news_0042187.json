Carson has plenty of company on the right among misquoters with Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker and Rand Paul all joining him. Gosh, even John Oliver has been misquoted. That is the problem with memes. If you have the right font and the right photo, any quote can seem real, Oliver said. And Ill tell you how I know that. Because for years now you may have seen multiple photos of me comparing gun control to airport security. Its an interesting thought. Heres the thing: I never said that! Even though, Ive now seen it so many times now Im starting to genuinely wonder if I ever did. A favorite historical figure to misquote is Abraham Lincoln. Here, Democrats are just as bad as Republicans. Presidents Clinton, Reagan and Obama have all mis-attributed just made up Lincoln quotes wholesale. So, helpfully, since actual truth does not seem so popular anymore, Oliver set up a website for the misquoters to consult for their made-up quotes. Definitelyrealquyotes.com, Have to be careful. Politicians lie to win. IT's part of the Machivallian born again evangelical plan that says the end justifies the means; the presidency makes it okay for me to lie to the American people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:40:14.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
