They found some documents in some files and they carted them away.” \nA top operative of the EFCC, who spoke to Punch on Saturday, said the SOCA team had been involved in a discreet investigation of Alison-Madueke for two months before they finally moved against her. \nIt was further gathered that the team from SOCA had been working alongside a team of EFCC operatives from the Subsidy Unit led by a Chief Superintendent of Police. \nThe EFCC team was constituted in August 2015 by its Chairman the activities of Alison-Madueke and some top officials of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC. \nThe SU team was mandated to probe all the accounts of the NNPC under the supervision of Diezani. \nThe intensified investigation into the activities of the former minister was being supervised by Lamorde and the Director of Operations of the EFCC, Olusola Adegbite. \nSome operatives from the subsidy unit of the EFCC carried out the operation at Alison-Madueke’s Asokoro residence in Abuja, following her arrest on Friday. \nAn operative of the commission, who spoke on condition of anonymity, disclosed that the EFCC’s subsidy team ransacked the residence of the former minister for several hours. \nThe source said, “When our operatives got there, there was nobody in the building. What they did was to get the security men who were working with her to guide them through the building.” \nEx-minister’s probe began in 2013: The NCA has revealed that the corruption investigation leading to the arrest of Nigeria’s former Petroleum Minister started in 2013, as soon as they started observing huge money leaving Nigeria secretly.
