In July, the seven-year-old from Taber, AB joined Winnipeg Blue Bombers Rory Kohlert and Moe Leggett to film a new War Amps PLAYSAFE public service announcement. The PSA will begin airing Saturday, October 10 during TSN's football telecasts and will continue through the CFL® Playoffs and the Grey Cup®.\nFor more than 30 years, The War Amps and the Canadian Football League have shared a special tradition – the annual CFL PLAYSAFE PSA, saluting the League's support of The War Amps kids-to-kids safety program. The connection goes back to the days when the late Karl Hilzinger was The War Amps CHAMP Sports Consultant. \"Karlo\" was a CFL all-star who played for the Ottawa Rough Riders in the '50s. A car accident left him a double-leg amputee. He became an inspiration to Champs and was well-known as the silver-suited skier in War Amps public service announcements. The War Amps and the CFL have been working together ever since to increase awareness of The War Amps PLAYSAFE Program.\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C8244&Transmission_Id=201510051011CANADANWWEB______C8244&DateId=20151005", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:30:04.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
