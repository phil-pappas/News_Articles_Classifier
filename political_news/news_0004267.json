It will take about 100 tanker trucks to transport the gasoline to Kathmandu, Nepal's capital.\nIt would be the first time Nepal would be getting fuel from China. The countries share a border that has the world's highest mountains, but two border crossings were damaged by an April earthquake. One of the crossings reopened this month.\nMadhesi ethnic groups have been protesting in southern Nepal against the country's new constitution for weeks, blocking essential supplies from India.\nNepal usually gets all of its fuel from India, which has close cultural ties with the Madhesis.\nProtesters have blocked a key Nepal-India border point for weeks. Other crossing points are free of protesters, but India has refused to allow a normal supply of fuel to Nepal.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:15:05.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
