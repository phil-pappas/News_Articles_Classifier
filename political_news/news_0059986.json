Hugh Thompson Rice illustrated that best Wednesday. The South Carolina Republican challenged EPA assistant administrator Mathy Stanislaus, attempting to show that the EPA has not held anyone accountable for the 3 millon gallon toxic waste-water spill.\nRice also sought to illustrate the need for stronger federal bonding requirements for mines on federal lands. He argued that adequate bonding would ensure enough money was offered upfront by mining companies to make cleanup possible at places such as the Gold King Mine, where the spill originated.\nRice's exchange got a little slap happy at times, however, with a slightly agitated Stanislaus trying to respond.\nThe exchange is detailed below:\n\nRice: \"Let me ask you this: since there is no accountability in this administration, was anybody fired for this 3 million [gallon] spill of toxic chemicals into this river.\"\n\nStanislaus: \"From an accountability perspective, we have done an internal review … .\" Cut off by Rice, who asked \"was anybody fired?\"\n\nStanislaus: \"No.\"\n\nRice: \"Was anybody disciplined?\"\n\nStanislaus: \"Well again, so we're waiting for an independent investigation by the Department of Interior and the Office of the Inspector General to determine whether … or not ... .\" Cut off by Rice, again.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Treasury, IRS lay out tax rules for same-sex couples following court ruling With the rules, a marriage of two people of the same sex will also be recognized for federal tax purposes.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/21/15 5:22 PM On bonding:\n\nRice: \"I wouldn't have to give you sufficient bond? Surely to God, I would have to do that\" if mining on federal property? \"It's really not a problem for new mines, is it? What about continuously open mines ... , surely they have set aside money?\"\n\nStanislaus: \"I wouldn't know that.\"\n\nRice: \"Gosh, you're the EPA, you don't know that!??\n\nStanislaus: trying to answer, but cut off. Rice: \"What do you do 9 to 5? (chuckling).\"\n\nStanislaus: \"I'm sorry?\"; Rice: (laughing); Stanislaus: \"I'm sorry (appearing a bit agitated at hearing the remark)? I couldn't hear you.\"\n\nRice: (trying to compose himself) \"I want to avoid this problem happening again. Surely the EPA is not going to let people open these mines and create these toxic situations without putting aside adequate reserves to close the mine.\"\n\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Biden decision leaves both parties in disarray The voters this year don't seem to be putting a high value on Biden's greatest strength: experience.\nBy Michael Barone • 10/21/15 5:21 PM Top Story CIA head wanted Colin Powell to negotiate with Iran John Brennan, in 2007, thought the next president should \"tone down the rhetoric\" used with Iran.\nBy Rudy Takala • 10/21/15 4:33 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:02:32.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
