He would \"love\" to see Roe v. Wade , the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion in 1973, overturned. Carson opposes abortion even in instances of rape or incest, saying that ​there are \"many stories of people who have led very useful lives who were the result of rape or incest.\"​ He'd only be willing to consider exceptions in the \"​extraordinarily rare situation​\" in which complications with pregnancy put the mother's life in danger. According to the CDC, about 650 women die due to pregnancy or child-birth related complications annually, a number that would be much higher if women were denied abortions.\n Carson believes that an infant's life begins at conception — a view that has no scientific or factual backing, but has garnered major support on moral grounds among right-wing conservatives and religious groups. When Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked whose rights are more important, the mother's or the unborn child's, Carson said the problem is that \"the mother should not believe that the baby is her enemy and should not be looking to terminate her baby.\"\n \"Things are set up in such a way that the person in the world who has the greatest interest in protecting her baby is the mother,\" he said.\nHe then likened women who wish to terminate their pregnancies as slave owners:\n\"Think about this,\" he told Todd. \"During slavery — and I know that's one of those words you're not supposed to say, but I'm saying it. During slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave. Anything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionists had said, 'I don't believe in slavery, I think it's wrong, but you guys do whatever you want to do.' Where would we be?​\"\nAbortion is not the only thing Carson thinks is promoting slavery. In 2013, he condemned President Obama's Affordable Care Act as \"the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\"​\nFollow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/the-life-of-the-mother/", "http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/pregnancy-relatedmortality.htm", "https://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php/articles/5639", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/15/opinion/ben-carson-is-wrong-on-guns-and-the-holocaust.html?_r=0"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:32:58.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
