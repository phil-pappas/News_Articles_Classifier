Traditionally they are held by Republicans, and incumbent Councilmen David Oh and Dennis O'Brien are hoping that holds true.\nBut a contingent of outsider candidates is working against the tide, trying to capture the same wave that in the May 19 primary led to the ouster of two Democratic councilmen who had party backing.\n\"A few non-machine candidates got through on that side,\" Andrew Stober, who is running as an independent, said last week to a group of voters gathered at a Society Hill house party. \"There is really a moment here where people are getting fed up with the machine. And I want to show people of all political stripes that there is a path to being elected that's not about coming out of either party machine.\"\nMore coverage Council creates more CC living space The makeup of the next Council class was, for all intents and purposes, mostly decided in the primary. Among the 10 district Council seats, three are contested in the general election, but none hotly.\nOf the seven at-large positions, five will likely be filled by Democrat nominees, due to the party's overwhelming registration advantage in the city. They are incumbents Blondell Reynolds Brown and William Greenlee, and challengers Derek Green, Helen Gym, and Alan Domb, all winners in the same primary that cost incumbents Ed Neilson and Wilson Goode their seats.\nThe real contest is for the two remaining at-large seats.\nNine people are vying for those spots, five of them Republicans who won ballot positions in the primary. They are incumbents Oh and O'Brien; and challengers Terry Tracy, a former executive at Ralph Lauren who once ran for city controller; Daniel Tinney, a financial adviser turned construction worker; and Al Taubenberger, longtime head of the Greater Northeast Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce and a former GOP mayoral candidate.\nThe third-party hopefuls are Stober, who stepped down as chief of staff of Mayor Nutter's transportation office to run; Kristin Combs, a science teacher and member of the Green Party; Sheila Armstrong, a North Philadelphia activist running as an independent; and John Staggs, a Walmart employee and member of the Socialist Workers Party.\nOf course, many have envisioned the same path those candidates do, only to be rejected by voters in a city where party and ward-level political machines still rule on election day - especially when turnout is low.\nOn Nov. 3, voters who do go to the polls can vote for as many as five at-large Council candidates.\nSoft support from GOP The race among minority-party candidates this year has an unusual wrinkle: While Oh and O'Brien are fighting to hold their seats, the Republican party, at least officially, is doing little to help.\nThe party didn't endorse in the primary, and its decision to back all five Republicans in the general election - when only two realistically have a shot - doesn't speak well for the incumbents.\nOh has been in hot water this election cycle, notably when the city Board of Ethics said he had orchestrated an illegal campaign contribution from a supporter and fined him $2,000. (Oh paid the fine and said he had misunderstood the law, not intentionally broken it.) He and O'Brien have also been criticized by some fellow Republicans for too often voting in step with the Democratic majority on Council.\nO'Brien \"went along to get along with the Democrats,\" Mike Cibik, Republican Fifth Ward leader, said of the decision to not endorse. \"I don't think David was quite as significant in going along to get along as Denny. But there wasn't an overwhelming enthusiasm for David Oh.\"\nOh said he's not concerned about the sentiment because he doesn't think it's one voters share.\n\"I've been sometimes with the majority, sometimes against the majority, and sometimes on my own,\" he said. \"But I have tried to work in a practical way on things that will help the people in our city.\"\nO'Brien, a former state legislator who four years ago won his Council seat without the GOP nod, said he, too, isn't worried about the lack of endorsement. And he said he isn't convinced enough voters will buck tradition and vote for third-party candidates to cause a problem for him.\nWill anyone deviate? \"Fundamentally, I question whether Democrats will deviate and vote for an independent or whether Republicans will deviate,\" he said.\nStober, whose entrance has enlivened an otherwise low-key race, is hoping otherwise. The lifelong Democrat opted against a run in the party's crowded primary and instead is vying for a minority seat as an independent.\nHaving moved to Philadelphia from Colorado in 2008 to work in the Nutter administration, Stober has proven to have more fund-raising prowess than the Republican challengers. He raked in about $87,000 by the mid-September filing deadline, $40,000 ahead of his nearest rival.\nBut experts say the amount is likely short of what Stober needs to overcome his lack of name recognition in a low-turnout election.\n\"The low-information voters are his worst enemy,\" said Joe Corrigan, a political consultant. \"People who don't know they can vote for an independent. People who don't understand that even though he's an independent, he still represents what Democrats want. And he does not, unfortunately, have the money to tell that story.\"\nThat's not to say he doesn't have a shot, according to consultant Larry Ceisler.\nCeisler said that as the number of registered Republicans has fallen, chances for third-party candidates winning the minority seats on Council have improved.\n\"Because one can make the argument, really, who is the minority?\" he said. \"Is a minority independents? Is a minority Republicans?\"\ntnadolny@phillynews.com\n215-854-2730\n@TriciaNadolny", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:54:54.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
