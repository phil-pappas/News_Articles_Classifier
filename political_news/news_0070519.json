He argued that the country has never recorded 100 turnout in any election, which means printing the exact voter number would be enough to cater for spoilt ballots. \nHe reiterated his appeal to political parties and Ghanaians in general to view ongoing proposals for reforms as “purely a national issue” that would not benefit any particular party. \nThe New Patriotic Party, Convention People’s Party and the Progressive People’s Party have been emphatic the current register is bloated and must be changed. \nThey contend that the credibility of next year’s poll hinge on a new electoral roll. \nHowever, the NDC joined by the People’s National Convention said a review and a cleanup of the register must be the way to go instead of replacing it with an entirely new one. \nToday's meeting was called by the Commission to discuss the about 30 proposals submitted by various parties and groups on the voters’ register and other matters with the political parties. \nCommission Chairperson, Mrs Charlotte Osei, told journalists proposals had been received, 15 of them from political parties and the remaining ones from civil society organizations and individuals. \nShe said a public forum would be held in October to discuss all the proposals submitted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:17:49.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
