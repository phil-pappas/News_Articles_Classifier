The states say the rule will cause higher electricity rates and hurt the coal-mining industry.\nPresident Barack Obama’s plan requiring states to generate 28 percent of their electrical capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar was expected to face legal challenges.\n“EPA claims to have sweeping power to enact such regulations based on a rarely used provision of the Clean Air Act, but such legal authority simply does not exist,” West Virginia AG Patrick Morrisey said in a statement.\nMorrisey argues that the rule is illegal in part because it seeks to regulate coal-fired power plants under one segment of the Clean Air Act, although it already regulates those plants under another section of the statute.\nThe other states joining the challenge are Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin, Wyoming, the Arizona Corporations Commission and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.\nThe Obama administration and environmental advocates say the regulations are needed to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nA dozen states including New York said Friday they anticipate getting involved next week in the litigation in defense of the clean power plan.\n“We believe there’s no merit to the argument that EPA had to make a choice between regulating toxic emissions from power plants to address problems such as mercury contaminated fish, or regulating greenhouse gases from those same power plants to address harms associated with climate change,” Michael J. Myers, New York assistant attorney general in the Environmental Protection Bureau, told reporters on a call.\n“Those are two very different problems and it doesn’t make sense that Congress would have tasked EPA with addressing one of those problems, but not the other.”\nmburke@detroitnews.com \n(202) 662-8736", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:43:09.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
