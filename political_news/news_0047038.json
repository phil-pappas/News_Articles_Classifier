Photo Reuters The Government is being urged to keep up the pressure on Australia to change its deportation policy. \nThe detention of New Zealanders in Australia - some on isolated Christmas Island near Indonesia - was expected to be high on the agenda during Malcolm Turnbull's first international visit as Prime Minister to New Zealand at the weekend. \nBut Mr Turnbull wasn't prepared to entertain any talk of scrapping or substantially changing the controversial measure. \nGreen Party human rights spokesperson Catherine Delahunty says all options should be on the table. \nShe says our Government first needs to spell out the problems to Australia, then consider stronger diplomatic measures. \nMr Turnbull says more consideration will be given to New Zealanders in detention centres - but that's as far as he went. \nPolitical commentator David Slack says it might seem a change of tone from the Australian government, but there's no change in sentiment. \nHe says New Zealanders are being taken for saps and we need to be doing what's in our best interest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:14:40.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
