Otherwise your whole operation is compromised.” \nShaikh, who recounted his experiences in the memoir “Underground Jihadi: Inside the Toronto 18,” said there are a number of tactics to find out whether someone is an extremist or potential extremist. \nIn one approach, Shaikh would ask the suspect whether he would be interested in attending a “(terror) training camp,” with the phrasing kept vague. View gallery Mubin Shaikh, a former Canadian counterterrorism operative who has worked undercover, said operative … \n“If I say the exact same thing to somebody else and he says ‘yeah, I do wanna go and train them,’ that’s you getting caught, that’s not entrapment,” Shaikh said. \n“If that suggestion is well within the operational doctrine of that group, that’s not entrapment, it’s like a dangle. You’re hooking somebody — it’s like fishing.” \n– Focus on Islamic State – \nUndercover agents are now heavily focused on identifying sympathizers of the self-proclaimed Islamic State group that has overtaken large swathes of Syria and Iraq. \nEarlier this month, FBI Director James Comey said counterterrorism investigators had followed “dozens and dozens” of suspected militants around the United States this summer and disrupted “many” of them. \nShaikh, a Muslim himself, acknowledged that with the high visibility of violent extremists who claim they are acting in the name of Islam today, “the Muslim community is completely under siege.” \n“Now the trust is really ruined,” he added. \nThe problem is that in some operations, undercover agents set traps that, at times, appear to force the hand of suspects in their sights. \nThe topic is the focus of “(T)ERROR,” a documentary that debuted at this year’s Sundance independent film festival. View gallery FBI Director James Comey has said counterterrorism investigators had followed “dozens and dozen … \nThe film, which scored a Break Out First Feature award at the festival, provides an unprecedented behind-the-scenes view of a counterterrorism sting over a two-year period. \nThese cases are not without controversy. \nIn one, the so-called Fort Dix Five group of alleged extremist men were said to have plotted to stage an attack on the US military base of the same name in New Jersey. \nFive of the original group of six were found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and four got sentenced to life in prison, including three Albanian brothers. \nBefore their 2007 arrest, they were placed under surveillance for a year and half after they had recorded vacation video footage of themselves shooting weapons in the countryside while shouting “Allahu Akbar.” \nCritics accuse the FBI of entrapment, saying FBI informants pushed the men to action. \nMahmoud Omar, an Egyptian-born informant in the case, maintains that the Dukas brothers are innocent. \n“I still don’t know why the Dukas are in jail,” he told The Intercept in June. \nThe FBI acknowledges that using informants in investigations “may involve an element of deception, intrusion into the privacy of individuals, or cooperation with persons whose reliability and motivation may be open to question.” \nHowever, the bureau is quick to add, the courts have recognized that the use of informants is “lawful and often essential.” \nIn addition, the FBI says, “special care is taken to carefully evaluate and closely supervise their use so the rights of individuals under investigation are not infringed.” \n– Terrorists or just losers? – \nMore often than not, these allegedly radicalized Americans are just youths with low self-esteem who, online, find a reason to exist, observers say. \nTake the example of Joshua Ryne Goldberg, a 20-year-old Jewish man living with his parents in Florida who had invented a second life on the Internet where he presented himself as living in Australia and flooded social networks with pro-jihad messages. \nHe was arrested last month after allegedly distributing information about bomb-making techniques. He faces 20 years in prison. \nIn Virginia, teenager Ali Amin was sentenced to 11 years in prison for using social media to support the Islamic State. \nAmin, 17, is the first minor to be prosecuted by the United States in a terrorism support case. \nShaikh called his case “tragic.” \nBut “when you have those guys online, preaching the ISIS message, trying to indoctrinate people, trying to recruit people, getting them themselves to do something, shouldn’t we do something about that?” Society & Culture", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:37:43.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
