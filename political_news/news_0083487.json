And voilà: the shot booms.\nThis being the 21st century, a pastiche of Beethoven’s and Schiller’s Ode to Joy is playing in the background, affirming the suicide’s undying “celebration” of the “European values” of “unity in diversity, freedom, peace, and solidarity.” Which would have been great, had the diversity not been artificially torqued to include at least 50 million aliens from all corners of the Third World. The great majority of whom are unalterably alien and unabsorbable Muslims.\nNow even that has been superseded by prostration before a drowning tide of “refugees” from Africa and the Middle East — mostly Muslims, too. Muslims that Europe has fought at least ten major wars between AD 711 and 1699 to keep out of Europe, not counting dozens of bloody regional wars that individual nations had to wage to protect themselves from Islamic aggression, e.g. Russia (nine wars with Turkey alone ending 1878), Poland, Hungary, Byzantium, Greece, Cyprus, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania and others.\nAll that is accompanied by massive propaganda, lying, obfuscation, subterfuge, blackmail of dissenters and sheer terror at the hand of the states’ and EU’s ruling elites, hired “anti-racist” hounds, journalists groomed by postmodern Marxist mentors, freelance Antifa shock troops, and their Muslim allies. The psychotic illusion started long ego, when Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi’s foisted his European Union “dream” onto the European elite in the 1920s. The elite then foisted it on a bamboozled population, beginning in the 1950s-60s (see Jean Monnet, Giscard d’Estaing, Helmut Kohl and others) [1] .\nMore @ Gates of Vienna", "external_links": ["http://gatesofvienna.net/2015/09/a-nightmare-reborn/", "http://gatesofvienna.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cropped-viennaheader1000.jpg", "http://freenorthcarolina.blogspot.com//feeds/posts/https://westernrifleshooters.wordpress.com/"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:48:55.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
