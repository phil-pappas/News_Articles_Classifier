Look at how the jackedbooted thug ran into Mr Shao Jiang obviously with the intention to knock him down but it seems he hadnt had enough of the stuff from Greggs that morning so Mr Shao Jiang stayed on his feet.Why was so much brute force used by the policeman? All he had to do was pull him not run into him helmet first.Why did the Met need to search Mr Shao Jiang's home? All he did was stand in the middle of a London road with signs held up. The chap that got into fisty cuffs with our deputy PM a while back wasnt even arrested. What was the justification for going to his home. His 'crime' was clear for everyone to see. It required no further investigation so why didnt they just charge him.... A fishing expedition perhaps.How can we encourage people to do things like Mr Shao Jiang did in Tianamen Square but arrest them when they do the same in London?Looking at the bail conditions set for Mr Shao Jiang, it is obvious that it had nothing to do with preventing a crime but all to do with protecting an evil vile dictator.A complete disgrace I cannot comment on 'our resident expert' however, I tend to agree with your point of view on this one EClassy. It's devastating to see such measures taken against someone of 'political importance'. The chap should have been able to protest peacefully, and if necessary be moved to allow the cars through, but house search etc.? shameful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:44:14.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
