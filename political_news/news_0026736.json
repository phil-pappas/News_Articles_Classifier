Brooks’ defense team says he was just a lousy bookkeeper who focused more on his mission than on finances. \nBrooks, 70, a civil rights activist since his teens and state lawmaker since 1981, pleaded guilty in April to one count of filing a false tax document and no contest to five counts of mail and wire fraud. He’s set for sentencing Nov. 2. In court filings, federal prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg to send the Atlanta Democrat to prison for two years and order him to pay restitution. His attorneys asked for five years’ probation. \nAs a lawmaker, Brooks was best known for his nearly two-decades struggle to remove the Confederate battle cross from Georgia’s state flag, which saw success in 2001. He also prodded federal authorities to reopen an investigation into an infamous 1946 lynching of four people at Moore’s Ford in Walton County. \nWhile prosecutors acknowledged his decades of good work, they said he misused that legacy. \n“(T)he fact that he has positively impacted so much in Georgia is undeniable,” prosecutors wrote. “Unfortunately, it was precisely this reservoir of credibility and goodwill that Brooks actively traded on to perpetrate his fraudulent schemes.” \nBrooks raised more than $1 million through Universal Humanities - a tax-exempt organization he founded in 1990 - which he said ran a statewide program called Visions of Literacy, prosecutors said. He sent fundraising letters to donors, including Georgia Pacific and Coca-Cola, seeking donations to help fight illiteracy. \nBut an investigation revealed none of the money went toward teaching students to read, prosecutors wrote. The investigation also revealed none of the prominent figures listed as members of the board of directors on the organization’s letterhead had heard of Universal Humanities, they wrote. \nBrooks became president of the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials in 1994. He created a new bank account in the organization’s name and didn’t tell the board, prosecutors wrote. He deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars from donors into that account and transferred the money to his own account, noting on the checks that they were reimbursements for expenses related to literacy training, voter education and anti-crime efforts, they wrote. \nBrooks also filed false income tax returns in which he intentionally omitted between $52,850 and $96,935 each year for at least five years, prosecutors wrote. \nHe deserves prison time partly because he has failed to accept responsibility, prosecutors say. They cited his claims that his prosecution was part of a government effort to discredit his civil rights work. \nBrooks’ attorneys, who include former Gov. Roy Barnes, argued in their filing that Brooks tirelessly pursued multiple noble causes and solicited funds to advance those efforts. But he had no financial or business training and unwisely comingled his own money with donated funds, failing to keep records to show he was operating in good faith, they argued. \nSome of Brooks’ letters may have been misleading about the progress or scope of the programs, but his donors gave because they knew he was always working on civil rights matters and they supported the broad spectrum of issues he fought for rather than a specific cause, his lawyers wrote. \nThey said his donors never complained or questioned, and even those who told the FBI they wouldn’t have donated if they knew some of the money was used to pay personal expenses would likely have been fine with it if they realized Brooks wasn’t drawing a salary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:53:50.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
