Scott Walker appointed conservative-backed appellate judge Rebecca Bradley to the Wisconsin Supreme Court on Friday, giving her the advantage of incumbency heading into the spring election.\nWalker introduced Bradley at a news conference Friday, formalizing a widely expected move first reported by The Associated Press earlier in the day.\nBradley, who had previously announced she was running for a full 10-year term on the court, will fill out the final nine months of Justice Patrick Crooks' term. He died in office last month.\nThe appointment expands conservatives' grip on the high court to 5-2. It also allows Bradley to run for the April 5 election as the incumbent. Two other candidates — 4th District Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg and Milwaukee Circuit Judge Joe Donald — did not apply for the vacancy.\nKloppenburg and Donald did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\nThe primary Feb. 16 will whittle the field down to two candidates who will then face each other in the April 5 general election. The term begins in August, when Bradley's temporary appointment ends.\nWalker's decision to appoint Bradley to the officially nonpartisan court was expected, given that he had previously named her to two other judicial posts and her run for the Supreme Court was backed by conservatives who also support Walker.\nTwo other applicants for the temporary appointment, Dane County Circuit Judge Jim Troupis and Madison attorney Claude Covelli, didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. Walker in May appointed Troupis, an attorney who previously worked for Republicans, to his current position.\nWalker first appointed Bradley, 44, to the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in 2012. She won election in 2013. In May, Walker named her to the state appeals court.\nKloppenburg, whose campaign is backed by liberals, previously ran for the Supreme Court in 2011 and lost to Justice David Prosser. Donald argued that he would be the most nonpartisan choice for the high court.\nDemocrats criticized Walker's pick in swiftly issued statements.\nSen. Jen Shilling, the Democratic minority leader, said Walker injected more politics into the Supreme Court.\n\"This power grab sets a terrible precedent and doesn't pass the smell test,\" Shilling said.\nScot Ross, executive director of the liberal group One Wisconsin Now, said, \"This appointment is about one thing only, allowing Rebecca Bradley and the special interests who will spend on her behalf in exchange for her fealty to use the words 'Supreme Court Justice' in front of her name when they run their campaign ads.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:12:12.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
