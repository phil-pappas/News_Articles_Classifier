I would say, 'Hey guys, everybody attack him.' He may shoot me, but he can't get all of us,\" Carson told Fox News . \nCarson also elaborated on his gun views in a Q-and-A on Facebook earlier this week. \nCarson was asked if the Oregon shooting had changed his position on the Second Amendment. He responded by sharing his personal experience with gun violence growing up in the \"slums of Detroit,\" as well as his experience as a doctor seeing victims of gun violence. (Video via C-SPAN ) \nHe said in the post, \"I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.\" \nCarson went on to criticize the Left for using mass shootings to advance a political agenda. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:17:57.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
