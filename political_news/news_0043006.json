I don't even understand how you could get mauled by a bear. I mean, seriously. It's not like they are phantoms that just magically appear behind you. Can't people see a bear? What are they doing to get mauled? The article only mentioned 3 women attacked by bears. There were a lot of dead bears, though. If you get within a mile of her damn cubs, the mother bear will maul you to death.
