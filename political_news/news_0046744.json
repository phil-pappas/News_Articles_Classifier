Paul Ryan has headed off congressional chaos by agreeing to run for speaker of the House of Representatives , the second most powerful political position in the country. Will the Wisconsin Republican, who has cited both Jack Kemp and Ayn Rand as influences, end up being one of the House’s best bosses? Time will tell. In the meantime, let’s consider 9 of the most memorable speakers in U.S. history… Paul Ryan (Photos: AP) Henry Clay (speaker: 1811-13, 1815-21, 1823-25) \nTemperamental and hyper-partisan early in his career, Clay later became known as The Great Compromiser . He helped craft both the 1820 Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850, both of which forestalled the country’s final reckoning over slavery. Abraham Lincoln called him “my beau ideal of a statesman.” Schuyler Colfax (1863-69) \nNicknamed “Smiler,” the bearded Hoosier was a proud Know Nothing before joining the Republican Party. Lincoln opposed Colfax for the speakership, considering him too radical (that is, too anti-slavery) and a “little intriguer.” He served as Ulysses S. Grant’s first vice president, but he became enmeshed in the Credit Mobilier scandal and was not offered re-nomination in 1872. Thomas Reed (1889-91, 1895-99) \nAs speaker, the Maine Republican was called “Czar Reed,” which was fine with him. He pushed through a series of parliamentary changes known as “Reed’s Rules” to keep obstructionism at bay. He explained : “Rules should not be barriers. They should be guides.” When asked if his party’s delegates should choose him as their 1896 presidential candidate, he said: “They could do worse, and they probably will.\" He didn’t get the nomination. Nicholas Longworth (1925-31) \nHe’s best known as the husband of Alice Roosevelt , Theodore’s wild daughter. The Ohio Republican was a highly successful womanizer, and Alice reciprocated. The daughter she and Nicholas raised, Paulina Longworth, was the result of Alice’s affair with Sen. William Borah. As speaker, Longworth worked closely with Democratic House minority leader John Nance Garner. “I was the heathen and Nick was the aristocrat,” Garner said of their working relationship. John Nance Garner (1931-33) \n“Cactus Jack” founded a congressional drinking club during Prohibition. He was rewarded by being elected speaker. The Texan became FDR's first vice president, but he soon wished he had remained in the House. Garner declared that the veep job was “not worth a bucket of warm spit.” He broke with Roosevelt over the New Deal and was booted to the curb. He called the vice presidency “the worst thing that ever happened to me.” Garner, left, with FDR Sam Rayburn (1940-47, 1949-53, 1955-61) \nThe pragmatic Texas Democrat was the longest-serving speaker ever. Most of his House colleagues called him “Mr. Speaker” or, if they knew him particularly well, “Mr. Sam.” He “relied mainly on persuasion and almost never on raw power to achieve his aims,” United Press International wrote upon his death in 1961. Still, his advice to new members was, “If you want to get along – go along.” Tip O’Neill (1977-87) \n“All politics is local,” his politician father told him, and he never forgot it . He backed President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs but opposed the Vietnam War. He didn’t like President Jimmy Carter and abhorred the priorities of President Ronald Reagan, but the Massachusetts liberal’s tenure as speaker is still considered successful. O'Neill with President Reagan and Vice President Bush Jim Wright (1987-91) \nO’Neill’s successor stepped into foreign affairs, negotiating a deal that led to elections in Nicaragua. But the Texas Democrat’s career came to an ignominious end when Republican colleague Newt Gingrich pushed an ethics investigation against him. Wright resigned rather than fight the accusations, saying he wanted to end the “mindless cannibalism” in the House. Sen. Robert Byrd, left, and Jim Wright Newt Gingrich (1995-99) \nCreator of the “Contract with America” and a highly combative approach to legislating, the Georgian became the first Republican speaker in 40 years. The former history professor reigned over a rancorous government shutdown and the even more rancorous Clinton impeachment proceedings. Facing his own ethics problems, which led to an official House reprimand, he resigned his seat in 1999. He later ran unsuccessfully for president.
