As incumbents they could expect to be placed at the top of the Tory list for 2016 without challenge.\nBut last night the party's board for South East Wales decided not to give them incumbency rights and opened up the selection process to other candidates.\nIt means William Graham and Mohammad Asghar could still win those top two spots, but so could any other would-be candidates.\nThe party's Welsh Board could overturn the decision but one source says that if that were to happen 'there would be a lot of unhappy people' amongst the region's Conservative activists.\nA Welsh Conservative spokesperson insisted that the decision was NOT a deselection:\nWilliam Graham and Mohammad Asghar continue to be involved in an on-going selection process for South Wales East. This will continue to be open and democratic, consistent with all Welsh Conservative selection procedures.\nâ€“ Welsh Conservative spokesperson William Graham isn't commenting this morning. I've approached Mohammad Asghar for a comment.\nI understand that party members have wanted to see new faces in the choice of candidates for some time but have been frustrated by sitting the refusal of sitting AMs to consider standing aside.\nParty leaders in Wales have also been frustrated in their attempts to persuade older members to make way for new blood.\nIn contrast, 9 Labour and 3 Plaid Cymru AMs have said that they'll stand down in May's election.\nLast updated Thu 15 Oct 2015 Politics William Graham Mohammad Asghar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:39:38.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
