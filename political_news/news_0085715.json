He loves to hang out with the poor. He washes the feet of the destitute. He spends time with people who have leprosy. In doing all this, he is following Jesus Christ's example.\nAnd he speaks truth to power. The pope is the world's best spokesperson on environmental and immigration issues. The challenge is for politicians in the United States and other world leaders to respond with real action.\nThe United States, Europe, India, China and other global powerhouses are the biggest polluters on the planet. And a number of countries have contributed to creating the instability that has caused the current refugee crisis.\nThe pope is teaching the world that greed destroys our environment.\n\"A selfish and boundless thirst for power and material prosperity leads both to the misuse of available natural resources and to the exclusion of the weak and disadvantaged,\" he said in his speech to the United Nations. \"Economic and social exclusion is a complete denial of human fraternity and a grave offense against human rights and the environment.\"\nImmigrants and refugees are suffering throughout the world, and Pope Francis is setting a great example that we have to \"love thy neighbor.\"\nHe is nudging the United States to advance on immigrant rights. It would be a momentous occasion if Congress were to favorably respond.\nOn the environmental front, the United States can set an example to the rest of the world by adopting the major resolutions that will be proposed at the climate conference taking place in Paris at the end of this year.\nLet all of us -- Catholic and otherwise -- pray for Pope Francis to be successful in his quest to truly change \"hearts and minds\" on the environment and immigrant rights. We cannot afford to wait any longer.\nAbout The Writer\nRandy Jurado Ertll (www.randyjuradoertll.com) is the executive director of the California Latino Environmental Advocacy Network, or CLEAN, and author of \"Hope in Times of Darkness: A Salvadoran American Experience\" and other books.\nHe wrote this for Progressive Media Project, a source of liberal commentary on domestic and international issues; it is affiliated with The Progressive magazine.
