(AP) â€” Gov. Chris Christie says he's sorry for making too much noise on an Amtrak quiet car.\nChristie spokeswoman Samantha Smith says he accidentally took a seat in the quiet car while traveling from Washington on Sunday morning.\nSmith says after breaking \"the cardinal rule of the quiet car,\" Christie promptly left for the cafe car.\nShe says he was talking on a cell phone when a conductor pointed out it was the quiet car. Unaware of it, Christie told the caller he would call back after changing cars.\nSmith offered sincere apologies.\nConductors generally urge passengers to maintain a \"library-like atmosphere\" in the quiet car. It's not uncommon for conductors to ask noisier passengers to change cars.\nThe Republican presidential hopeful appeared on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" earlier Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:30:50.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
