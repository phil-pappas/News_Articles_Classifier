Photo: Michelle Smith\nMass online petitions can lead to \"terrible policy outcomes\" and politicians must resist the urge to respond by making policy on the fly, while the future of political organisation will be based around issues rather than left- or right-wing principles, a new book argues.\nFergus Hanson, a non-resident fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Internet Wars, says the web has allowed people to mobilise and aggregate \"human power\" in an unprecedented way.\n\"If politicians put the issues on the agenda and let people see that they're being discussed it can forestall very rushed decisions that don't lead to a very good outcome.\"\nFergus Hanson, author Internet Wars. And he says activist campaign groups like GetUp!, which began as a campaigning organisation but has since run a successful High Court challenge to the Electoral Laws and organised volunteers to man polling sites, could be the way of the future for political campaigns in Australia.\nSuper trawlers and petitions may not result in good policies. GP03QPJ(1).jpg\nMr Hanson says this shift is because the old Cold War left-right divide has evaporated, and voters are more likely to sign on to individual issues and causes rather than adopt a political side.\nAdvertisement \"What energises people are issues-based campaigns, they get fired-up about gay marriage, climate change, the Syrian campaign,\" he said.\n\"They don't always fall into a left-right basket,\" he said, but noted the issues were generally popular with younger voters.\nFergus Hanson says the web has allowed people to mobilise and aggregate \"human power\" in an unprecedented way. Photo: Paul Lovelace\nMr Hanson says the conservative side of politics has traditionally lagged in generating issues-based campaigns but says the US think-tank Heritage Foundation is one example where the right is closing the gap. \"It's just a matter of time until the conservative side of politics catches up,\" he said.\nMr Hanson urged politicians to resist the urge to respond to populist online petitions - commonly orchestrated in Australia through sites like Change.org and GetUp! - by making impromptu policy.\nHe warned that the organisations, by their nature, would select populist issues to campaign on, and said the best solution might not always be the most politically popular.\nHe cited the former Labor Government's decision in 2012 to ban a foreign super trawler from fishing off Tasmania in response to a Greenpeace campaign as one example of how appeasing a vocal minority led to bad policy.\n\"The campaign itself was targeting the state of the oceans, it wasn't even to do with the fishing quota sizes,\" he said. \"Essentially you end up with policymaking on the fly,\" he said.\nMr Hanson called for more scrutiny about who is behind petitions, whose voices are being heard, and whether or not they represent the majority.\n\"They need to resist the urge to get the issue out of their face,\" he said. But he also said politicians could be more proactive to prevent decision-making in a panic in the face of a public backlash.\n\"If politicians put the issues on the agenda and let people see that they're being discussed it can forestall very rushed decisions that don't lead to a very good outcome.\"\nFollow Latika Bourke on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/environment/conservation/super-trawler-banned-from-fishing-in-australian-waters-20120911-25q3i.html", "https://www.facebook.com/Latika-M-Bourke-132583706779458/"], "published": "2015-10-25T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:31:07.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
