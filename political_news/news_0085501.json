(Evan Habeeb/Getty Images) October 5 at 7:29 PM Sally Jenkins’s Oct. 1 Sports column, “ Gruden shows sense sticking with Cousins ,” noted “very concrete numerical reasons to be patient with Cousins.” There are also significant reasons Robert Griffin III should be the starter instead of Kirk Cousins: one Heisman Trophy, one first-round draft pick and one NFL rookie of the year award vs. zero for Mr. Cousins. A respected NFL head coach with multiple NFL championships selected RGIII and made him into a star player. Now Washington has a coach with one season as an NFL head coach having fans believe RGIII is not even worthy of being activated on game days.\nMany of us in the minority community know all too well within our professional careers what it is like when your contributions are discounted and your flaws are exaggerated. But to be humiliated, as RGIII is, by not being activated on game days is beyond the normal uneven treatment we’re typically required to tolerate.\nCarl D.
