The Summit gathered leaders from the government, private sector, academic, technical and scientific communities to focus on cross-sector efforts to tackle the climate change challenge here in the United States as well as on a global scale.\nSpecifically, the event focused on how to further efforts around carbon mitigation, sustainability, and resiliency, as well as how technologies are emerging to support and scale these efforts. Additionally, participants discussed how to further engage and organize in support of the upcoming COP21 Paris climate negotiations.\nAt the event, Tri Global Energy announced that it has joined the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, joining more than 60 companies from across the American economy that are standing with the Obama Administration to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to climate action and to voice support for a strong outcome to the COP21 Paris climate negotiations.\nTHE AMERICAN BUSINESS ACT ON CLIMATE PLEDGE:\nTri Global Energy applauds the growing number of countries that have already set ambitious targets for climate action. In this context, we support the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future.\nWe recognize that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters, and the health of the global environment.\nWe put forth our pledges as follows:\nTRI GLOBAL ENERGY â€“ AMERICAN BUSINESS ACT ON CLIMATE PLEDGE\nBuilding on the 6,200 megawatts of wind power projects that are now under development, under construction or in operation, Tri Global Energy is investing in renewable power diversification with the addition of a solar division and the acquisition of a solar energy company. Accordingly, we put forth our pledges as follows:\nInitiate development of an additional 600-900 megawatts of new utility-scale wind generation projects annually through 2018, not only in West Texas and Eastern New Mexico where TGE's 15 wind generation projects are located, but expanding our reach to locations across the U.S. Tri Global Energy is the leading developer of wind energy in Texas . Transition more than 500 megawatts of additional wind capacity into the construction and operations phase annually through 2018 thus increasing renewable capacity available for grid integration and electricity usage. Install solar photovoltaic systems on 1,000 commercial and 8,000 residential roof-tops over the next five years for homeowners, non-profit groups and other entities replacing the energy output of carbon-intense plants. About Tri Global Energy\nTri Global Energy (TGE) is a leading renewable energy company in the U.S. that develops clean energy by establishing wind and solar power projects.
