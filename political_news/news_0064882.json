The enrollment goal, released just weeks before the start of the next enrollment period on Nov. 1, is an acknowledgment that the next sign-up season will be Obamacare’s most challenging.\n“I’ve picked a point that we will manage for,” Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said on a call with reporters Thursday. “We believe 10 million is a strong and realistic goal.”\nThe administration expects low enrollment growth even as the law’s requirement for individuals to purchase coverage ramps up to full strength. The fine for not having coverage in 2016 jumps to $695 per person or 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is higher — that’s up from $325 or 2 percent of household income this year.\nPremiums for 2016 health plans still haven’t been released in full, but a varying picture has already emerged from states that finalized rates. Some states are projecting double-digit increases in 2016 plans, while others — like California and New York — have kept rate increases down in the single digits.\nLew says debt limit deadline is now Nov. 3 By John Bresnahan\nThe latest enrollment goal, for the second straight year, falls below predictions from the Congressional Budget Office, which previously estimated that 21 million would be signed up through the exchanges in 2016. The administration has said the CBO’s projections are off target because the nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, in part, predicted more workers would drop job-based coverage and get a plan on the law’s health insurance marketplaces. Instead, employer coverage has remained consistent in the first two years of the Affordable Care Act’s coverage expansion.\nHHS appears to be on track to meet its goal of having 9.1 million paid-exchange enrollees at the end of this year. Officials estimate that between 7.3 million and 8.8 million people will keep their coverage in 2016, and between 2.8 million and 3.9 million uninsured people will choose exchange plans for the first time. The administration previously said 10.5 million uninsured people are eligible for exchange coverage next year.\nThe administration expects anywhere between 11 million and 14.1 million people in all will select a plan in Obamacare's third enrollment period, which runs from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31. But some won’t pay their first month's premium, and others may drop out during the year because their income fluctuates or they sign up for job-based coverage.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43900-2015-03-ACAtables.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:15:40.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
