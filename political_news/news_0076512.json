The National General Council takes place every 5 years, mid-term between National Conferences, and is convened to assess implementation of ANC resolutions from conference, their adoption into government policy and translation into programmes. The NGC does not change policy, but reviews implementation of resolutions and can adjust programmes to deal with challenges and problems, and identify areas where new policy is needed. The 4th National General Council will be attended 4094 delegates with a minimum of 90% of these drawn from branches of the ANC as follows: Eastern Cape: 403 Free State: 165 Gauteng: 285 KwaZulu-Natal: 513 Limpopo: 275 Mpumalanga: 315 North West: 257 Northern Cape: 125 Western Cape: 162 Total branch delegates: 2500 Other categories of delegates include the Leagues of the ANC, Alliance Partners, the NEC, PECs and RECs and Umkhonto WeSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA). We are also honoured by the confirmation of attendance by Izithwalandwe Comrades Kathrada, Mlangeni and Mme Shope. Other stalwarts including members of the Integrity Committee have also been invited. As is the tradition within the ANC, we have also invited fraternal organisations, notably the Former Liberation Movements - MPLA (Angola), ZANU-PF (Zimbabwe), CCM (Tanzania), FRELIMO (Mozambique) and SWAPO (Namibia) who have confirmed their attendance. We also expect in attendance representatives of the BRICS embassies - Brazil, Russia, India and China. Cadres deployed in government and members of the business community make up the balance of delegates to the NGC. Delegates will be transported in 67 busses, all of which have already left the various provinces across the country. The first delegates arrived at 09h00 this morning. We are currently busy with the registration of delegations, following the pre-registration that have been done in provinces. We are pleased with the speedy and smooth registration that has characterized the accreditation and registration process thus far. This evening the Progressive Business Forum will host a Gala Dinner to be attended by business, members of the diplomatic corps, our international guests and leadership of the ANC. The NGC will be officially opened tomorrow, 9th October 2015 when the President of the ANC, Comrade Jacob Zuma, will deliver the political report. NGC will also receive the Organisational Report which will assess the state of the organisation, the functioning of our structures and progress made in the implementation of resolutions of the 53rd National Conference. The Treasurer-General will deliver the Financial Report to the NGC. The complete draft programme of the NGC is attached to this statement.
