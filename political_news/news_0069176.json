The upgrade by UC Davis Medical Center officials indicated that his vital signs are stable and normal and he is conscious.\nAirman 1st Class Spencer Stone, 23, \"is awake, able to get out of bed and in good spirits,\" the hospital said in a statement.\nPolice were continuing to sort through conflicting accounts of what happened and have made no arrests, Sacramento Police Sgt. Doug Morse said.\nHe said police interviewed a 24-year-old woman who was also hurt in the fight and was treated at a hospital for abrasions. Morse said the woman was with Stone and three others when they became involved in a brawl with another group in the Sacramento nightclub district.\n\"We're really hoping that additional witnesses or anyone involved comes forward,\" Morse said. \"Right now detectives are working around the clock to clarify all that stuff. It would be way too premature to discuss what witnesses saw.\"\nPolice said Stone was out with three women and another man before the fight early Thursday. A grainy surveillance video from outside a liquor store shows a large man who appears to be Stone fighting against a half-dozen people at an intersection.\nA second video released by police appears to show a woman who was not with Stone's group and two men fleeing in a vehicle after the altercation.\nPolice collected surveillance video from three bars down the block from the fight, owner T.J. Bruce said. He said staff who were working that night did not see an altercation inside or outside the three connected clubs.\n\"There was no confrontation in the bar that night,\" Bruce said. \"We have security that's posted in front of our doors all night. There was nothing.\"\nHe said police have not told him if their review of the clubs' surveillance video showed any of the people involved in the fight.\nStone, who is assigned to Travis Air Force Base in California, suffered a severely cut thumb and a knife wound to his neck in August when he and two childhood friends from Sacramento stopped a terror attack aboard a Paris-bound passenger train.\nStone, National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos and college student Anthony Sadler were vacationing in Europe when they tackled Ayoub El-Khazzani, a man with ties to radical Islam who had boarded the train with a Kalashnikov rifle, pistol and box cutter.\nSacramento police said there is no connection between the Sacramento fight and the attack in France. Police have not said what started the argument but said there was no evidence the assailants knew who Stone was.", "external_links": ["http://embed.newsinc.com/Single/iframe.html?WID=2&VID=29797050&freewheel=91223&sitesection=advance&height=349&width=620"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:45:38.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
