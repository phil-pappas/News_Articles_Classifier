Do you know something I don't know?\" he said, as the reporter pressed, saying that it had been widely reported. \"Many things have been widely reported,\" the minister shot back.\nMcCain accuses Russia of attacking CIA-backed Syrian rebels By Eliza Collins\nRussia targeted \"ISIL-associated depots, armaments and sites,\" Lavrov said.\n\"When some state or a country becomes an object of a terrorist attack, you can't leave the country to fend for itself. You need an international coordinated action,\" he said, in defending Russia's surprise military actions that began Wednesday.\nU.S. commanders in Iraq, meanwhile, have advised their Iraqi counterparts not to share sensitive intelligence information with the Russians as their operations begin in Baghdad.\nArmy Col.

You cannot operate without Security Council mandate, you cannot activate without the consent of the country in question,\" he added. \"And we said from the very beginning, when the coalition was announced that it was a mistake not to go to the Security Council. It was another mistake not to engage the Syrian government.\"\nPhilip Ewing contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:43:49.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
