John Kasich called on Friday for the establishment of no-fly zones in Syria and again recommended a coalition of ground troops in that nation.\nAt a news conference in New Hampshire, Kasich said he is worried that Russia’s decision to drop bombs in Syria will exacerbate that nation’s troubles. No-fly zones, he said, are needed to prevent casualties and more refugees.\n“You enter that no-fly zone, you enter at your own peril,\" Kasich said. “No more red lines, no more looking the other way. If any hostile aircraft should enter that, there will be a great consequence to them.”\nKasich, who is running for president, said in a statement that Russia’s intervention in Syria is intended to neither defeat Islamic State nor relieve the suffering of Syrian refugees.\n“Mr. (Vladimir) Putin’s real goals are quite different: to take military action to rescue (President Bashar) Assad’s criminal government from its death and to strengthen Russia’s strategic position in the eastern Mediterranean,” he said. “This is unacceptable and must stop.”\nKasich is not the first presidential candidate to endorse a no-fly zone: He joins both former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in embracing the idea, among others.\nKasich said the zones would provide refuge for Syrians fleeing the 4-year-old civil war that has killed a quarter-million people and displaced an estimated 4 million. He suggested regional assistance from Turkey, Jordan and the Kurds, and he said the administration should encourage European allies to help enforce no-fly zones.\nKasich also reiterated his call for the United States to be part of a regional coalition of ground troops — from Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the Arab League and Jordan — to defeat Islamic State and al-Qaida both in Syria and Iraq.\nKasich also criticized President Barack Obama for what he said were years of inaction in the region that has allowed Assad to remain in power.\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said on Friday that no-fly zones “make sense.”\n“We have the ability to enforce that,” he said. “But it takes political will, and that’s what we don’t see.”\nPortman stopped short, however, of calling for American troops on the ground.\nInformation from the Associated Press was included in this story. \n@jessicawehrman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:05:22.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
