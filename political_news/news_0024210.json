Food Venture Center gets $7M in funding Rochester Business Journal October 7, 2015 \nNew York’s wine and beer industries are getting a boost with a $7 million investment announced Wednesday for Cornell University's food-research facility in Ontario County. The New York State Food Venture Center, located in Geneva, will receive the funding, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during his third annual “Beer, Wine and Spirits Summit.” He also announced an additional $5 million for an advertising campaign to promote the state's craft-beverage industry, and another $5 million for a revolving fund that would offer $50,000 interest-free loans for startup wineries and breweries. Cuomo noted that New York has seen a 436 percent increase in brewery licenses since 2011, his first year in office. He said the money spent on new techniques for wineries and beer labs is a good investment.
