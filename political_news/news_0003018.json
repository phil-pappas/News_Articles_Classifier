We simply cannot ask men and women to risk their lives on behalf of our nation all around the world while they wonder whether they will get their paychecks and be able to pay their bills. I also voted in support of several measures in recent weeks that would strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood, and we will continue to work on legislative options that can get such legislation to the President’s desk.”\n###", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:35:39.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
