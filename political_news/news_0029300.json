Peskov also said any increased presence of British troops in eastern Europe would be regrettable and would amount to Britain using an alleged Russian threat as camouflage to press ahead with NATO expansion. Peskov said Russia would act in order to ensure \"parity\" should Britain do this. Turkey, which has the second-largest army in NATO, scrambled two F-16 jets on Saturday after a Russian aircraft crossed into its airspace near its southern province of Hatay, the Turkish foreign ministry said. In a second incident, the Turkish military said a MiG-29 fighter jet - an aircraft used both by Russia and Syria's own air force - had harassed two of its F-16s by locking its radar on to them on Sunday as they patrolled the border.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:44:20.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
