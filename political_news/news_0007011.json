According to figures the campaign shared with top donors gathered in Las Vegas, Rubio is starting the fourth quarter with $11 million cash on hand.\nThat's the number that Rubio's team is highlighting as he and Jeb Bush continue to battle for support from the party's establishment and donor class.\nBush, who has yet to release his third-quarter fundraising totals, is expected to outpace Rubio; but there are concerns about the campaign's total cash on hand given the higher burn rate of Bush's larger operation.\nCampaign officials said they raised $1 million online during September and saw an uptick in contributions toward the end of the quarter. They blamed a slow July and the focus that month on Scott Walker, who entered the race just after the July 4 holiday. When Rubio performed well in the first debate in August, it was harder to capitalize on the fundraising front with a number of people on vacation, according to the source attending the weekend summit of roughly 120 donors.\nHe has raised $18 million since launching his campaign, including $3 million that was transferred from his Senate reelection fund.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:19:11.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
