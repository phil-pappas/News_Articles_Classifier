(all times local)\n___\n8:30 a.m.\nIsraeli police are barring young Muslim men from Jerusalem's most sensitive site as a measure to ensure calm after several days of violence.\nSpokeswoman Luba Samri said Friday that men under 45 are barred from the Al-Aqsa mosque compound.\nThe age limit has been set intermittently in an attempt to ensure calm as it's mostly younger Palestinians involved in the violence.\nUnrest began about three weeks ago as Palestinians repeatedly barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque and hurled rocks and firebombs at police.\nIt was fueled by Palestinian allegations that Israel plans to change the delicate arrangement at the hilltop compound, holy to Jews and Muslims. Israel has adamantly denied the allegations and accused Palestinian leaders of incitement.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
