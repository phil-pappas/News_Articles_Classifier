Millegan states, “The American people and the world need to know the true story of Lee Harvey Oswald and what really happened on November 22, 1963. Lee Oswald did not kill President Kennedy. He was the ‘patsy’ in a conspiracy that accomplished a covert coup d'état in the United States. We are offering this information for free, so anyone, anywhere, may participate and learn from these historic discussions. TrineDay is asking for donations to cover costs of this and future events. The ‘Coup of 1963’ is still in power, creating havoc around our world, and leaving our children an uneasy future. Something must be done!”\nOn October 16-18 2015, nationally known researchers and scholars will gather in New Orleans at the Crowne Plaza Hotel-Airport, 2829 Williams Blvd., Kenner, Louisiana for Oswald's Summer of Secrets: New Orleans and the JFK Assassination.\nThe conference will break new ground in unlocking the mysteries of Lee Harvey Oswald’s activities in New Orleans in the summer of 1963 and explore other topics such as David Ferrie, Dr. Mary Sherman, and the Garrison trial, according to organizer Kris Millegan.\nThe link for the live-stream is http://oswaldconference.com/?page_id=710\nSpeakers include: Jim Marrs, Robert Groden, Joan Mellen, Russ Baker, Edward Haslam, Judyth Vary Baker, Roger Stone, Saint John Hunt, Daniel Hopsicker, and Ed Tatro.\nAn ad-hoc group of TrineDay, Conscious Community Events, and the JFK Historical Group produce the conference.\nContact Kris Millegan (trineday(at)icloud(dot)com) 1-800-556-2012 or David Denton (dentond(at)iecc(dot)edu) for more information or go to http://oswaldconference.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL29zd2FsZGNvbmZlcmVuY2UuY29t", "http://oswaldconference.com/?page_id=710", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL29zd2FsZGNvbmZlcmVuY2UuY29tLz9wYWdlX2lkPTcxMA=="], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:21:35.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
