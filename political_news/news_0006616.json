(AP) - An advocacy group has announced plans to try to recall a Sedgwick County commissioner who wants people in the U.S. illegally from participating in a federal nutrition program in Kansas. \nThe Wichita Eagle (http://bit.ly/1OPMl8v ) reports the Immigration Advocacy Network announced Monday it’ll seek to recall Sedgwick County Commission Chair Richard Ranzau over his positions on health care and immigration. Sandrine Lisk, director of advocacy for the group, says they’ll apply within the week for a petition seeking Ranzau’s recall. \nRanzau sent a letter to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment recently asking that Kansas participants in the the federal food program called, Women, Infants and Children, be limited to “United States citizens, nationals and qualified aliens.” \nRanzau says a potential recall won’t affect his positions on WIC. \n___ \nInformation from: The Wichita (Kan.)
