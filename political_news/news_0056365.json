PHOTOS PROVIDED \nLEXINGTON, Ky. â€” Democrat Sannie Overly promised a Jack Conway administration would spend more money on public preschool programs while Republican Jenean Hampton said it was a \"non-issue\" for Matt Bevin during a statewide televised debate of Kentucky's major party nominees for lieutenant governor just two weeks before the election. \n\"This whole issue, this is a non-issue for us. This wasn't even on our radar,\" Hampton said when asked if a Bevin administration would provide public preschool programs in Kentucky. \"The reason the Conway camp is blowing this out of proportion is they have no other substance to offer. So they do what they always do, which is deflect attention from the real problems in Kentucky.\" \nAfter the debate, Hampton told The Associated Press she meant that cutting spending for public preschool programs was the non-issue, saying \"it wasn't even on our radar for budget cuts or anything else.\" \n\"I rose out of poverty. Obviously I care about kids education,\" said Hampton, who was raised in Detroit by a single mother who could not afford a television or a car. \nStill, Overly pounced on the comment after the debate, calling it \"an extreme position\" and \"contrary to all of the research.\" \n\"Those folks don't represent the mainstream of even the Republican party,\" Overly said. \nOverly pledged an \"historic expansion of early learning opportunities,\" but said that did not mean Conway would increase spending. \n\"We may have to shuttle some things around to get that done, but we know that's where Kentucky needs to be investing,\" she said. \nThe candidates appeared on the Kentucky Tonight program on Kentucky Educational Television for about an hour. Independent candidate Heather Curtis, the wife and running mate of Independent candidate Drew Curtis, was not invited to participate because she did not meet KET's polling standards. \nEarly childhood education has been a stumbling block for the Bevin campaign since before he was the Republican nominee. In a televised debate before the primary election, Bevin questioned continued spending on the federal Head Start program, saying research shows it \"serves no purpose\" after the third grade. \nHe was referring to a 2012 federal study which found the program benefited children's language and literacy development compared to children not enrolled in the program, but found those difference mostly disappeared by the third grade. \nBut the Conway campaign has used that quote again and again to say Bevin does not support early childhood education. Bevin has rejected those claims, saying he would review spending on public preschool programs to make sure the money was spent wisely. Monday night, Hampton said she was concerned public preschool programs were introducing topics to children that \"may contradict the values of the parents,\" adding her mother prepared her for kindergarten without having the benefit of a high school diploma. \n\"I believe that Kentucky parents are perfectly capable of teaching their 3 and 4 year olds,\" Hampton said. \"We need to do something differently.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:36:12.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
