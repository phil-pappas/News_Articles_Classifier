Craig began his career in the military, and since his discharge he has acted as a Consultant to Federal Law Enforcement Agencies including the Justice Department, and the Department of Homeland Security, and most recently he authored,, The Hydra of Carnage: Bush’s Imperial War-making and the Rule of Law. Craig is an expert on government policy, international relations, and terrorism. Host John B. Wells interviews Mr. Hulet and throughout their conversation Craig discusses the NDAA, Congress treasonous acts and the 9/11 connection to the house of saud.\nIf you’re looking to better understand the whole concept of a “New World Order,” how it affects you, and why it is so dangerous, consider Craig the Bat that is going to smack you upside the head enough times in the next 45 minutes to completely shake everything you thought you knew about the world. As you’ll hear from Craig, who has been an expert fighting the government cartel from within for decades, the show is over. We the People have LOST. All of the repercussions from things like the NSA domestic spy program, Obamacare, the “Net Neutrality Act,” and the Trans-Pacific Partnership to name a few, have all sealed our fate, and it’s a real bad one. Right now, we’re literally living in the calm before the storm. Once all the legislation that has already PASSED is codified into policies and procedures for the various enforcement agencies to use day-to-day, we’re going to wake up one morning and it’s going to feel like we’ve been hit upside the head with a baseball bat. Sadly, that day will be soon. Like I said, the legislation is already through.\nPeople like myself begged and we pleaded for people to listen about “Net Neutrality,” the TPP, the Army’s new manual for domestic use on citizens, and so on, but the time for all that has passed. Anyone mumbling, “Conspiracy Theorist” is an utter imbecile, because there is nothing theoretical about laws that has already passed. I’m afraid what Sergeant Dire says in the last video below is virtually certain. The time that was once available to retake our country civilly has probably passed us by. The extent of the damage is SO bad, I don’t even want to think about what our options are.\nFirst, directly below you will get more than you bargained for from the first video with Craig. In a post of mine from the other day titled, 150,000 Russian Troops in Syria with Chinese Aircraft Carrier and Iranians Backing Them , I spend a great deal more time going into the problems we face a bit more. For now, first listen to what Craig has to tell you. Then you will see a video of General Wesley Clark confirming everything that Craig says. What we are witnessing is a plan that began during the first President Bush. Following that video is a short article by J.D. Hays trying to sum everything up, and then at the bottom I included two more things for you. The first is a video from Sergeant Dire. No one will ever accuse him of not having passion for this country, and I hope you’ll take his words very seriously. Finally, I include a description of Craig Hulet’s new book, which I am probably going to purchase later today, so feel free to ask me in a week or so how it was.\nFOR MORE NEWS BY VOICE OF REASON CLICK HERE!\nWWW.THELASTGREATSTAND.COM\nEditor’s Note: As Dr. Paul Craig Roberts so often points out, the United States is the worst aggressor in the world, and has been since the end of World War II. Its undemocratic and unconstitutional empire has set up bases in nearly every corner of the earth, spent untold volumes of money to start wars everywhere, and rules mainly from the strength of the dollar, which in turn backs up the military force.\nAfter Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia, Pakistan and others, the U.S. has done everything possible to destabilize the Middle East region, and yet it is eager to paint Putin as the aggressor and the one who must be contained. In reality, we are witnessing the tantrums of an empire upset that the dollar is being unseated as the world reserve currency, and is doing whatever it can to desperately project its force and prop up the illusion of superiority and dominance. It may not work, but everyone knows a wounded, cornered animal is at its most dangerous moment under threat.\nGen. Wesley Clark (yes, the same one who called for rounding up dissidents) long ago called out the neocon strategy in the Middle East, which sought to provoke war and ‘take over seven countries in seven years.’ This is the Wolfowitz Doctrine.\nFOR MORE NEWS BY VOICE OF REASON CLICK HERE!\nCHECK OUT THE NEW GOOGLE+ PAGE!\nGeneral Wesley Clark:\nBecause I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, “Sir, you’ve got to come in and talk to me a second.” I said, “Well, you’re too busy.” He said, “No, no.” He says, “We’ve made the decision we’re going to war with Iraq.” This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, “We’re going to war with Iraq? Why?” He said, “I don’t know.” He said, “I guess they don’t know what else to do.” So I said, “Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?” He said, “No, no.” He says, “There’s nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.” He said, “I guess it’s like we don’t know what to do about terrorists, but we’ve got a good military and we can take down governments.” And he said, “I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.”\nSo I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, “Are we still going to war with Iraq?” And he said, “Oh, it’s worse than that.” He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, “I just got this down from upstairs” — meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office — “today.” And he said, “This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.” I said, “Is it classified?” He said, “Yes, sir.” I said, “Well, don’t show it to me.” And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, “You remember that?” He said, “Sir, I didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!”\nTHE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME THE “WORLD’S MOST DANGEROUS TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.” WARNS A FORMER REAGAN OFFICIAL\nJ.D. Heyes Writes:\nA former top member of the Ronald Reagan administration has issued a dire warning about the current state of American government: it’s evil and will become even more evil in the years ahead as the world itself becomes more dangerous.\nDr. Paul Craig Roberts, who served just over a year as Reagan’s Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy, said on the Shadow of Truth radio program that Washington, D.C., is a major den of inequity.\n“The United States [military policy] has destroyed seven countries,” he says. “The populations there are subject to ongoing continual violence either from the U.S. or these Jihadists or from the Islamic State. In Libya there’s various factions, no government – just warlords fighting and nobody’s safe anywhere so the populations are getting out. You can’t live in that type of situation.”\nEarly in the interview, the hosts ask Roberts about a recent column he penned in which he states that all current Republican presidential contenders are essentially in favor of war. The hosts then ask him about the potential of nuclear war with either Russia or China, “because we seem to be moving in that direction.”\n“I think what it will take is the European countries to realize that they’ve been enabling American aggression in the 21st century, and aggression that is now brought them millions of refugees particularly from Syria and Iraq, and they can’t cope with these refugees,” said Roberts in reference to the fighting between ISIS, Syrian rebels, and Iraqi and Syrian government forces that has caused a wave of migration out of the war zones into Europe.\nWAR HAWKS ARE ALSO WARNING\nHe also said that Europe’s blind pursuit of American-led goals was putting the entire continent in potential conflict with Russia, which has established bases in Syria and has deployed men and material there in support of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, including tanks and combat aircraft. The Obama White House opposes Assad and wants him to step down.\n“All of this is nonsensical for Europe, so it’s possible that they will come to the conclusion that being a vassal of Washington doesn’t pay,” Roberts said.\nAs further noted by Investment Research Dynamics , commenting on Roberts’ interview:\nLost in the rivers of humanity that have been streaming out of Africa and the Middle East and flooding into Europe is the fact the U.S. military is responsible for this crisis. Not only has the U.S. destroyed several countries around the globe, the U.S. Government now appears to provoking Russia into a military conflict in both Ukraine and Syria that risks escalating into a nuclear war . Even Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski – two notorious warhawks – have both recently stated that the U.S. Government is pushing Russia too hard.\nIn his interview, Roberts said that he believes the only way to avoid an eventual nuclear conflict is to break up the European Union and the NATO military alliance, the latter of which was formed at the opening of the Cold War as a counterbalance to the former Soviet Union-led Warsaw Pact. He says the U.S. uses NATO as “cover” to implement unilaterally dangerous, aggressive military policies around the world.\nNO PEACEFUL CANDIDATES\nIn his cited column regarding the Republican candidates, Roberts added:\nThere is not a peaceful person among the Republican candidates. Even the female is heartless. Carly Fiorina positioned herself along side the macho men as a warmonger. She let the military/security complex know that she, too, was for sale. Send in the campaign donations, and she will see that the money flows back to the military/security complex in the buildup of fleets and armaments that will send the Russians a message.\nHe also says that the EU is essentially addicted to U.S. money and that it might be virtually impossible for the nations within the coalition to act on their own, which he adds is their own fault.\nYou can hear the entire interview here .\nTHE COUNTRY IS AT A BREAKING POINT. SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE. EACH MAN HAS TO DECIDE WHAT HE IS WILLING TO GIVE AND WHAT CAPACITY HE OR SHE IS WILLING TO FIGHT IF WE HAVE ANY CHANCE AT ALL OF SAVING OURSELVES.

An American-led empire whose ideology is Corporatism; where of the 100 largest economies in the world, America being the largest, 55 are monopoly corporations. Congressman Jack Metcalf stated regarding Mr. Hulet’s ongoing research and analysis the following: “Craig Hulet has been an invaluable advisor. Whether the issue is MAI, GATT, NAFTA, or the more general question of the growing power of transnational corporations over our institutions and everyday lives,\nMr. Hulet provides a heavily researched, coldly logical analysis where others too often delve with emotion, biases, and disinformation. His work should be widely disseminated. His conclusions should be very carefully considered.” Three (of the 20 plus chapters and appendices) chapters describe what Hulet sees as an evolution from classical terrorism into an International Urban Guerrilla Warfare; the targets were key to understanding this and why America will be hit again. Hulet is considered one of the better informed experts in his field, once described by Rita Rich (Producer for Jim Bohannon) as follows: “Fasten your seat-belts when you start reading Hulet’s Human, All-Too-Human, Hulet. Craig is a man who I call for expert advice on surviving Y2K, international and domestic terrorism, and white supremacy, (to name a few topics.) Now I’ll have to call on him to interpret the whim of the American public.”\nFOR MORE NEWS BY VOICE OF REASON CLICK HERE!\nCHECK OUT THE NEW GOOGLE+ PAGE!\nBE SURE TO GO MY PROFILE’S BELOW AT OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFACEBOOK | TWITTER | PINTEREST | STUMBLE UPON | TUMBLER\nTHE VOICE OF REASON\nWEBSITE: http://thelastgreatstand.com/ FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/LastGreatStand GOOGLE PLUS: https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LastGreatStand TWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/LastGreatStand TEA PARTY COMMUNITY: https://www.teapartycommunity.com/profile-151600/ PATRIOT ACTION: http://patriotaction.net/members/TheVoiceofReason YOUTUBE CHANNEL: https://www.youtube.com/user/LastGreatStand/ SEEN.IS: https://www.seen.is/members/home RIGHT.IS: http://right.is/contributor/pages/351/169/bio.html", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi_-yTSgNrw", "https://www.facebook.com/LastGreatStand", "https://www.pinterest.com/thelastgreatsta/", "http://www.evil.news/", "http://thelastgreatstand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Tread.jpg", "http://right.is/contributor/pages/351/169/bio.html", "http://www.naturalnews.com/NATO.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9RC1Mepk_Sw", "http://thelastgreatstand.com/", "http://thelastgreatstand.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Surveillance.jpg", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/stumbler/lastgreatstand/likes", "https://www.seen.is/members/home", "https://www.youtube.com/user/LastGreatStand/", "http://www.shtfplan.com/aftermath/u-s-government-is-now-worlds-most-dangerous-terrorist-organization_10092015", "http://patriotaction.net/members/TheVoiceofReason", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Ww970ZxGRk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnUKzJzdw_Y", "https://twitter.com/LastGreatStand", "https://www.teapartycommunity.com/profile-151600/", "https://twitter.com/#!/LastGreatStand", "http://www.naturalnews.com/nuclear_war.html", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+LastGreatStand", "http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/09/20/republican-presidential-candidates-stand-war-paul-craig-roberts/"], "published": "2015-10-16T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:15:54.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
