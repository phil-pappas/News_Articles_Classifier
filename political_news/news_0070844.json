Barely weeks ago, Modi hailed the SP chief for working in national interest after the latter broke away from opposition ranks to end the Congress-led blockade of Parliament.\nWith Dadri registering on the national consciousness as an unprecedented medieval crime, Mulayam may find it difficult to be seen as aiding BJP on legislations other parties oppose, like GST.\nAfter his personal accusation against BJP as a serial offender on communal front, any \"statesmanlike\" approach on parliamentary conduct would reinforce the perception that he is either vulnerable to the Centre's diktats owing to sensitive CBI probes about UP or is helping the saffron camp edge out rival BSP from the political scene.\nAs he made the U-turn in the monsoon session, Mulayam's jilted friends in the opposition attributed his new-found softness for Modi to \"CBI pressure\" and \"political strategy against BSP\". Even his decision to contest separately from Lalu-Nitish alliance in Bihar has been seen as being orchestrated by BJP to ensure division of anti-BJP votes.\nMulayam's allegation against BJP leaders are bound to raise hopes in the opposition eager to corner the Centre.\nThe rising cases of riots in UP have been a nettlesome issue for Samajwadis. An aggressive assault against BJP raises the prospects of polarization, which can only hurt caste-based parties like SP, especially when their governance deficit comes up against the Hindutva campaign laced with development theme.\nThe Dadri lynching followed by incendiary comments of saffron leaders would have revived memories in SP of BJP's sweep of Lok Sabha polls held in the wake of Muzaffarnagar riots.\nWhile silence would have been politically preferable, it would not have assured future peace from rabble-rousers while seriously denting the \"secular\" credentials of SP.\nFor Mulayam, the decision to speak out would have been difficult given its implications for communal polarization and its potential in forcing him away from the Modi government. Especially, when blaming three key BJP leaders - MLAs and a Union minister -- would be viewed as an attempt to pre-empt fair investigations.
