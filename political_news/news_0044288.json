Supervisor Michelle Steel was opposed, citing the cost.\nBut her colleagues praised the ordinance and said they look forward to supporting the campaign to get it approved as law. Shirley Grindle, a longtime resident who helped write the county’s landmark 1978 campaign finance law – Time is Now, Clean Up Politics, or TINCUP – said she’s “eternally grateful” to supervisors and plans a full campaign to get the commission passed.\nBoard Chairman Todd Spitzer called the ballot proposal “not only dramatic, but historically significant for this county.”\nSupervisor Shawn Nelson called it “one attempt to clean up one small aspect of what we do around here.”\n“Yes, there are still other problems. So we’ll get up tomorrow and work on something else. In the meantime, I’m proud to move this,” Nelson said.\nUnder the proposal, the board will appoint an ethics commission executive director who will track all campaign contributions and provide quarterly reports, and organize training sessions and create a manual for elected officials and candidates. Each supervisor will appoint one commissioner who will serve a three-year term, with a two-term limit.\nCommissioners must be registered voters and can’t have been employed as lobbyists within the past 10 years or have been an elected county officer, county department head or county executive manager or been elected to a partisan office. That would rule out current and former supervisors.\nAnyone who sponsored the proposal, including Grindle, also is prohibited from serving.\nThe commission’s executive director will handle initial investigations and will have the power to subpoena bank records of candidates for county offices. The accused can request a hearing, then appeal those results to the five-member Ethics Commission.\nSanctions for violations include fines of up to $5,000 for each violation or “three times the amount which the violator failed to report properly or unlawfully contributed, expended, gave or received, whichever is greater,” according to the proposal.\nThe proposed ordinance also would repeal Measure E, which was approved by voters in November and authorizes the state Fair Political Practices Commission to enforce the county’s campaign finance law. The new Ethic Commission ordinance would supersede that.\nThe proposal must be approved by more than 50 percent of voters to become law.\nContact the writer: mcuniff@ocregister.com .
