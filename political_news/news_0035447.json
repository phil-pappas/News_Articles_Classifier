The program, MilCents, is a 10-week financial literacy program designed specifically for military families.\n\"There are thousands of financial resources - so many that it can be difficult to know where to start. MilCents makes understanding finances easy, interactive and actually fun,\" said MFAN's executive director, Shannon Razsadin. \"This program will empower military families to take control of their finances, one step at a time.\"\nThe goal of MilCents - available at MilitaryFamilyAdvisoryNetwork.org/MilCents starting Monday, Oct. 12 - is to connect military families to some of the best tools available for understanding their current financial situation, managing and protecting their money, and planning for the future. During the program, participants will:\nLearn how to read a leave and earnings statement (LES). Get their credit score and learn how to improve it. Categorize their spending and saving. Create a budget. Find out how to avoid predatory lenders. Join a social community where they can interact with other program participants and financial experts, sharing their successes and asking questions. MFAN has partnered with the Better Business Bureau Military and Veterans Initiative , the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Investor Education Foundation and the National Foundation for Credit Counseling in developing the MilCents program. Its industry-validated resources are part of an online platform that fosters collaboration based on social learning principles that are particularly effective among adults. Google Hangouts and Twitter chats will be used for Q&A sessions with experts on specific topics.\n\"MilCents will resonate with military families - it is user-friendly and conducive to the busy military life,\" said Bruce McClary , vice president of public relations and external affairs at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. \"Participants take a little time each day to read about best practices, apply them and then talk about it, reinforcing what they've learned.\"\nMFAN is proud to partner with AFCPE and the FINRA Foundation Military Spouse Fellowship , a program that empowers military spouses by giving them the opportunity to become an AFCÂ® (Accredited Financial Counselor). AFCs will be available to support participants throughout the program by answering questions and offering one-on-one financial support. AFCs will receive continuing education practicum credit for their participation.\nMFAN is inviting journalists to try a portion of the program prior to its Oct. 12 launch.
