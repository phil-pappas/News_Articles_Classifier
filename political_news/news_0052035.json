Credit: ITV Border Workington's MP Sue Hayman has met Jeremy Hunt, the Secretary of State for Health, to push for better care in Cumbria.\nShe was accompanied by GPs from Workington and Cockermouth Hospitals.\nThey want the Success Regime - a scheme to improve healthcare in the region - to include community hospitals in its plans, rather than just focusing on the Cumberland Infirmary and the West Cumberland Hospital.\nWell there's certainly a real will in Government that it's going to work. What concerned me was that it is focusing too much on the acquisition by the Northumbria Trust and too much on the acute hospitals, without actually looking at the critical role that community based health services has to play in order to make it all successful. So that's what we were talking to the minister about.\nâ€“ Sue Hayman MP, Workington Labour Last updated Fri 23 Oct 2015 Politics Cumbria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:47:27.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
