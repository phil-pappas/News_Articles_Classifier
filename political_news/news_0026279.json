(AP) â€” Former students of a central Florida middle school were hoping to crack open a buried time capsule to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Hoover Middle School.\nThe problem is no one remembers where it was buried.\nFlorida Today (http://on.flatoday.com/1MTWCP2 ) reports teacher Jack Deppner filmed students on an 8 millimeter camera in 1976. He also collected mementos to bury in the time capsule.\nStudents reconnected on Facebook and raised the idea of opening the capsule. But no one knew where it was buried. Deppner died a few years ago, but had searched for years and never found the spot.\nFormer student Dawn Atkinson-Spaccio says they're planning on using metal detectors and ground penetrating radar to scour the campus. If they pinpoint a location, they'll seek permission from the school to start digging.\n___\nInformation from: Florida Today (Melbourne, Fla.), http://www.floridatoday.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
