That's down from the 12% he enjoyed in the poll's August survey of registered Republican voters. \nAnd nearly two-thirds of Republican voters in the state said Christie should end his presidential campaign, which has struggled to get off the ground and gain momentum. \nTrump's support, meanwhile, has surged to 32% in New Jersey, up from 21% in August. \nFour other presidential contenders now fill the gap between Trump and Christie, with results mimicking those of national surveys. \nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Marco Rubio took second and third place in New Jersey with 13% each while Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has 6% of support and former tech CEO Carly Fiorina takes 5%. \nThe poll surveyed 935 registered Republican voters in New Jersey between October 3-10 and has a margin of error of 3.9%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:58:20.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
