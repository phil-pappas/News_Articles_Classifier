(AP) - The Connecticut Supreme Court has scheduled arguments in the case of former Hartford Mayor Eddie Perez, whose corruption convictions were overturned by a lower court. \nState prosecutors are appealing a 2013 Appellate Court ruling, which said the charges against Perez were improperly combined into one case and ordered new trials. The Supreme Court plans to hear the case on Tuesday. \nPerez was mayor from 2001 to 2010, when he was convicted of accepting a contractor’s bribe of home improvements and trying to extort $100,000 from a developer. He was sentenced to three years in prison, but has remained free on bail during his appeal. \nProsecutors say the Appellate Court wrongly concluded that holding one trial violated Perez’s right to testify in one case and remain silent in the other. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:03:04.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
