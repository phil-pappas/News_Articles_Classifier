More Hillary Clinton tacks left with Wall St crackdown \nMrs Clinton delivered a strong defence of her record as a senator and secretary of state, while deflecting questions about recent flip-flops on issues such as trade policy by casting her U-turns as shifts that reflected her willingness to evolve. Her performance will reassure supporters who had started to question her campaign as Mr Sanders has risen in the polls. \nMr Sanders also had a strong evening, promoting the need to reduce inequality and the influence of the billionaires whose money steers politics and policies in the US. While he stuck to the messages that have helped him draw large crowds — and have provided an unexpectedly strong challenge to Mrs Clinton — his appearance on the national stage may broaden his appeal. \n“Clinton went into the debate the frontrunner and she came out exactly the same — probably strengthened in that role,” said Larry Sabato, a politics expert at the University of Virginia. “Sanders went in as the chief challenger and he came out the same — likely reinforced in that role.” \nThe debate was notably different in tone and substance from the first two Republican debates which were hijacked by the presence of Donald Trump , the real estate magnate who has proven adept at attacking his rivals on personality, but less skilled at discussing policy. The Democrats also gained from the fact that they had only five candidates on stage, compared to the 11 participants in last month’s Republican debate. \n“Hillary Clinton performed very well, but she really wasn’t challenged. It’s not a strong field,” said Tony Fratto, a former White House official supporting Jeb Bush. “The smaller field made for a better debate. Also, it helps that every Democratic candidate has held public office before and can refer [to] or be quizzed on a record. The three candidates leading the GOP field have never held public office and tend to take radical assertions [that] they never had to test in office.” \nMrs Clinton’s debate performance could give Joe Biden, vice-president, second thoughts about jumping into the Democratic field . Polls show he would pull the most support from Mrs Clinton and he has been seen as an alternative if she is dragged down by questions over her use of a personal email server. \nContinue reading \nFor many Americans, it was their first time getting to know Mr Sanders, whose leftwing credentials shone most when he debated Wall Street reform, an issue that came up several times. “Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress,” he said to applause. \nMrs Clinton recently unveiled a plan to clamp down on Wall Street , but it did not go as far as Mr Sanders who wants to break up the biggest banks. He supports a reinstatement of the 1930s Glass-Steagall Act , which separated commercial and investment banking but was repealed in 1999. \n“My plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail . . . and would give regulators the authority to go after the big banks,” Mrs Clinton said. “But I’m telling you, if you only look at the big banks, you may be missing the forest for the trees.” \nThe two candidates also disagreed on gun policy. Mrs Clinton said Mr Sanders was not tough enough on the need for more gun controls. The Vermont senator voted against a bill to introduce mandatory background checks for gun purchases, although he said his overall stance had caused the powerful National Rifle Association to award him a rating of D minus. \nIt was hard for the three other candidates to break through although Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, did the best. He received one of his loudest cheers when he referred to Mr Trump as an immigrant-hating “carnival barker in the Republican party”. \nJim Webb spent much of his time complaining that he was not getting enough air time. When candidates were asked which enemy they were most proud of, he mentioned a soldier who had thrown a grenade at him during the Vietnam war. \nLincoln Chafee repeatedly stumbled in his answers, including blaming his vote to repeal Glass-Steagall on the fact that it was his first one in the Senate. “What does that say about you that you’re casting a vote for something you weren’t really sure about,” asked Anderson Cooper, one of CNN’s moderators. \nIn one of the evening’s most memorable moments, Mr Sanders ended up coming to Mrs Clinton’s rescue on her most vulnerable issue, her email scandal . The revelation that she used a personal email address on her private server while she was secretary of state has dogged her for months, at a cost to her once formidable poll numbers. \nDemocratic presidential debate: As it happened \nThe first Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas proved to be a lively affair. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders came through a substantive debate strongly, while lower-polling rivals Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee struggled to get airtime or land the breakthrough moment lesser-known candidates seek from such events. \nContinue reading \nMrs Clinton again acknowledged it was a mistake but said she should be judged on her wider experience. But Mr Sanders’ passionate denunciation of the attention paid to her emails prompted a genuinely warm handshake from Mrs Clinton. “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,” he said to raucous cheers. \nThe Vermont politician was the social media star of the debate when he made the comment. The video of his handshake with Mrs Clinton was the night’s most tweeted moment and had the highest engagement on Facebook. His campaign also leapt into action, sending out a solicitation for donations with the subject line “Your damn emails”. \nMrs Clinton’s emails ranked fourth on Google’s top five searches of debate issues — behind healthcare, immigration and the economy, and ahead of abortion. Mr Sanders and Mrs Clinton together accounted for 80 per cent of the Twitter conversation around the debate, with the remaining three candidates each in single-digits. \nThe Republican National Committee pointed to focus groups ​results as evidence that Mr Sanders — a man that Republicans believe cannot be elected because of his socialist views — had the better debate. \n“Hillary Clinton may be the strongest debater on the stage — she was in 2008 too — but it was Bernie Sanders that won the hearts and interest of Democrat voters,” said Michael Short, an RNC spokesperson. \nOne figure who was not present got more attention than several of the Democrats. Mr Trump, who spent the evening sniping at the Democrats on the social media site, was mentioned more often in Twitter discussions of the debate than the three second-tier candidates. In web searches, the property developer and reality TV star kept pace with Mrs Clinton, according to data from Google Trends, though both trailed behind Mr Sanders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:40:52.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
