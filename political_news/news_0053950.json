For these reasons we are opposed to same-sex marriage in Bermuda. \n“This website is formed by a wide cross-section of citizens in Bermuda that desire to preserve marriage in our country,” the website added. “This petition is for persons aged 18 and over.” \nThe official Bermuda domain registrar website lists Cornerstone Bible Fellowship on Church Street as the registrant for the domain preservemarriage.bm. \nPromotional video for the website: \nThe Ministry of Community, Culture and Sports recently held public information sessions regarding same sex marriage, which followed after a petition with 2,500 signatures was presented to Government in May 2015, with the petition calling for same sex marriage to be legalized. \nSpeaking at the first meeting, Minister Patricia Gordon Pamplin said, “In May of this year, I was presented with a petition requesting that the government consider implementing legislation to give effect to same sex marriage. \n“I promised that I would consider the petition and that I would present it to my colleagues for discussion and determination of next steps respecting the petition. \n“Almost instantaneously with the breaking news of the receipt of the petition, the public discourse by way of contributions to the blogs of the various media confirmed that this very emotive subject elicited very strong views within the community. \n“There were those who believe that it is a no-brainer; that no one’s rights ought to be undermined and therefore legislation should be instantly amended. \n“On the other hand, there were those who believed we should not consider making such a move to amend the legislation, as it would offend their own belief system.” \n“We have been questioned as to why we are addressing this matter now, in light of other pressing matters facing the community. On the other hand, there are questions as to what has taken us so long to address this matter. \n“It is my belief that sober, measured research is needed in order to show that we are considering the impact of this issue on the whole community.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:22:55.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
