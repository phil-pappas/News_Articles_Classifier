Steve Dickerson. \nColeman, a civil engineer, attorney and military veteran who lives in Nashville’s Whitland neighborhood, confirmed to The Tennessean that she’s considering running for the District 20 seat as a Democrat. She said she expects to make a decision by the beginning of 2016. \n“You have more of a broad stretch of issues that you’re dealing with than what the Metro Council deals with,” Coleman said of her interest in state politics. “You’re talking about health care, schools, guns — all of these issues that are so important and pressing right now in our state and country. \n“I think someone with a diverse background such as my own, when it comes to being a military veteran to being a mother of three, would be a good addition to the Senate (Democratic) Caucus.” \nDickerson, among the more moderate Republicans in the Republican-dominated state legislature, defeated Democrat Phillip North by a 54 percent to 46 percent margin in the 2010 open race to replace former Sen. Joe Haynes. He faces his first re-election test next year. \nIn last month's Metro runoff election, Coleman finished just 2,799 votes behind Jim Shulman for the fifth at-large seat in the Metro Council. \nThe geographically winding District 20 — Nashville’s only Senate seat that leans to the right — encompasses the neighborhoods of Belle Meade, Forrest Hills, Belle Meade and Bellevue, as well as the far northern part of Davidson County, including Goodlettsville and Joelton. \nIn a 2016 election cycle that is likely to once again be tough for Tennessee Democrats, District 20 could be one of their best chances to pick off a legislative seat from Republicans. \nReach Joey Garrison at 615-259-8236 and on Twitter @joeygarrison. 129 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1LPQnwx TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:15:54.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
