That is the fastest rate of increase since 1994, and casts doubt on some of the commentary that Auckland’s market is cooling. \n\"It also confirms the hard truth that Generation Rent is being forced out of the market by skyrocketing prices, which will also flow through into higher rents. \n\"The big question is whether the Government’s half measures such as the bright-line speculators’ test will have any impact in the months to come. Expert submitters have criticised the Bill as ‘a bad idea’, ‘incoherent’ and ‘ineffective’. \n\"What we really need to do is get cracking on a massive house building programme and stop speculators by banning non-resident foreign buyers from buying existing homes,\" Phil Twyford says. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
