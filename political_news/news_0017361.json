Duke Energy and the Obama administration are settling a 15-year-old lawsuit over claims that the company violated federal clean air laws by modifying coal-fired power generators without required air pollution control equipment, company and administration officials said Thursday.\nCharlotte-based Duke, the country's largest electric company, would pay a civil penalty of $975,000, shut down one coal-burning unit not previously included in the lawsuit and spend $4.4 million on environmental mitigation projects under the proposed settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department.\nDuke had shut down 11 of the 13 North Carolina units at five power plants, and the closures become permanent as part of the deal.\nThe monetary penalty is dwarfed by company earnings and by a fine it paid in another recent North Carolina environmental case.\nDuke Energy last month reported second-quarter profits of $543 million and earned $1.88 billion in 2014.\nIn May, it agreed to plead guilty to nine criminal violations of the federal Clean Water Act and pay more than $102 million in fines and restitution for failing to contain water contaminated by coal residue at five North Carolina coal-burning plants.\nRelated Groups try to halt deal on coal-ash spill - Oct. 14, 2015 Groups target \"sweatheart\" Duke Energy-N.C. coal ash deal - Oct. 13, 2015 Duke Energy reaches $7M deal over water pollution accusations - Sep. 30, 2015 DENR: Duke Energy can't promise to move more coal ash pits - Aug. 12, 2015 Environmental groups give support to duke energy - Jul. 23, 2015 Posted to : Duke Energy Federal Government Nation - World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:52:04.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
