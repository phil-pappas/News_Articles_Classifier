The shameless Department and Minister have poorly mismanaged our visa application system which has allowed people to live and work here illegally. \n\"New Zealand First has consistently questioned Nationalâ€™s open-door immigration policy and the effectiveness of the Department to try and prevent instances like this from occurring again! \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:08:26.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
