Other hot markets in the new index included Miami, Houston and Atlanta.\nAt the other extreme, tough places for real estate investors were Birmingham, Ala.; Boston, New York City, Baltimore and Los Angeles.\nBigger Pockets, a social network for real estate investors based in Cherry Creek, looked at how much residential properties, not including apartments, appreciated in value between early 2014 and early 2015.\nGet news alerts in your inbox Sign up for updates and a curated roundup of news delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThe index also measured what annual rents, as reported by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, represented as a percentage of property values.\nDenver led the metros studied on that first measure, with a 13.4 percent gain in home prices. That was strong enough to overcome a weaker showing on the annual rent ratio to provide a total return of 18.9 percent, right behind Dallas at 19.5 percent.\n\"Some investors are looking for cash flow from rental income, while others are hoping for greater gains from appreciation,\" BiggerPockets founder and CEO Joshua Dorkin said in a statement.\nThe best markets are those that can combine the two, he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.biggerpockets.com/renewsblog/2015/10/14/biggerpockets-real-estate-investment-market-index-best-worst-markets-real-estate-investors/", "http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-14T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:13:38.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
