The person asked whether I gave bribe to Parliament for them to pass GIMPA's law. Not knowing that now if you want Parliament to pass anything else, not only do you bribe the committee, but after they have gotten their share, they ask you where is our last top? In other words; you haven't made provision for our girlfriends. It's time now in Ghana for us to rise; and it for us to lay the foundations of righteousness in the next generation. Train your children to be servant-leaders wherever they are.” \nThe tough-talking professor who was addressing the 40th anniversary of the SAPS School in Accra, also stated that “at least 8 in 10 politicians in Ghana are glorified thieves although almost every need of theirs is met by the state. We have to stop it.”Prof. Adei thus encouraged parents and teachers to bring up their wards in a manner that will empower them to overcome the temptation to be corrupt when they assume leadership roles in the future. \n“Statistics show that 80 percent of all people who will go to heaven make their decision for Jesus Christ before the age of 18. The children should grow up knowing Jesus Christ and if we do so, we will not have judges who collect bribes to prevent justice”.His comments come days after a massive judicial corruption scandal was uncovered by investigative journalist, Anas Aremeyaw Anas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:16:03.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
