Jeb Bush initially responded to Donald Trump's criticism that President George W. Bush failed to keep the country safe on 9/11 with a tweet calling the claim \" pathetic .\" Now the governor is looking to turn it into a fundraising opportunity for his presidential campaign.\nBush reportedly urged supporters help defend his brother via an email fundraising pitch.\n\"If you believe as I do that my brother kept this country safe and strong after those horrific attacks, then I need you to donate $5 and fight back against Donald Trump,\" Bush said in the fundraising pitch. \"By Donald Trump's logic, President Roosevelt should be blamed for Pearl Harbor or President Reagan for the terrorist attacks on our Marines in Beirut.\"\nThe former governor also set up a web page where supporters can fork over their personal information below an image of the former President Bush standing on the rubble of the Twin Towers. Bush, who ranks fifth in the Washington Examiner 's most recent power rankings , will also attend fundraisers in Texas, Arizona, and California on Monday, according to his campaign. The governor raked in the second largest fundraising haul among all GOP presidential candidates during the third quarter, according to the October quarterly report his campaign filed with the Federal Election Commission. As the year-end FEC reporting deadline looms and the early nominating contests approach, Bush will look to ramp up his fundraising operation.\n  Clinton celebrates foreign policy experience ahead of Benghazi testimony Clinton's campaign released a video touting her successes while serving as secretary of state.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/19/15 12:11 PM Top Story Is the GOP really still a party?  \nBy W.
