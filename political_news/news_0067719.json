The people of Gibraltar have an inviolable right to remain British. \n“We will maintain that right, for as long as they wish us to.” \nHe added: “While I’m speaking Spanish, let me clarify something for president Kirchner of Argentina – whatever the Labour leader says, this Conservative government will never sell out the Falkland Islanders.” \nMr Hammond recalled how the Falkland Islanders voted unanimously – 99.8% on a turnout of more than 90% – to remain British in a recent referendum. \nHe joked: “A free and fair election with a majority that would make (Russian president Vladimir) Putin. \n“The bullying and harassment to which the islanders continue to be subjected is shameful – it’s counter-productive, it’s wrong and it must stop. \n“The Falkland Islanders have every right to develop their economy.” \nAshley Fox, leader of the Conservative MEPs in the European Parliament, who also represents the South West of England and Gibraltar, told delegates: “Let us send out a clear and resolute message today to the people of Gibraltar – as long as you want to be British, no matter what intimidation, bullying and threats you may face, we will stand by you, we will defend you; the Conservatives will never betray you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T18:59:03.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
