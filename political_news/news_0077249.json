A second forum will be held at 3 p.m. Monday.\nLicense holders are already permitted under state law to carry handguns on college grounds. The new law, effective August 2016, allows carrying in campus buildings.\nUniversities are permitted to establish rules declaring some locations off-limits and regarding storage of handguns in campus dormitories. But the law, Senate Bill 11, says the rules may not “generally prohibit” license holders from carrying their guns on campus.\nThe forums are sponsored by a 19-member panel established by UT President Gregory L. Fenves to make recommendations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:13:52.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
