It is the UK Government themselves, by undermining those services and robbing the country of investment, that is putting pressure on them.\"\nMr Harvie contrasted the Tories' consistent \"right wing\" message with the mixed messages he sees coming from other political parties.\n\"At least they're not asking you to vote for a pig in a poke\", he said, in a clear allusion to Lord Ashcroft's allegations about the youthful hijinks of Prime Minister David Cameron.\nHe welcomed the SNP's recent moratorium on underground coal gasification, but questioned their commitment to environmental policies, observing that Energy Minister Fergus Ewing only gets a \"fire in his eyes\" when he's talking about the continuing viability of Scotland's oil industry.\nHe also called for a property market that benefits those looking for a home rather than \"those who can make a fast buck with a few back-to-back deals - naming no names\", alluding to the police investigation into property transactions involving a solicitor linked to suspended SNP MP Michelle Thomson.\nTurning to Labour, he said: \"It's interesting to see a Labour leader who probably agrees with us on more than he agrees with his own parliamentary party.\nShare article \"It's curious, and there will be many people in the Labour party who sense that hope and optimism in their own party and they have a chance to turn that tanker around.\n\"But it remains to be seen whether they are going to be able to do that against a might of party machine that is already plotting against him.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-10T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:34:15.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
