I’ve always said we can’t force people to settle …… so they have to be willing participants at the table. \n“If they are not there, it’s really their loss.” \nOn the same programme, the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, Hon Christopher Finlayson, said: “Ngāpuhi stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if issues around the tribe’s Treaty settlement are not sorted.” \nHe warned mandated entity Tūhoronuku that it “faces losing its authority if it does not gain more support from opposing hapū.” \nEarlier this week Te Tai Tokerau MP, Kelvin Davis, said “everyone wants settlement, there’s no denying this”. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:40:00.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
