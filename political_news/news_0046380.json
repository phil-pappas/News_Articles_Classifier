Dr. Alberto A. Mitrani says Bush's blood pressure and weight have dropped due to dieting and exercise, putting him in \"excellent physical and mental condition.\" \nThe medical information is part of a batch of records Bush released to the public Thursday, including his 2014 tax return. The tax information showed Bush earned roughly $8.3 million in 2014 and paid just over $3 million in federal taxes. \nBush also disclosed the names of his top campaign fundraisers, people who had helped \"bundle\" contributions for his federally regulated presidential campaign.
