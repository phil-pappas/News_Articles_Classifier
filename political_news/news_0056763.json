(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images) By John Wagner and Matea Gold September 30 at 7:33 PM Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @mateagold hopeful Bernie Sanders said Wednesday that he had raised more than $24 million during the past quarter, a robust take fueled by small online donations that have come at a faster clip even than those President Obama collected in his campaign.\nThe total value of Sanders’s haul is expected to be eclipsed by Hillary Rodham Clinton but ensures that the senator from Vermont can run a vigorous campaign against the once-formidable frontrunner heading into the first nominating contests early next year.\nAs of Wednesday night, Clinton officials had not disclosed how much her campaign had raised during the past three months. Aides to Sanders said they expect his total could grow considerably in the final hours before the close of the quarter at midnight. In the previous quarter, Clinton’s campaign raised $47.5 million, compared to $15.2 million by Sanders.\nSanders’s campaign said it now has more than $25 million in the bank, a reflection of a far more thrifty campaign than Clinton’s and one that has yet to start airing television ads, as the former secretary of state has.\n[ How Bernie Sanders is plotting his path to the Democratic nomination ]\nOnly one other campaign released totals Wednesday, the last day of the fundraising quarter. GOP contender Ben Carson raised at least $20 million, according to a spokesman.\nSanders, a self-described democratic socialist who decries the political influence of the “billionaire class,” has generally eschewed traditional events where candidates mingle with large donors. The senator has instead focused on raising money over the Internet, mostly in small increments. Aides said his average donation is about $30.\nBy Wednesday evening, Sanders’s campaign said it had received 1.3 million donations from about 650,000 different donors. That put Sanders across the one-million-contribution threshold earlier than Barack Obama in both his campaigns.\nObama reached one million donations in his 2008 campaign in February of that year. In 2012, Obama’s campaign announced it had reached the mark in October 2011. Unlike Sanders, Obama also heavily courted larger donors as well.\nTad Devine, a Democratic strategist who is advising Sanders, said that the senator’s team had gauged that they would need to raise at least $40 million before the Iowa caucuses to run a credible campaign against Clinton — a mark they have now hit months ahead of schedule.\n[ Clinton’s hands-off policy toward Sanders is a long bet — with risks ]\nDevine said that a big advantage of Sanders’s style of raising money is that he can return again and again to the same donors for additional contributions, given most of them are giving well under the $2,700 limit for the campaign cycle.\n“They will have enormous headroom to continue to contribute to the campaign,” Devine said.\nMore than three-quarters of the contributions Sanders received in the spring quarter were in increments of $200 or less. It was not immediately clear Wednesday what share of donations from the past quarter were of that amount.\nUnlike most other presidential candidates, including Clinton, Sanders has discouraged the support of super PACs, groups that operate independently of the campaigns but have the ability of raise unlimited sums to promote their preferred candidates.\nWhile acknowledging this puts him at a disadvantage, Sanders has said repeatedly that he does not want money from the wealthy.\nStill, the sizable haul for his campaign and the low burn rate over the summer months puts him in a nimble position in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses. And it shows that his fundraising pace is quickening. After bringing in an average of $213,000 a day in the spring quarter, his rate of donations over the summer increased to nearly $264,000 a day, according to a calculation by The Washington Post.\nAs Obama demonstrated in his races, a robust small donor base can be a powerful financial force. In his 2012 reelection, 28 percent of his individual contributions — $216 million – came from donors who gave $200 or less cumulatively, according to the Campaign Finance Institute.\nSanders has been able to expand his small donor base by working with ActBlue, a nonprofit political committee that provides campaigns and party committees with free fundraising technology to process online donations. The group has information for 1.7 million donors in its files, allowing return users to make contributions to participating campaigns nearly instantly – a huge advantage, particularly when it comes to mobile devices.\n“All these small donors are becoming the backbone of Democratic giving,” said executive director Erin Hill. Wednesday, the final fundraising day of the third quarter, was one of the most active days in Act Blue history, with $3 million in contributions processed by early evening, she said.\nIn her 2016 bid, Clinton is leaning more heavily on big donations. She headlined dozens of $2,700-a-person fundraisers at the homes of wealthy contributors over the last few months, including a spate of events in recent days in New York and California.\nAides have sought to downplay expectations that Clinton will match the record $47.5 million that she raised in the spring quarter, but officials have told campaign bundlers that they have been hitting all of their targets, both for online donations and high-dollar events.\nThe jockeying over fundraising totals comes as Sanders has pulled even or taken over the lead in recent polls out of Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating states.\nWhile Sanders is spending considerably less money on his campaign than Clinton, he has invested heavily on operations in those states and has been making hires for states later in the calendar.\nDevine said the Sanders campaign had made a strategic decision not to try to match Clinton’s early spending on television ads in order to conserve its resources.\n“We wanted to have as big a pile of cash on hand at the end of this quarter while aggressively building operations in the early states,” he said.\nmatea.gold@washpost.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@mateagold", "https://twitter.com/@WPJohnWagner"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:47:35.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
