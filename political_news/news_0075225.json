REUTERS/Cathal McNaughton Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams \n“The fact is that Mr Kenny is focused on getting enough seats to ensure his re-election as Taoiseach.” \nDeputy Adams also hit out at the Taoiseach over the Coalition’s record on dealing with the health and homelessness crisis. \nHe added: “Michael McGrath (Fianna Fail finance spokesman) was right when he said that the Government had adopted Fianna Fáil policy on the economy. \n“What he failed to say was they obviously adopted Fianna Fáil policy on Health and have sustained the chaos in our health services as well as in housing, emigration and education.” \nIt is known that a rift has opened up in the Coalition over the Taoiseach’s failure to give a commitment that the Government will run its full term. \nLabour leader Joan Burton said she wants to time to allow the Banking Inquiry to report its findings and for important legislation to be enacted.
