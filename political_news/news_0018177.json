Boston Scientific . However, Judge Mary Miller Johnston did reduce the $100 million verdict to $10 million . The decision may be regarded as a major victory for mesh manufacturers perhaps effectively setting a ceiling on damages for mesh lawsuits.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277287LOGO\nBoston Scientific manufactured two polypropylene transvaginal meshes named Advantage Fit and Pinnacle. Both of them were implanted in Ms. Barba in 2009, and within a short amount of time, she had to have both of them removed. Barba had sustained serious injuries, and later found out that she wasn't informed of safer alternatives. She is one of many litigants pursuing action against transvaginal mesh manufacturers for negligence. Many more cases are expected to appear within a matter of months.\nThe defendant's motion for new trial, was rejected as Judge Johnston stated that \"the liability verdict was one that a reasonably prudent jury could reach.\" The remittitur, a judge's reduction in the award given by a jury to a plaintiff, reduced the jury award by $90 million .\nPaul Coppola , President of Fair Rate Funding, a mesh lawsuit funding firm commented on the decision. \"While the motion for new trial was denied, the reduction in the damages award is a real victory for defense attorneys and their mesh manufacturing clients,\" said Coppola. \"The outcomes of these trials never cease to amaze but it is good to know Ms. Barba is going to get some compensation for her suffering.\"\nFair Rate Funding provides pre settlement cash to plaintiffs involved in pelvic mesh or other types of lawsuit.
