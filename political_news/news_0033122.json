But ethics board members indicated they were likely to give the officials license to continue.\nThe board members said Espinoza wouldn't be barred by a conflict-of-interest rule from voting on the historic landmark application for a house in his neighborhood.\nThe conflict-of-interest provision applies only if he has \"any substantial employment, contractual or financial interest\" in the outcome.\n( File photo ) But Chairman Brian Spano said it still would be up to Espinoza to decide whether participating in the council's discussions and votes on the issue in coming weeks would be appropriate.\n\"I think it is going to fall into a gray area of discretion for you, with respect to the appearance of impropriety,\" Spano said.\nEthics board member Roy Wood, noting that Espinoza has expertise on the matter as an architect, voiced a more permissive view: \"It's a classic case, I think, where you should disclose (your role). ... You certainly shouldn't recuse.\"\nAdvertisement The council's Neighborhoods and Planning Committee, on which Espinoza serves as vice chair, will consider the designation for 2329 Eliot St. on Oct. 28. Earlier this month, the Landmark Preservation Commission recommended granting historic status to the Jefferson Park house , against the wishes of homeowner James Sonnleitner.\nCouncil approval would mean that a developer that's eyeing the property for a townhome development could not tear down the 1880s Queen Anne-style home.\nEspinoza joined with a group of residents to file the application in late May — \"begrudgingly,\" he said — and paid the nonrefundable $875 filing fee himself, before taking office in July.\nRegarding Haynes' dual roles, ethics board members leaned on prior advice given by the board more than a decade ago .\nTwo previous parks directors, James Mejia and Kevin Patterson, also were simultaneously members of the Denver Public Schools board. Haynes, the DPS board's president, is running for re-election to her at-large seat in the Nov. 3 election.\nShe told the board that like Mejia, she plans to delegate the handling of agreements and contracts with DPS over cooperative park use and other matters to Fred Weiss, the department's finance director.\n\"Both the city and the school district have very strong ethics codes, and I intend to follow those on either side,\" she said.\nSpano said the board's advisory opinion likely would \"prohibit any direct official action by you in connection with any matters involving Denver Public Schools. ... It does require full disclosure of any interest that might arise and recusal from any act or vote thereon as well as not exercising any authority to try to persuade others.\"\nAsked about time demands for the two positions, Haynes said they would make for some busy weeks. But she said she was confident she could juggle the time requirements without shortchanging her day job at Parks and Rec.\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or @JonMurray", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/0916/20150916__blogs~p1_100.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:16:49.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
