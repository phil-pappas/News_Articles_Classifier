Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, and Joseph I. Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut, invited presidential candidates from both parties to speak at a daylong “Problem Solver Convention” in Manchester on Monday. Just showing up at the conference was deemed proof of being one of those so-called problem solvers, even if the speeches there did not always focus on big ideas.\nThe event, on live video, drew eight presidential candidates from the field of more than 20 Democrats and Republicans. Founded on the idea that toxic political divisions are ruining the nation, officials with No Labels have long advocated focusing on fixing government instead of partisan politicking.\n First Draft: Calling Obama a ‘Weakling,’ Chris Christie Says He Would Shoot Down Russian Planes Over Syria OCT. 12, 2015 Political Memo: From Donald Trump, Hints of a Campaign Exit Strategy OCT. 9, 2015 video How Bernie Sanders Connects With His Crowds OCT. 12, 2015 For candidates whose speeches use the language of outrage, such as Donald J. Trump , the No Labels event had the potential to be an odd fit.\n OPEN Interactive Graphic Interactive Graphic: Who’s Winning the Presidential Campaign? “No Labels, that’s right — I’m a believer!” Mr. Trump declared as he took the stage.\nAs he spoke, Mr. Trump tried to embody the motto written on a sign behind him: “Stop fighting, start fixing.” Instead of beginning with his usual stump speech, which has focused on building a wall along the border with Mexico to keep out immigrants, Mr. Trump devoted nearly 15 minutes to describing his acquisition in 1986 of the Wollman Rink, a once-decripit ice skating rink in Central Park that he transformed amid much hoopla.\nThe granularity of reconstruction specifics was occasionally jarring. “Do you know what brine is? It’s water with salt in it,” Mr. Trump told the crowd at one point, straining to discuss some of his building projects in New York City.\nThe rink “is the No. 1 in the world and it does great,” Mr. Trump said.\nAt another point, he explained that getting the City Council and Mayor Edward I. Koch to agree to his overhaul of the rink reflected his ability to work with people on complicated issues.\nMr. Trump, whose criticisms of President Obama — and questions about his citizenship — have helped fuel his political rise since 2011, seemed careful not to go into negative mode, at least initially.\n“I want to be nice to the president,” Mr. Trump insisted, before calling the nation’s unemployment rate a “disaster.”\nAfter his speech, he was peppered with questions. When one person asked if he worried that his “divisive” language on the campaign trail was corrosive to the system, he replied, “I know what’s divisive, I know what’s not divisive.”\nA young man asked about negative comments he had made in the past about South Korea. “Are you from South Korea?” Mr. Trump asked in response. The man said he was from Texas and, later, Colorado.\nMr. Trump returned to his signature combativeness as time went on. He criticized candidates for taking money from “ super PACs ” and suggested the United States was being outsmarted by global leaders. And Mr. Trump, a first-time candidate who has been channeling some of the deep frustration within the Republican Party ’s base, ultimately seemed to decide that muting himself made no sense.\n First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race , the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n “I don’t think anybody in this room wants to have somebody who’s not going to fight back,” Mr. Trump said.\nMr. Trump’s appearance was preceded by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a fellow Republican candidate who infused his criticism of the opposing party with references to “our Democratic friends.” He talked about eliminating the national debt and urged No Labels to find foreign policy planks that could accommodate his more hawkish views of other nations.\nAnd Chris Christie , the New Jersey governor who received national recognition for YouTube videos of him scolding teachers, explained the importance of engaging with people who hold opposing views.\n“It’s harder to hate up close,” said Mr. Christie, who spoke after Mr. Trump. Mr. Christie declined to give a prepared speech, instead answering questions from the crowd for more than 30 minutes.\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is running for the Democratic nomination, seemed to take the instructions about focusing on government fixes as literally as possible as he delivered remarks remotely, over a video feed. He spoke at length about the debt, increasing the minimum wage and making investments to improve the plight of the shrinking middle class.\nThe wealthiest people are “doing phenomenally well,” Mr. Sanders said, adding that government efficiency is key.\nAfter a speech steeped in policy, Mr. Sanders thanked the group “for the good work” it does.\nMany candidates did not attend, such as Hillary Rodham Clinton (who is attending the first Democratic debate of the campaign on Tuesday), and Jeb Bush from the Republican side.\nThose who did not attend were chastised lightly as the conference came to an end.\n“Anybody have a good excuse that might make me feel good about them not being here today?” one attendee asked at a final question-and-answer session.\n“We will be going to the other candidates who weren’t here today, they will see all the coverage,” one official with the group said. “They have another shot.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/12/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign-video-analysis-1444666538302/bernie-sanders-campaign-video-analysis-1444666538302-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/us/10trump2/10trump2-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/16/us/elections/presidential-candidates-dashboard-1442376909418/presidential-candidates-dashboard-1442376909418-master180.png", "http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:46:56.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
