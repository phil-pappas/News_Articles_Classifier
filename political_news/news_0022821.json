John Kasich has surged to an all-time high job approval rating among voters in his home state of Ohio, according to the results of the latest Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday. More than six in 10—62 percent—said they approve of the job their governor is doing. Kasich, a GOP presidential candidate, drew just 29 percent disapproval. The numbers are in line with Kasich's previous high of 61 percent to 28 percent in August, still within the statistical margin of error.\nIn poll results released Wednesday, Kasich drew 13 percent among likely Republican primary voters in Ohio, trailing just Donald Trump and Ben Carson.\nThe poll was conducted as part of a series of swing-state surveys in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, where voters in all three states were asked their opinions of recreational marijuana. No presidential candidate since 1960 has won the general election without winning at least two of those states. In both Ohio and Florida, voters backed the legalization of the personal use of marijuana, by 53 percent to 44 percent and 51 percent to 45 percent, respectively.\nThere is a significant gender gap in both states. In Florida, men backed legalization 57 percent to 41 percent, while women opposed 49 percent to 46 percent. In Kasich's state, men supported it 59 percent to 38 percent, while women were split 47 percent to 49 percent.\nIn Pennsylvania, voters were overall more divided on the issue, with 47 percent supporting legalization and 49 percent opposing it.\nQuinnipiac surveyed voters from Sept. 25-Oct. 5 via landlines and cellphones. In Ohio, 1,180 voters were surveyed, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points; while in Florida, 1,173 registered voters participated, with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points overall; and in Pennsylvania, 1,049 registered voters participated, with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/2016-presidential-swing-state-polls/release-detail?ReleaseID=2288", "http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/2016-presidential-swing-state-polls/release-detail?ReleaseID=2287"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:28:09.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
