Clearing up the Democratic choices a bit, I guess. Not that Chafee or Webb were really going to siphon a lot of caucus goers from Clinton and Sanders. It can hurt in the first round at a precinct, though, which can mess up your second round if suddenly supporters think they need to jump ship to be on the \"winning\" side. Caucuses can be a weird phenomenon! Crazy stuff. Anyway, so long Chafee!
