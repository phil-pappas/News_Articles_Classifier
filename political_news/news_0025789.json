Jerry Brown signed legislation barring public schools from using the Redskins name for sports teams.\nIt was one of three sports-related bills Brown recently approved. He also signed a measure that bans using or possessing smokeless tobacco on the playing field at professional baseball parks and another that recognizes competitive cheerleading as a high school sport.\nThe mascot legislation will prevent public schools from using a term that American Indians regard as offensive. It goes into effect in 2017.\nOnly four schools still use the name. Messages seeking comment from school officials were not immediately returned Monday, a federal holiday.\nBrown rejected separate legislation that bans naming parks, schools and other public property after Confederate leaders.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the bills were approved recently, not all on Sunday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:43:51.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
