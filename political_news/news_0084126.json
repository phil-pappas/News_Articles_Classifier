Not a photo of your actual uterus (that might be difficult), but this cute, cranky pink cartoon uterus sends pretty much the same fierce message: GTFO.\nSend Congress Your Uterus ​ is a n ew online service that allows you to mail one of three postcards to a U.S. congressman or senator to express displeasure at his or her support of legislation that would curb women's reproductive rights. The back of every postcard reads, \"Dear Congress member, You're receiving this because your voting patterns have demonstrated to the women of these United States, that you believe you have a right to regulate our bodies. Enjoy the sentiment of this postcard.\" ​\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Send Congress Your Uterus The idea comes from Chelsea Kent, founder of nail wrap subscription service Scratch Nails and her colleague Alexa Natanson, who oversees marketing for the Los Angeles startup. \"We didn't necessarily have a strong interest in politics,\" Natanson, 27, told Cosmopolitan.com over the phone. However, \"we realized that we care a ton about the fact that there are these people running our country and most people are not paying attention to what they're doing.\"\nMore From Cosmopolitan \"We decided that we really wanted to take some action on this,\" she said. ​\"You can always call your senator or representative. You can always write to your senator or representative. We just wanted to streamline that process so that people begin to realize they have a voice and then can start to take a lot more action on their own.\" ​\nEach postcard will go to one of 305 federal lawmakers who has recently opposed women's reproductive health. Natanson arrived at the list by identifying supporters of \" ​every bill that has come up in the current Congress that has had to do with [taking away] women's healthcare and women's right to choose\" including a bill that attempted to defund Planned Parenthood and the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Act, which sought to limit abortions to no later than 20 weeks. ​\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Send Congress Your Uterus \"Some of those representatives voted many times against reproductive rights. Some of them voted once,\" said Natanson. \"But one vote, to us, counts as a vote against women's rights. ​\"\n​One potential downside is that the service doesn't let you choose which federal lawmaker your postcard goes to. Nor does the site allow you to personalize the messages. This is because, once enough orders are placed, the postcards are mailed to lawmakers in bulk batches. Kent wrote via email that since the Sunday launch, ​\"we've gained enough momentum to hit each of those 305 congress member [ sic ] at least once.\" ​ They hope to have enough volume to mail at least one batch per week.\nThe process is simple, but it'll cost you $3.50. According to Natanson, this covers cost of production, labor, postage, and a transaction fee. The profits obtained from the postcard sales will go directly to another similarly themed project that Natanson and Kent hope to unveil in the coming months. Any funds left over after that, Natanson says, will be donated to a reproductive rights organization that has not yet been specified.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Send Congress Your Uterus Of course, sending an email is free, but an email could easily end up in a spam folder. ​And postcards are far more confrontational. \"Someone in their office is going to have to make a decision about what to do\" with the postcard, Natanson explains. \"They're going to either have to show it to someone, or they're going to have to throw it away. They will be making a statement every time they receive [a] postcard and have to think about what to do with it, instead of just moving it to a spam folder in email.\" ​\nNatanson is appalled by the current debate about abortion and the attempts to defund the leading provider of health care for low-income women. \"I get passionate about certain issues, but this one, for me, women's reproductive rights, it seems ridiculous that this is something that people are talking about in Congress,\" she said. \"It really does feel like they are having discussions that they shouldn't be having in my lifetime. I feel like this fight was already fought so long ago and I learned about it when I was growing up, and I didn't think I would be watching happen as a young woman. I don't want to be talking about this in 20 years. I want women to have as much freedom as men are granted in the health and reproduction sphere.\"\nFollow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x1066/gallery-1443818529-decisions2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x388/gallery-1443814843-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-33959-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x466/gallery-1443814843-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-33959-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x653/gallery-1443818529-decisions2.jpg", "https://www.goscratch.it/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x426/gallery-1443818529-decisions2.jpg", "https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x320/landscape-1443814843-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-33959-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443818459-so-many2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x319/gallery-1443818529-decisions2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x594/gallery-1443814843-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-33959-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x1066/gallery-1443818459-so-many2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/640x426/gallery-1443818459-so-many2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x511/gallery-1443818459-so-many2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x777/gallery-1443814843-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-33959-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/768x511/gallery-1443818529-decisions2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x853/gallery-1443818459-so-many2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1443814843-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-33959-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1280x853/gallery-1443818529-decisions2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x319/gallery-1443818459-so-many2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/980x653/gallery-1443818459-so-many2.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/480x291/gallery-1443814843-screen-shot-2015-10-02-at-33959-pm.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/40/1600x800/landscape-1443818529-decisions2.jpg", "http://sendcongressyouruterus.com/"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T00:56:38.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
