White said this week that no violation of city policy occurred when Common Council candidate Maria Updegraph bought a house at last year’s city tax foreclosure auction despite having unpaid taxes herself.\nUpdegraph paid off her city, county and school taxes in full Tuesday, three days after The Buffalo News reported that she owed more than $7,500 in property taxes dating back to 2012.\nThe city has a policy that no one who owes city taxes is allowed to buy property at the auction. But White said that at the time of the auction on Sept. 9, 2014, Updegraph’s city taxes weren’t delinquent yet. The taxes she paid off at City Hall Tuesday were the 2014-15 school taxes, which were billed a week before the auction, and the 2015 city taxes, which weren’t billed until January.\nHer county taxes were behind, but White said the city’s auction policy applies only to city taxes, not county taxes.\nUpdegraph said the taxes were paid off from funds held by Darkride Studios, a business owned by her and her husband, James, which makes Halloween masks, among other special effects.\n“October is our busiest month, and we use that income to pay our vendors, our bills, our taxes and to put some money away for savings so that we can provide for our three children the rest of the year and for emergencies that any family can encounter the rest of the year, when the business is slower and the money is tight,” Updegraph emailed The News. “I didn’t pay these debts because of a news article. I did so because we were financially able to this month. Over the past month we were already making partial payments on taxes and we knew by the end of the month it would be paid. Anybody that has a small business in Lockport or anywhere in New York State knows that it is a constant struggle. People want transparency. This is as transparent as it gets.”\nThe county taxes from 2012-14 were owed on their Spalding Street home, and taxes owed on the nearby house they bought for $10,000 in the auction were imposed in the past year.\nUpdegraph wrote, “We are so passionate about restoring our neighborhood that we knew we had to put our money where are mouths were. Why would we invest all this effort and time into restoring homes just to lose them to foreclosure? The answer is we wouldn’t. We fully intended on fulfilling our tax obligation, and we have. Does that justify being delinquent on our taxes? No, we are not looking for justification. To us, it was worth the sacrifice, and we are very aware of how our business cycle works, with a seasonal company.”\nThe only other candidate in the Nov. 3 election with unpaid taxes was Edward W. Tracy, the city Democratic chairman, who is running for 1st Ward alderman. He paid off $1,721.37 on his East Avenue home Thursday.\nTracy said he thought the bill had been paid before. “It was an oversight, but I am entirely to blame,” he said.\nemail: tprohaska@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:19:16.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
