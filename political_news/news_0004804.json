The One4 Project symbolizes the exponential power of one by encouraging people to download the Imagine Dragons' newly released song \"I Was Me,\" now available exclusively on iTunes worldwide at iTunes.com/IWasMe . Apple, KIDinaKORNER/Interscope and Imagine Dragons will donate their respective proceeds to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Further, SAP will also donate USD 10 cents for every download up to the first 5 million downloads from iTunes.\nKIDinaKORNER/Interscope recording artist Imagine Dragons is scheduled to publicly perform \"I Was Me\" tonight for the first time, live from the SAP Arena in Mannheim, Germany . The SAP Arena is among the first stops of the band's Smoke + Mirrors European leg.\n\"The refugee crisis is incredibly urgent in terms of the number of vulnerable people being affected every single day. As a band we wanted to get involved and decided to partner with SAP and Apple to try and make a difference,\" said Dan Reynolds , lead singer of Imagine Dragons. \"'I Was Me' is a song about trying to regain your life, which is exactly what millions of people are going through right now. Whether it is by downloading this track or by other means, we hope people everywhere recognize the severity of the situation and find a way to assist these families in desperate need.\"\n\"SAP's culture is reflected in our vision of helping the world run better and improving people's lives. When one of our employees had an idea of how SAP could use two of our greatest strengths - our employees and our expansive network of customers, partners and friends - we felt compelled to see this idea through to fruition,\" said Robert Enslin , member of the Executive Board of SAP SE. \"Uniting the passion that SAP and our friends at Imagine Dragons and iTunes share for social responsibility through the One4 Project is a natural extension of these networks in action and represents the power one idea can have when supported by many.\"\nFunds raised will benefit the UN Refugee Agency in their efforts to provide aid and assistance to the increasing numbers of people forced to flee their homes due to conflict and violence, many of whom continue to risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea. As fall turns to winter, the challenges faced by these refugees will only increase.\nTo support the UN Refugee Agency by downloading \"I Was Me\" from iTunes, visit here .\nTo learn more about the UN Refugee Agency, visit here .\nFor more information, visit the One4 Project page on sap.com.
