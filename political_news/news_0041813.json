But local morning gains were pared back in the afternoon with miners among those to retreat from earlier positions.\nHowever IG market analyst Angus Nicholson noted during the session that the portion of companies trading above their 200-day moving average had increased to 52 per cent â€“ up from 30 per cent in September.\n\"If you look over the past couple of years, every time this measure has consistently rallied over 50 per cent, the rally usually continues until at least 60-70 per cent of companies on the index are trading above the 200-day moving average,\" he said.\n\"There is now the fundamental and technical foundation that could lift the ASX back to its 5600-5700 level before the August sell-off.\"\nThe cautious afternoon was amplified by a dearth of economic data today. Investors are eyeing Wednesday's quarterly inflation figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics for a pointer on the Reserve Bank's next rate move as central banks around the world, notably Europe's and possibly Japan's, head towards further easing.\n\"The ASX would be lifted alongside this increased liquidity in the markets,\" Mr Nicholson said.\n\"The big question for the ASX at the moment is which sectors are going to see the bulk of that lift?\"\nIn equities news today, media company Ten Network announced a capital raising as it posted a deeper full-year loss while financial services firm AMP launched a $200m notes issue. Elsewhere, BlueScope announced a sharp increase in its earning guidance as it confirmed a $1bn buyout of its North Star steelworks joint venture partner. Looking ahead, tomorrow sees the ASX listing of superannuation administration firm Link Group as well as a raft of annual general meetings including Stockland and WorleyParsons' yearly gatherings. Overseas tonight, the US is expecting the latest on new homes sales, the Dallas Federal Reserve's manufacturing survey and earnings results from 94 companies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:44:35.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
