What it is is an attempt the overwhelming vote of the party room by a two thirds majority to maintain our position on marriage, which is to maintain the truth of marriage which is between a man and a woman to the exclusion of others.\n\"Our party room decision is that would be our policy up until the next election,\" Mr Abetz told the ABC.\nMr Entsch warned the moves by Mr Entsch were \"not actions that will help unity or heal wounds\" sustained by supported by Mr Abbott in the leadership spill.\n Back in August, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott tried to assuage tensions after a marathon party room meeting by saying the party will maintain it's position on gay marriage up until the 2016 election, and promising to allow a plebiscite in the next term of Parliament.\nMr Abetz accused Mr Entsch of waging a media campaign to pressure Mr Turnbull into \"a breach of promise\" in pushing for the change in legislation before the election.\n\"From Mr Entsch by promoting this in the media and putting the Prime Minister in a very difficult situation, when we know what the Prime Minister's personal view is.\n\"I believe we get into uncharted waters and very complicated situations if we try to bind the next parliament by a vote of this Parliament,\" he said.\nLNP Senator Matthew Canavan agreed that he would be concerned by legislation coming before the parliament before the 2016 election, saying it would have the effect of binding future MPs.\nAlthough Mr Entsch said the legislation should be passed before the election, sources close to the Prime Minister are wary of a pre-election vote, fearing internal tension.\nSome Nationals are also understood to be perplexed by the plan.\nMr Abetz also took a parting shot at Mr Entsch: \"he seems to expend an inordinate amount of time on this issue and good luck to him\".\nLabor leader Bill Shorten said a plebiscite would not only be a waste of money, but cruel to gay people because they would be victims of a government funded no case.\n\"Do you really want to subject members of the LGBTI community to a no case?\" he said.\n\"What we don't want is a divisive debate about people's sexuality. We don't want that debate. I don't think that is a genie we should have let out of the bottle where a whole lot of people are able to stigmatise each other.\"\nHe said the matter should be put to Parliament and swiftly.\n\"I don't want young people in regional Australia, who might already feel pressured and stigmatised too, have to subject to a TV campaign where they're told that their sexuality and their choices are somehow not fit to be allowed to be married so we have reservations about a divisive debate which will cause a lot of harm.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/eric-abetz-says-gay-men-dont-want-to-marry-citing-dolce-and-gabbana-20150811-gix165.html", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:47:41.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
