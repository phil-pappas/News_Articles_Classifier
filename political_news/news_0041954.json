They said one possibility was a tax on financial transactions.\nClimate change deaths\nThe 20 said they accounted for just two percent of world greenhouse gas emissions but had suffered an average of more than 50,000 deaths a year since 2010 from impacts they linked to rising temperatures.\nThey estimated that they faced \"escalating losses of at least 2.5 percent of our GDP potential per year, estimated at $45bn since 2010.\"\nThey said they would also share experiences and work for a sovereign V20 Climate Risk Pooling Mechanism, an insurance facility to spread risks and help recovery after extreme weather events and disasters.\nMinisters from the 20 nations are due to approve the documents before meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Lima starting on Friday.\nSource: Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:51:39.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
