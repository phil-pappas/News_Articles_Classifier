But before you start carving your jack-o'-lantern or pull the old witch costume out of storage, make sure you're prepared to keep festivities fun and not frightfully real.\nCSA Group, a leading public safety and product testing and certification organization, would like to remind everyone of the following decorating safety tips to help ensure a happy Halloween is had by all.\nGo big and heavy-duty: Use heavy duty extension cords for high wattage decorations like fog machines and large light displays to avoid overheating and potential fires. Only use it outdoors if it says 'outdoors': Ensure lights and electrical decorations are marked for 'outdoor use.' Cut the power: Before working with outdoor wiring, turn off the electricity to the supply outlet and unplug the connection. Dispose of damaged goods: Carefully inspect each electrical decoration. Cracked or frayed sockets, loose or bare wires, and loose connections may be a shock or fire hazard. Dispose of damaged light sets and replace damaged power cords. Take care with connectors: When hanging lights outdoors, keep electrical connectors above ground, out of water and away from metal eavestroughs. Connect outdoor lighting into receptacles protected by weatherproof ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI), which can provide protection from electric shock by sensing ground leakage and cutting electrical power. Choose fasteners not nails: Use insulated fasteners rather than metal nails or tacks to hold light strings in place to avoid damaging the wires and insulation. Use flashlights, not candles: When decorating, avoid using candles. Instead, use flashlights or battery-operated candles to light pumpkins, displays and walkways. Never use open flames near combustible materials. Look for the mark: When purchasing light strings, animatronics, strobe and black lights, fog machines or extension cords, look for a certification mark from an accredited certification organization, such as CSA Group. A recognized certification mark provides assurance that products are tested and certified to the applicable standards for safety and performance.\nAbout CSA Group\nCSA Group is an independent, not-for-profit membership association dedicated to safety, social good and sustainability.
