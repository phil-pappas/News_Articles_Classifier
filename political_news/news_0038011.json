Bob Gannon (R-Slinger) said that he had based his statements on media accounts and the student handbook of Umpqua Community College, which he said discouraged students from carrying firearms. \n\"The first media reports made it that it was a gun-free zone,\" Gannon said. \"So drop it, that's not the story.\" \nIn 2011, the Oregon Court of Appeals ruled that that state's public university system could not prohibit students with concealed carry permits from carrying firearms on campus grounds. That state's higher education board has sought to ban students from carrying them inside buildings. \nGannon was responding to President Barack Obama's statements in favor of gun control in the wake of the shooting at Umpqua, where at least 10 people were killed including the 26-year-old gunman, Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer . \n\"What Obama ignored was the testimony of the students and educators at the school that they were defenseless in this incident as the school was a 'gun free' zone. This means that only criminals will possess personal protection at these locations, and the law abiding citizen is an easy target,\" a statement released by Gannon's office said. \nIn an email, Gannon, who has a concealed carry permit, said he has told those around him on the Assembly floor that \"if shooting starts, they should hit the floor, because I have every intention of defending myself.\" \nIn an interview Thursday with MSNBC , an Umpqua student and veteran with a concealed carry permit, John Parker, Jr., said he considered intervening during the shooting but decided to stay in a classroom to guard other students and staff. \n\"I was prepared to defend the classroom,\" Parker said. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
