During the event, FPL announced that it will award a $5,000 renewable scholarship to a high school senior who has participated for two or more years in a FIRST ® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science) robotics program in FPL's service area, has a cumulative GPA of 3.5 and has been accepted to an accredited four-year college or university majoring in engineering or information technology. Provided the student maintains a college GPA of 3.0, the scholarship is renewable for up to four years, totaling $20,000 in college tuition assistance.\n\"Robotics programs help prepare today's students for exciting, well-paying jobs in the future – and these are the employees that FPL and other Florida companies will need going forward,\" said Silagy. \"Students who participate in these programs not only learn engineering and programming skills, but gain team and creative experiences that will help them thrive in a competitive work environment.\"\nAcross the state, FPL sponsors 50 robotics teams and also sponsors the Southeast Florida FIRST regional competition, which will be held in West Palm Beach in 2016.\n\"We want Florida to be first for jobs, and we must have a skilled workforce to reach that goal. By investing in science, technology, engineering and math education, we are ensuring our students are prepared for the jobs of the future,\" said Governor Scott.\nRecently, FPL provided a $25,000 matching grant to the North East Florida Educational Consortium (NEFEC) and the Foundation for Rural Education Excellence, its charitable arm, to start 15 FIRST programs in rural Northeast Florida . Additionally, FPL will sponsor the 2016 Northeast Florida FIRST robotics regional competition held in the spring at the University of North Florida.\nIn all, nearly 1,300 Florida schools have been touched by an FPL education program, including robotics clubs, an electric car build as part of the Miami ePrix electric race series and \"Men in Plaid,\" a traveling school assembly show about energy conservation. FPL has constructed more than 125 school solar energy stations and trained nearly 600 teachers in a curriculum used in conjunction with the solar stations. Last year, FPL hosted two STEM teachers from the School District of Palm Beach County in paid \"externships.\" The teachers spent the summer working alongside FPL professionals, seeing firsthand how skills acquired in STEM curricula translate into real world jobs – insights they will take back to their classrooms.\nFor more information on FPL's education programs please visit www.FPL.com/education .\nTo download photos and video from today's event please visit: www.FPL.com/newsroom .\nFlorida Power & Light Company\nFlorida Power & Light Company is the third-largest electric utility in the United States , serving approximately 4.8 million customer accounts across nearly half of the state of Florida.
