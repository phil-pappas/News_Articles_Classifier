The bakery in the recently finished City Center DC is the prelude to the opening of Momofuku, Chang’s first DC restaurant of his renowned, Japanese-inspired restaurant empire. #DC , we're pumped to FINALLY OPEN. come see us & bring your camera. 7a-midnight everyday. #milkbardc pic.twitter.com/oPxz8p5NPt \n— momofuku milk bar (@milkbarstore) October 23, 2015 \n\nChang is not the only celebrity chef to be drawn to the area in recent months. \nIn September, Edward Lee of Louisville’s 610 Magnolia fame opened his latest restaurant, Succotash in National Harbor. \nMomofuku’s nearby neighbor in CityCenter is DGBG, which opened last fall, the first D.C. iteration of Daniel Bouloud ’s high end New York, Vegas, and European eateries. Image via The Riggsby \nBoston’s Michael Schlow has opened two D.C. establishments in the last year, Tico on 14th St., and The Riggsby, which recently made Washington Post critic Tom Sistema’s top 10 in the paper’s fall dining guide . \nIt's not just top tier imports either. Local talent is also capitalizing on the steady rising demand for fine dining. \nChef Jose Andres , the culinary titan who has dominated DC’s fine dining with his cadre of Chinatown restaurants, is expanding into gourmet fast casual with vegetarian-focused Beefsteak. \nDefending the title of Bon Appetit’s “Best New Restaurant in America 2014,” Chef Aaron Silverman of Rose’s Luxury is planning to launch a second restaurant , Pineapple and Pearls, early next year. Masseria \nAnd local chef Nicholas Stefanelli also nabbed a top 3 a spot on Sistema’s fall dining list with his new hip establishment, Masseria. \nAdding to the District’s culinary chops was the news this week that 3 D.C. chefs, Marjorie Meek - Bradley of Roofers Union, Garret Fleming of Barrel, and Kwami Onwuachi of soon-to-open Bijou, would be a part of the 17 member cast for the next season of Top Chef, more than from any other city. \nAs the District’s population has shifted in the past decade, and an influx of higher-net worth millennials fills glass block condo buildings in neighborhoods like NoMa and Shaw, the restaurant industry is seizing on an opportunity. And though D.C.’s quintessential white table cloth steak house network is still confident in it’s role in the city, it’s clear the times are changing. \nThe huge volume of star-studded openings in the last year prove that D.C. is the place to be for innovative chefs, and with residents lining up along the sidewalks of Barracks Row and City Center to taste their cooking, the District just might be the hottest dining city in America right now.
