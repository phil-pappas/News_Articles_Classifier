He said this while addressing a meeting of party workers from 11 Bihar districts. 1\nShah also accused chief minister Nitish Kumar and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad of taking potshots against the BJP to divert people’s attention from various issues. \nAcknowledging internal problems in the state unit during ticket distribution, Shah told party workers, “We must collectively work towards the victory of NDA candidates.” \nDubbing rival parties in the state as “pseudo-secular”, Shah said since these parties cannot match the BJP , they are trying to raise identity politics issues why don’t hold water now. \nDescribing Nitish as a “backstabber”, Shah said he left the BJP for his own political aspirations and joined Lalu, a symbol of 15-years of jungle raj, and lawlessness, in Bihar. \n“ India under Narendra Modi is taking giant strides. There is a change in how other countries look at India now. During Manmohan Singh ’s tenure, even small countries seemed to rub us the wrong way,” said Shah.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T14:14:20.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
