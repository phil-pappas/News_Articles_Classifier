Lee / The Tennessean) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThose readers who have experience selling know that the best outcome from your presentation is a fast “yes,” but also know that second-best is a fast “no.” \nThe killer is a slow \"no,\" or, sometimes, even a slow \"yes.\" \nWhat outcome did \"death with dignity\" get? \nChancellor Carol McCoy ruled Tuesday that John Jay Hooker and his physicians, who pleaded before her court on July 10, 80 days prior, for dispensation on the wish to commit suicide by taking prescribed medication, have no standing to sue Gov. Bill Haslam and other officers of the state and courts to strike down Tennessee’s proscription on physician-assisted suicide. Judge rules against legalizing assisted suicide in Tennessee \nNo harm, no foul, the chancellor said on the request to rule whether terminally ill Tennesseans' right to privacy entitles them to receive a legal prescription enabling suicide. \n“The facts submitted by the Physicians lack an injury-in-fact,” McCoy ruled. “Mr. Hooker is still alive and no one has been or is threatened with criminal prosecution.” \nThe initial reports of McCoy’s ruling said she rejected Hooker’s request for “death with dignity” — giving Tennessee’s great gadfly a slow no, but, maybe, her ruling is really a slow yes. \nHooker has stage IV metastatic cancer and has been diagnosed as terminal. He is “still alive,” as the chancellor noted, and continues to fight for both his life and the right to die with dignity when the time is appropriate to him. John Jay Hooker still fighting, for life and death \nHooker’s co-plaintiffs, Drs. Barton Campbell, Jeffrey Sosman and Robert Ballard, who sought an injunction from prosecution if they prescribed a sufficient amount of sedatives to kill Hooker, have no standing because they have not yet committed the crime of “physician-assisted suicide” and so cannot claim they face imminent harm. \nIn fact, McCoy noted, the doctors were very circumspect in whether they even would prescribe the medicine — they would have to evaluate Hooker before prescribing — and stated they would be prescribing medicine to relieve his pain and discomfort. \nThe doctors have not, yet, violated the law, so they can’t sue. Thinking about committing a crime is not the same as committing it. (I have to agree with Chancellor McCoy on this one; otherwise I would have to turn myself in for many different violations in thought.) \nHooker, who sat through the July proceedings in a wheelchair, was disappointed that McCoy did not rule in his favor and was deeply angered by the slow no. \n“She could have made this ruling from the bench,” Hooker said. “Instead, she waited almost 90 days, when she knew, she knew, that I am under a sentence of death. \n“Time is of the essence, not just for me, but for those who want to know if they can die with dignity!” \nOne of Hooker’s attorneys, Cynthia Chappell, said they filed an appeal Thursday challenging the chancellor’s ruling. \nBut what does McCoy’s ruling really mean? \nI appreciate and understand Hooker’s anger — and am glad for it, truth be told, as it stokes his will to continue fighting, to stick with a discomforting and painful experimental treatment for his cancer, and to stay vibrant instead of depressed by his diagnosis. \nBut I was intrigued by what else McCoy said in her ruling. \n“The Act,” she wrote, “focuses on the intent (McCoy's emphasis) of the physician who prescribes life-ending medication; none of the Physicians have declared that they have or will prescribe a medication with the purpose or intent to end his life.” \nThe physicians said they “are willing to consider writing a prescription for medication for aid-in-dying to mentally competent and terminally ill adult patients to ease their suffering and provide comfort but for the exposure to felony criminal prosecution for doing so,” McCoy quoted, and also noted two other parts of the complaint citing the doctors' emphasis on pain relief and comfort. \n“Nothing in the Act bars the Physicians from such conduct; indeed,” she stated, “the Act clearly states that it is not an offense to … \n\"(2) Prescribe, dispense, or administer medications or perform medical procedures calculated or intended to relieve another person’s pain or discomfort but not calculated or intended to cause death, even if the medications or medical procedures may hasten or increase the risk of death; or \n\"(3) Fail to prevent another from bringing about that person’s own death.\" Dying, naturally, is our right \nMcCoy, who in her opening remarks at the July 10 hearing shared her own experience with the death of a loved one, and the use of palliative care, understands the fine line doctors and patients tread. \nMany readers of my column, particularly the lawyers, make clear, mincing no words in questioning what standing I have to write about our courts and justice system, that I am not a lawyer, but … \nThe way I read this order it says that Tennessee law protects doctors who prescribe medications that could be used by patients to commit suicide as long as the intent for the prescription is to relieve pain and suffering. And physicians cannot be held accountable if their patients choose to use the medication for their own purpose. \nI cannot wait to find out how this turns out. \nReach Frank Daniels III at 615-881-7039 and on Twitter @fdanielsiii.
