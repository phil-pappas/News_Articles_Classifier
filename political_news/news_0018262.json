Former neurosurgeon Ben Carson’s campaign posted a video to Facebook Friday that showed his staff using the memoir for a series of things – a computer stand, step stool and weights, among them – none of which involved reading it.\nRand Paul put his copy on eBay — as of Friday morning it was going for $12,100.\n“GET YOUR OWN SIGNED COPY OF A GREAT FICTION BOOK!” the description reads.\nThough the book will go to one lucky bidder, Paul wrote a personal note to Clinton.\n“Your refusal to provide security for our mission in Benghazi should forever preclude you from higher office!” the Kentucky senator wrote with his signature.\n“Senator Paul is a great fan of fiction, and he's not seen such revisionist history in years. He did flip through the book and right away decided it would sell a lot better under fiction,” Paul’s Communication Director Sergio Gor told POLITICO. “We didn't have much use for the book, but thought someone out there might be interested in reading why she should forever be precluded from holding higher office.”\nJeb Bush referenced Clinton’s book Thursday during an interview with Hugh Hewitt as a way to describe her stance on trade, which the Bush campaign called a “flip-flop.”\n“I found it interesting that Hillary Clinton, in her book that she apparently sent me, talks glowingly about supporting the Trans-Pacific trade agreement and now has come out four-square against it because, again, popular sentiment in the here and now apparently on the left is opposed to this,” Bush said. “That kind of leadership is exactly what we don't need anymore.\"\nMike Huckabee fired off a series of social media posts about receiving the book. “Hillary's book ‘Hard Choices’, which she mailed to GOP candidates, arrived today. I'm anxious to read her next book, ‘Hard-Drive Choices,’ that she writes from prison. How many pages will be deleted?” Huckabee posted on Facebook.\nGov. John Kasich’s campaign said they had received the book and they had no plans for it. But spokesman Rob Nichols told POLITICO that a different letter that had the Clinton logo on it arrived at the Governor’s Mansion recently — addressed to former Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat who left office in 2011.\n\"We get a lot of junk mail. We also got this, so I'm not sure who is in charge of quality control at her end,” Nichols said, referring to the letter addressed to Strickland.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/231713581239", "https://video.xx.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xpt1/v/t42.1790-2/12094505_538996829600121_318138740_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InNkIn0%3D&oh=0f0fe0ffc8aca4318f9b6bd8f6836f65&oe=56180AA8", "https://www.facebook.com/mikehuckabee/posts/10153322435712869"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:40:09.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
