Tuesday's Congressional hearing about defunding Planned Parenthood was to be the centerpiece of the right wing's orchestrated attack campaign. The problem was that in recent weeks we've learned the gotcha videos at the center of the campaign were deceptively edited. And so far six statewide investigations have found no wrongdoing on the part of Planned Parenthood. That meant the Congressional production was likely destined for failure.\"The entire hearing was premised on a series of mischaracterizations,\" reported The New Yorker. Republicans were left with little but bouts of bullying in an effort to intimidate Planned Parenthood chief Cecile Richards as she testified. It didn't work. So after ten weeks, the sustained attack against Planned Parenthood produced no tangible evidence of wrongdoing and no serious damage to the organization. (Of course, despite their failures so far, Republicans are now reportedly considering creating \"a special panel to investigate Planned Parenthood.\") . . . Corporations are trying to once again control the message of the elections. So far, all they've shown is the incompetency of their republican party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:34:40.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
