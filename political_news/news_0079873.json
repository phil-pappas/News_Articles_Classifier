In this 16th year, those notables have included Sigourney Weaver, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeffrey Tambor and Damian Lewis, not to mention music names like Billy Joel and Patti Smith. (Nearly 20,000 people attended this year, from every state except North Dakota, and from 36 countries — including Latvia, Macedonia and Kuwait.)\nBut the festival also touches on the more urgent questions of the day, and this year, that included the upcoming presidential election and the earthquake risk in the Pacific Northwest.\nA panel on the fault line known as the Cascadia subduction zone, which runs from northern California through Oregon and Washington, was pretty much just as scary as the much-discussed July New Yorker article about it. It began with a compilation of photos and film clips from the most devastating earthquakes of the last century, ending with a few seconds from the humorously unrealistic movie \"San Andreas.\" Schulz, who wrote the article and moderated the panel, quipped that the magazine's famously exacting fact-checkers should have paid better attention.\nBut the discussion immediately turned serious, with experts explaining how the risk in the subduction zone is more serious than the San Andreas fault, with the potential of an earthquake measuring 8.3 to 9.2 on the Richter scale. Even worse would be the resulting tsunami, and chances of survival in the inundation zone, panelists agreed, were \"very, very grim.\"\nCarmen Merlo, of the Bureau of Emergency Management in Portland, Oregon, outlined how much preparedness work remained to be done, noting it would cost hundreds of billions of dollars to retrofit metropolitan Portland alone — and that none of the city's bridges were seismically fit.\nAt least, noted panelist Chris Goldfinger of Oregon State University, plenty of people in Portland own kayaks.\nSchulz responded: \"Tragically, you're not even joking.\"\nAt another panel, the only earthquakes considered were of a political nature. Specifically, panelists were discussing \"The Hillary Question.\" While the email controversy clouding Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign was not a major topic of discussion, questions of gender and double standards were.\n\"When did it become about, 'Do I want to have dinner with this person?' asked author Roxane Gay, referring to the \"likeability\" question. \"I don't want to have dinner with any of the candidates. I have friends.\"\nOne of the most passionate interchanges of the discussion, moderated by writer Jill Lepore, came when an audience member asked whether there was a sense among women \"that Hillary is not quite one of the girls — one of us.\" Gay responded: \"That's nonsense. That's jealousy. She was the first first lady to have a graduate degree, the first to have a career. We need to look at these women not as 'not like us,' but as people we can aspire to be.\"\nClinton also came up in a conversation between Sigourney Weaver and New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane, when Weaver expressed the hope that Clinton would be the next president — and that more women would get into Congress. She also decried what she called the demonizing of Planned Parenthood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:45:12.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
