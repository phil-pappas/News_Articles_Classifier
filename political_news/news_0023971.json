LePage's actions in firing Comment Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 7:21 AM Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 7:21 AM » Social News AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) — The chairman of a school that was threatened with a loss of funding is going to be testifying before the Maine Legislature's Government Oversight Committee. Good Will-Hinckley Chairman Jack Moore is expected to take questions Thursday, but several members of Gov. Paul LePage's administration have declined to appear. Moore is the recipient of a handwritten note from LePage that threatened to withdraw support over the hiring of one of the governor's political foes. Good Will-Hinckley's board later rescinded the job offer to Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves. Eves responded by suing the governor. LePage was an early supporter of Good Will-Hinckley and its charter school, the Maine Academy of Natural Sciences. He and the Harold Alfond Foundation were pivotal in helping get the school onto sound financial footing. seacoastonline.com Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 7:21 AM » Comment or view comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:41:22.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
