That report identified the need for the Ministry to significantly improve how it prepares for, and responds to, biosecurity incursions. \nOur follow-up audit this year reviewed what progress the Ministry has made to address the recommendations in our 2013 report. We found that the Ministry has made good progress with how it prepares for, and responds to, biosecurity incursions. The Ministry has prepared a response model to deal with all types of responses. The Ministry’s investment in a model that streamlines many processes and allows a consistent approach gives it a solid foundation for responding consistently. \nThe Ministry is better prepared for a potential outbreak of foot and mouth disease than in 2013. It continues to work on improving its foot and mouth disease preparedness programme. \nThis report also identifies other areas where the Ministry has made progress, such as working better with response partners, introducing performance measures to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of responses, and supporting a culture of continuous improvement. The Ministry is aware of the need to continue to make improvements to how it prepares for, and responds to, biosecurity incursions and is committed to ongoing improvements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:00:05.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
