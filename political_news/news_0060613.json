We have something missing and we need a teacher that can fill that void,\" he said.\nSyrian refugees, who say they often feel unwelcome in Egypt, have gradually carved out a community of their own here in 6th of October, a Cairo suburb. They have moved into Syrian-majority neighborhoods and started businesses, and many are now enrolling their children in classes run by and for refugees.\nSome 128,000 Syrian refugees are registered in Egypt, according to the U.N. refugee agency, but the actual number is believed to be much higher. There are no refugee camps in Egypt, so the vast majority live in dense urban areas alongside Egyptians.\nSyrians in Egypt encountered growing hostility after the 2013 military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi, who had backed the Syrian uprising. Egyptian media cast Syrians as troublemakers who had taken part in protests calling for Morsi's reinstatement. Rights groups said hundreds of Syrians faced prolonged detention or deportation, and Egypt also began requiring that Syrians obtain entry visas.\nTensions have eased since then, but life for Syrian refugees in Egypt remains difficult, particularly for children, many of whom are behind in school after missing months or years of classes because of the conflict. Egypt's public schools are overcrowded and chaotic, and Egyptians speak a different dialect of Arabic that can be hard for some Syrians to follow.\nThe Civilization Builders Educational Center, where Basil attends class, is one of several centers in 6th of October established to provide a better learning environment for the refugees.\n\"Education is the most important thing for a Syrian who has left his country, so opening a school for them will give them knowledge, that when we go back to our country one day they can rebuild it,\" said Tarik al-Harki, who teaches high school English at the center. The center, which opened this year, also teaches a small number of Iraqi, Libyan and Egyptian students, and has two Egyptian teachers.\nThe sounds of drilling and hammering from elsewhere in the unfinished building echo through the classrooms, and workers splattered with paint walk through the halls past brightly colored murals.\nThe center is led by Hossam Joubi, who worked as a teacher in the Syrian city of Aleppo for more than 30 years before he was forced to flee and still sports the tweed jacket and reading glasses of a veteran educator.\nHe said that the center, which is run by fellow refugees, is able to provide \"psychological and social support\" for the 500 students who attend classes there. \"The Egyptian teachers might not be able to do that.\"\nPolitical discussions are not allowed. Joubi said the students are \"already hurt by what they saw from destruction and devastation, so we try to make them forget this, through sports and other activities, such as arts, singing, acting and drawing.\"\nThe center teaches the Egyptian national curriculum and has an agreement with an Egyptian private school, where the students take end-of-term exams and where their degrees will ultimately come from. Syrians have been allowed to register at Egyptian public schools since 2012, and about 35,000 are enrolled. Another 6,000 attend \"non-formal education opportunities\" like the center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:16:07.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
