Many of our volunteers either helped build our B-29 when it came off the assembly line at Boeing Wichita in 1945 or served our nation in a B-29 during conflict. Some have even carried out their volunteer work to honor a loved one who either served our nation in a B-29 or was member of Wichita aviation work force during the 1940s and 50s.\"\nThe restoration team recently successfully started and ran all four engines as they prepare for an Airworthiness Certificate from the FAA, which could be received in the next few weeks. Following certification, the crew will embark on ground and taxi testing before eventually entering into the test flight status. Murphy and the Doc's Friends restoration team are hopeful they can reach the first flight milestone before the end of the year.\nIn order to reach the first flight milestone, Doc's Friends continues a Kickstarter fundraising campaign to cover the costs of engine, taxi, and flight-testing.\n\"It's all about getting the plane back into the air,\" Turner said. \"Every dollar matters, and it all goes into the cost of restoring the plane. Every single pledge will make a difference, whether it's $10 , $25 , or $1 ,000-and we're running out of time.\"\nThe Kickstarter campaign runs through the end of October.
