Asked later for his impressions on a day at the UN that included a 90-minute meeting with Mr Obama, he said: “It is too bad I did not get to see New York. It is a large, great city.” \nThroughout the course of a week that has mixed high diplomacy with dramatic military action, Mr Putin has gone out of his way to always appear one step ahead and to subtly undermine the American president. More Migrants reignite German foreign policy \nThe Russian leader presented himself to the UN general assembly as the real champion of the international fight against Islamist terrorism and when Russia launched its first air strikes in Syria on Wednesday, his officials gave Washington only one hour’s warning . \nThe personal mixing with the political, Russia’s decision to intervene directly this week in Syria’s multi-headed civil war has gone in tandem with an attempt to present Mr Putin as a respected world leader and Mr Obama as the head of a declining power in the Middle East. One of the few things the two men seem to share is a deep mutual disrespect. \nYet for all the tactical boldness that has left the White House firmly on the back foot, Mr Putin risks plunging Russia into the very quagmire in Syria that Mr Obama has long warned of. “He is pouring gasoline on the fire,” said Ashton Carter, the US defence secretary. \nMr Putin’s duel with Mr Obama this week has resonated beyond the Syrian war because it plays into the pervasive critique of the American president as a well-meaning but hesitant ingénue in a world of hard-headed great powers. Such views are often shared by frustrated allies in the Middle East, some of whom look kindly on Russia’s intervention. Haider al-Abadi, Iraq’s prime minister, said on Thursday that Baghdad would “welcome” Russian air strikes against Isis in his country. \nHaving spent so much energy berating the president for being weak and slow to react, Mr Obama’s conservative critics at home could not conceal a hint of admiration for Mr Putin’s decisiveness. \n“It is very bold,” said Mac Thornberry, the Republican chair of the House armed services committee. “It really does go back to that old line that people attribute to Lenin: Probe with a bayonet and if you encounter mush, continue. If you hit steel, stop. That’s what Putin is doing.” \nAnd it is not just Republicans who are critical. Former Clinton administration official David Rothkopf wrote: “For those who missed it, here is a summary of Obama’s UN remarks: “Good morning. Cupcakes. Unicorns. Rainbows. Putin is mean. Thank you very much.”’ More video \nAt times, Mr Putin seemed to echo the moral clarity with which George W Bush talked about the threat of terrorism, but which Mr Obama shuns as simplistic. \nCalling for an alliance against Islamist extremism “similar to the anti-Hitler coalition”, Mr Putin appealed to “forces willing to resolutely resist those who sow evil and hatred of humankind”. His foreign minister Sergei Lavrov commented: “If it looks like a terrorist, if it acts like a terrorist, if it walks like a terrorist, if it fights like a terrorist, it’s a terrorist, right?” \nConfronted with the neoconservative claim that American leadership can shape events on the ground, the president’s brand of realism would counter that even a superpower has to deal with the world as it is. Mr Obama has argued for four years that the US cannot resolve the sectarian rifts that drive Syria’s civil war.
