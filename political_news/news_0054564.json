The updated scale – MP-2015 – reflects a trend toward somewhat smaller improvements in longevity.\n\"The data continues to show that people are living longer, but longevity is increasing at a slower rate than previously available data indicated,\" said Dale Hall , managing director of research for the Society. \"The new improvement scale will ensure the pension actuarial community has the most up-to-date information available to help them accurately measure private retirement plan obligations.\"\nIn October 2014 , the Society released the RP-2014 base mortality tables and MP-2014 improvement scale, the first update to the SOA's pension plan mortality tables in more than a decade. At that time, the SOA indicated the mortality improvement scale (used to project mortality rates) would be updated more frequently as new longevity data became available. The improvement scale released today includes Social Security Administration mortality data from 2010 and 2011.\nThe SOA's preliminary estimates suggest that updating to the MP-2015 scale released today might reduce a plan's liabilities by between zero and two percent, depending on each plan's specific characteristics.\nAccording to Hall, \"Every plan is different, and it is important that professionals working in this field perform their own calculations on the impact to their plan. It is up to plan sponsors, working with their plan actuaries, to determine whether to incorporate MP-2015 into their plan valuations.\"\nThe updated mortality improvement scale was developed by the SOA's Retirement Plans Experience Committee (RPEC).\nFor more information, view a full version of the Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2015 report.\nAbout Actuaries\nActuaries bring a complex future into focus by applying unique insight to risk and opportunity.
