Bernie Sanders are in a dead heat in New Hampshire after the first Democratic Debate, according to a new poll released Friday. The Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll conducted in the two days following Tuesday's debate reverses a trend in a series of surveys in the early primary state that had shown Clinton trailing Sanders substantially, another sign of the former secretary of state's strong performance in Tuesday's debate. In the Friday poll , Clinton led Sanders 37% to 35%, a statistical tie well within the poll's margin of error. A CNN poll last month had the Vermont senator leading the former secretary of state 46% to 30%. Vice President Joe Biden, who is still undecided on a presidential run, was in third, at 11%.
