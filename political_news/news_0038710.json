Williams name was on the list. Coppadge said Williams has no recollection of being asked for support from the Clinton campaign. The mayor's office is reaching out to the Clinton campaign for a correction, she said. \nA spokeswoman for Clinton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nBiden is considering a presidential campaign but has not announced his plans. He was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, but has lived in Delaware most of his life.
