David Vitter and Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle's campaigns, Angelle is either an Obama-loving former Democrat or a reliable right-wing conservative.\nA Vitter campaign ad attacking Angelle has become known as the \"Obamaphone\" ad. In it, a sinister-sounding announcer says that Angelle voted to \"expand the Obamaphone program to give people on welfare free cell phones and free Internet that you pay for.\"\nThe ad plays off a 2012 video in which a Cleveland woman says she is voting for President Barack Obama because he got her a free cell phone. What she's referring to is a federal program that dates to the Reagan administration that provides reduced-cost phone service to low-income households, but it has become the target of conservatives like Vitter who told Politico in March that \"The free government cell phone program is beyond reform and should be ended.\"\nThe ad has pushed the Angelle campaign into a contest with Vitter over which candidate is more conservative. And that may be just want Vitter wants, as the two Republicans will be competing for the same conservative voters that have always been Vitter's base.\n\"Angelle never voted for Obamaphones or increased state spending,\" Angelle's response ad said, with a huge red \"Conservative\" label slapped on the screen. \"But Vitter voted to raise the national debt ceiling five times.\"\nMeanwhile, Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne, who has consistently promoted himself as an anti-abortion conservative, hasn't waded into the advertisement wars. Although Vitter has run ads asking \"How liberal is Jay Dardenne?\" and accused the former state senator of \"voting for abortion six times,\" Dardenne's ads have not directly responded.\nPearson Cross, a political science professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, said Angelle is taking a risk by getting into the who's-a-bigger-conservative contest with Vitter.\n\"I think Vitter pretty much has the very conservative voters sewn up in that race,\" Cross said. \"Angelle was a Democrat and Dardenne has always been seen as a garden variety, country club moderate Republican. So if (Angelle) responds by going farther right I don't know that it serves him that well.\nAngelle's best chance is to find people who won't vote for a Democrat but don't like Vitter,\" Cross said.\nRyan Cross (no relation to Pearson Cross), a spokesman for the Angelle campaign, disagrees. He said the strategy has always been to emphasize Angelle's conservative credentials. Angelle also ran ads about conservative issues such as religious freedom and the importance of getting people off welfare before the Vitter attack ads ran.\n\"We've seen two things change in this race: We've seen David Vitter fall (in the polls) and seen Scott Angelle climb,\" Ryan Cross said. \"Those voters as they've gotten to know Scott have left Sen. Vitter. It's clear that a majority -- a large majority -- of Louisiana is conservative and they're not looking for a governor who only tells them half the story.\"\nMarsanne Golsby, a spokeswoman for the Dardenne campaign, said there are a lot of voters in the middle who still aren't spoken for. Those are the voters Dardenne is seeking to appeal to, as well as conservative women who have a distaste for Vitter being tied to a prostitution scandal.\n\"We're going after a broader range of voters than the group Scott is going after,\" Golsby said. \"We're running right up the middle. He's got a lot of women that are very conservative that are supporting him, and he's got a lot of folks in the middle that like how he's got a history of bipartisanship and not grandstanding and pandering.\"\nA spokesman for Vitter's campaign, Luke Bolar, declined to discuss the strategy behind what the ads are seeking to achieve. But he did say he thought the ads were accurate.\n\"I don't know how he can portray himself as the real conservative,\" Bolar said. \"He has zero record as a real conservative aside from what he's said.\"\n. . . . . .
