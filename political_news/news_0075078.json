The showdown will give Sanders his first broad national exposure and offer Clinton a chance to ease the concerns some Democrats have about her. \nAfter two raucous Republican debates that drew big television audiences attracted by the fireworks generated by front-runner Donald Trump, the Democratic encounter in Las Vegas, is likely to be a tamer affair. \nIt comes at a critical time for Clinton, whose once overwhelming lead among Democrats in polls has slipped amid questions about her use of a private email server instead of a government account when she was secretary of state. \nIn addition, she faces the threat that Vice President Joe Biden could enter the race - something he has been increasingly urged to do as Clinton's lead falters. \nDraft Biden, a political action committee created to urge the vice president to jump into the race, on Tuesday released a new ad portraying him as an advocate for the dignity of work. \nAlmost half of the nationâ€™s Democrats want Biden to run, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday. \nForty-eight percent of Democrats surveyed wish he were a candidate, compared with 30 percent who said he should stay out. \nSANDERS EXCITEMENT \nSanders, a self-described socialist, has excited the party's \nleft wing and generated big crowds with a message of eradicating income inequality and reining in Wall Street. \nIn response, Clinton took stances on several key issues recently that align her with Sanders. She reversed course to announce her opposition to the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that she had praised when she was secretary of state, and she rejected the Keystone XL pipeline that she had said in 2010 she was inclined to approve. Sanders is a longtime opponent of both projects. \nSanders, who has repeatedly refused to directly attack Clinton, signaled over the weekend he would make an issue in the debate of Clinton's tardiness in embracing liberal positions on some of those topics, noting he opposed Keystone and the TPP \"from day one.\" \nClinton, who still faces ambivalence about her candidacy from much of the union rank-and-file, won praise from labor leaders for her opposition to the TPP. Labor has opposed the pact out of fear it would cost manufacturing jobs and weaken environmental laws. \n\"I don't think she ever had any inclination to back TPP,\" said R. Thomas Buffenbarger, a Clinton ally who is president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which has endorsed Clinton. \nSome subtle policy differences remain between the two top Democratic contenders. Sanders has pushed for what he calls a sensible approach on gun control and voted against the 1993 Brady handgun bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law. \nClinton broke with the White House to back a no-fly zone in Syria to give refugees a safe corridor. Sanders opposes it, saying it could be a step toward pulling the United States into Syria's civil war. \nSanders has discouraged Super PACs from raising funds on his behalf, warning of the influence of corporate money. Clinton is backed by several Super PACs. \nEric Davis, a professor emeritus of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont, expects Sanders \"to have a vigorous critique of Hillary Clinton on things like campaign finance,\" saying he can criticize her for \"the way she is financing her campaign and her perceived closeness to Wall Street interests.\" \n(Additional reporting by Alistair Bell ; Editing by Leslie Adler and James Dalgleish ) Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greets members of the culinary workers union local 226 after speaking at a demonstration outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada October 12, 2015.
