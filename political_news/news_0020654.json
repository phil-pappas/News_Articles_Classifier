Paul Ryan (R-WI) speaks during a press conference at the Union League Club of Chicago August 21, 2014 in Chicago, Ilinois. John Gress, Getty Images \nGOP leaders are begging Wisconsin's Paul Ryan to run for House speaker as the GOP rushes to try to fill a power vacuum, following Kevin McCarthy's sudden withdrawal from the race for the post Thursday . \nBut Ryan said despite being \"grateful for the encouragement,\" he will not be running. \nThe problem now is there aren't many people who want to lead a party that is this divided, reports CBS News correspondent Nancy Cordes. \nSome lawmakers were even in tears following McCarthy's abrupt announcement, upset that what should have been an orderly transition of power has descended into what many of them called chaos. \nMcCarthy had faced opposition from the same 40 hard-line conservatives who wanted to unseat the current speaker, John Boehner. \nTim Huelskamp of Kansas said McCarthy's exit from the race is a victory for the American people. \n\"They want Congress to respect conservatives and other members of Congress and that hasn't happened very much in the last four and a half years,\" said Huelskamp. \nBut not everyone saw it that way, like New York congressman Peter King. \n\"We can't allow a small minority of 30-35 people to hijack the House of Representatives,\" said King. \nFlorida Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called it \"a fight for the soul of the GOP.\" \n\"We need somebody who's willing to negotiate and talk to the other side, and those are not bad ways to govern,\" Lehtinen said. \nThree days ago, North Carolina Republican Walter Jones sent a letter to Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers saying if any candidate for speaker has committed any \"misdeeds,\" he should \"withdraw\" from the race. McCarthy denied that this was behind his sudden move. \nThe chaos surrounding the speaker election comes as Congress faces looming deadlines, including the vote to raise the debt ceiling by Nov. 5 and finding a way to fund the government by December. \nBoehner says he will stay on until a new speaker is elected.
