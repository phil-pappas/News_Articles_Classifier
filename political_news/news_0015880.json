Friday, 16 October 2015, 1:20 pm \nWhy is so much of the Palestinian suffering never considered newsworthy? \nAn urgent request to the news media \nPress Release |16 October 2015: \nLeslie Bravery, Palestine Human Rights Campaign Aotearoa/New Zealand www.palestine.org.nz \nRight now Israeli-Occupied East Jerusalem is much in the news because of the sudden eruption of violence by Palestinian youngsters venting their anger and frustration. These young people have grown up under Israeli military occupation, in an imposed atmosphere of contempt and oppression that was not of their making. The news media have the responsibility to present as balanced a view as possible. \nJust to take the past week alone, if the news of thePalestinian violence had been equally balanced with news of Israeli Army and settler violence, then most of the news broadcasting time, and several pages of newspaper columns, would have been devoted to the appalling violence suffered by Palestinians. All we ask is that more attention be paid to context and balance. Why is so much of the Palestinian suffering never considered newsworthy? Some very recent examples: \n27 Palestinians killed, 1400 injured and 400 taken prisoner so far this month alone (13 October). http://icj.einnews.com/article/291313623/s8_Iw2iPO9V2q0LR \nIn Israeli-Occupied East Jerusalem: 15-year-old Hassan Khaled Mahayna killed by Israeli forces: ambulance held up deliberately: Video. The boy's cousin, Ahmed (13), was also seriously wounded as settlers scream “Die!”. Watch as a number of people stand around and do nothing to help the injured boy. One even pushes him with his foot! An ambulance is forced to move away! \nhttp://www.africametro.com/headline/15-year-old-hassan-khaled-mahayna-killed-by-israeli-forces-ambulance-deliberately-delayed-watch-video-viewer-discretion-is-advised \nPregnant woman and child killed – family injured – home destroyed: \nCeasefire violation – air strike – 2 dead – 4 injured: Gaza – 10 October 02:05 , Israeli war planes carried out two air strikes on the al-Zaytoun neighbourhood, destroying a home and killing a pregnant woman, Nour Hassan, and her two-year-old child, Yahya Hassan, injuring four other members of her family: Mohammad Hassan (5), Yahya Hassan, Najah Rasmi, and Mohammad Hassan. \nhttp://palestine.org.nz/phrc/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2883&Itemid=44 \nEscalating tear-gas deployment against schoolchildren in Hebron. The onslaught began at7:41 am when a crowd of children could be heard playing noisily in the street near several primary schools. Suddenly their laughter turned to screams and the sound of running and gunfire as the first canisters were shot and could be seen flying over the crowd with their white streams of gas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:42:23.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
