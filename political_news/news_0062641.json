It comes at a significant time in the area of social housing with central government and local authorities reviewing their housing portfolios, and the start of social housing transfers in Invercargill and Tauranga. \n‘This Heads of Agreement is a visionary initiative,’ Victoria Kingi, spokesperson for the Consortium said. The Tauranga Consortium comprises three Bay of Plenty Treaty Settlement Tribes - Nga Potiki a Tamapahore Trust, Tapuika Iwi Authority and Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Ranginui Settlement Trust – established to bid for the transfer of social housing in the Tauranga area. \n“As Treaty Settlement Tribes and Community Housing Providers, we believe, like Trust House Masterton, that our community is best placed to take responsibility for social housing in our region. Our Consortium has the capability, the commitment and the historical knowledge to achieve the best results.” \n‘This is about collaboration and partnership,’ Allan Pollard, Trust House Masterton Chief Executive said. ‘We have a common commitment to our own communities and the drive to succeed. We were the first community house of its kind to be established in New Zealand and have 16 years of experience behind us. This is a precedent-setting opportunity for both our organisations.’ \nMr Pollard said Trust House had a rental portfolio of 500 homes in the Wairarapa and Tararua which made a significant contribution to social housing in the region. ‘The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment approved us as New Zealand’s first registered community housing provider in 2014,’ he said. It was a major step forward in enabling local communities to take responsibility for social housing. The partnership with the Tauranga Consortium would be a ‘win win’ for both organisations. ‘We look forward to assisting the Consortium through the social housing transfer process,’ he said. \nMs Kingi said the three iwi involved in the Consortium had already been working in the area of social housing specifically in the construction of new homes for their kaumātua. “The potential for social housing to be devolved to the community is an exciting one because it offers all the benefits of local knowledge and skills coupled with initiative and the potential to work with like-minded organisations.” \nAlthough the Consortium was a comparative newcomer to the housing sector, it had already gained an appreciation of what could be achieved. By establishing a strong working relationship with Trust House, the Consortium would be able to further its social housing goals and at the same time benefit from the Masterton experience. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:55:34.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
