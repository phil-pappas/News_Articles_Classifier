October is American Cheese Month, a celebration of the many varieties of the dairy product. America is the world's cheese superpower, producing 26 percent of the world's supply. The nations of the European Union combine to produce 9.6 million metric tons of cheese annually. However, U.S. production of over 5.6 million metric tons exceeds that of the combined second to fourth place producers -Germany, France and Italy . America's annual cheese consumption averages almost 33 and half pounds per capita. A full third of this figure is accounted for by mozzarella, likely attributable to our appetite for pizza. Big Cheese is formed in America by 561 production establishments. Employing over 43,000 workers, cheese captures a $43 billion a year slice of the economy. Profile America is in its19th year as a public service of the U.S. Census Bureau.\nSources:\nCheese Month: http://www.cheesesociety.org/i-heart-cheese/american-cheese-month/\nCheese manufacturing establishments/NAICS 311513: http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=BP_2013_00A1&prodType=table\nCheese manufacturing employment and revenue/NAICS 311513:\nhttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ASM_2013_31GS101&prodType=table\nShare of world production: http://worldknowing.com/top-10-largest-cheese-producer-country-in-the-world/\nBreakdown: http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?commodity=cheese&graph=production\nConsumption: http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/detail.aspx?chartId=40062&ref=collection&embed=True\nProfile America is produced by the Center for New Media and Promotions of the U.S. Census Bureau.
