The government was defeated in a Commons vote on the final day of the 2010 parliament, losing a bid to force a secret ballot on the re-election of Bercow. The move was branded a \"grubby\" plot by Labour. But when MPs stood to applaud Walker after his impassioned speech, a visibly emotional Bercow gradually called the session to order. 2 Back in 2014, it seemed Bercow had clearly missed telling off MPs for taking too long to answer questions after Parliament's recess. The Speaker chastised several backbenchers during a heated prime minister's questions, but reserved his most vicious slap down for the prime minister. Cameron, who was reveling rubbing Ed Miliband's face in newly-released positive economic figures, was taken aback when Bercow cut him off short. \"I haven't finished,\" Cameron pleaded after he was interrupted. The Speaker, stamping his authority on the prime minister replied, \"the prime minister has finished and he can take it from me he has finished.\" 3 Bercow delivered one of his famed almighty slap-downs to Business Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday this week, branding him “discourteous and incompetent” for giving an overly-long statement on the British steel industry. Javid spent eight minutes answering a question on job losses in Redcar, Scunthorpe and Scotland – twice as long as he the time he was allocated. Bercow left the Cabinet Minister in no doubt of what he thought of his performance, coldly telling him: “It’s a considerable discourtesy or incompetence or both for the Secretary of State to take twice the length of time that is allocated for answering an urgent question.” 4 Also this week, the Speaker issued a series of shock digs at Chinese President Xi Jinping, snipping at the Premier ahead of his speech to Parliament. The underhanded comment was made when comparing the UK's relationships with China and India, ahead of the latter's prime minister visiting Britain next month. \"Of course the Indian prime minister is the representative of a great democracy,\" Bercow shot out of the blue in a Commons exchange. 5 In a particularly rowdy performance of PMQs, then Conservative Chief Whip Michael Gove was picked on by Bercow for misbehaving. The Speaker interrupted 2014's deafening proceedings to single out the now justice secretary for being an \"over-excited individual\". He ordered Gove to \"write out 1,000 times 'I must behave myself at Prime Minister's Questions'\" to raucous laughter. 6 George Osborne was once given an extraordinary telling off by Bercow during yet another fiery parliamentary clash. The Speaker leapt to his feet while Osborne was speaking during Treasury Questions and bellowed: “Chancellor sit down man! I told you to sit down, sit down!” A bemused Osborne, who had been responding to a question from Labour MP Barry Sheerman, sheepishly sat back down on the Government bench. Within ten minutes, Bercow was at it again - on his feet, barracking the Chancellor, but this time telling him off for not being briefer in replies to questions. He said: “Some of these answers require a bit of practice because they suffer from the disadvantage of being not just a bit long, but far too long, hopelessly long.” 7 Backbenchers are often admonished by the Speaker too. Back in 2014, Bercow shut down two MPs for being too loud at PMQs. \"Can I say to Mr Robertson - you do have something of a lion's roar and it rather lets you down, because I can hear very clearly it's you,\" he said. Proceeding to round on a second Labour MP, Bercow added: \"And as for you Mr Lucas, I've told you you need to go on some sort of therapeutic training course if you're to attain the level of statesmanship to which you aspire.\" 8 Cameron's attempt to chastise his then opponent Ed Miliband as a \"conman\" over Labour's plans to intervene directly in energy market pricing. After repeating the charge, Bercow told Cameron over a raucous Commons: \"Let me just say - order - I let it go the first time. \"The word conman is frankly unparliamentary and the prime minister is a man of great versatility in the use of language, it is a bit below the level. We'll leave it there.\" 9 One of Parliament's most famed commentators got a brutal telling-off from Bercow back in 2013, the Speaker laying in to her for repeatedly interrupting colleagues. \"Order - let me say once and for all to the Honourable Lady, who has been conducting a running commentary since she sat on that bench at the start of this debate, stop it. \"I don't wish to hear it, neither does the House. The Right Honourable Gentleman the secretary of state will respond in due course... \"I don't want to hear the sedentary chuntering and the finger-wagging and all the rest of it, the Honourable Lady - she can say 'pooh' if she wants - the Hon Lady will accept the ruling of the Chair and either leave or get out of the chamber, I don't mind which it is.\" Most Popular Videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:53:09.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
