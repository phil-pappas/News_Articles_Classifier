I have a solid record of effectiveness and success. Our city has suffered from too much sexism, racism and homophobia to just go along to get along. I challenge that every day on the Boston City Council. I challenge every department about their hiring practices, about how they are delivering services.”\nCampbell, a former Patrick administration staffer, topped the field in the preliminary election, leading Yancey by 58 percent to his 34 percent for a chance to unseat him in the Nov. 3 general election.\nCampbell said she has given her cellphone number and email address to voters.\n“I fight for my family. I will fight for you,” she said. “When you call me I’m going to call you back, that’s not going to change. When you email me, I’m going to email you back in a timely manner. I am going to stay in a space of gratitude and humility.”\nOn education, Campbell said as a councilor she would have a “bullhorn” to use on behalf of special-needs students.\nYancey said he was against expanding the number of charter schools.\n“Charter schools pose a threat to public schools,” he said. “As for experimentation within Boston Public Schools, we should support that. I would never support any measure that would support the demise of public education in Boston.”\nOn jobs, Campbell said she was endorsed by several building trades unions, which she toured in hopes of boosting jobs programs.\n“I was surprised to hear them say they had never had a District 4 city councilor tour their facilities,” she said.\nYancey said he wants to enforce provisions in city contracts that require quotas on minority hires.\n“Economic development is key,” he said.\nCampbell said she wants to improve community policing by increasing the number of minorities hired by the police department.\n“We need to do a better job of recruiting officers who look like the people in this community,” she said.\nYancey said, “I don’t think we should rely on the law enforcement model to deal with violence. I believe we should invest in young people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:24:12.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
