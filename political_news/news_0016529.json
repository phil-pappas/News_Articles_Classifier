The 2016 Democratic front-runner got off easy on the issue that's dogged her campaign for months. It received less than five minutes of attention. Her Democratic rivals were a big help, especially Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who had one of the night's most memorable lines. The American people, he said to roaring applause, “are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.”\nWhen Clinton deflected questions about her controversial private email set-up as secretary of State by changing the topic and blasting what Democrats call a politically motivated House Select Commit Benghazi panel, CNN moderator Anderson Cooper didn't aggressively challenge her.\nIt was a stark -- and, for Clinton, a very welcome -- change from the attention showered on her email practices since the spring. No one brought up, for example, the fact that hundreds of the messages sent over her private email server were later deemed classified, or pushed on the fact that the FBI is now investigating.\n“I take responsibility,” Clinton said. “I did say it was a mistake. What I did was allowed… but wasn’t the best choice.\" She noted that she turned over 55,000 pages of emails and asked that they be made public.\nThen, she quickly changed the topic to the Benghazi panel.\n“Let’s take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee,” she said. “It is a partisan vehicle as admitted by the Republican Majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers, big surprise, and that's what they have attempted to do.”\nCooper started to note that the FBI is looking into the matter and President Barack Obama said in an interview recently that the matter was a legitimate issue.\nShe agreed it was legitimate, but said, “I said I have answered all the questions.”\nClinton goes after Sanders on gun control By Daniel Strauss\nClinton, of course, has not answered “all” the questions. Lawmakers are seeking more information about how she decided what was considered a “work” message vs. what was “personal” and deleted. There's still uncertainty about who green-lighted her arrangement at the State Department, who was involved and the security set up of her network.\n\"This committee has spent $4.5 million of taxpayer money,” she continued. “I think it’s pretty clear what their obvious goal is.\"\nThen she pushed Cooper to move on: \"But tonight I’m not here to talk about my emails but what the American people want from the next president.\"\nShe got her wish.\nAfter Sanders' “sick and tired\" line, the crowd roared, Clinton shook his hand -- and that was it for the night on her most uncomfortable topic.\n“Bernie Sanders just did for Hillary what her own staff could not,\" one Clinton campaign source said: He shut down the conversation on emails.\nAnnie Karni contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:52:18.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
