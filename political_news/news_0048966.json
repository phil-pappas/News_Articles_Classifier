The inspector general’s office at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission has been investigating the group in connection with an undercover video revealing the practice.\n“The State has determined that you and your Planned Parenthood affiliates are no longer capable of performing medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner,” according to a letter from the inspector general’s office to Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast.\nAnd all the people raised their faces to the heavens and shouted, “AMEN!”\nAnd the devil snarled in riposte, “I'll see in you in court!”:\nThe move sets up a legal battle in Texas, the latest State to freeze funding for the group after the [pro-life] group Center for Medical Progress released a series of videos [exposing] the practice of selling fetal tissue for medical research. Planned Parenthood has already sued in three States — Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana — over Medicaid funding for its patients. A federal judge on Sunday ordered Louisiana to continue providing Medicaid funding to the group pending a legal battle. Planned Parenthood has indicated it could do the same in Texas.\nBecause neo-Nazis have a stupendous entitlement mentality, same as every other leftwing extremists.\n“It is completely outrageous that Texas officials are using these thoroughly discredited, fraudulent videos….\nWhich have been, in this quantum reality, thoroughly vindicated and corroborated in catching PP poobahs red-handed in their macabre, RICO-worthy criminal conspiracy.\n….to cut women off from preventive health care, including cancer screenings, HIV testing and birth control”….\nThe former two of which they do not actually provide other than in the creatively mendatious imaginations of their gutter propagandists..\n….said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in an e-mailed statement. “We will fight back against this outrageous, malicious, political attack in Texas.”\n“We demand that you pay for us to mass-murder unborn children by the millions and buy our Lamborghinis as well.”\nAnd all the people raised their middle fingers in the air and shouted….\nWell, you know.", "external_links": ["http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/texas-medicaid-funds-planned-parenthood/2015/10/19/id/696971/", "http://www.you-can-be-funny.com/images/finger4.jpg", "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/5d/c0/5dc0e1daf7769f5ecf6d9d6df8b7e5ac.jpg?itok=zDIh-bKV"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:45:38.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
