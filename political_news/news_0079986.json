Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush sought to tie Clinton to President Barack Obama and current Secretary of State John Kerry:\nBenghazi security failures were a stunning example of an incompetent foreign policy. @HillaryClinton ’s role as SOS deserves scrutiny today.\n— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 22, 2015\nThe Obama-Clinton-Kerry team’s foreign policy legacy:\n https://t.co/T9Qz05jb8Z\n— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 22, 2015\nBreitbart.com published an opinion article by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio that also pivoted from the Benghazi hearings to attacking Clinton's entire approach to foreign policy:\n\"In the case of Benghazi, despite her advocacy of the intervention that resulted in the fall of a brutal dictator, Clinton appeared to show little interest in the deteriorating situation in Libya,\" Rubio wrote . \"The administration’s approach of 'leading from behind' prolonged the Libyan civil war, allowing well-armed militias to proliferate. After the conflict ended, the United States did little to support the nascent Libyan government that followed [Libyan dictator Muammar] Qaddafi as it struggled to stabilize the country. As former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recently admitted, Secretary Clinton’s postwar plan amounted to 'playing it by ear.' The result has been extended anarchy in Libya, which has been exploited by America’s enemies, including al Qaeda affiliates and ISIL.\"\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul's campaign website mocked Clinton by promoting a \"Hillary's Hard Drive With Wiping Cloth\" priced at $59.95 — a reference to the home-brewed email server the former secretary used while at the State Department.\n\"If Hillary needs, a wiping cloth, we've got them. Hillary's Hard Drive comes complete with wiping cloth! CLEARANCE SALE! You've read about it on the news, now you can get one for yourself. Hillary's Hard Drive. 100% genuine erased clean email server,\" the description of the hard drive said .\nOther candidates live-tweeted the hearing.\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee focused his attacks on the late ambassador Chris Stevens, who died in the attacks.\nChris Stevens died, Hillary Clinton lied, and the Obama administration tried to cover it up. Time to tell the truth! #Benghazi\n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 22, 2015 . @HillaryClinton - It's not about why Chris Stevens was IN #Benghazi , it's about why he wasn't rescued OUT!\n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 22, 2015 Sen. Lindsey Graham, meanwhile, said that the mission (which was not technically a consulate) became a \"death trap\" under Clinton's watch:\nOn @HillaryClinton watch the U.S. consulate in Benghazi became a death trap. #BenghaziCommittee\n— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 22, 2015 I agree with @HillaryClinton they can't operate from bunkers, but they shouldn’t be required to operate in death traps. #BenghaziCommittee\n— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 22, 2015 As threats increased, security decreased. @HillaryClinton is responsible above all others for this dynamic. #BenghaziCommittee\n— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 22, 2015 <div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Benghazi?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/657206155303854080", "https://store.randpaul.com/index.php/hillary-s-hard-drive.html", "https://t.co/T9Qz05jb8Z", "https://twitter.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/657199052757471232", "https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/657206272748572673", "https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/657206067764572160", "https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/657190532377157632", "https://twitter.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/657205329583730688", "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BenghaziCommittee?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/657213245783080960", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/22/rubio-hillary-clinton-failed-in-benghazi-overall-foreign-policy/"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:44:25.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
