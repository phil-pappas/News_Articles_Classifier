Bradley Podliska, an Air Force Reserve major, former intelligence analyst, and self-described lifelong Republican, says he complained the committee had become a political witch hunt and had lost sight of actually investigating the attacks in Libya, which killed four Americans, including an ambassador.\nRelated Story From Whitewater to Benghazi: A Clinton Scandal Primer\nPodliska’s accusations, and some of the details he offers, are damning, but they take on extra weight in context. In late September, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy argued on Fox News the committee had effectively harmed Clinton’s standing—taken by many observers to be an implicit admission that the panel’s goal all along had been to cut the Democratic frontrunner down to size. (McCarthy argued, only somewhat convincingly, that he did not mean this.) His verbal missteps are seen as one factor in his surprise decision to drop out of the race to be speaker last week.\nMany Republicans rushed to insist the Benghazi committee had the purest of motives—a difficult argument given its focus has drifted away from the attacks themselves and toward Clinton’s email fracas, and because the inquiry has now dragged on for 17 months . Other influential voices see no point in playing that game. Bill O’Reilly said that “of course” the investigation is political: “If you think those guys, those Republicans on that panel, don’t want to bring down Hillary Clinton, you’re 6 years old, because they do, so it is political.”", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/us/politics/former-benghazi-investigator-says-he-was-fired-unlawfully.html?_r=0", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/bill-oreilly-benghazi-investigation-political-214620", "http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/02/hillary-clinton/clinton-campaign-benghazi-probe-congress-longest-i/"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:31:16.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
