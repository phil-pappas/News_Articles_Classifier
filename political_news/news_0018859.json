So long, Uncle Joe. It’s not that we hardly knew you, but that we hardly cared.\nLess than three months after he shook up the Democratic presidential contest by putting out word he might run to honor his son Beau’s dying wish, Vice President Joe Biden again used his son Wednesday, this time to explain why he wasn’t running.\nHe declared that the “grieving process” didn’t give him time to assemble a campaign.\nIn an off-kilter Rose Garden announcement, with his wife, Jill, and President Obama beside him, Biden delivered a long, not terribly impressive stump speech from the campaign he’d just announced he wouldn’t launch.\nFreed from electoral politics after four decades, Biden’s first move was to electioneer.\nSome of that was surely muscle memory from a politician who has professionally played an ordinary guy throughout his long Washington career, and wasn’t going to walk away from what may be the largest audience he has left without a performance.\nBiden’s peroration was also a warning to Hillary Clinton that he would come after her if she ran too hard against Obama’s record on, say, the well-being of America’s working and middle classes.\nCARLOS BARRIA/REUTERS Biden arrives with his wife, Jill, and Obama to announce he will not seek the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination on Wednesday in the White House Rose Garden. He made his attack dog intentions plain by lambasting the “mean-spirited,” “petty,” “divisive partisan politics” of those unnamed Democrats who see Republicans as the enemy.\nThat, of course, is how Clinton — who’s actually running for President — described them last week at her party’s first debate, where her strong performance effectively closed the door on the vice president’s hopes of moving up to the big seat.\nBut Biden’s potency as a Democratic critic or cheerleader will be far weaker than he may imagine.\nHaving bowed out, he is yesterday’s news. Finally, though, Biden’s move clarifies the choice facing Democrats, including those who can’t stomach Clinton and those yearning for a plan B if she implodes.\nRepublicans seem determined to self-destruct, what with clown-car riders Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina leading the field.\nSo, Democrats can risk it all on a love affair with socialist Bernie Sanders or they can settle down with Clinton and start dreaming of her, not Biden, talking to them from the Rose Garden.\nRelated Stories Biden’s friends, rivals praise VP after he says he won’t run Memorable 'Bidenisms' from Joe Biden's political career Biden sets himself apart from Clinton in speech Joe Biden speaks out in defense of religious liberty", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:23:51.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
