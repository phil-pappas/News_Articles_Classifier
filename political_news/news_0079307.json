The reports present the findings from the 2014/15 Continuous Household Survey, a Northern Ireland wide household survey administered by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). The sample for this survey consisted of a systematic random sample of 4,500 addresses selected from the Land and Property Services' list of private addresses. The bulletins are based on 3,348 respondents aged 16 years and over. Responses were weighted in relation to age and gender to take account of those who had not responded resulting in the profile of the responses being more representative of the population. 2. The key findings from each report are summarised below: Sport and physical activity · Over half of adults (55%) had taken part in at least one sport within the last year, a similar proportion to that reported in 2013/14 (54%). A higher proportion of males (63%) than females (47%) participated in sport within the last year. · The most frequently cited sport was swimming or diving (22%). This was followed by 'keep-fit, aerobics, yoga, dance exercise' (16%), jogging (15%) and cycling for recreation (15%). · Nearly a quarter of the adult population (23%) were members of at least one sports club, with males twice as likely to be a member of a sports club (33%) than females (16%). · Almost three in every ten adults (29%) attended a live sporting event in Northern Ireland within the last year. · Adults living in the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland were less likely than adults living in the least deprived areas to have participated in sport within the last year, or the last four weeks. They were also less likely to have attended a live sports event or be a member of a sports club. Arts · Over a third of adults (35%) participated in an arts activity within the previous year with women more likely to have done so (38%) than men (32%). · The three most popular arts activities were 'playing a musical instrument for own pleasure' (11%), 'textile crafts such as embroidery, crocheting and knitting' (9%) and 'painting, drawing, printmaking or sculpture' (9%). · Eight out of every ten adults (80%) attended an arts event within the previous year with women more likely to have done so (82%) than men (78%). · The most popular arts events attended were a film at a cinema or other venue (61%), a museum (29%), a play or drama (22%) and a rock or pop music performance (19%). · The proportion of adults who participated in an arts activity or attended an arts event were similar in 2013/14 and 2014/15, although both proportions have increased since 2007/08 (Participation: 28% to 35%; Attendance: 71% to 80%). · The most frequently cited barrier to engaging in the arts was difficulty in finding the time (30%). · Just over seven in every ten adults were satisfied with arts provision in Northern Ireland (71%). 3.
