Sen. David Vitter and John Bel Edwards made the runoff election, which happens Nov. 21. \n“Well obviously we’re disappointed,” Dardenne said after his concession speech. “You don’t get into a race like this not expecting to win and hoping to win. So I’m disappointed for all those folks who have contributed and been so involved in my campaign over the years. I’m hopeful that people will come together and get only the best for Louisiana down the road.” \nDardenne has a long history as a public servant in Louisiana. He served on the Baton Rouge Metro Council from 1988 to 1992. He was a state senator from 1992 to 2006 and secretary of state from 2006 to 2010. He has served as the state’s lieutenant governor since 2010. Dardenne says along the way he has had tremendous support from both family and friends – many of who were by his side on election night. \n“I’m very grateful for all their support and their strength through the years. It’s been a real privilege to serve the people of Louisiana. I obviously love the outpouring that we have tonight. It’s a lot of great people who are behind me. I’m disappointed for them, and I know they’re disappointed for me,” Dardenne said. \nThe lieutenant governor offered well wishes and prayers to the man who wins the November runoff and becomes the state’s next governor. Dardenne also talked about what his plans are for the future now that he knows he will not governor. \n“I wind down the operation of the lieutenant governor’s office and help the next guy, whoever it is, step into my shoes and hopefully continue what we’ve done to bring people to Louisiana. I don’t intend to run for office anymore. I’ve had a great run and I really enjoyed the opportunity to serve the people,” Dardenne said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:02:09.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
