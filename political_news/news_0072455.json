Casey rails at GOP as default looms Comment Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 8:27 PM Updated at 8:40 PM Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 8:27 PM Updated at 8:40 PM » Social News U.S. Sen. Robert Casey, D-Pa., called Republicans wreckless and misguided as the country is just weeks away from the Nov. 3 debt limit deadline. “I can’t see into people’s hearts, what motivates them,” Casey said during a media conference call Wednesday that also included economist Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the former chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden. “All I can say is that it’s a bad idea to even get close to not paying our bills, and I hope that in the next few days the folks on the other side of the aisle will see that,” Casey said. Casey and Bernstein agreed that failing to come to an agreement on the $18.1 trillion borrowing limit could have a great effect on small business owners, soldiers and veterans who rely on government services. Interest rates could increase and mortgage costs could explode, Casey said, noting that in late 2011, the 30-year conventional fixed-rate mortgage spiked by as much as 70 basis points, increasing the average borrower’s monthly payments by about $100 per month. A default could also cost undergraduate students at least $1,000 and graduate students as much as $5,000, Casey said. It would also hurt federal student loans and saddle students with more debt. “One of the things (Republicans) are trying to do is use the debt limit as leverage to get spending cuts in programs they like to go after,” Bernstein said. House Republicans have introduced the Default Prevention Act, currently up for a vote, Casey said. However, the legislation forces the United States to pick and choose which payments to default on. The legislation is similar to what U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., offered in 2011 and 2013 and is tantamount to paying China before paying for other essential services of government like Medicare payments, payments to veterans, or paying the electric bill, Casey said. Under the Republicans' scenario, the pay and benefits of 1.4 million active duty troops and 827,000 reserve troops would be compromised, Casey said. Benefits to nearly 4 million disabled veterans who are in need of help would not be paid as well as payments for health care for about 5.9 million veterans who receive care at Veterans Administration hospitals and health centers, Casey said. Additionally, nearly 31 million children who participate in the free and reduced-price school lunch program would be adversely affected, and more than 50,000 National Institutes of Health grantees that are conducting life-saving research and providing 300,000 jobs would also lose funding. “This is not a debate we should be having,” Casey said. “We should have more people working on a bipartisan level, but unfortunately we have a number of folks trying to score ideological points instead of solving the problem.” Republicans had accused Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew of trying to rush them into approving an increase in the government’s borrowing limit. The government will have less than a $30 billion cash cushion on Nov. 3 and will no longer be able to take arcane bookkeeping steps known as “extraordinary measures” to continue borrowing under the cap, Lew said. The government has never defaulted on its obligations, and a severe market reaction would be all but certain if it did, Bernstein said. “Look, under President Ronald Reagan the debt limit was raised 18 times; under George H.W. Bush it was raised nine times and six times under Bill Clinton,” Bernstein said. “It was raised six times under George W. Bush and six times under President Obama. “One of the things Republicans are trying to do is use the debt limit as leverage to get spending cuts in program they like to go after,” Bernstein said. “The idea that they want to argue with other members of Congress is a completely legitimate thing to do outside of the debt level discussion. Here, what they’re doing is refusing to pay for spending they’ve already committed themselves too,” he said. That would be “wreckless and misguided” on the part of the GOP, Casey said. By Stacy M.
