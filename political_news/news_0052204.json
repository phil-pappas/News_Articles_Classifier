The office of state secretary of state, now held by Doug La Follette (right), would not be changed. By Jason Stein of the Journal Sentinel Updated: 2:39 p.m. (3) Comments \nMadison — After years of trying , Republicans are coming closer to a long held goal — giving voters a chance to eliminate the office of state treasurer. \nThe state Assembly will take the first step Tuesday toward a proposed constitutional amendment eliminating the office, which has already been relieved of most of its responsibilities. \nThe state treasurer's office had one of its last major responsibilities — authority of the state's unclaimed property program — eliminated under the state budget two years ago and has lost many other responsibilities over the years, such as responsibility for the state college savings program. \nRep. Michael Schraa (R-Oshkosh), the proposal's sponsor, noted that GOP Treasurer Matt Adamczyk and his predecessor Kurt Schuller both campaigned in 2014 and in 2010 on eliminating the position. \n\"It's a do-nothing job,\" Schraa said. \"It's symbolic.\" \nIn the past Republican lawmakers have also sought to eliminate the job of longtime Secretary of State Doug La Follette, a Democrat. La Follette has argued for keeping his job, saying that elected officials are more responsive to the public, and the current proposal leaves La Follette alone and affects only the treasurer. \nEliminating the position requires a constitutional amendment, which would have to pass through two consecutive sessions of the Legislature and receive voter approval in a referendum. The earliest the Wisconsin Constitution could be changed is 2017. \nBoth Adamczyk and La Follette both serve on the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, one of their few remaining responsibilities and one that is also spelled out in the state constitution. Along with state Attorney General Brad Schimel, the men oversee an agency that manages some state lands and $1 billion in assets, with the interest going to benefit public school libraries in the state. \nThe proposal would replace Adamczyk on the board with Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, a Republican. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
