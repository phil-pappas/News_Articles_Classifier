Both ex-Presidents say a credible and peaceful election would be guaranteed in 2016 if the EC heed calls for a new register. \nIbrahim Adjei did not say what these legimiate means by the LMVCA would entail, however, the pressure group is noted for organising charged protest marches. \nLMVCA protestors clashed with riot police last month when the group attempted to submit a petition to the EC for a new register. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd who had allegedly veered off an approved route. \nThe EC meanwhile says it is studying evidence of double registration, registration of minors and foreigners among others presented the pressure group -- claims first made by NPP vice presidential candidate, Dr Mahamadu Bawumia. \nLMVCA says apart from Dr Bawumia’s evidence, it is motivated in its push for a new register by the ruling by the Supreme Court on the 2012 election petition that recommended that the current electoral roll be reformed. \n“If somebody says ‘reform’ it means change the way you do things. In addition to that, post [the Supreme Court] judgement, we also find principally, and a sample number of 76,000 foreign names on our register -- a huge proportion of which was scanned in”, Ibrahim Adjei told PM Express host, Malik Daabu, to back LMVCA’s campaign for a new electoral roll. \nHost, Malik Abass DaabuWatch the full interview below:Story by Ghana | Myjoyonline.com | George Nyavor | [email protected] Politics Follow Us The Constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness.
