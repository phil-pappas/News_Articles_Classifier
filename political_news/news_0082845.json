The cleavage of “old versus new” (Europe) was coined by the former US Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, in 2003. Rumsfeld’s use of the term described the lack of enthusiasm by NATO’s “old” member states to join the war in Iraq, as opposed to its newest members. But, the significance of the cleavage seems to have outlived that particular period.\nEarlier this year, Lithuania announced that it will reintroduce compulsory military service. The President, Dalia Grybauskaite, announced this was in response to “growing aggression” in Ukraine. The country abolished conscription in 2008 and reduced the size of its army from 39,000 in 2004 to 15,000 in 2015. Now, the Baltic State hopes to replenish its forces by as many as 3,000 men in one year. Thus far, it has been able to do so by enlisting 2,660 volunteers, willing to serve for nine months. Who would volunteer to join the army in the Netherlands, Britain, and the U.K?\nThe answer to this question has political as much as a cultural consequence. Not everyone shares the same sense of fear in Europe.\nOn Tuesday, the Lithuanian Ambassador to Britain, Asta Skaisgirytė, challenged the leader of the opposition in Westminster, Jeremy Corbyn. In a letter to the Guardian , she noted that in denouncing “imperialism,” Labour’s leader fails to make an explicit reference to the USSR and Russia. She alluded to an imperialist continuity between the invasion of the Baltic States and the invasion of Georgia and Ukraine by Russia. The Ambassador notes that contrary to what Mr. Corbyn suggests “… our countries were not, as he seems to believe, forced or lured into Nato,” but instead “… were pounding on the door of the alliance, demanding to be let in, because we feared that Russia might one day become what it is now: a threat.”\nOn Sunday, Geen Stijl , an activist website in the Netherlands gathered 450,000 votes required to force the Dutch government to hold a referendum. These were more than enough to force the Dutch government to lead the country towards a referendum that will challenge the EU’s Association Agreement, initially with Ukraine. At the very least, this would delay the ratification of the agreement by all member states, handing a resounding diplomatic victory to Russia.\nThis cultural cleavage is not confined to the British opposition and a Dutch NGO.\nPoland’s demand for a more assertive NATO is not taken seriously enough. Warsaw will host the next NATO Summit in 2016 and calls upon its Euro-Atlantic partners to abandon a 1997 pledge to avoid deploying troops and weapon systems in Central Eastern Europe. Instead, Germany recently asserted its vision for reviving the NATO-Russia Council.\nIn August 23rd, the Polish Presi dent, Mr Duda, visited Estonia to mark the anniversary of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. And this was a statement of cultural significance with political consequences. The cleavage runs deeper than Europe is willing to admit.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/lithuania-is-safer-with-nato-mr-corbyn", "http://kudtkoekiewet.nl/?t=http://www.geenstijl.nl/"], "published": "2015-10-01T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:45:20.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
