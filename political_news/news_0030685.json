He reigned on his promises of crop loans waiver of, giving Rs 2,000 as unemployment allowance and\ncreation of jobs for the youth.\"\nYSR Congress MPs, MLAs, MLCs and many other leaders of the party also joined the fast while thousands of Jagan's supporters also reached the venue from all over the state.\nStates: Andhra Pradesh AP Special status Jagan begins fast Chadrababu Naidu Andhra Pradesh Also Read Keep you questions ready: Chandrababu Naidu to interact with people on social media Suicide: Uday Kiranâ€™s kin, friends questioned WEF 2015: N Chandrababu Naidu woos investors in Davos Winter session of Andhra Pradesh Assembly in Visakhapatnam", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Jagan-Mohan-Reddy.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151007/nation-politics/article/ap-special-status-demand-jagan-mohan-reddy-begins-indefinite-fast", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Jagan-Mohan-Reddy.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:32:03.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
