Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella appeared with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce the delivery of low-cost broadband Internet to villages throughout India.\nDespite the hopes of Clinton Global Initiative planners, the announcement didn’t come at their annual New York conference, but rather in California at an unrelated event. Both men had been invited to the conference, according to a planning document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, but didn’t attend.\nAfter more than a decade, the Clinton Global Initiative, the showpiece event of the Clinton family’s charitable foundation, is losing some of its pizazz. Many of the group’s longtime supporters are avoiding the Clinton spotlight. Some of the most-sought speakers didn’t make it. Piles of media passes sat uncollected.\nRead More on Capital Journal Capital Journal is WSJ.com’s home for politics, policy and national security news.\nRepublicans, White House in Fresh Budget Talks Biden Follows a Candidate’s Schedule Rivalry for House GOP Leadership Heats Up A Microsoft spokesman cited logistics for Mr. Nadella’s missing the Clinton event, which concluded Tuesday. A representative for Mr. Modi didn’t respond to a request for comment.\nIn all, at least six major corporations that sponsored previous Clinton Global Initiative meetings didn’t make cash contributions the event this year. They include global banking giant HSBC HSBC 2.27 % PLC, which in 2014 donated $1 million to the conference, accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and electronics company Samsung . SSNHZ 0.00 % Others include Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM 1.89 % , Dow Chemical Co. DOW 4.54 % and Deutsche Bank AG DB 1.58 % .\nCompany representatives said their decisions were unrelated to the political swirl surrounding the foundation, and that their relationships with the organization remain strong.\nShannon Schuyler, a spokeswoman for PwC, said the company made earlier this year a $30 million extension of a previous commitment through CGI.\nHillary Clinton ’s run for the Democratic presidential nomination has brought scrutiny to the foundation, its work and its overlapping ties to her public duties as secretary of state. The organization has struggled this year, the foundation’s 11th and the conference’s seventh, according to people close to the foundation’s fundraising, citing potential donors’ aversion to being caught in headlines.\nIn a written statement, Robert Harrison, chief executive of the Clinton Global Initiative, said he was proud of this year’s conference, which he said featured more than 1,000 new and returning members, and the announcement of 123 new “commitments to action.”\n“Some have characterized the turnover of a handful of CGI’s sponsors as ‘trouble’ for CGI and ‘abandoning’ the Clintons,” Mr. Harrison said, “but this is just another example of critics trying to politicize philanthropy, and the facts don’t bear out the argument.”\nThe conference is scheduled every year to coincide with the United Nations General Assembly with the hope of attracting heads of state. The foundation this year featured the leaders of Greece, Italy, Mexico, Colombia, Albania and Seychelles. Some countries, including South Sudan, Ethiopia and Liberia, sent ministers.\nPresident Barack Obama declined an invitation, though he attended the conference in previous years.\n“The Clinton Global Initiative was just not something we could fold into the president’s schedule this year,” said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. No secretaries in Mr. Obama’s cabinet are attending. Instead, the head of the Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S. loan-guarantee agency, appeared.\nSome attendees said they noticed the lack of the usual star power, but remain enthusiastic about the networking and ideas exchanged at smaller breakout panels. “I want to hear some provocative things—I don’t care what their title is,” said Perry Yeatman, a corporate consultant from Washington. “The big names are nice to have, but not a must-have.”\nENLARGE Ursula Burns, left, chief executive of Xerox Corp., talks with Chelsea Clinton on Tuesday during the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in New York. Photo: Lucas Jackson/Reuters A spokesman at the foundation said the attendee list—which included World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and billionaire Bill Gates , who were also panelists—was impressive, despite those who turned down invites. It was Mr. Gates’ third time taking part in the conference program.\nThe official said that while some companies haven’t returned as sponsors, the turnover rate is lower than other years.\nConference-goers said they believed Mrs. Clinton’s campaign for president might have dissuaded some. “I’ve heard a lot of companies have shied away because it is a political year,” said Diana Saville, a chief innovations officer at a health-care foundation.\nSeveral major companies did renew their sponsorships, such as the Coca-Cola Co. KO 1.16 % , though its chief executive, a frequent attendee, didn’t speak this year. Barclays BCS 1.37 % PLC and Procter & Gamble Co. PG -0.47 % also returned as sponsors.\nThe Clinton Global Initiative has long highlighted the star power that its annual meetings attract. On the first day of its 2013 gathering, officials touted that “more than 1,000 international leaders and innovators” would appear, including Mr. Obama, former Vice President Al Gore and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde . This year, Ms. Lagarde was asked again to be a panelist and didn’t accept the invitation, records show.\nOn Tuesday morning, about one-third of a ballroom was empty at the opening panel, “Unleashing Women’s Economic Opportunities,” featuring Chelsea Clinton and Ursula Burns , Xerox Corp. XRX 2.53 % ’s CEO.\nClinton Global Initiative planners tentatively had penciled in Messrs. Nadella and Modi to speak at the closing session with former President Bill Clinton and Chelsea Clinton. Instead, the closing panel included Alibaba founder Jack Ma , a headliner for the second year in a row, and Elizabeth Holmes , CEO of Theranos, a health-care company.\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KN858_CLINTO_M_20150929154326.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KN858_CLINTO_P_20150929154326.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:37:46.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
