Stephen Harper's Conservative government eliminated the subsidy, which had been designed to give parties a guaranteed source of revenue after strict new limits on donations were imposed in 2004.\nEvery party leverages expected rebates to secure bank loans to finance their campaigns. Each party is entitled to rebates of 50 per cent on national campaign expenses; each candidate who receives at least 10 per cent of the popular vote gets a rebate on 60 per cent of expenses.\nHaving scored their worst-ever result in the 2011 election, when just 217 candidates were entitled to rebates, Broadhurst said it was a challenge for Liberals to persuade the banks to look beyond the party's immediate past history.\nAccording to preliminary results from Monday's vote, Liberal candidates in all but one of the country's 338 ridings -- Alberta's Crowfoot riding -- are poised to collect rebates, compared to 308 Conservative candidates and 258 New Democrat contenders.\nConservative spokesmen did not respond to questions about how much money the ruling party spent in a losing bid to win a fourth consecutive mandate for Harper. The NDP said it's still tallying its numbers.\nHowever, Broadhurst said it was evident the Conservatives spent more than either of the other two parties -- around $50 million by his reckoning.\nHe noted that the Conservatives launched their campaign plane immediately after the election was called in early August, whereas both the Liberals and NDP waited several weeks. The Conservatives also carpet-bombed the airwaves with ads, even before the campaign officially started, whereas the other two parties meted out their ads more sparingly, with the heaviest concentration in the final two weeks.\nA senior Conservative source has told The Canadian Press that the party will be in debt when all the election costs are added up.\nRelated Stories Can Justin Trudeau deliver on his refugee promise by end of year?
