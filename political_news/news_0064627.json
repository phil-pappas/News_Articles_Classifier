As our influence around the world has decreased, it has left a vacuum that petty dictators and extremists have been all too eager to fill. The world today is more dangerous and unstable than it has been at any point in our lifetimes. At home, our struggling economy has left too many people without hope, and a culture of lawlessness has led to brazen attacks on our law enforcement community. Those who have looked to Washington to \"fix\" our problems have come to realize that Washington itself is broken.\" \nSmith went on to thank everyone for their encouragement and support. \nIf you can't see the post, click here: http://on.fb.me/1GvQCMR . \n(Â© 2015 KUSA) Read or Share this story: http://on9news.tv/1LSibR9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:39:37.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
