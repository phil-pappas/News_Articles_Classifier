(Alexander Kots/Associated Press) October 14 at 5:19 PM In their Oct. 9 op-ed, “ Countering Putin ,” former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and former defense secretary Robert Gates argued that we need to “create our own facts on the ground” in Syria. They urged no-fly zones and safe harbors since such things protected the Kurds against Saddam Hussein in Iraq. But there was no al-Qaeda or Islamic State in Iraq at that time. Syria is a much more complicated problem.\nIf we could prevent Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from flying into a no-fly zone, what would prevent the Islamic State or others hostile to the United States from moving into those sanctuaries? We are already providing air support for the Kurds. Who else should benefit from our intervention?\nMs. Rice and Mr. Gates concluded that “we must create a better military balance of power on the ground.” Are they suggesting U.S. boots on the ground? If so, they should say so.\nMs. Rice and Mr. Gates are Soviet/Russia experts. Their appreciation of Russian President Vladimir Putin seems appropriate. But not so their recommendations for U.S. intervention in Syria.\nStephen M.
