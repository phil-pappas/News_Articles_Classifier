Six years before his arrest, he disappeared after being accused of diverting funds from his Cincinnati-based employer. He apparently spent much of the intervening period along the more than 2,000-mile hiking trail that stretches from Georgia to Maine.\nHammes has pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and money laundering charges from 2009, but authorities recently filed a notice of a plea change. No other information has been released on the agreement, which is subject to approval by U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott.\n\"I think the family as a whole is very happy that Jim is behind bars and hopes he will get a sentence that he deserves,\" Jane Ryan, of Springfield, Illinois, said by telephone this week.\nHammes' attorney didn't respond to messages for comment.\nRyan is one of four siblings of Joy Johnson, of Waverly, Illinois. Her sister met Hammes when both attended college in Springfield, and they were married with a daughter when Joy died at age 40 after a fire in the Hammes' home in 2003 in Lexington.\nHammes had remarried by the time his bosses at a Pepsi-Cola bottler called him to its Cincinnati headquarters and confronted about missing millions in 2009. He soon disappeared. Hammes, a licensed pilot, had credited a successful investment in a software company for extra money that paid for scuba diving trips to the Caribbean, according to Ryan and other former in-laws who were interviewed in 2012 for an episode of the CNBC series \"American Greed.\"\nLexington firefighters at the time blamed a defective electrical cord and said Hammes had been out walking the dog. There were no charges, but Ryan and other members of Joy Johnson's family raised questions on the TV show about the circumstances. Federal agents later reviewed the fire investigation, but nothing came of it.\nRyan said she and other relatives still wonder about the fire, and how else they and Joy might have been misled.\n\"I think the circumstances are very suspicious, because of the embezzlement and the other lies that he told,\" she said. \"I don't know where his boundaries are, and we may never know the truth. ... I don't know of anything he's told the truth about so far.\"\nThe show is credited with leading to Hammes' arrest: A fellow Appalachian Trial hiker saw the episode and recognized the man he knew as \"Bismarck.\"\nFBI agents arrested him May 16 in tiny Damascus, Virginia, during the annual Trail Days festival. People there say Bismarck was a regular on the trail.\nTrail guidebook writer David Miller said the genial, bushy-bearded Bismarck had a surprisingly high visibility on the trail, where hikers often go by such \"trail names.\" Bismarck showed up in photos in hikers' journals and on social media. Susie Montgomery, operator of the inn where Bismarck often stayed, said he was a popular guest, and she was stunned when FBI agents showed up there to arrest him.\nHammes, a Milwaukee native, was the Lexington-based controller for the southern division of G&J Pepsi-Cola. FBI special agent Pamela Matson stated in an affidavit that G&J funds were deposited into an unauthorized account that played off the name of a vendor. Investigators found that Hammes opened the account in 1998, she said. He repeatedly wrote checks to the sham vendor account then quickly moved the deposits into his own bank account, according to Matson.\nIn 2009, a federal grand jury indicted him on 75 counts, carrying potential sentences of decades in prison.\nAccounts have placed Hammes as staying in Maine and northern Indiana when not on the trail during his time on the lam, although the FBI wouldn't discuss its findings. His second wife in Lexington divorced him years ago.\n___\nContact the reporter at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell\n___\nAP Researcher Rhonda Shafer in New York contributed.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/dansewell"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:42:15.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
