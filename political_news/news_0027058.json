He said he looked forward to serving in Parliament as an MP. \n\"We have been able to elect a strong official opposition to the Government of Canada.\" \n[Last update posted at 11:54 p.m. ET] \n(CNN) -- Canada looks likely to elect the first new leader in 10 years, with Canadian networks projecting the general election for Justin Trudeau's Liberal party. \nLiberal candidates have secured 149 seats -- or \"ridings,\" the Canadian term for federal electoral districts -- and are leading in a further 40, which would give them 189 seats in parliament, putting them over the line for forming a majority government. A total of 170 seats are needed for a majority. \nThe Conservatives currently have 84 seats secured and are leading in 19 more for a projected total of 103. \nA victory for Trudeau would deny a fourth term to incumbent Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Because Canada does not have term limits, Harper has held the position for 10 years. \n\"It's gonna change before the evening ends but it's not going to end in any dramatic fashion,\" CBC host Peter Mansbridge said. CBC is a CNN partner network. \nSeveral provinces have showed strong support for the Liberal party. It is the first time the Liberals have a majority in Quebec since former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's premiership. \nWith almost 80% of seats declared, districts in the eastern provinces showed overwhelming support for the Liberals, with those in the prairie provinces tending towards the Conservatives. \nBeginnings of a dynasty? \nThe son of Pierre Trudeau and scion of Canada's first likely political dynasty, the young Ottawan surged into the lead in recent weeks, largely on the back of anti-Conservative sentiment that saw Harper's party lagging as Canadians went to the polls. \nBefore the grueling, 78-day electioneering campaign began, many dismissed the younger Trudeau as trading off his father's famous name, but pundits in Canada have praised his campaign and the way he has led the Liberals to sweeping victory. \nAlong with confident predictions from the networks, including CBC, major political figures -- including Ottawa's mayor, Jim Watson -- are already congratulating the presumptive Prime Minister-elect. \nAhead of the election, many pundits were predicting a tight race, with Harper and Trudeau neck-and-neck and the New Democratic Party (NDP) making up the numbers. Thomas Mulcair's party currently holds four seats in the new parliament. \nMulcair is leading in his own race but pundits are suggesting he may step down after a poor showing at the polls, especially following a strong, positive campaign. \nThe NDP suffered a rout, slipping from Official Opposition to the Harper government to a terrible showing in the night, with only 35 seats projected -- a loss of 12% of the vote. \nMulcair was gracious in defeat. \"From the very outset this election has been about change. Tonight Canadians have turned a page and reject the politics of fear and division,\" he said in his concession speech in Montreal. He did not indicate if he would step down as leader. \nElsewhere there were other reasons for Canadians to cheer. The Toronto Blue Jays won, as Canada's only MLB team beat the Kansas City Royals 8-11 to claw back a game in the American League Championship Series. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
