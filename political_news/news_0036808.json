Greg Abbott had a baseball blunder on Monday night. The Texas governor’s office tweeted congratulations to the Houston Astros about eliminating the Kansas City Royals from the playoffs — the only problem being, the game wasn’t over yet.\nThe Royals scored seven runs in the last two innings and ended up taking home the victory in Game 4 of the American League playoff series, and Abbott's office deleted the tweet.\n“Hey @astros fans. Unfollow --> @GovAbbott . Follow the REAL Greg Abbott right here. No predictions. Just support,” Abbott tweeted from his personal account, encouraging them to unfollow his office.\nAccording to the Associated Press, the original tweet was sent from a staffer.\nAbbott wasn’t the only one cheering for the Astros. On Sunday, former President George H. W. Bush — a longtime Houston fan and himself a former Yale baseball player — threw out the first pitch for Game 3.\nThe best-of-five series is now tied at two games each.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/astros/", "https://twitter.com/GovAbbott/", "https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/653677679137296384"], "published": "2015-10-12T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:32:02.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
