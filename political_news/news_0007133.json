This is more than double the number of fibre connections in 2014. \n“This change is being driven by the ultra-fast broadband roll-out continuing, and strong demand for fibre from customers,” international and business performance statistics senior manager Jason Attewell said. “One in every 20 broadband connections is through fibre. While it’s still a small proportion, it has the potential to grow rapidly now that the infrastructure for connecting to fibre is available.” \nFibre connections are offered by many New Zealand Internet service providers in 2015: over 60 percent supplied customers with fibre-based connections. \n“Faster fibre connections allow for more data-heavy Internet usage, and Kiwis are embracing the possibilities that fibre brings,” Mr Attewell said. “Both households and businesses can benefit from fast Internet – streaming video, gaming, and video conferencing are all very accessible with fibre broadband.” \nAccording to Crown Fibre Holdings, the Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative aims to have 75 percent of New Zealanders in 33 towns and cities able to connect to fibre by 2019 – a total of 1,340,000 households. Recently, the programme has been extended to reach at least 80 percent of New Zealanders. \nThese figures come from the 2015 annual Internet Service Provider Survey, a supply side survey that is sent to all Internet service providers in New Zealand. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:40:01.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
