Bernie Sanders clashed on issues from gun control to foreign policy to capitalism as they squared off in the first Democratic debate Tuesday in Las Vegas.

(Photo: Register photo) Buy Photo \nLAS VEGAS – The Democratic presidential candidates had their best spokespeople lined up to dive into the reporter scrum in the spin room immediately after their first debate, held Tuesday night at the Wynn hotel-casino on the Vegas strip. \nHere are some of the messages the candidates' allies spun in interviews with The Des Moines Register: \n1. WHAT WAS TEAM SANDERS' BIG TAKE-HOME MESSAGE? \nBernie is the Barack of 2016 was the theme Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' backers pushed. \n\"When Barack Obama ran, the mainstream media was quick to call it a movement,\" said Ed Schultz, who formerly hosted MSNBC's \"The Ed Show\" and endorsed Sanders in September. \"You've got Bernie Sanders keeping pace with establishment politics. You've got over a million people donating to his campaign. When is he going to get credit for a movement?\" \nAbout 650,000 individuals have contributed to Sanders' campaign, but \"(Obama) did not reach that mark until after he won the Iowa caucuses,\" said Sanders' chief strategist, Tad Devine. \nSanders' pace in national polling and in organizing is ahead of Obama at this point, too, Devine said. \n2. HAS THE CLINTON EMAIL CONTROVERSY COLLAPSED? \n\"I don't think it puts it to rest,\" said Antonio Villaraigosa, a former mayor of Los Angeles and surrogate for former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \"The Republicans will continue to kind of beat on that tired old drum but I think most people, particularly most Democrats see it for what it is: Overblown. Clearly a mistake, but she accepts responsibility, but it's nothing that would any way undermine her candidacy.\" \nMORE: Clinton hits grand slam in first debate \nCivil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who ran for president in 1984 and 1988, said: \"President Barack said that there were some process mistakes but he said that no national security was breached,\" Jackson said. \nAnd the power of Sanders' debate assist – \"the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails\" – can't be underestimated, Jackson said. \n\"Sanders' role has been big in civilizing the process,\" he said. Sen. Bernie Sanders came to Hillary Clinton's defense after she was asked about her private emails during the CNN Democratic Debate. \n3. DID CHAFEE HAVE A FATAL STUMBLE? \nLittle-known contender Lincoln Chafee defended a vote he now regrets by saying \"it was my very first vote.\" \n\"Are you saying you didn't know what you were voting for?\" CNN debate moderator Anderson Cooper questioned, referring to the Glass-Steagall bank regulation act that Chafee voted to repeal. \n\"I'd just arrived at the Senate,\" said Chafee, a former U.S. senator from Rhode Island. \"I think we'd get some takeovers, and that was one.\" \nThat answer was the most disastrous moment of the night, according to chatter online and in the Wynn hallways after the debate. When the Register asked Chafee if he now regrets his debate answer, he said no. \n\"I was explaining the circumstances as they existed,\" he said. \nHis spokeswoman, Debbie Rich, stepped in to defend him – Chafee was appointed to fill his father's seat in 1999 when John Chafee died in office. Staff told Lincoln Chafee his dad supported the bill – a compromise bill negotiated by Democrats and Republicans. The vote was almost unanimous, she said. \nAsked her reaction to online criticism that Chafee fatally damaged his already struggling campaign, Rich said: \"I don't know, I have no idea. My phone's off.\" \n4. DID CLINTON INTEND TO TARGET SANDERS? \n\"That's is not how she approached it,\" Clinton's communications director Jennifer Palmieri told the Register. \"She was addressing the questions that were put to her.\" \nPalmieri added: \"It was spirited, but I don't feel like it got personal by any means from anyone.\" \nSanders is Clinton's chief rival, attracting monster-sized crowds and steadily climbing in the polls. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders faced off in a sharp Democratic debate hosted by CNN. Here are the best attack moments from the candidates. \n5. WAS SANDERS TOO GRIM AND GRUMPY? \n\"No, I thought he was on the less grim side tonight,\" said his campaign manager, John Weaver. \"He smiled when he shook hands with Secretary Clinton. He smiled and patted Jim Webb on the back when Jim Webb talked to him about being a conscientious objector. So even when he was attacked, he was smiling.\" \nSchultz took a different tack and acknowledged Sanders' furrowed-brow demeanor. \n\"When I met with him last week in his office, he was as serious as a heart attack,\" Schultz said. \"He's all business. No back slappin'. ... Just, 'What have you got?' and 'Here's what we're thinking.'\" \nSchultz added: \"When you're in front of the American people and you have a limited amount of time to sound the alarm on what's going on with the middle class in this country, what's going on with Wall Street, how the wage earners are falling behind, he's not going to waste his time on a slick sound bite.\" \n6. DID O'MALLEY MISS HIS CHANCE? \nWas there a single line or exchange that inspired the political world to pay attention to former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley? His spin room surrogates were unable to put their finger on just one, but his anti-NRA stance was memorable, they said. \n\"When he was talking about how he took on the NRA as governor to pass far-reaching gun legislation. And the passion he showed,\" Dan Hynes, a former Illinois comptroller who stumped for Barack Obama in 2008. \n\"His passion on gun control, when he talked about climate change, when he talked about all of the things that are going to make people's lives better,\" said Yvette Lewis, the former chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party.
