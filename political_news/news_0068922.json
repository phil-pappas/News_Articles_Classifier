(Guide, Inspire,Volunteer and Education) charity program.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275256\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151008/275257\nThe We G.I.V.E. charity was founded by the Golden State Warriors Pro basketball team and the auto insurance provider Esurance. It is a volunteer-based program that provides opportunities for corporate partners, season ticket holders and fans to come together and participate in selected volunteer projects within the local community. Volunteer events take place throughout the year.\n\"Joining the We G.I.V.E. program gave me the opportunity to give back to my local community,\" explains Lippman. \" It felt great to make a difference and know that I was helping other people. It was an honor to work alongside the Golden State Warriors and Esurance. They are doing great things!\"\nLaunched in 2013, the We G.I.V.E. volunteer platform encourages people to give, inspire, volunteer and educate others by supporting organizations dedicated to giving back to the Bay Area community.\nThe #HashtagLunchbag movement was the second event behind the We G.I.V.E. volunteer platform for their past season and it has made an unprecedented name for itself as a viral global movement.\nKlay Thompson , who was a recent recipient of the NBA Cares Community Assist Award, joined the We G.I.V.E. volunteer group to help end hunger. In November of last year, he donated $20,000 to the City of Oakland for their annual Thanksgiving Dinner, which serves 2,000 low-income families and homeless citizens a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal.\nAfter reading an article about how the Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson joined the volunteer group to make sandwiches and distribute bagged lunches to shelters and nonprofit organizations within the Bay neighborhood, Wayne Lippman became inspired to also join the #HashtagLunchbag movement.\n\"After I read about Klay Thompson and his effort to help the community, I became inspired to do my own part,\" said Wayne Lippman . \" I decided to participate in the #HashtagLunchbag movement which allowed me to help eliminate hunger in the Bay Area. My biggest hope is that I will be able to inspire at least one person to get involved, just as Thompson inspired me.\"\nAs an active philanthropist, Mr. Lippman generously donates to a wide range of charities including Habitat for Humanity through the Wayne Lippman Charitable Trust Fund. He also gives back to the community by volunteering regularly at Voluntary Income Tax, a government organization that offers free tax preparation to low income families.\nTo ready more about the personal story from Wayne Lippman go to: http://www.waynelippman.com/post/130708721470/wayne-lippman-hashtaglunchbag\nFind out more information about the We G.I.V.E. volunteer program, visit their website directly at www.nba.com/warriors/community/wegive .
