Bernie Sanders are in a dead heat in New Hampshire after the first Democratic Debate, according to a new poll released Friday. Media Galleries Walker suspends campaign for president \nThe Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll conducted in the two days following Tuesday's debate reverses a trend in a series of surveys in the early primary state that had shown Clinton trailing Sanders substantially, another sign of the former secretary of state's strong performance in Tuesday's debate. \nIn the Friday poll, Clinton led Sanders 37% to 35%, a statistical tie well within the poll's margin of error. \nA CNN poll last month had the Vermont senator leading the former secretary of state 46% to 30%. \nVice President Joe Biden, who is still undecided on a presidential run, was in third, at 11%. No other candidate broke 3%. Half of the voters surveyed also said Biden should not enter the race, compared with 36% who felt he should, a sign that despite the buzz of a presidential bid, it's not immediately clear how much of difference the vice president would make. \nOf the likely Democratic voters surveyed who watched it, Clinton was declared the winner of Tuesday night's debate, 54% to 24% for Sanders. \nSuffolk surveyed 500 likely voters in New Hampshire's Democratic presidential primary Oct. 14-15 for the poll, which has an error margin of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:34:57.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
