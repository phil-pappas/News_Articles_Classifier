(Courtesy of Ben Horn) ( Marin Independent Journal ) A Marine pilot was killed Wednesday when an F/A-18C Hornet crashed in a rural area about 70 miles north of London. There were no other casualties. \nThe plane was in a flight of six aircraft when it crashed in a field near RAF Lakenheath, a Royal Air Force base that hosts U.S. Air Force units that include fighter jets and refuelers. The five other planes diverted safely to RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. \nCivilian witnesses said the pilot was able to eject, but there was no official confirmation. \nABC7 News reported that it has confirmed the pilot was Taj Sareen from San Mateo County. No other information about the pilot was known. \nThe single-seat Hornet was assigned to Marine Attack Fighter Squadron 232 at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego. The squadron, considered the oldest and most decorated fighter squadron in the Marine Corps, is part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. \nThe crash occurred about 5:30 a.m., minutes after takeoff from Lakenheath. \nThe squadron, dubbed the Red Devils, has been deployed in the last six months to Iraq and Syria to provide close air support for U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State. \nKaren Miles-Holdaway, 48, told the Cambridge News that she was working in her garden when the plane flew over \"much lower than they usually fly.\" She said the pilot appeared to be trying to avoid houses. Advertisement \n\"He took the plane away from the houses, which was brilliant,\" Miles-Holdaway said. \"We are just very grateful to him.\" \nThe region has seen two other U.S. aircraft crashes in recent years. A year ago, an Air Force F-15 crashed in a field near a school. The pilot ejected safely. \nIn January 2014, four U.S. Air Force personnel were killed when the helicopter they were in hit a flock of geese and crashed. \nMatthew Barzun, U.S. ambassador to Britain, posted a tweet with his regrets at the F/A-18C crash: \"The loss in Cambridgeshire today is terrible news, my thoughts & prayers are with all involved.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:44:01.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
