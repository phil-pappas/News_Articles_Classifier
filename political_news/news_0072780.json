The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe working groups will decide which drones will require registration. Toys and small drones that don't present a safety threat are likely to be exempt. \nThe FAA is scrambling to get registration rules in place before Christmas. The Consumer Electronics Association has forecast that 700,000 drones will be sold this holiday season.   To many in New York City, the rats are winning.
