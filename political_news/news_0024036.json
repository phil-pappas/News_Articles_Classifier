Marco Rubio of Florida talks to CNBC correspondent John Harwood, left, during an interview at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Rubio is coming to Wisconsin on Nov. 9. By Patrick Marley of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 8, 2015 11:03 a.m. (0) Comments \nMadison — Just two months after Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker abandoned his run for president, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio will make foray into the Badger State in November. \nThe Florida senator and GOP presidential contender will appear at a fundraiser Nov. 9 for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and the campaign arm of Assembly Republicans. \nRubio will speak at a roundtable event at the Veterans Terrace in Burlington moderated by WTMJ-AM (620) host Charlie Sykes. \nAttending the roundtable costs $2,500 per person and is limited to 20 people, according to a fundraising solicitation. That money will go to Republican Assembly Campaign Committee. \nPhotos can be taken afterward for $500 per person, with those proceeds going to Vos' campaign. A $100-per-head reception for Vos will also be held that night at the Veterans Terrace in Burlington. \nRubio's visit to Wisconsin is the first one announced by a GOP White House hopeful since Walker dropped out of the presidential race on Sept. 21.
