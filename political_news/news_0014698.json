If people say there are no guarantees they can give, then fine. It’ll be quite easy to make up our minds,” warned Mr Salmond.\nA spokesman for Heathrow pointed out that expansion of the airport would be wholly financed through the private sector but that there would be public transport upgrades.\n“There is precedent that surface transport investment in London is considered by the Treasury as ‘England only’ and would, therefore, entitle the Scottish Government to reimbursement under Barnett Formula consequentials,” he added.\nIn July, the Davies Inquiry, commissioned three years ago by the UK Government, recommended that, if stringent noise and air pollution conditions could be met, Heathrow rather than Gatwick should be extended.\nMr Cameron, who in 2010 famously declared that there would be no third runway at Heathrow “no ifs, no buts”, is due to give his response by the end of the year.\nShare article The issue of airport expansion is proving highly contentious at Westminster.\nA third runway at Heathrow is opposed by many Conservative MPs, including Zac Goldsmith, the Tories’ candidate for London Mayor, Boris Johnson, the incumbent, and Cabinet Ministers Philip Hammond, Theresa Villiers and Justice Greening. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell are also strongly opposed; both are London MPs.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-17T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:37:16.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
