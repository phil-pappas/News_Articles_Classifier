To expand on the commitment, Bayer hosted nearly 30 local elementary school teachers at its first Making Science Make Sense teacher workshop at Science City on October 10 . Bayer's award-winning Making Science Make Sense program is a company-wide initiative that advances science literacy across the United States through hands-on, inquiry-based science learning, employee volunteerism and public education.\nCompletely free to attend, the workshop offered an opportunity to receive a CEU credit and participate in four exciting classroom experiments designed to develop a love of science-based learning in students, focusing on density, the creation of proteins, pollination and plant DNA extraction. Each teacher received a tool kit with supplies to take back to their classroom to facilitate the teaching of these experiments in their own classrooms with their students. Attendees came from the following schools surrounding the Kansas City metro region: Broken Arrow Elementary, Brookwood Elementary, Cedar Creek Elementary, Comanche Elementary, Douglass Elementary, Highlands Elementary, John Diemer Elementary, Roesland Elementary, Rushton Elementary, Shawanoe Elementary, Sunflower Elementary and Tomahawk Elementary. Attendees also came from the following schools in Missouri : Academie Lafayette, Harrisonville Elementary, Luff Elementary, Spring Branch Elementary and Stansberry Leadership Center.\n\"Science is at the heart of everything Bayer does.
