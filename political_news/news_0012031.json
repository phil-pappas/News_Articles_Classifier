The vice president was standing outside of his residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory to greet South Korean President Park Geun-Hye when he was asked if he would jump in the 2016 race, according to a White House pool report.\nHe offered a series of answers, none of which answered the question.\n“I'll answer it in Korea...,\" he said. \"I'm here to greet President Park. I'll talk to you all about that later.\"\n\"I can't hear you,\" he continued. \"I'll tell you what, good to see you all. \"\nBiden had said he would make a decision by the end of last summer but has yet to announce his intentions.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:46:07.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
