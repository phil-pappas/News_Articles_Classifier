On top of his usual Parliamentary workload, the former soldier has become a go-to party voice for the conflict in Syria. This is understandable, given his experience serving with the British Army to defeat extremist insurgencies in Afghanistan. \nBut he has taken the role to heart, travelling to the very edge of the conflict zone to learn about the situation first hand. \n“I’m very lucky to have been to Syria and Turkey last week. I was there for two and a half days and it was a busy old time. There were eight flights in those two days,” he told WMN on Sunday. \n“We buzzed about all over the border region and had a look at the refugee camps. We had a chat with local officials, then went up to Ankara and met the British ambassador and government officials. \n“I was basically getting a bit of ground truth as to the problem. It’s a pressing matter, it’s something I want to educate myself about so I can have an informed view. \n“And it had quite an impact really.” \nThe Plymouth Moor View MP, and member of the Parliamentary Defence Committee, has not shied away from saying the UK should play a part in the military intervention in Syria. But he is also the first to acknowledge the scale of the challenge the conflict poses, including its impact on neighbouring countries. \n“I don’t think it’s going to end any time soon. The situation is so complex,” he said. \n“The Kurds run a very good media operation. But the reality on the ground is that the PKK is a terrorist organisation and if we got into bed with them it would create real problems for Turkey. \n“Its very easy to knock Turkey, but it’s done an awful lot in this crisis,” he said. \n“They’ve taken 2.5 million refugees now and they given seven billion euros in aid. They’ve really stepped up. \n“But the international community needs to do its bit as well, and there are some desperate, desperate people caught in the middle.” \nThis year is only Mercer’s second ever party conference, but he has observed a definite change in tone and tempo since becoming an MP. “You have very little time to yourself, but that’s as it should be,” he said. \n“It’s a chance to get together with the party and speak to activists and those who do the hard work on the ground.” \nHe has even found himself in demand for fringe events, enabling him to bring his expertise to bear. \n“I did a very interesting fringe about foreign affairs and the complex nature of Syria and what response, if any, we can do as the UK,” he said. \n“It was a good chance to speak to people about important and pressing matters. \n“To use that experience to inform others was a real opportunity, and I’m grateful for that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:08:41.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
