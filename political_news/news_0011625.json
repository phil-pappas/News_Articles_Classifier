Steve Davis and Ed Norris, a former Baltimore police commissioner, host the broadcast.\nPolice arrested 16 people on trespassing charges early Thursday after an eight-hour demonstration. Demonstrators refused to leave following a hearing by a City Council committee on Davis' nomination to the top police job.\nDavis says the arrests were \"the last thing we wanted to do.\" He says that, \"in a perfect world, they probably wouldn't have stayed that long.\"\n___\n9:30 a.m.\nBaltimore police say 16 people, including three juveniles, have been charged with trespassing after a protest at City Hall.\nOn Thursday morning, police released the names of the protesters, who range in age from 16 to 38. Most are from Baltimore, but the group includes a 26-year-old from nearby Columbia and a 38-year-old from Burtonsville, in the Washington, D.C., suburbs.\nSupporters gathered at City Hall Thursday morning to demand the protesters' release, hours after the group refused to leave City Hall when a City Council subcommittee voted to keep on the interim police commissioner.\nTawanda Jones, whose brother Tyrone West died after a confrontation with Baltimore police following a traffic stop in 2013, is among the protesters, holding a sign that reads: \"Jail for Killer Cops.\" Jones says protesters are trying to hold the police accountable. She says their voices are not being heard \"and that's disgusting.\"\n___\n8 a.m.\nJust hours after protesters were led away from City Hall in plastic handcuffs, supporters are gathering outside City Hall to demand their release.\nA handful of people are outside the building Thursday morning.\nProtesters who say they want a voice in the selection of a police commissioner gathered inside City Hall on Wednesday night as a Council subcommittee voted to keep interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis on permanently. Afterward, protesters refused to leave City Hall until city officials agreed to meet a list of demands.\nSeveral hours later, police say some protesters left the building and the remaining protesters were arrested and charged with trespassing.\nDavis took on the interim role in July after predecessor Anthony Batts was fired amid a spike in violent crime in Baltimore. The spike followed unrest and rioting in April after Freddie Gray's death.\nThe full council must approve the appointment and a vote is scheduled on Monday.\n___\n4:30 a.m.\nPolice officers grouped before dawn outside Baltimore City Hall and could be seen by an Associated Press reporter leading at least 12 people from the government building to police transport vans and other vehicles. Several of those being escorted away could be seen in plastic handcuffs, their hands behind their backs.\nApproximately 25 officers initially formed a line in front of City Hall and more police were seen with their vehicles out back as protesters were led out. More than a dozen others outside City Hall looked on at the police activity, chanting, \"It is our duty to fight for our freedom, we have nothing to lose but our chains!\"\nPolice officials could not be reached immediately for comment on their activities at City Hall and whether they had confirmed anyone was formally taken into custody.\nKwame Rose, an organizer of protesters who have been occupying the building for hours, said he and others left after police had warned they shouldn't be in the building after hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:55:54.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
