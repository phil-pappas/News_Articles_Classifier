Stan Dogbe should have cross-checked with his party members in the region before commenting on the issue,” some of the callers indicated. \nAccording to the residents, the utterances of Dogbe about Ghanaian journalists 'were unbecoming of somebody in public office.' \n'I think the appointment of Stan Dogbe as a presidential staffer by President Mahama was a wrong move and he needs to be sacked,” one of the callers indicated. \nBenjamin Peters, Joy Fm correspondent who was among the affected journalists, narrated to DAILY GUIDE that the press men were about 12 in the vehicle when the accident occurred. \nPeters said the vehicle, a Toyota mini bus, was hired for the journalists in the region by the regional communications officer of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) to take them to Bamiankor. \nHe explained that when the commissioning ceremony was over, the journalists decided to head back to Takoradi. \nAccording to him, on reaching Biaho, near Apowa in the Ahanta West District, the journalists realized that the president’s convoy was behind them and so their (journalists') vehicle stopped for the convoy to pass. \nPeters noted that after a number of the vehicles had passed, the one carrying the journalists decided to follow them, not knowing it was left with the last vehicle in the convoy. \n“So when our vehicle was about to join the convoy, it was bumped into by the last pick-up in the convoy,” Peters maintained. \nThe accident happened at about 7:00 pm between Beahu and Akowen. \nNo fatalities were recorded, but some of the journalists sustained varying degrees of injury. \nA Citi FM correspondent, Obrepong Yaw, whose injury appeared to be quite serious, was rushed to the hospital. \nWhen DAILY GUIDE visited the injured at the Kwesimintsim Hospital yesterday, Obrempong was in neck POP sleeping. \nThe nurse in-charge of the male ward said the reporter was responding to treatment. \nThis is the second time in two months that journalists covering the president had been involved in an accident. \nThe first happened on the Afienya-Dawhenya road in August, claiming the life of a Ghanaian Times reporter, Samuel Nuamah. He was buried last month. \nFrom Emmanuel Opoku, Takoradi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:02:26.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
