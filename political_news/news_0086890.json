(AP) â€” Republican presidential hopeful John Kasich (KAY'-sik) says some people don't get him or his economic message.\nThe Ohio governor, who is struggling to say in the nomination race, has described himself on Monday at the University of Richmond as a \"troublemaker\" who's been at the center of battles to balance the government budgets for decades. He says troublemakers must also actually accomplish something, otherwise they're just \"a clanging bell in life.\"\nKasich says he'd do more than balance the federal budget, he'd also boost defense spending and make sure that no Americans are \"left behind.\" He says his multifaceted economic approach is \"why some people just don't get me.\"\nKasich is one of several presidential hopefuls visiting Virginia, a competitive state expected to help decide the 2016 presidential contest.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdx3n5%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdx3n5%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Republican%20Gov.%20John%20Kasich%20says%20he%27s%20a%20%27troublemaker%27", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdx3n5%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdx3n5%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Republican%20Gov.%20John%20Kasich%20says%20he%27s%20a%20%27troublemaker%27&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdx3n5%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Republican%20Gov.%20John%20Kasich%20says%20he%27s%20a%20%27troublemaker%27", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdx3n5%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:24:43.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
