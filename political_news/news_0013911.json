The work of these women will change lives and communities by empowering women to take charge of their heart health.\nThe fall 2015 WomenHeart Champions join 690 inspirational women from around the country honored with the WomenHeart Champion title to become the \"boots on the ground\" in the fight against heart disease. Sixteen of the new WomenHeart Champions graduated from the Science & Leadership Symposium as Community Educators, and 44 graduated as Support Network Coordinators to lead a monthly WomenHeart Support Network in their community. WomenHeart's Support Network Coordinator program is the nation's only peer-led support program for women living with heart disease. 37 of the new WomenHeart Support Network Coordinators will lead their Support Network at a WomenHeart National Hospital Alliance member hospital and 7 will co-coordinate an existing WomenHeart Support Network.\nThe WomenHeart National Hospital Alliance is a network of hospitals that have a partnership with WomenHeart to advance women's heart health in their community and lead efforts to save women's lives. It was developed by WomenHeart in 2012 to ensure that women heart disease patients in every community have access to information, education and patient support services to live well and thrive even with heart disease.\n\"There are 8 million women living with heart disease in the U.S., and an overwhelming 43 million women are at risk. WomenHeart Champions who are Support Network Coordinators and Community Educators offer peer-to-peer support and vital heart health information to other women living with and at risk for heart disease,\" said Mary McGowan , CEO, WomenHeart. \"I look forward to working with the fall 2015 WomenHeart Champions and Support Network Coordinators to increase our outreach to eradicate heart disease in women in every community,\" she added.\nThe fall 2015 WomenHeart Champions hail from 28 states and range from 23 to 79 years in age. 25% are African-American; and 10% are Latina, Native American, or belong to another minority ethnic group.\nThe fall 2015 WomenHeart Champions are:\nSupport Network Coordinators\nOlivia Rodriguez , Santa Barbara, CA\nCo-Coordinator, WomenHeart of Santa Barbara, CA\nElizabeth Wieland , Cascade, CO\nCo-Coordinator, WomenHeart of Southern Colorado\nSusan Nichols , Hurst, TX\nCo-Coordinator, WomenHeart of Mid Cities Texas\nGeorgia Leventis-Molina , Kalamazoo, MI\nCo-Coordinator, WomenHeart of Greater Kalamazoo West\nKalamazoo, MI\nMichele Buc , Memphis, TN\nCo-Coordinator, WomenHeart of Memphis, TN\nCecilia Acquaah-Harrison , Frederick, MD\nCo-Coordinator, WomenHeart of Frederick County, MD\nMaggie Anderson , Boise, ID\nCo-Coordinator, WomenHeart of Boise, ID\nKristina Reu , Santa Clara, CA\nEl Camino Hospital, Mountain View, CA\nAudrene Rossi , Cupertino, CA\nEl Camino Hospital, Mountain View, CA\nMary Anne Norling , Sunnyvale, CA\nEl Camino Hospital, Mountain View, CA\nTracy Solomon-Clark , Gardena, CA\nCedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA\nBetty Denny , Encinitas, CA\nScripps Cardiovascular Care, La Jolla, CA\nDale Stewart , Lafayette, LA\nThe Women and Children's Hospital of Acadiana, Lafayette, LA\nCindy Hillman , Lenexa, KS\nMuriel I.

Lovell Federal Health Care Center, North Chicago, IL\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in women and more women than men have died from heart disease every year since 1984. Each year since 2002, women heart disease survivors from around the country have taken part in a nationally competitive application process to be selected to attend WomenHeart's annual Science & Leadership Symposium at Mayo Clinic to become the voice of heart disease and women in their communities and on a national scale.\nThe WomenHeart Science & Leadership Symposium is a four day national conference led by Mayo Clinic's leading cardiologists and other medical and health experts, and experts in policy, advocacy, communications, and Support Network development and implementation. In addition to being trained as community educators, advocates, spokespersons, and Support Network Coordinators, participants receive training in the areas of diagnostics, technology, and treatment, including drug and device protocols, lifestyle and food management, and meditative techniques to reduce stress.\nThe fall 2015 WomenHeart Science & Leadership Symposium is sponsored by Boston Scientific, Sanofi-Regeneron, Gilead, Novartis and Abbott Vascular.\nWomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease is the nation's first and still only patient-centered organization serving the 42 million American women living with or at risk for heart disease – the leading cause of death in women. WomenHeart is solely devoted to advancing women's heart health through advocacy, community education, and the nation's only patient support network for women living with heart disease. WomenHeart is both a coalition and a community of thousands of members nationwide, including women heart patients and their families, physicians, and health advocates, all committed to helping women live longer, healthier lives.
