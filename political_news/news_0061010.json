We have been providing consular assistance to Mr Andree and to his family since he was first arrested and we have raised the case repeatedly in recent weeks.\n\"Given the ongoing concerns and the fact we would like to see more progress, the PM is writing today to the Saudis to further raise the case on the back of the action that has already been taken by the Foreign Office.\"\nIn the letter, to a \"senior\" figure in the Saudi government, \"the Prime Minister will outline some of the concerns that we have around this case and this individual\".\nReacting to Downing Street's intervention, Mr Andree's son Simon Andree said: \"I'm pleased. It has taken an awful long time. I need to speak with my family.\"\nHe added: \"I just hope that the breakdown of this deal won't affect him. It was never my intention. I hope it won't impact upon him. This case was always about my father's health.\"\nMr Andree, a grandfather of seven who has battled cancer and suffers from asthma, has lived in the Middle East for the last 25 years, having worked in the oil industry.\nHe was described as an \"all-round lovely person\" and a \"very good man\" by his family.\nMr Andree was arrested in Jeddah in August last year after bottles of home-made wine were discovered by police.\nHe was sentenced to 12 months in prison and flogging for breaching the country's strict anti-alcohol laws. He has served his time in jail but is still locked up as Saudi officials wait to carry out the lashings, according to his son.\nThe family are also urging that Mr Andree be released on compassionate grounds because his wife Verity is dying of Alzheimer's and is in Britain receiving care.\nAsked whether \"political considerations\" were getting in the way of efforts in his father's case, Simon Andree told the Press Association: \"I think my father is at the bottom of the list. It's very unfair.\n\"I feel that all the business dealings with Saudi Arabia and the UK are probably taking priority over it.\n\"I'm asking David Cameron to look at his case, look at his health and help us bring him home.\n\"He's a British citizen - we have British citizens locked up around the world and it is the responsibility of the British Government to help him.\"\nThe withdrawal of the prison contract bid follows reports of a Cabinet rift on the issue, with Justice Secretary Michael Gove said to have angered Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond by seeking to pull the plug.\nMr Gove was reported to have secured the support of Business Secretary Sajid Javid for abandoning the proposed deal to sell expertise to the Saudi penal system - but was overruled by Downing Street.\nThe Justice Secretary has closed down the controversial departmental commercial body which sold prison expertise to countries with dismal human rights records.\nJust Solutions international (JSi) was established under his predecessor Chris Grayling in 2013.\nBut the MoJ announced that withdrawing JSi's controversial bid for the Saudi Arabia work \"would be detrimental to HMG's (the Government's) wider interests\".\nThe Government has faced sharp criticism from human rights groups for JSi work carried out in countries with poor human rights records such as China, Pakistan, Libya and Nigeria.\nShare article JSi, which is staffed by British civil servants, has also undertaken work in Oman, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Kosovo, Turkey, Macedonia and the Seychelles.\nThe MoJ has previously insisted that JSi's work was focused on trying to improve human rights standards in the countries' jails through training and prison design, and complied with British human rights standards.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-13T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:43:37.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
