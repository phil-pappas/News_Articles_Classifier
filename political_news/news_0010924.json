We now have to look at other avenues to ensure Kiwis’ rights are being protected. \n\"There are appalling stories out of Christmas Island in particular. New Zealanders in detention are being bullied by guards, there is a lack of access to medical treatment, they are not able to access legal support and a number are subject to arbitrary detention. \n\"All of these are serious human rights breaches,\" said Ms Delahunty. \n\"There has always been a special relationship between Australia and New Zealand, but now the Coalition government is putting that at risk,\" the Australian Greens’ immigration spokesperson, Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said. \n\"This is a real test for Malcolm Turnbull and he will have some serious questions asked of him when he lands in New Zealand today. Will he let the vestiges of the Abbott government’s overreach on immigration law hurt our regional partnerships or will he see sense and let the courts consider these matters on a case by case basis? \n\"There is serious potential for human rights abuses under these new laws. I hope that the ANZAC spirit isn’t jeopardised by the rashness of the Coalition government’s obsession with political point scoring on immigration.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:22:50.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
