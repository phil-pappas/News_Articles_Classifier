(AP) - A blind man accused of obstructing police has been ordered to stand trial in a case related to a Lansing event celebrating a federal disabilities law. \nJudge Hugh Clarke Jr. heard testimony Friday and watched video. He says people don’t have a right to disobey lawful commands. \nPolice believed that Paul Harcz, also known as Joe, was a protester who wanted to disrupt the event last month at the state Capitol. Police say the 62-year-old Flint-area man struck officers with his white cane as he tried to get past a barricade. \nDefense attorney Mark Kamar calls it an accident. \nThe Detroit Free Press (http://on.freep.com/1hKfIfp ) quotes the judge as saying it will be up to jurors to decide if Harcz had been invited to the Americans with Disabilities Act celebration. \n___ \nInformation from: Detroit Free Press, http://www.freep.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:09:43.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
