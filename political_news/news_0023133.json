And on August 28, 2015, the ministry advertised for two chairpersons of council positions in public universities. \nYesterday, Prof Mengich admitted that he was not recruited competitively but said it’s only the appointing authority that that can answer the question. “I was requested to serve and I accepted,” he said. \nCommission for University Education (CUE) chief executive officer David Some said the recruitment should be competitive. \nHowever, he said getting people with doctorate degrees to apply for such non–executive positions has proved hard. “These are busy people and sometimes people have to propose them,” said Prof Some. \nProf Mengich is currently the Principal, College of Health Sciences – at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture Science and Technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:10:58.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
