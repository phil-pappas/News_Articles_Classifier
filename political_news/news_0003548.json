George Osborne is a political genius and David Cameron is a modern-day, one-nation Macmillan.\nIn reality, the Conservatives are not so deeply entrenched in power and they are not widely liked. Their values are seen as toxic, they are bereft of ideas and their long-term economic plan doesn’t exist. Yet last May, they won the general election, while Labour went down to one of its worst ever defeats.\nNow they have made a land grab for Labour policies in a pretence that they hold our values. They have taken the living wage . They have taken Labour’s work on apprenticeships with their proposed levy on business . They have taken our idea for a national infrastructure commission , and they have taken prison reform as their own.\nAt the heart of Labour’s policy review was the devolution of power and resources to our English cities, counties and communities. But our leadership couldn’t let go of its desire to control from the centre. Labour was too arrogant to listen and too timid to act. We vacillated about our New Deal for England and so George Osborne grabbed it and claimed it as his own “northern powerhouse” . But he will continue to punish the poor for the sins of the banking sector.\nThe Tory version of the living wage will not end in-work poverty. Tory apprenticeship schemes will be limited. The Tory infrastructure commission will be undermined by a failure of political ambition. Political opportunism trumps substance. Tory politics is thin gruel.\nIn 2010, during Labour’s leadership election, we surrendered the argument on the deficit and the economy. We never recovered. In the 2015 leadership election, we surrendered the argument on devolution. Labour is stuck in an unpopular, outdated politics of taxing and spending and using state control. It has got us into a situation in which a Tory chancellor looks more in tune with our Labour councils in the north than the Labour party itself.\nWe can’t let Labour lose again. We can no longer be a party fearful of new ideas and wedded to institutional conservatism. We have let down tens of thousands of members, whose selfless work is a great force for good in the country. The country needs a Labour party capable of boldness, but absolutely clear that what matters is building a broad coalition of electoral support. We didn’t do that in 2010 and we ignored it in 2015. So this week we launch an organisation called Labour Together .\nWe will work with members who supported any of the four leadership candidates and with organisations across the spectrum of the Labour movement. We will support grassroots Labour in our communities. We know that Labour only wins when it is united and when it is patriotic and speaks for the whole country.\nJeremy Corbyn has rightly challenged the party to rethink the way in which it does politics. This is a challenge we wholeheartedly embrace. Together with my colleagues Lisa Nandy, Steve Reed and council leaders Judith Blake, of Leeds, and Nick Forbes, of Newcastle, I will lead an initiative to bring together all sections of our party to discuss and debate the future of the party and the country.\nWe will take forward the work of the 2012-2014 policy review and anchor it more deeply in the life of our communities. We will connect our council and city leaders and develop our local community organising and our networks of thinkers, social entrepreneurs and policy makers.\nLabour lost everywhere to everybody. We were wiped out in Scotland because we were the party of Westminster. We lost in England and Wales because voters didn’t trust us with the country’s finances. On a range of electorally significant issues, we were out of touch with the views of the electorate.\nLabour Together will learn the lessons of defeat so that we can win again. We will build a broad inclusive politics to challenge the huge inequalities in power, wealth and opportunity that still blight too many people’s lives. We want power to be shared with local people, not just with town halls and local politicians. Local people know best how to solve local problems and we must involve them in policy making and shaping their public services.\nWe want the same power for people in the economy. Our priority must be a new political economy that is pro-worker and pro-business, supporting people to develop the skills, power and knowledge they need to act as full economic citizens.\nWe need to help people to help themselves. The power of people’s relationships can transform lives for the better and give them a sense of identity and belonging.\nLabour lost in 2010 and again in 2015 and now we face political irrelevance unless we can transform ourselves. Let us trust in the people of our country. Power must lie with them. Only they can decide their own destiny. Our aim is to bring the Labour party together to become once again the party of the whole country and the party of the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:53:53.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
