Close to an hour after the other candidates and most of the attendees had cleared out of the Hy-Vee Center in downtown Des Moines, Bill and Hillary Clinton were still schmoozing with a small group of lingering fans.\nAnd while Hillary Clinton ignored reporters and focused on the Iowans there to meet her, Bill Clinton proved once again there’s no subject he doesn’t want to expound on— and that he can’t resist chatting with reporters.\nAfter posing for a string of selfies, he engaged reporters who asked him how the iPhone has changed his interactions with voters. While people used to approach politicians with a question, he said, now they simply hold out their phones for a picture.\n“It’s a dominant force that’s allowed to interrupt conversations,” he said, “I think, on balance, it’s been a great thing for people.”\nBut he admitted that if iPhones had been around when he was governor of Arkansas, “I might never have lived to run for President. I spent my time doing uber retail politics.”\nThe former president, making his first official appearance on the campaign trail for his wife over the weekend, also waxed philosophical about the art of the selfie. “It has democratized picture-taking and record-keeping — and that’s good,” he said.\nClinton said he even requests his own selfies sometimes.\n“I’ve been with people who are taking selfies with me, and I thought they were interesting looking people, total strangers, but I thought it was an interesting setting,” he said of when he has requested his own copy. He didn’t answer when a reporter asked him what, in his view, constituted an interesting looking person.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:12:05.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
