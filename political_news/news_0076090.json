We would welcome Russian coordination.\"\nBut Earnest noted that the administration's first priority was to get talks started between military leaders of the two countries to ensure that there's no conflicts between forces operating separately in the same space. On the orders of Defense Secretary Ash Carter, U.S. military leaders had opened discussions with their Russian counterparts on how those talks could take place, but the formal discussions had not begun before Russian airstrikes began.\nBut there's a potential wrinkle in the possibility that U.S. and Russian forces could collaborate: A Pentagon official said the Russian airstrikes were not targeting the Islamic State, as Moscow had said it would do, because they were near the city of Homs, where the extremist group has no fighters.\n  Poll: Scott Walker's slide in Wisconsin continues Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's slide in his home state continues, even after leaving the presidential race.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 09/30/15 7:01 PM \"We just know that it's by deduction not ISIL,\" one official said. \"ISIL is not in Homs, they're striking Homs, therefore it's not ISIL.\"\nThe official said a Russian general walked across the street to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Wednesday morning to say the Russians would begin bombing an hour before the airstrikes were launched. The general's request that coalition aircraft remain clear of the airspace over all of Syria was rejected, and airstrikes continued Wednesday as far west as Aleppo.\nEarnest said \"it's too early for me to share any conclusions with you\" about what Russia's intentions are with its airstrikes in Syria, noting that this is one of the reasons why the White House has put a priority on getting deconfliction talks started.\n\"We have sought a Russian contribution to our counter-[Islamic State] campaign that's constructive,\" he said. \"We certainly wouldn't want Russian military operations to come into conflict with that effort.\"\nBut he rejected the idea that U.S. officials were surprised by the Russian move, saying it was a logical consequence of their military buildup inside Syria.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton: Israelis 'always sound cocky' Clinto replied to an email thread by saying Israelis \"always sound cocky — in the air and on the ground.\"\nBy Ariel Cohen • 09/30/15 6:49 PM \"I don't think it's particularly surprising that Russia is using those new military capabilities … to prop up the Assad regime,\" he said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:18:04.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
