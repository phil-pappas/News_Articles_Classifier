It is understood Lord Burns, the chairman of the Independent Commission on FoI, is looking at abandoning current rules that let people ask the government to release information in the public interest for free. The development was attacked by campaigners who said the move would make it easier for public bodies to “withhold” information and could lead to a “very large” drop in the number of requests. There is concern a charge as high as £20 per request could be proposed. It has also emerged that the commission may hold its evidence sessions in private and is yet to agree to publish all submissions handed in during the consultation. The commission formally launched on Friday with a call for evidence, with November 20 the deadline for submissions. Recommendations are expected to be made by the end of the year.

There have been concerns that the Conservative government is attempting to clamp down on the ability of voters, campaigners and journalists to ask for information to be released from government bodies. Freedom of Information laws introduced by Tony Blair mean that most public bodies are legally obliged to release information if requested, provided a series of exemptions do not apply such as whether the request is in the public interest. Campaigners say the law is fundamental to revealing what is really happening inside government while some politicians – including Mr Blair – have complained undermines good governance and is used to reveal damaging information by the media. The commission, set up after the Tories won the election to investigate changes to FoI laws, has been attacked as partisan given many of the figures picked to serve are politicians rather than campaigners. Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the Civil Service, could face the sack, according to reports Photo: EPA Lord Burns, the chairman of Channel 4, is heading up the commission and is joined by Jack Straw, the former Labour Home Secretary, Lord Howard, the former Tory leader, Lord Carlile, a Liberal Democrat peer, and Dame Patricia Hodgson, the chairman of Ofcom. A senior Commission figure on Friday conceded that the panel did mainly consist of people who had been the subject of FoI requests rather than campaigners submitting them. However confidence was expressed that the process would be transparent, that all evidence submitted would be fairly assessed and that the panel would listen to all views. In a move that sparked controversy, it is understood that the commission will consider charging people to submit FoI requests - a change to the current process which is free. Payment is currently only needed if the request includes large postage or photocopying costs. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair Photo: Andrew Crowley Campaigners said that when Ireland introduced a €15 charge the number of requests dropped by almost a half and led to criticism from the country’s Freedom of Information commissioner. The fee was eventually dropped – though there remains a cost for appealing decisions. Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, told The Telegraph it was likely the government would consider a £15 to £20 fee and warned of the consequences. “You would very quickly find that the Act was priced out of the range of the great majority of individuals, smaller campaign organisations, freelance journalists and many other bodies,” he said. “You would have a major restriction on how the Act could be used. You would find a very large fall off in the volume of requests made.” The Houses of Parliament He added: “It will make it easier for authorities to withhold information and makes it less likely they will be caught out when doing something different from what they say publicly.” Lord Burns said: “Freedom of Information is an area of considerable public interest and we want to hear the views of as many people as possible, which is why we are announcing this public call for evidence. “The Commission is an independent body, with no predetermined view, and is interested in gathering as much objective evidence as possible on the question posed in the call for evidence.” The Telegraph Media Group, publisher of The Daily Telegraph, is among more than 140 media organisations and campaign groups that have written to David Cameron expressing “serious concern” at the review of the Freedom of Information rules. telepolitics Follow @telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:04:29.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
