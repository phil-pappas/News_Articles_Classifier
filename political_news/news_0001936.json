Results 1 to 4 of 4 EXCLUSIVE: U.S. officials conclude Iran deal violates federal law | Fox News Obama and Kerry should have paid more attention to the details than politics. parts of the Iran deal violate federal law and there is not much they can do about it. This is not a treaty therefore current law supersedes parts of the deal. most of the violations occur with giving money and business transactions in iran. what is funny is that Obama himself even signed parts of this law in 2012. the administration is already looking at the courts to strike it down. Chicks dig the long ball Join Date 1,904 Re: Parts of the Iran deal violate Federal law Interesting article - although the legal discussion involved is fairly complex and will probably require the input of the courts. The TL;DNR version (based on my own reading): The Iran deal included a provision that would effectively allow US-owned subsidiaries to conduct business with Iran. This provision conflicts with a law signed by Obama in 2012 with the intent of closing off the subsidiary exception (US businesses were going around the Iranian sanctions by permitting subsidiaries to still work with Iran). There are some other provisions from other laws that appear to influence the authority and finally, you have the fact that the Iran deal was an executive only agreement - which grants a lower level of deference. In the end, this conflict does not appear to threaten the Iran Deal because the provision involved, while important to certain companies, is not a central aspect of the Deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:32:10.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
