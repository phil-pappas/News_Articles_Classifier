Not as a psychiatrist, but as a fellow man. I know he might spew vindictive words. I know he might throw coffee. But I have sat with much more violent men in search of the best parts of themselves — and helped to find them.\"\n  Senate considers bill to lighten mandatory minimum sentences Legislation aims to curb overcrowding in prisons.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 10/19/15 5:22 PM Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ In Rolling Stone last week, Taibbi had posited that Fox News was losing its influence among conservative voters due to the rise of Donald Trump, who has engaged in an on-again, off-again feud with the network and who has seen his candidacy thrive amid a series of controversial statements he has made.\n\"Murdoch could go lower to prove his devotion [to his audience], but that next step down is Trump,\" Taibbi wrote. \"If he balks at that, he might lose his audience. Beautiful. Here's to hoping that any choice he makes will end in disaster. Nobody has ever deserved it more.\"\nTop Story Bill Clinton to campaign in Iowa His   event where   Perry.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/19/15 2:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:59:43.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
