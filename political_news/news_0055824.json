Among the systems are the party-list and mixed-member proportional systems. The CDC has not decided yet which would best fit both Thai and international norms, Jade Donavanik, a CDC adviser and member of the sub-panel, said. Apart from the electoral system, the legislative branch also concerns the composition of members of the Parliament and senators, as well as relevant organic laws. He said the sub-panel had so far discussed only the MP issue because that was an initial CDC order. Jade insisted that charter articles on the legislative body had not been written ahead the discussion tomorrow. Meanwhile, CDC vice chairman Apichart Sukhagganond revealed that drafters had completed some parts that deal with people's rights and freedoms but many points had been put aside for later deliberation. One of them is voting in elections. Apichart said CDC members were debating whether the practice should be a right or a duty. The CDC would ask for public comment on the issue, he said. 225 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:08:23.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
