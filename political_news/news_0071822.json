There are a lot of people who have lost their congressional seats saying things like that.\" \nTip No. 3 hit the Chicago-raised West close to home. \"Do you really think that this country is going to elect a black guy from the South Side of Chicago with a funny name to be president of the United States?\" Obama asked. \"That is crazy. That's cray!\" \nObama, aka POTUS, also joked that West has his own nickname for the person in the White House — Peezy (that's someone who is really, really cool). \nWest also is thinking about running for speaker of the House, Obama cracked. \n\"Couldn't get any stranger,\" he said.
