It did so, despite the absence of a quorum, in response to the Spanish flu pandemic that was sweeping the globe. On the previous day, House leaders had sought to bring up a bill to establish a Public Health Service reserve corps to be drawn from the ranks of military health personnel. Under the bill, the corps could be deployed around the country to alleviate the demand for doctors in influenza hot spots.\nWhen Rep. Martin Madden (R-Ill.) demanded a quorum call, it revealed that 251 members were absent. Overnight, however, a deal emerged to consider the bill under unanimous consent without anybody raising a point of order. From the rostrum, Speaker James \"Champ\" Clark (D-Mo.), still recuperating from his own bout with the flu, termed it a “modus vivendi.”\nRep. Joseph Walsh (R-Mass.) initially demanded a quorum call. But he was persuaded by his colleagues to withdraw his request. Debate on the bill lasted four hours, before an amended measure passed without objection. Immediately afterward, Walsh made a point of order that a quorum was not present and the House adjourned.\nThe wave of flu cases had begun to sweep through Washington in late September. Within days, many members were absent because they were ill or tending to sick family members. The District of Columbia, swelled by an influx of World War I workers, was especially hard hit. By early October, hundreds of deaths were being reported weekly.\nAn estimated 50 million people, about 3 percent of the world’s population, died of the disease — about 500,000 in the United States. Some 500 million, or fully a third of the people in the world, were infected but survived.\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF HISTORY AND PRESERVATION, CLERK OF THE U.S. HOUSE\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:09:19.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
