By PAUL ROLLY | The Salt Lake Tribune First Published 1 hour ago • Updated 1 hour ago Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) A group of 17-year-olds were sitting around with nothing to do earlier this year, so they decided it would be fun to steal the campaign signs of a South Jordan City Council candidate. Little did they know that stupid decision could lead to their first foray into grass-roots politics. The candidate, Tamara Zander , running in City Council District 4, found out who the culprits were and lodged a complaint with the South Jordan Police Department. According to the report filed by South Jordan Officer Sam Winkler, Zander at first wanted the teens prosecuted for theft, but when he informed her of the penalties they could face and the long-term consequences, she decided to hold off. VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs In my conversation with her this week, she said she wanted the teens held accountable and to learn a lesson, but she didn't want them to have a record that could damage their futures. Once confronted by police officers, the six teens came clean and, with their parents, made arrangements to return the signs and pay for the ones that were destroyed. They placed most of the signs back in their original locations, but they had cut up some larger signs and paid Zander $200 to cover the loss. Winkler's report said they also agreed to work on Zander's campaign as a form of restitution. But only one of the teens actually tried to make restitution and showed remorse, Zander said. She told me she assured the police that boy should not be punished, but the others had not fulfilled their promises or showed remorse. Winkler wrote that Zander was paid back $200 for signs that were damaged and that other stolen signs were put back in their original locations. Because of that, Winkler wrote that no criminal act remained and he closed the case. Zander told me it was the teens' parents idea for them to work on her campaign and she felt it would be a good exercise for them to do something positive to compensate for their bad decision. She said not much was done by the teens other than putting up some signs. Speaking of campaign signs: The enemies of Draper City Council candidate Mani Grewal might be going for some kind of a record. Grewal, whose opponent is Michele Weeks, has reported more than 70 of his signs stolen throughout the city during the campaign season. He has filed several complaints with the Draper Police, but so far, nobody has been caught. If they are, perhaps he can get them to work on his campaign. Luck of the draw: After reading my column Friday about the Highland High School freshman who had to wear a baggy green sweat shirt and sweat pants all day at school because her shorts were deemed inappropriate, a reader shared an even more curious experience. It was the beginning of school in August and she dropped off her twin first-grade granddaughters, wearing matching outfits, who then ran into the school. It was a blistering 98 degrees that day, so the 6-year-olds were wearing tank tops and shorts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:47:17.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
