Now I genuinely can't decide whether Britain should leave or remain An In/Out vote on Britain's EU membership will be held before the end of 2017 Photo: Alamy By Matthew Maxwell Scott Comments \nFor the first time in my life, I am a floating voter. To EU, or not to EU? It is a sensation I should cherish. \nPolitical activists like me favour certainly. You are either for us, or against us. Thus one of the most reliable forms of canvassing data is the old-fashioned door slam. Assuming it doesn’t hit you, you can walk away knowing the slammer will never, ever be on your side. Often one suspects they won’t be voting for anyone, unless they thoughtfully garnish the door varnish with a shout of “Tory scum!” \nIn those areas with Liberal Democrat voters – few and far between though they may be – there is the voter who claims to be undecided. They say they will look at each party’s policies. They smile. But their eyes don’t smile. You realise they have long since made up their mind. \"Until now my instinct has been to stay in for fear of something worse. I was born in 1976; I know no different\" \nBut there are those who genuinely have not made a call. Apparently as many as 5 per cent of us only make the final decision once in the privacy of the polling booth, stubby pencil in hand. As I like to remind those I campaign with, these people are perfectly normal. It is us, with our clipboards and our rosettes, who are the odd ones. \nI have always voted Conservative. If I am offered a second preference, I don’t use it, not wishing to encourage anyone else. I have voted in referenda as directed by my party - against the Scottish parliament in 1997, against the Alternative Vote in 2011. In neither case was this difficult as I happened to agree. \nSuddenly, though, I have doubts. I am not wavering but drowning. Before the last general election, when I was a candidate, I hedged my bets on the subject of the EU by adopting a pragmatic, wait-and-see position. Now reality is staring in me in the face. We are to have a referendum . And as with around one in three voters, I don’t know what to do. \nThe renegotiation might be irrelevant. The Prime Minister is unlikely to come back from Brussels with a deal so seismic that he will secure a landslide to remain. There will be a little ground given, some nuance and much promise that we are now travelling in the right direction. I am not sure that is enough. \nNigel Lawson may be right to say it is time to get on with it and campaign for withdrawal. In typically lucid terms, the former chancellor has set out why he has taken up the presidency of Conservatives for Britain. To the fury of other outers, he is now being described as the leader of the \"leave\" campaign. In reality, they should accept they are lucky to have him. Even Lord Lawson’s critics should acknowledge his clarity of thought, his economic credentials and his willingness to stand up to political orthodoxy and encourage a debate. \"I would have fewer concerns if the EU was more democratic. Equally, if many Outers didn’t seem like foam-flecked maniacs\" \nUntil now my instinct has been to stay in, to accept nurse for fear of something worse. I was born in 1976; I know no different. In reality I do not fear Brexit. I believe the EU currently needs us more than we need it. I believe effective, lasting trade deals with China, India and many emerging economies could more easily be achieved if we were acting on our own . \nI accept the importance of the consumer protections EU legislation offers. But it would be bizarre to suggest we could not maintain these if we were on our own. I believe in the benefits of immigration. But I want economic migrants with the right skills, attitudes and aspirations. Ill-considered caps on non-EU immigration means we could be turning away Indian doctors or Chinese inventors but forced to accept unskilled workers from closer to home. And I like the ease of traveling around Europe but know it is a poor reason to accept the status quo. \nI would have fewer concerns if the EU was more democratic, more accepting of opposition voices and more true to the free-trade model which older voters opted for in 1975. If Peter Mandelson kept quiet I would feel less queasy about it all. Equally, if many who call for Brexit didn’t seem like foam-flecked maniacs I might long ago have rallied to their banner. \nI will read the leaflets. I will listen to the discussions. I will certainly vote, one way or another. And I will make the decision I believe to be in my and my family’s best interests. I just don’t know what it is yet. \nMatthew Maxwell Scott was the Conservative Parliamentary Candidate in Carshalton & Wallington at the 2015 election", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:20:41.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
