Clementa Pinckney. The Post and Courier’s Cynthia Roldan covered the special election where Matthews secured 89 percent of the vote from the district’s five Lowcountry counties to trounce Republican Al Fernandez. Speaking of trouncing, of the two times former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb visited South Carolina, neither were as a declared Democratic presidential candidate and, as of yesterday no future visits will be as one either. Webb, the last Democratic candidate to enter the race, bowed out Tuesday after dragging in the polls and a lackluster debate performance where he rivaled Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee for least amount of speaking time— a point he repeatedly made known. Now, the Democrats are down to the Final Four--unless Vice President Joe Biden jumps in and, according to polls, springboards into the number three spot . TBA. But Webb isn’t alone. He joins the first two Republican casualties, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. A recent article from The Washington Post speculates which Republicans could drop next. Hint: neither are from South Carolina. Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said late Tuesday that he will run for the House speaker position, under his own conditions . Senate Democratic Leader supports a Speaker Ryan. Grab your hoverboard, it’s “Back to the Future” day and The Telegraph is reporting on it in real time .
