They are expected to reach Didymoon by May 2022. Nasa will send one craft in a mission known as Double Asteroid Redirection Test (Dart) mission. It will fire a probe to smack into the rock and see if it can throw it off course.\nAs well as the nudging probe, scientists will send another spacecraft — the European Space Agency’s Asteroid Impact Mission (Aim). That will fly around Didymoon watching for the effect of the Dart mission, as well as measuring the asteroid’s mass and density and putting a small lander on the asteroid itself to look at its insides.\n“To protect Earth from potentially hazardous impacts, we need to understand asteroids much better — what they are made of, their structure, origins and how they respond to collisions,” said Dr Patrick Michel, lead investigator for the European Space Agency half of the mission.\n“Aida will be the first mission to study an asteroid binary system, as well as the first to test whether we can deflect an asteroid through an impact with a spacecraft. The European part of the mission... will study the structure of Didymoon and the orbit and rotation of the binary system, providing clues to its origin and evolution.\nAsteroids represent different stages in the rocky road to planetary formation, so offer fascinating snapshots into the solar system’s history.”\nThe closest that Didymoon has got to Earth in recent times was in 2003, when it came as near as 4.46 million miles away.\nSource: www.independent.co.uk\n Asteroid Redirection Test NASA Astroid technology Sciemce and Trends Astronomy Also Read What is ‘Wiggle Stereoscopy’?
