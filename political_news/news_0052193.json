Officials said this was the first American combat death in Iraq since the U.S. began its counter-IS military campaign in August 2014. \nPentagon press secretary Peter Cook said target of the raid was a prison near the town of Hawija and that the raid was undertaken at the request of the Kurdish Regional Government, the semi-autonomous body that governs the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. He said U.S. special operations forces supported what he called an Iraqi peshmerga rescue operation. \nThe peshmerga are the Kurdish region's organized militia. The U.S. has worked closely with them in training and advising roles, but this is the first known instance of U.S. ground forces operating alongside Iraqi troops in combat. \n\"This operation was deliberately planned and launched after receiving information that the hostages faced imminent mass execution,\" Cook said, adding later that it appeared the hostages faced death \"perhaps within hours\" and that freed hostages told authorities that some had been executed at the prison recently, prior to the rescue. \nCook said Defense Secretary Ash Carter approved the U.S. participation in the mission. Cook called it \"consistent with our counter-ISIL effort to train, advise and assist Iraqi forces.\" \nU.S. combat troops have rarely, if ever, participated directly in combat against IS fighters on the ground since the U.S. mission began in 2014. The U.S. has mostly limited its role to training and advising Iraqi and Kurdish forces, airdropping humanitarian relief supplies and providing daily airstrikes in IS-held areas of Iraq. \nIn a separate statement, the Kurdish government said the operation lasted about two hours and was led by its counterterrorism forces, with support from coalition troops. It made no mention of intelligence indicating the captives were in imminent danger of mass execution, as asserted by the Pentagon. \nThe Kurdish statement said more than 20 IS fighters were killed in the operation about four miles north of Hawija. It said 69 hostages were freed, none of whom were Kurds, and it thanked the Americans for their bravery. \nThe circumstances in which one U.S. military member was killed were unclear, but one U.S. official said the American had been shot in a firefight at the scene. Cook said the service member was wounded during the mission and died after receiving medical care. Cook said four Peshmerga soldiers were wounded. \nAnother U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide other initial details, said the U.S. role in the rescue mission was mainly limited to four areas: transporting Iraqi soldiers to the scene in five U.S. special operations helicopters; providing airstrikes before and after the mission; advising Kurdish fighters and Iraqi security forces; and providing the Iraqis with intelligence for the operation. \nThe U.S. defense official said the number of IS members killed was not to be made public immediately but that it was more than 10. \nCook said that of the approximately 70 prisoners freed, more than 20 were members of the Iraqi security forces. He did not say who the others were. \nCook said five IS members were detained and \"a number\" were killed. \n\"In addition, the U.S. recovered important intelligence\" about IS, Cook said without elaborating. \nThe relative of one of the Kurdish hostages said he had been informed of their rescue in a U.S.-led raid. \nIrfan Sadradeen, the uncle of Kurdish peshmerga fighter Meriwan Mawlud, said he was contacted by a peshmerga official who informed him about the raid on the Islamic State group near Hawija. Irfan said he was told that paratroopers landed at a poultry farm, close to the home of the main sharia judge of Hawija, where they launched their rescue. \n\"We are waiting for more information. A peshmerga official called us today confirming the news of the raid,\" he said, adding that he was told 15 IS fighters were killed in the raid. \"None of them arrived to this area yet but we are waiting for them,\" he said. \nTariq Rafiq, the father of a peshmerga soldier, said he was told by Kurdish authorities that the rescue mission happened at 2 a.m. local time and that the prisoners were being held in a judge's house in Hawija. \n\"We are now together with other family members waiting for more information,\" Rafiq said. \n___ \nJanssen reported from Irbil, Iraq.
