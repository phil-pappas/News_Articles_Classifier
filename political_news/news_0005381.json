Michael Eakin, under renewed investigation for his in the role in the exchange of offensive emails, has apologized, saying the emails did not reflect his character and had no bearing on how he decides cases.\n\"It is disconcerting and embarrassing to find others searching years of private personal emails looking for and publicizing any insensitive content. I sincerely apologize for such content,\" Eakin said in a statement.

While Kane did not make the emails public, the Philadelphia Daily News disclosed details of about 15. The ones cited by the paper included supposed jokes that mocked African Americans, Latinos, gays and domestic abuse victims.\nWhile an embarrassment for Eakin, the disclosures also were the latest a black eye for Pennsylvania's highest court, and and for the Judicial Conduct Board. After similar allegations were raised about Eakin last year, both the court and the board conducted investigations and cleared him.\nIn recent days, the high court and the board have issued statements faulting Kane for the shortcomings of their investigations. They said that in giving them emails for review, she withheld the most damaging ones that figured in the Daily News' recent account. Kane has rejected the criticism, saying she gave them complete sets of Eakin emails.\nThe high court suspended former Justice Seamus McCaffery last year after the news broke that he had sent pornography to a friend who was a detective with the attorney general's office. McCaffery retired soon thereafter, amid allegations from Eakin that he had threatened Eakin about the latter's email. McCaffery has denied threatening the colleague.\nEakin, 66, is a member of the Republican majority on the court, and is its liaison with the Philadelphia court system. A former district attorney in Cumberland County, he was elected to the high court in 2001. His current term expires in 2019.\ncmccoy@phillynews.com 215-854-4821 @CraigRMcCoy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:56:51.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
