She previously testified in Congress in January 2013 when she voiced her exasperation with the investigation.\n\"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?\" she asked.\nCongressional Republicans say it's clear the Obama administration tried to cover-up its incompetence by quickly creating a smokescreen.\nThe told the public the attack was just related to a protest over an online video about Mohammad. The evidence has revealed it was actually a well-orchestrated terrorist attack.\nMeanwhile, Democrats argue it's a pointless political investigation designed to undermine Clinton's bid for the White House.\nBut the committee is still looking for more answers. And a new Associated Press-GfK poll shows Americans view the investigation as justified.\nA Rasmussen reports poll also shows most voters don't think Clinton is \"telling the whole story about the incident.\"\nAbout 52 percent of likely U.S. voters say Clinton has not been honest in her disclosures and testimony related to the attack, while just 27 percent think she has been honest.\nWhen it comes to voters who are not affiliated with either major party, 61 percent think Clinton has not been honest. Overall, just 37 percent of all voters say they trust Clinton.\nThe month after the fatal assault, Clinton declared she had been responsible for the safety of those serving in Benghazi, without acknowledging any specific mistakes on her part.\nBut the administration continually tried to distance Clinton and President Barack Obama from the attack, saying neither of them was aware of the requests for better protection because security decisions were handled at lower levels.\nFour senior State Department officials were put on paid leave after an independent accountability board said that security at the Benghazi mission that night was \"grossly inadequate.\" The department then reassigned three officials to positions of lesser responsibility. One resigned.\nSome Republicans have complained that no one was fired. Critics also questioned why the board didn't interview Clinton during its investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:49:10.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
