Senate hopefuls give peek at early fundraising Comment Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 7:14 PM By Associated Press Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 7:14 PM » Social News HARRISBURG (AP) — Two Democrats who just joined the nomination race to challenge for Republican Pat Toomey's U.S. Senate seat are reporting their first quarterly campaign finance tallies. Katie McGinty's campaign said Wednesday that she raised slightly over $1 million in the weeks leading up to the Sept. 30 cutoff before reports are due to the Federal Election Commission. McGinty has held top posts in the state and federal governments. John Fetterman's campaign says he raised $170,000 in the 17 days before the cutoff. Fetterman is the mayor of tiny Braddock in southwestern Pennsylvania. Toomey and Democrat Joe Sestak haven't revealed their latest tallies. Toomey had $8.3 million in the bank as of June 30, while Sestak had $2.1 million. Seseak is a former congressman and Navy admiral seeking a rematch with Toomey.
