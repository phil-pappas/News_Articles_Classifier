Dunlap informed the GOP in a letter on Tuesday. The GOP wants to put tax reform and welfare reform in one question on the November 2016 ballot as part of the governor's plan to bypass the Legislature and go straight to the people. Dunlap said there's precedent for splitting such a referendum into two separate questions when they involve different policy areas. He said it wouldn't be fair to a voter who supports one proposal but not the other to have only one option of approving or rejecting both of them.   20, 2015 at 11:25 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:20:52.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
