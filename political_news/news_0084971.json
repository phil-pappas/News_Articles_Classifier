Sounds tedious, but the issue is one that’s been in Virginia’s political forefront: the ethics of politicians.\nThe Virginia Conflict of Interest and Ethics Advisory Council was created in reform legislation this year that was signed by Gov. Terry McAuliffe in April. The panel stems from the corruption conviction of former Gov. Bob McDonnell. It met for the first time Monday to review its duties.\nThe nine-member body includes four lawmakers, which subjected the General Assembly to complaints that it didn’t go far enough toward creating an independent group. McAuliffe and a study commission he formed that is chaired by former Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, a Republican, and former U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher, a Democrat, have called for an independent ethics commission.\nThe panel chose retired Court of Appeals Chief Judge Walter Felton as chairman.\nLawmakers on the panel are Sen. Tommy Norment, R-James City County; Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah County; Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax County; and Del. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.\nThe panel will issue formal and informal advice on ethics issues. Formal opinions will be published online. Informal advice will be kept secret and treated similarly to information protected by attorney-client privilege.\nOther duties of the panel will be approving certain travel for lawmakers and creating a searchable database with information from lawmakers’ financial disclosure forms.\nLawmakers are required to file those forms twice a year, in June and December.\nThe council will meet again this year at a date not yet set and must issue an annual report on its activities by Dec. 1 to the General Assembly and governor.\n“There’s a lot of moving parts. This is brand new,” said Chris Piper, the council’s executive director. “There’s a lot of things that we’re all trying to figure out.”\nPiper said he expects the council will receive a high volume of questions.\nDale Eisman, spokesman for D.C.-based Common Cause, which lobbies to remove the influence of money in politics, said Virginia needs an ethics commission independent of lawmakers that can investigate and audit books of candidates and campaign committees\n“It will take more than an ‘advisory council’ to remove the stain on Virginia’s reputation for good government left by the conviction of former Gov. McDonnell,” he said.\nHe also said the General Assembly should ban corporate campaign donations and impose limits on other campaign donations. Virginia is one of the few states in the nation with no cap.\nMcDonnell was sentenced in January to two years in prison following convictions last year in a corruption case. He remains free while his case is on appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court. His wife, Maureen McDonnell, also was convicted and remains free on appeal.\nPatrick Wilson , 804-697-1564, patrick.wilson@pilotonline.com\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
