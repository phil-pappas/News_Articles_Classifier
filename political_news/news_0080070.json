Marco Rubio accused Democrats of engaging in a \"liberal versus liberal\" debate Tuesday night Rubio said it reminded him of big liberal promises made in the mid-'80s Washington (CNN) Florida Sen. Marco Rubio knocked the Democratic candidates for president Wednesday, calling their matchup Tuesday night a \"liberal versus liberal debate about who was going to give away the most free stuff.\"\n\"If you watched that debate last night, it looked like something from the early '80s. It was basically a liberal versus liberal debate about who was going to give away the most free stuff: Free college education. Free college education for people illegally in this country. Free health care. Free everything,\" Rubio said on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends.\"\nRELATED: Hillary Clinton's big night on the debate stage\nThe first Democratic debate of six planned, hosted by CNN and Facebook in Las Vegas, offered Republicans a chance to move outside their own inner party battling and take some easy shots at the Democrats.\n\"Their answer to every problem in America is a government program and a tax increase. That's all they prescribe time and time again. And this is stuff from the '80s, the mid-'80s,\" Rubio said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:21:13.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
