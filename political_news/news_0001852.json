Federal Reserve finds that people with high credit scores are better at relationships.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/01/15 3:58 PM \"[I'm] very deeply disappointed about the meeting,\" King said, conceding later that perhaps liberals like him have been \"read[ing] too much into what the Pope thinks about gay marriage and the LGBT community in general.\"\nDuring Francis' secret meeting last week with Davis, which was reportedly initiated by Vatican officials , he gifted her two rosaries, asked her to pray for him and encouraged her to \"stay strong,\" according to her legal counsel.\n\nFrancis had won high marks from media earlier in his tenure for asking \" Who am I to judge? \" when addressing the issue of people who are inclined towards homosexuality, but also \"seeking the Lord in good faith.\" This is the main reason why his meeting with an anti-gay marriage Christian apparently came as a serious blow to America's commentariat.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner White House: Russia tensions 'not at all' a new Cold War \"They're trying to salvage their investment in this deteriorating situation\" in Syria, Josh Earnest said.\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/01/15 3:12 PM Elsewhere on MSNBC, \"The Last Word\" host Lawrence O'Donnell was similarly unhappy.\n\"It … made no sense to me that of all the people in the 50 United States to work through that filter to get into a room with the Pope, it made no conceivable sense to me that Kim Davis would be one of them,\" he said.\nThese hosts and their guests are certainly not alone in airing their deep disappointment in Pope Francis.\nLate Tuesday evening, after the pope's secret meeting was at last revealed, a slew of media figures came forward to bemoan that the Bishop of Rome would do something with which they disagreed.\n\"I don't begrudge Francis supporting someone standing up for religious beliefs. Where I draw the line is with Kim Davis,\" Washington Post columnist Jonathan Capeheart said on social media.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner FBI confirms investigation of Clinton's email server FBI director confident \"we have the resources and personnel assigned to this matter.\"\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/01/15 3:38 PM Chris Hughes' New Republic ran with a story headlined, \"The Pope was never America's liberal hero.
