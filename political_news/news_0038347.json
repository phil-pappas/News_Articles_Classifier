Because in Monday's New York Times is an articleonce you get past the tales of Republican committee member's \"Wine Wednesdays\" (with special glasses!) and their dreams of monogrammed Glockswith this little nugget, buried in the 25th paragraph: Senior Republican officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing confidential conversations, said that Mr. Boehner had long been suspicious of the administrations handling of the attacks and that Mrs. Clintons emails gave him a way to keep the issue alive and to cause political problems for her campaign. But he thought that the task was too delicate to entrust to others and that it should remain with Mr. Gowdy, the former prosecutor. Of course. Because we already know the truth about what happened in Benghazi. What we NEED is an investigation into why republicans should not be tried for treason for cutting funds to embassies.
