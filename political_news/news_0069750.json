Mike Pence is set to make what his office calls a major infrastructure announcement. \nThe Republican governor's announcement scheduled for Tuesday afternoon comes amid recent political sparring with Democrats over state highway conditions. \nPence said in August he was considering whether some of the state's $2 billion in reserves should be spent on highway improvements. Those comments came during the month-long emergency closure of an Interstate 65 bridge near Lafayette that forced drivers to take a long detour off the highway. \nDemocrats have persistently criticized Pence for underfunding highway maintenance, leaving the state with many roads and bridges in poor condition. The Pence administration has said accusations of the state's infrastructure crumbling are irresponsible scare tactics.  //on.whas11.com/1Lsex04 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:16:04.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
