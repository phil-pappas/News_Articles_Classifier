He was the victim of an egregious breach of privacy perpetrated by a roommate who, unbeknownst to him, set up a webcam to spy on him in an intimate act.\nMore importantly, Tyler was victimized by persistent bias and by a legal system that, even five years later, fails to take cyberabuse seriously. The result is an epidemic of cyberharassment that routinely targets women, girls, and gay, lesbian, bi and transgender youth most of all.\nAccording to several studies, nearly half of all LGBT youth experience cyberharassment each year. LGBT teens are three times more likely than heterosexual teens to be harassed online and twice as likely to receive threatening or harassing text messages. And adolescent girls are significantly more likely to experience cyberharassment than boys. Among youth, cyberharassment contributes to lower GPAs, higher truancy, spiraling depression and, sometimes, suicide.\nThe risk doesn't end with adolescence. Evidence from the organization Working to Halt Online Abuse, suggests that, among adults, women are singled out as targets online: Over a seven-year period, women accounted for nearly 73% of all reported incidents of cyberabuse.\nMisuse of technology, an unregulated internet, discrimination and cultural ignorance are at the root of cyberharassment's profoundly dangerous effects on society. And if we are serious about combatting this epidemic, we must attack it from all angles.\nVictims of cyberharassment know the painful truth that legal redress is, for the most part, out of reach. They cannot sue websites that host harassment because a federal law prohibits it. Suing harassers directly is not easy. Not only do many of them hide behind shields of anonymity in the darkest corners of Reddit and 4Chan, they are also likely judgment-proof — because they lack the money to pay civil damages.\nWhat's more, too few practicing attorneys have the time and necessary expertise to represent cyberharassment victims in court. Student victims can seek help from schools, but all too often, teachers and administrators are either part of the problem or feel constrained to act by the off-campus origin of most cyberharassment.\nIt's time to tame the frontier.\nFirst, we need more well-trained lawyers ready and willing to represent cyberharassment victims pro bono. There are a few pioneering firms and clinics in this space, but we need more. We also need to train today's attorneys to litigate digital harassment cases, many of which raise questions of proof, strategy and substantive law that are outside most attorneys' bailiwicks.\nSecond, we need legal reform. Criminalizing revenge porn — the unauthorized exposure of intimate photographs by exes, which is how many women get harassed — is a must, as is making reasonable tweaks to the immunity that still shields many of the internet's most notorious hosts of cyberharassment. We simultaneously need to help school districts draft, enact and implement anti-cyberbullying policies that recognize a school's constitutional power to respond to digital harassment, whether or not it originates on school grounds.\nThird, we need a comprehensive education project that teaches adolescents how to protect themselves online, helps parents instill values of digital citizenship and pushes policymakers and thought leaders to take cyberharassment seriously. Social scientists must fill research gaps on who gets victimized and by whom.\nFourth, we need more companies to invest in programs aimed at educating people of all ages about the threat and rise of cyberbullying, such as AT&T's Digital You program, which teaches people how to protect themselves against bullying and harassment online.\nAll of this would send a message to victims that they are not alone, that many people are looking out for them. Had Tyler felt less alone, he might be here today. It is time for every arm of society, from schools to industry, from parents to the practicing bar, to pay attention to the victims of the internet's dark alleys. Only then can we be truly safe, productive, and free online.\nWaldman is associate professor of law at New York Law School, director of the Innovation Center for Law and Technology, and founder and director of the Tyler Clementi Institute for Internet Safety.
