Jonathan Barrett by Jonathan Barrett A Perth family are preparing to give life to the fictional film The Castle – in which Mum, Dad and the kids fight off a government attempt to seize their home.\nResidents at risk of having their homes demolished to make way for the $1.6 billion Perth Freight Link – a road project to link the city's industrial suburbs to Fremantle port – have been warned the state government will finalise the route by the end of the month.\nThose affected have already likened their plight to the Kerrigan family, from the Australian comedy The Castle , and any decision to raze homes is likely to ignite a ferocious community backlash against a project backed by the federal and state Liberal governments.\nBut, if the government does want to take your home one day, what rights do you have?\n\"Tell them they're dreaming.\" A scene from \"The Castle\" movie. Supplied While laws differ between states, property experts say that saving a home subject to a \"taking order\" is nigh impossible, as a government has already decided that the planned infrastructure is in the broader public interest.\nLand holdings will have reservations placed on them, followed by a notice of intention to take, followed by a taking order and offer of compensation. Affected residents do get an opportunity to try to persuade a government to change its course, however it's unlikely by this stage plans are going to be redrawn.\n\"In my experience, objections are rarely if ever successful by the time a notice of intention to take has been issued,\" said James Graham, principal at Perth-based Borrello Graham Lawyers.\n\"It's usually a futile process: they've already decided it is in the public interest.\"\nTania and Damon Smirke, with their four sons, Joshua, Kieran, Matthew and Toby. Their home could be demolished to make way for the Perth Freight Link. Jonathan Barrett Mr Graham said it was important to get an independent valuation and advice as early as possible, to ensure fair compensation. Disputes can be resolved through negotiation or litigation, or a combination.\nThe issue has been complicated in Perth, as land long preserved for potential road upgrades to the Fremantle port was sold to private residents as state government priorities changed. The plans were revived in the 2014 federal budget, with the Commonwealth committing $925 million to the infrastructure.\nIf Perth Freight Link plans progress as expected – there are alternative proposals to construct a tunnel – one lane of the east-west Leach Highway would go through Damon and Tania Smirke's swimming pool, and their house would have to be demolished.\n\"We built this house with our bare hands,\" said Mr Smirke, who says his wife has earned the title \"cornice queen\" for her new-found expertise in putting up the ceiling feature. \"The house is irreplaceable.\"\nThe Smirkes are finishing renovating a large two-storey house – seven bedrooms and four bathrooms – designed to cater for their family of six. The house is specific to their needs, and they don't believe the government's market valuation would reflect the money they put into it, nor would it allow them to rebuild nearby.\nThe principal land valuer at WA Land Compensation, Bob Ferguson, said residents can make a claim for the \"value to the owner\" rather than just market value.\n\"My advice to people is to do your house up to the way you want it, even if there's a future threat of demolition. If Main Roads wants it they have can it – and pay you for it.\"\nThis principle has previously worked for rural home-owners who have part of their land seized. They might be able to argue that compensating for the depreciated value of the house is irrelevant, because they'll need to rebuild a new home somewhere else on the property.\nMr Ferguson said some people even emerge better after the government takes their land. He said some investors buy homes earmarked for future demolition at a cut rate, rent them out at full market value, then get compensation when the government eventually takes the land.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:06:13.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
