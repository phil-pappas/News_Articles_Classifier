All eyes will be on the crucial third phase on October 28, followed by fourth on November 1 and fifth on November 5 . Hence the parties are leaving no stone un-turned to woo the masses with apt slogans to catch their eyes. \nAmong the prominent ones include ‘Bahut hua jumlon ka war, phir ek bar Nitish Kumar ’ ( too much of barb-trading, vote for Nitish Kumar once again), screams a hoarding at the busy Exhibition Road intersection here while banners carrying NDA ’s war cry of ‘Badaliye sarkar, badaliye Bihar’ (change government, change Bihar) and the image of Modi-Shah duo, have become ubiquitous in the state capital, where poll excitement has reached a crescendo. \nThe state capital Patna , along with five other districts will go to polls on October 28 in the third phase of the high-octave Bihar elections, which will span 50 crucial constituencies. And after salvo-firing at rallies, ‘poster posturing’ is where real barbs are being traded. \nAll major locations and landmarks in the city are splashed with political colours, with BJP apparently a decibel up in the poster wars. Giant hoardings carrying the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah , beside the party’s slogan in the Bihar polls - ‘Badaliye sarkar, badaliye Bihar’ have flooded all parts of the city, from busy traffic intersections to flyovers to railway stations and other transport hubs, and markets, among other places. \nAnd, if Modi-Modi-Shah duo are being projected as vote magnets for the BJP led NDA , for the Grand Alliance , JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar has been fronted to win the battle of the eyeballs. \nCommuters crossing the old Chirayantand Bridge can see four rows of unipole advertisements by BJP bearing the Modi-Shah duo image and the rallying slogan of ‘Badaliye sarkar…’ \nKumar ruled Bihar for last 10 years in alliance with BJP , before snapping ties with the national party, and the publicity campaign centred around him, has been designed to inflict ‘caustic barbs’ on its opponents. \nAt the busy Fraser Road, Exhibition Road, among other prominent streets, the banner carrying Kumar’s image against a red background reads - ‘Jhhanse meyn na aayenge, Nitish ko jitayenge’ ( Will not be fooled, ensure Nitish’s win). Clearly the battle lines are drawn in this bitter battle for Bihar 2015. With D- Day on November 8, the battle will only get fierce and even nasty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:50:00.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
