By providing food security, education and employment training, ABLF supports individuals while strengthening the quality of community life on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside-Canada's most impoverished neighbourhood.\n\"This generous $20,000 donation to ABLF from Alive Publishing Group will go directly toward creating meaningful change on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside,\" says Mark Brand , Founder of ABLF. \"These funds will directly help to relieve poverty by first providing nutritious meals to those in need, and second, by providing job skills, training opportunities and job placement assistance to those with barriers to traditional employment.\"\n\"APG and ABLF align perfectly in their mutual desires to help educate and empower those who are open to changing their lives for the better,\" says Ryan Benn , Publisher and President of APG. \"When we can help those in need to find new and empowering ways to advance their personal security around food and employment, we extend our corporate values beyond ourselves and have a direct impact on the community at large.\"\nAlive Publishing Group is based in Richmond, BC , and provides natural health and wellness education, news and support across 16 different consumer- and industry-facing products and services. Now into its 41 st year, APG is a Canadian success story maintaining a strong and successful business model at a time when publishing around the globe sees its influence waning. APG has met that challenge head-on and diversified its content properties to ensure a solid future as a go-to content provider in the natural health category across the world.\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C7545&Transmission_Id=201510140900CANADANWWEB______C7545&DateId=20151014", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:57:58.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
