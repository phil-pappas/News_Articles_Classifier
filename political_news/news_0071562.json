That year, members said they turned in rusty and inoperable guns. The $100 MasterCard gift cards for each gun were used to buy ammunition for a National Rifle Association youth camp in Bloomington and bolt-action rifles for campers. \nBoch is vowing to return to Chicago with about 60 guns to turn in. \nInformation from: Chicago Sun-Times, http://chicago.suntimes.com/ \nThink your friends should see this?
