In July, it was 50.0.\nThe index, compiled by the Chinese Federation for Logistics and Purchasing and released Thursday, is based on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 indicate expansion.\nChina's economic growth held steady at 7 percent in the latest quarter ending in June, which was the weakest performance since the 2008 global crisis. Officials hope to maintain the growth rate for the rest of the year but many economists doubt the target will be met.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
