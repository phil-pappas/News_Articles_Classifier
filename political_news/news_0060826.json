Trump has widened his lead ahead of other Republican presidential candidates, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. Donald Trump and Ben Carson have widened their lead over the group of other 2016 Republican contenders in the race for the party’s nomination, a new poll shows.\nA CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday showed that 27% of registered Republican voters nationwide supported the bombastic billionaire, while 22% supported the retired neurosurgeon.\nThe next closest competitors were Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who both garnered about one-third the support of each of the two frontrunners, with 8%, the poll showed.\nNo other candidate got more than 5% support in the poll, which was conducted Oct. 14-17, weeks after the second GOP debate last month.\nThe biggest decline in support was felt by Carly Fiorina — she got 4% — who emerged from the Sept. 16 debate in Simi Valley, Calif., a resurgent candidate quickly gaining in polls.\nAndrew Harnik/AP Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and Donald Trump have put even more space in between themselves and other Republican presidential candidates, according to the recent poll. But the former tech executive has lost 11 percentage points since the last CNN/ORC poll, taken right after the debate, in which she registered 15% support.\nA separate NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday mirrored those results.\nIn that survey, Trump and Carson led the field with 25% and 22% support, respectively, while no other candidate got more than 13% support.\nFiorina got 7% support in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll.\nTags: Donald Trump , Ben Carson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:04:09.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
