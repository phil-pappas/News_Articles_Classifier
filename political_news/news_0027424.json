And would the FM ever have Mrs T back on the front bench?\nShare article “If the allegations are proved that will represent behaviour I find completely unacceptable,” said Ms Sturgeon through grinding molars. “I will take whatever actions I deem necessary.”\nIt ended with her declaring, in response to a query about start-ups, that she wanted Scotland to “to be seen as a great place - the best in the UK - to do business, set up businesses, expand businesses and invest in businesses”. Ms Thomson will no doubt testify to that.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-02T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:14:53.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
