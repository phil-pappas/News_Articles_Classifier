Webb and Jared Hasten, who took over the case for Brunswick after the settlement mess, say it’s meaning is obvious.\n“The jury’s question would lead any attorney familiar with the facts of this case to realize that the jury was inclined to attribute all responsibility for Scot Vandenberg’s accident to the ‘empty chair’ defendant, RQM LLC, not Brunswick,” they said, referring to another defendant not represented at trial.\nNot so fast, argues C. Barry Montgomery, who is now representing the Vandenbergs.\nHe argued it is “pure speculation” for Brunswick’s lawyers to say the AIG representative would have negotiated differently if he had known the content of the note.\n“Experienced trial lawyers certainly know not to read too much into notes from juries. The notes can mean anything or nothing,” Montgomery wrote.\nPerhaps, but that never stops experienced trial lawyers from dissecting such notes at length in the never-ending effort to read the tea leaves on where a jury is headed.\nThe Vandenbergs’ lawyers sought to block the evidentiary hearing that Lynch will conduct after Budzinski recused herself, saying it “would only provide a forum for the defense to develop evidence based on bald speculation and hindsight.”\nThey say it’s undisputed that AIG offered the $25 million settlement soon after jury deliberations began, an offer that was more than double the last offer made two days earlier.\n“One can assume that the reason for this offer was fear that the jury might award the plaintiffs substantially more,” they say.\nAbout an hour after receiving the offer, they say McNabola called AIG and accepted.\nThe hearing is slated to extend into Friday. On television, they could wrap it up in under an hour.\nFollow @MarkBrownCST\nTweets by @MarkBrownCST", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MarkBrownCST"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:10:12.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
