Advertisement More by this Author \nA supremacy war has erupted at the Mombasa County Assembly pitting two camps, one aligned to Governor Hassan Joho and the other to Nyali MP Hezron Awiti, splitting the legislative unit comprising of all elected ODM members, down the middle. \nIt all started when at least 15 MCAs in the 30-elected member assembly met to discuss among other things, the alleged arm-twisting and intimidation of renegade MCAs by a nominated member, ostensibly so that they may toe the governor’s line else they are kicked out of the party. The assembly has 15 nominated members. \nKongowea MCA Jabes Oduor told Sunday Nation that Mr Mohamed Hatimy (nominated), had been enlisted by Mr Joho’s camp to intimidate other MCAs. He also questioned Mr Joho’s loyalty to party leader Raila Odinga, claiming the latter was always “away” in the last few visits the Cord leader had made visits at the coast. \n“We are being told that we are not loyal to the party because of our opposition to the system but that is not true. We don’t want to be puppets and that’s the reason we keep the county executive in check by criticising them whenever they go wrong. But Mr Hatimy is being used to intimidate us. For instance, we are supposed to hold elections but we are not aware of any arrangements,” he said. \nHowever, Mr Hatimy said as the ODM chairman in Mombasa county he has never intimidated any member, adding that those in the rebel camp were serving other peoples’ interests. \n“That is not true,” he said. “If indeed I have done that let them come out in the open and tell me when, where and on who I did it to. The party constitution is clear on how members ought to behave and if they are not comfortable with being in ODM they should quit and stop wasting our time.” \nMr Hatimy added that contrary to claims by the MCAs that they were not intending to hold party elections, they had completed a sensitisation exercise and were awaiting the elections board’s nod on when they would elect officials. \nDuring a press conference on Tuesday last week, a section of supporters defended Mr Joho against accusations that his loyalty to Mr Odinga had waned. They attacked four MCAs who last week questioned Mr Joho’s loyalty towards Mr Odinga and ODM party. \nThe MCA’s – Mr Oduor, Mr Dan Onyango (Mikindani,) Mr Mohamed Ndanda (Kadzandani) and Mr Paul Onje of Junda, claimed that the governor was gradually drifting away from ODM towards Jubilee Alliance Party. \nLed by their spokesman Mr Mwinyi Menza, the supporters told off the four MCAs. \n“Governor Joho’s loyalty to ODM and party leader Raila Odinga is unquestionable and intact. Who are they (four MCAs) to question it? We know they are the ones working with non-ODM parties and we give them seven days to resign from their party positions and as ODM members,” said Mr Menza.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:54:10.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
