Lomax-O'dneal will oversee a roughly $2 billion budget. \n\"She is going to shatter two glass ceilings at once,\" Barry said. \"She will be a very critical member of my administration. She will advise me on the city's financial opportunities, and she will help me pay for the priorities that my budget will set.\" Barry retains four more Dean aides in mayor's office \nLomax-O'dneal is no stranger to Nashville's budget. She previously served as the city's deputy finance director, preparing and monitoring Metro's operating and capital budgets. She has more than 25 years of finance experience in the public and private sectors, including 15 years with Metro's Finance Department. \n\"These are huge, demanding tasks, and she has been an extremely sharp and an extremely steady manager of those assets over her 15 years,\" Barry said. \"She comes with an incredible wealth of experience.\" \nThe appointment will be submitted for approval by the Metro Council at the Oct. 20 meeting. Megan Barry picks Charles Robert Bone to lead transition team \nThe finance director position opened after Barry appointed the previous finance director, Rich Riebeling, to serve as her chief operating officer. The COO oversees day-to-day operations and is one of two positions that Barry discussed when considering restructuring the mayor's office. The chief of staff, who would manage the political side, is the second spot, and it remains open. \nBarry also made campaign pledges to create two new positions, including a director of transportation as well as a chief diversity officer. The mayor's office is budgeted for 30 positions. Barry, who was elected on Sept. 10 and sworn into office two weeks later, indicated that it could take a couple months to finalize her staff. \nReach Holly Meyer at 615-259-8241 and on Twitter @HollyAMeyer. \nMayor Megan Barry announces Talia Lomax-O'dneal as the new Metro Finance Director on Tuesday.
