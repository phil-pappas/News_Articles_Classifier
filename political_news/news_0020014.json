Biden avoided naming her among those decided in whether the operation should move forward.\n\"There were only two people who were definitive and were absolutely certain\" he said. Central Intelligence Agency Director Leon Panetta said \"go,\" Biden said, and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said \"don't go.\"\nClinton in the Democratic debate last week took a veiled shot at Biden by emphasizing her involvement in Obama's decision to authorize the raid.\nBiden has said that he has been mulling a possible bid for the Democratic nomination, but Clinton's strong performance at the debate has led some in the party to conclude Biden has waited too long to jump into the race. Clinton's campaign had seemed to be stumbling with the persistent controversy over her use of a private email server as secretary of state - raising doubts among some voters about her trustworthiness - but since the debate her poll standings have risen.\nThe White House declined to weigh in on whether Biden had changed his story about his position on the bin Laden move.\n\"I don't have any insight to share with you about the private conversations between the president and the vice president,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters.\nA Biden campaign would put Obama in the awkward position of having to choose between his vice president of seven years and his former secretary of state should the president decide to endorse a candidate during the 2016 primary season.\nBiden spoke during an event to honor former Vice President Walter \"Fritz\" Mondale, who served under President Jimmy Carter. Biden was joined by several political heavyweights who spoke about their relationships with Mondale, who served in the Senate, representing Minnesota, before becoming vice president.\n(Reporting by Alana Wise and Jeff Mason; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Howard Goller and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:07:50.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
