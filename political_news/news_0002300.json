(Published Friday, Oct. 16, 2015) With just weeks to go until the election, hundreds of campaign signs have disappeared or been defaced in East Lyme. Deputy First Selectman Kevin Seery is running and said a few of his signs are missing, but the vandal's main targets seem to be Mark Nickerson and Steve Carpenteri. Forty to 50 of Nickerson’s signs were taken or ripped up, while 100 of Carpenteri’s signs have been damaged. \"People invest a lot of time and money into getting these signs up, placed out and so forth to get the information and make the candidate’s name more aware to the public,\" Seery said. \"I think it is just disappointing that someone would deface these things because it is disrespectful to both sides.\" Area voters were surprised this type of vandalism is happening in East Lyme. \"It is bad. It is really bad. They should do something about that,\" Maria Cunha, of Waterford, said. \"It is disgusting. But everybody's got you know their own opinions. Some people show it in a different way, I guess,\" Rich Grillo, of Waterford, said. Both political parties have made police aware of the issue so they can keep an eye out for any suspicious activity. Officials hope this is not a sign of an attack on either party and would encourage everyone to be respectful of the campaign process.
