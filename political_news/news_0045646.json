More Disrupters rattle Europe’s old order \nFor Ms Rousseff, who is facing the possibility of impeachment by an opposition emboldened by her growing unpopularity , the enemy within is the last thing she needs. For Latin America’s largest economy, which is sinking into its deepest recession since the 1930s, ruling party infighting will sap investor confidence only further. \nDifferences between Ms Rousseff, who was Mr Lula da Silva’s chief of staff during his eight years in power between 2003 and 2010, and her mentor have long been said to exist but rarely have they burst into the open as they have this month. \nThe latest spat erupted after Mr Lula da Silva, still the pre-eminent figure in the ruling leftist Workers’ party (PT), criticised the economic policies of Joaquim Levy, Ms Rousseff’s University of Chicago-trained finance minister. \nAfter splurging on a sustained fiscal stimulus during her first four-year term between 2011 and 2014, Ms Rousseff appointed Mr Levy this year to clean up Brazil’s sinking public finances. \nThe problem for Mr Lula da Silva and the PT is that Mr Levy’s austerity programme, which includes clamping down on state bank lending and increasing interest rates to curb inflation, could not have come at a worse time. The party is already deeply unpopular over corruption at state-owned oil group Petrobras. \nWorse, the recession has pushed up unemployment while inflation is rising — a double whammy for the PT’s core voters in the unions and working classes. With municipal elections looming next year, the PT worries that Mr Levy’s austerity programme will be a lightning rod for popular anger. \nTo try to distance himself and the PT from the government’s austerity measures, Mr Lula da Silva lashed out during a recent trade union congress, where he argued Ms Rousseff’s government was behaving like the more economically orthodox opposition PSDB party that it beat in elections last October. \nThe friendly fire forced Ms Rousseff to declare that the PT’s opinion was not that of the government and that Mr Levy had her full confidence.
