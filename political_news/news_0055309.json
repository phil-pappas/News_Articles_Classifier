But an ABC News analysis of state level polling found that most candidates aren’t doing much better on their home turf than in the national spotlight.\nOver the spring and summer, many candidates – like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie , Ohio Gov. John Kasich and even New York Gov. George Pataki – once sat atop the polls in their home states.\nBut now the playing field has changed, cutting Jeb Bush’s support by two-thirds in Florida, chopping Kasich’s support in half in Ohio, and Christie’s support falling more than 30 points in New Jersey.\nHere’s the breakdown of how candidates perform when they compete for the nominations in their own backyard:\nFLORIDA – Former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio used to top the polls in June, but now sit in the second tier. Bush had the most dramatic fall – his Florida support cut to almost a third of what it was in February. Meanwhile, Rubio has maintained stable support, hovering in the mid-teens.\nQuinnpiac on 10/8: Trump 28, Carson 16, Rubio 14, Bush 12, Fiorina 7, Cruz 6…..\nQuinnipiac on 8/20: Trump 21, Bush 17, Rubio 11, Carson 11, Fiorina 7, Cruz 7…..\nQuinnipiac on 6/17: Bush 20, Rubio 18, Walker 9, Carson 7, Huckabee 6, Paul 5…..\nQuinnipiac on 3/30: Bush 24, Walker 15, Rubio 12, Carson 8, Cruz 7, Huckabee 6…..\nQuinnipiac on 2/3: Bush 32, Rubio 15, Huckabee 11, Walker 9, Carson 8…….\nOHIO – Gov. John Kasich has gone from leading in August to having his support cut in half in just two months, dropping 14 points to third place in Quinnipiac polling in his home state, where he is currently governor. Still, his 13 percent support in Ohio is better than his national numbers, where he remains in the low-mid single digits.\nQuinnipiac on 10/8: Trump 23, Carson 18, Kasich 13, Cruz 11, Fiorina 10, Rubio 7, Bush 4…..\nQuinnipiac on 8/20: Kasich 27, Trump 21, Rubio 7, Cruz 7, Carson 6, Fiorina 5, Bush 5……\nQuinnipiac on 6/17: Kasich 19, Bush 9, Walker 8Rubio 7, Pall 7, Huckabee 7……\nQuinnipiac on 3/30: Kasich 20, Cruz 9, Huckabee 9, Walker 9, Bush 8, Carson 8….\nQuinnipiac on 2/3: Kasich 14, Walker 11, Bush 10, Paul 10, Carson 8…….\nPENNSYLVANIA – Former Sen. Rick Santorum started as a player in the race for Pennsylvania’s delegates in the GOP nomination race back in the spring, but now he’s just a footnote in his home state, reflecting his low standing in national polls.\nQuinnipiac on 10/8: Trump 23, Carson 17, Rubio 12, Fiorina 8, Cruz 6, Christie 5, Bush 4, Huckabee 4, Kasich 3, Santorum 2 …\nQuinnipiac on 8/20: Trump 24, Carson 13, Rubio 10, Fiorina 7, Bush 6, Cruz 5, Paul 5, Santorum 4 …..\nQuinnipiac on 6/17: Rubio 12, Paul 11, Carson 10, Bush 10, Walker 9, Santorum 7 …..\nQuinnipiac on 3/30: Walker 14, Santorum 9 , Bush 9, Carson 9, Rubio 7, Cruz 7……\nQuinnipiac on 2/3: Bush 12, Christie 11, Huckabee 10, Santorum 8 , Carson 8, Cruz 6, Walker 6...\nMARYLAND – Former Gov. Martin O’Malley. While others have been getting a little love in their home state, O’Malley hasn’t been getting any. The former governor has been holding it down in the bottom tier.\nGoucher College on 10/6: Clinton 43, Biden 23, Sanders 17, O’Malley 2 , Webb 2…..\nWashington Post on 10/5: Clinton 63, Biden 9, Sanders 3, O’Malley 3 …\nWashington Post on 2/16: Clinton 72, Biden 8, O’Malley 5 …\nNEW YORK – Donald Trump leads the GOP nomination race in his home state, performing even better there than in most national polls. Former Gov. George Pataki actually tied for the lead over a splintered field in one poll this summer, but a separate poll now shows him near the bottom of the pack, reflecting his national struggle for support.\nSiena College on 9/21: Trump 34, Carson 14, Bush 11, Christie 9, Fiorina 8, Rubio 5, Kasich 4, Cruz 3, Pataki 3…\nQuinnipiac on 6/3: Pataki 11, Rubio 11, Bush 10, Walker 7…..

Hillary Clinton did hold a dramatic lead in New York over the summer, but a separate poll now shows her lead at more than 20 points – mirroring her lead shrinking in national polling. She also leads top Republicans in the general election.\nSiena College on 9/21: Clinton 45 , Biden 24, Sanders 23…\nQuinnipiac on 6/3: Clinton 55, Sanders 15, Biden 9…..\nQuinnipiac on 3/23: Clinton 51, Biden 8, Sanders 5……\nGeneral election: Siena College on 9/21: Clinton 53, Bush 36 // Clinton 55, Trump 36.\nCALIFORNIA – Carly Fiorina is mirroring her national numbers, sitting near the top tier with Trump and Carson in a recent California poll – but no boost from her Senate campaign there in 2010.\nField Research on 10/8: Trump 17, Carson 15, Fiorina 13 , Rubio 10, Bush 8…..\nNEW JERSEY – Gov. Chris Christie actually once garnered bare majority support last summer in the race for the GOP nomination. As of late June, Christie remained tied for the top spot, although his numbers had plummeted in recent polls.\nFairleigh Dickinson on 6/29/15: Christie 18, Bush 18, Trump 11, Walker 9, Rubio 6, Carson 6….\nFairleigh Dickinson on 4/22/15: Christie 20 , Walker 14, Bush 13, Paul 8, Cruz 8…\nFairleigh Dickinson on 8/29/14: Christie 51 , Paul 10, Rubio 9, Bush 6…\nWISCONSIN – Gov. Scott Walker, before calling it quits, was getting support from the Badger State in the race for the nomination. But a general election poll showed he would have lost his home state to Clinton by a wide 10 points.\nMarquette University 9/30/15: Trump 20, Carson 16, Rubio 14, Fiorina 11, Bush 7, Cruz 5, Paul 5….
