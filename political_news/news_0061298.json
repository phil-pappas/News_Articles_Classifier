Thanks to the rising tourism demand for mega-events such as World Expo 2020 in Dubai and the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar, the region's hospitality and retail sectors are set to adopt audiovisual technology solutions such as digital signage, guest room control, and wayfinding.\nAs a result, the Middle East and Africa's audiovisual market for hospitality and retail combined is set to reach USD 782 million by 2016, a 65 percent growth from USD 474 million in 2012, according to a report by InfoComm International. The organization's subsidiary InfoCommAsia Pte Ltd. is organizing InfoComm MEA 2015, the region's leading audiovisual event. In the UAE, hospitality will be the country's fastest-growing audiovisual segment, at a CAGR of 17 percent to 2016. Dubai is forecast to see strong growth, with the Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing projecting 25 million visitors for World Expo 2020.\n\"Hotel complexes and malls are the center for social life in the Middle East. Integrating LED seamless display walls with Big Data analytics can enhance the guest experience by capturing shoppers' attention with mall-wide entertainment, trying on clothes virtually, and supporting advertising innovation,\" said Jozef Dusenka, CEO, Leyard EMEA, a leading LED manufacturer in the global high-end display market. \nDigital signage in particular is rapidly-advancing, with 4K ultra-high definition LED walls opening up new retail opportunities, according to InfoComm International. \n\"From ultra-high-definition slim bezel monitors to a range of intelligent, interactive LED displays, Sharp's stand will dazzle visitors with a new line up of products and solutions that embrace style, design and intelligent innovation, suitable for hotels, restaurants, and retail outlets,\" said Ravinder Kumar, General Manager, Business Solutions Division, Sharp Middle East and Africa. \nRobust audio systems can also enhance the guest ambience -- whether setting the mood in a restaurant, providing an immersive concert-going experience, or unique shopping experience. \nFor Middle East hotels and malls to implement the audiovisual solutions, they need integrated back-end control and automation systems to centrally monitor, manage, and control lighting, temperature, security, digital signage, and audio and video. \n\"Audiovisual systems can no longer work in separate silos - rather control and automation systems bring together data from various audiovisual technologies to analyze venue and mobile device usage, run remote diagnostics, and schedule maintenance - ensuring the top-line guest experience,\" said Robin van Meeuwen, CEO, Crestron EMEA. \nAudiovisual solutions in hospitality and retail will be a key focus for the more than 200 manufacturers and suppliers from 30 countries who are set to attend InfoComm MEA 2015. \nThe 5th InfoComm MEA will run under the theme of \"Digital Interconnect for Peak Performance,\" co-located with GITEX Technology Week 2015 from 19-21 October 2015 at the Dubai World Trade Centre.
