For many years, Technogym has been active promoting wellness as a social opportunity for communities, governments and enterprises. \"Let's Move and donate food\" is an initiative aimed at leveraging technology to help address world hunger, targeting a tech-savvy generation. Technogym provides the first platform to connect equipment to a cloud ecosystem for physical exercise management.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277653\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277652LOGO\n releases/technogym-to-donate-650000-meals-to-malnourished-children-300161208.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151016/277652LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277652LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151016/277653", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277653", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/technogym-to-donate-650000-meals-to-malnourished-children-300161208.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN30389&Transmission_Id=201510161042PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN30389&DateId=20151016"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:12:04.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
