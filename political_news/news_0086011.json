Cruz has been surprisingly effective at landing top GOP moneymen, collecting more than $50 million for his campaign and super PACs.\nThe Club, which is one of the most conservative spending groups in elections, is helping raise money for four presidential candidates; Cruz, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. But no other presidential candidates are confirmed to attend.\n\"We believe he's a very pro-growth senator and would be a good pro-growth president,\" said Doug Sachtleben, the group's spokesman.\nThe $1,500-a-head summit at the luxury Hotel del Coronado will feature \"conversations about policy and politics with America's leading conservative, pro-growth Congressmen, Senators and Governors,\" according to the invitation. Conservative favorite Rep. Ron DeSantis, who is now running for a Senate seat in Florida, and Fox News personality Greg Gutfeld will also speak.\nAt the Club's more extensive three-day retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, in February, six candidates earned facetime with the party's donors, who tend to butt heads with more GOP establishment financiers: Bush, Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Walker dropped out last week, and Pence chose to not enter the race.\nCruz is a natural fit for the group, which is unafraid to battle in Republican primaries. One of the main donors to the Club for Growth's super PAC , New York hedge funder Bob Mercer, gave $11 million to start his own super PAC backing Cruz , Keep the Promise I.\nOne potential area of friction: The Republican front-runner, Donald Trump, who Cruz has embraced even though the Club has unveiled a $1 million campaign to tear him down.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics", "http://www.eventbrite.com/e/club-for-growth-economic-conference-san-diego-registration-17398508407"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:16:32.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
