When it comes to political writing, he needs to get out of the building,\" he said.\nAnd he also defended Carson's original comments.\n\"He said what I hope I would do is fight back. That’s what we all hope. We never know until we're in that situation. He wasn’t casting judgment on anyone. Just asking what he would do. And then they take that out of context and try to turn it into something else. It’s ridiculous,” he said.\nThe GQ article described comments from Republican presidential candidates as an \"arms race of stupid.\"\nBennett said, \"well everybody is stupid who doesn't agree with him 100 percent.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.gq.com/story/fuck-ben-carson?mbid=social_twitter"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:52:07.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
