He hinted strongly that he was set to announce that control over abortion law is also set to be devolved. \nMr Mundell said the current Scotland Bill would be a \"game-changer\" and usher in a \"new era\" of devolution. Full powers over income tax rates and bands are set to come into force from April 2017. Promoted stories \nHe said: \"Scottish Government ministers will be able to design a significant part of Scotland's welfare system and control income tax to pay for it. If they want to top up existing benefits, they will be able to. If they want to introduce payments to those in short-term need or design new benefits in those welfare areas being devolved that will also be an option available to them. \n\"Powers in the Scotland Bill ensure Scottish Parliament will have the means to pay for any changes, but it will have to justify them to the public, as under the new arrangements, income tax raised in Scotland will stay in Scotland and be spent in Scotland.\" \nThe Scottish Government said that it would use new powers over welfare to design a fairer and simpler welfare system. A new paper will be launched today setting out responses to a consultation over a new Scottish system, with a further paper setting out a outline vision for social security in Scotland promised by the end of the year. \nHowever, deputy First Minister and SNP Finance Secretary John Swinney said there was a \"significant amount of doubt\" over whether the Scottish Government would be able to reverse tax credit cuts. \nHe said there remained vetoes in the Scottish Bill meaning UK Government approval would be required for benefit changes and that it was \"very unlikely\" that an estimated £6 billion needed to reverse benefit cuts in Scotland could be found. \nMr Swinney added: \"We'll do everything in our power and the resources available to us to tackle the issues... but the cumulative effect of the reductions in benefits in Scotland will be of the order of £6 billion by the end of this decade. Share article \n\"I'm simply saying that financially that will be a challenge for the Scottish Government given the many pressures and issues that we have to address. \n\"Will we be able to reverse every single one of the welfare cuts of the United Kingdom government? I think that will be unlikely for the Scottish Government to be able to undertake.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:56:18.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
