Only 16 of 534 submissions on the discussion document supported the government’s plan. \nToday, parliament can show it has listened to people in Canterbury, and trusts them to make their own decisions,\" says Megan Woods. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
