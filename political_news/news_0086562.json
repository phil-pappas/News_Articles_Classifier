(Photo: Shelley Mays / The Tennessean) Story Highlights A reasonable rollout is needed to make the local-hire law effective, Barry's administration says. Backers and opponents of Amendment 3 called for a delay on implementation. Amendment 3 did not specify when the measure should go into effect. 10 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIn a landslide, Nashvillians went to the polls in August and approved Metro Charter Amendment 3 to ensure that local workers are guaranteed jobs on city-funded construction projects. \nIt became the new policy of Metro. But the amendment did not specify when it must go into effect. \nSilence on that area is newly elected Mayor Megan Barry's rationale for having the authority to delay the rollout of Amendment 3, which requires that 40 percent of workers hired for Metro-funded construction projects reside in Davidson County. \nThough Nashvillians voted 58 percent to 42 percent to adopt the amendment upon passage — Barry herself was a champion for the cause as well — her administration argued Thursday that a \"fair reading of Amendment 3\" must allow for a reasonable implementation period. \nNo one has formally challenged her administration's legal interpretation on this point. Until the policy is administered, Metro contractors are not regulated on hiring locally. \nThe Procurement Division of the Metro Finance Department had originally set an implementation date of Oct. 1 for the local-hire rule, which applies to projects that cost $100,000 or more. But Barry, in a letter to the Metro Council on Wednesday announcing the postponement, pointed to requests for delays from representatives of unions who advocated for the amendment and contractors who opposed it. Among the lingering issues: questions over Nashville's workforce being properly trained and large enough. \nWhile making clear that she still supports the principles of Amendment 3, Barry alluded to concerns raised by stakeholders that new procedures might hinder Metro's ability to move forward with construction projects and thus be \"counterproductive\" toward the intended goal of putting more Davidson County residents to work. Megan Barry delays Nashville's local-hire law \n\"Implementation of any major change to purchasing practices takes time,\" Barry spokesman Sean Braisted said in a statement to The Tennessean, explaining the administration's justification for having authority to determine when to implement the law. \"Important parts of solicitation and contract documents have to be rewritten and potential contractors, laborers and others who will be affected have to be educated about the changes. \n\"Taking the time necessary to handle the implementation carefully helps promote fairness to the contracting community and prevent costly mistakes and delays in starting important public projects. So, a fair reading of Amendment 3, particularly given that it does not specify an effective date, must allow for some reasonable implementation period.\" \nBraisted added: \"A ramp-up period is even more appropriate than usual here. Gathering input from contractors, laborers and others would help in working with important undefined terms and in setting up fair and appropriate measures for compliance and enforcement, which the Amendment does not address.\" \nBarry's administration has not set a new implementation date, making the delay indefinite. \nAmendment 3 also requires \"significant effort\" be made to ensure 10 percent of the workforce on city-funded construction projects goes to low-income residents. \nNashville's local-hire regulation was opposed by Barry's election opponent, David Fox; the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce; and area builders and contractors. Earlier this month, state Sen. Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, calling the measure \"misguided\" and constitutionally suspect , filed a state bill that he says would prevent local governments from requiring a company bidding on a public construction project to employ individuals who reside within their jurisdiction. \nBarry, who wants to research best practices of other cities with similar local-hire requirements during the delay, has indicated that her goal is to create more local jobs on Metro projects even if the local-hire amendment is overturned. \nAmong the groups that had called for a delay was the Southeast Laborers' District Council, a division of the Laborers' International Union of North America, which had pushed for Amendment 3. The laborers union suggested a rollout date of March 31 to provide discussion among all the various stakeholders. \nIn a letter this week to Metro Purchasing officials, Glenn Farner, business manager of Southeast Laborers' Council, said his organization agrees with other interested parties that Nashville needs a \"more expansive and better trained local workforce\" before the new policy gets added to Metro's procurement solicitations. \nBarry, in an interview with The Tennessean's editorial board last week, said that one of the first things she would do in her first 30 days would be to bring together the laborers and developers to discuss making the Amendment 3 procedures work without halting construction projects. \nShe talked about the possibility of issuing waivers and hinted that a delay could be possible. \n\"I know the laborers — because I've had this conversation — they don't want to impact the development that's going on. They also want to say, 'Look, if we need to step this back and if we need to look at what works legislatively, let's do it, or what we need to do to implement (it).' So, I think there's a lot of agreement that there's a problem we're trying to solve, what's the best way to solve it.\" \nReach Joey Garrison at 615-259-8236 and on Twitter @joeygarrison. 10 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1FJjPUG TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:01:56.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
