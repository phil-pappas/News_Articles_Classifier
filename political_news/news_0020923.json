At first glance, it certainly seems that 2015 has been a bad year to be a front-runner. The Democratic front-runner is plagued by terrible character ratings and shrinking leads in the polls. The first presumptive GOP front-runner, Jeb Bush, is mired somewhere around sixth place right now. The second front-runner, Scott Walker, is already back home in Madison, Wisconsin. Story Continued Below \nYet even as Clinton flounders and the GOP establishment appears in total disarray, a closer examination of the electoral history shows that the two parties face very different challenges. There are, in fact, very different breeds of front-runners, even as they all inevitable face electoral setbacks—and Hillary Clinton, as weakened as she may be, is in much better shape than the candidates purportedly at the front of the GOP pack. \nIf Leo Tolstoy had covered American politics, he might say that “all front-runners become unhappy; but each becomes unhappy in his or her own way.” Or perhaps we could borrow from George Orwell, who didn’t quite say: “Not all front-runners are equal, but some are way, way more unequal than others.” \nWhile it’s clear that both parties have front-runners, that title doesn’t represent similar stature or staying power. Hillary Clinton, nearly every analyst, pundit and observer agrees, still stands the best chance of winning the Democratic nomination. Yet on the other side, while Donald Trump possesses a solid lead in nearly every poll and every early state, the entire political establishment anticipates that he’ll ultimately follow Wile E. Coyote right off the cliff (although they might be wrong). The GOP in particular in recent elections has churned through FRINO after FRINO—candidates who for a short period lead the polls and suck up media attention, all without ever really building the structure and grass-roots base necessary to sustain a long race. \nSo how do we tell the difference between a “real” front-runner, as Hillary Clinton seemingly is, and a FRINO like Donald Trump and, to a lesser degree, second-place Ben Carson? \nPerhaps Donald Rumsfeld had the right rubric: When it comes to front-runners, there are “known knowns,” “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns.” It’s in looking at the one key front-runner “known known” that we can begin to understand the sharp distinctions among those who at one point or another lead the contest for a presidential nomination. \nThe “known known” is simple: Sooner or later, one way or another, the front-runner for a presidential nomination always confronts a brush with disaster. It can happen a year before; it can happen in the middle; it can happen at the last minute; it can be a momentary setback, a serious impediment, a fatal blow. \nEvery front-runner, somewhere, somehow, takes a punch. What precisely that punch is, that’s the “known unknown.” How the candidate responds, that’s the “unknown unknown.” \nThe travails of the front-runner extend far back in our political history. New York Gov. William Seward was the overwhelming early favorite to win the 1860 Republican nomination until a one-term ex-congressman from Illinois showed up, a fact that could provide some comfort to the New York senator who was the presumptive front-runner for the 2008 nomination until a first-term senator from Illinois showed up. And the pre-primary era is filled with near-death experiences. Dwight D. Eisenhower was on the verge of losing to Senator Robert Taft in 1952—the convention logistics were controlled by Taft backers—until a surge of telegrams and phone calls from constituents watching at home on their new-fangled “TVs” persuaded the delegates to side with Ike on crucial credentials fights. John F. Kennedy secured his first ballot nomination in 1960, when the last state, Wyoming, gave him enough delegates to put him over the top. As Robert Caro has written, had Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson not dithered for months before his last-minute candidacy, JFK would almost surely have been denied a first-ballot win—to what effect, no one can say. \nIt’s when the primaries replaced power brokers as the source of delegates, however, that the trials by ordeal of the front-runners became a visible, permanent staple of our campaigns. In 1972, the very first “primary centric” contest, Senator Edmund Muskie entered with the backing of regulars and reformers alike, and the memory of his impressive run as Hubert Humphrey’s 1968 running mate. If party leaders still controlled delegates the way they had in earlier times, he would have been all but assured to win the nomination. Instead, facing an opponent fueled by anti-Vietnam war passion, and winning the New Hampshire primary by “less than expected,” Muskie found himself out of the race by spring. \nIf you’re looking for a Unified Field Theory of why front-runners always stumble, you won’t find it here. Yes, it always happens, but rarely in the same way—or at the same time in the cycle. \nSometimes, thanks to the insanely early polling that now begins about the time the inaugural parties end, the leaders should more properly be deemed FRINOs from the start. Joe Lieberman may have led the Democratic pack in January 2003, but that was almost surely a matter of name recognition stemming from being the party’s vice presidential nominee in 2000. At other times early in the 2004 cycle, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton were top choices, even though neither made a move toward entering that race, and for one brief shining moment General Wesley Clark was atop the polls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:08:34.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
