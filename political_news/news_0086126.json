There were also concerns that the proposals could be expanded.\n\"We are concerned that this is an opening salvo that could eventually lead to a proposal to tax mom and pop investors,\" said Bill Harts, chief executive officer of HFT advocacy group Modern Markets Initiative.\nClinton would also pursue additional oversight of the \"shadow-banking\" sector by imposing other margin and collateral requirements on risky short-term borrowing; review recent regulatory changes to the money market fund industry for possible holes; create new reporting requirements for hedge funds and private equity firms; and strengthen the authority of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.\nUnless the Democrats win a majority in the Senate and retake the House of Representatives in the 2016 elections, the chances of the proposals being enacted are low, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note to clients.\n(Additional reporting by Ross Kerber , Sarah Lynch , Dan Freed, David Henry, Olivia Oran ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:03:35.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
