Martin O'Malley. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, however, has remained steadfast in her decision that there will only be six sanctioned debates for the Democratic presidential candidates.\nA DNC spokeswoman told The New York Times that Gabbard was not uninvited, but that the committee communicated that the focus at the debate should be on the candidates present and the difference from Republicans.\nRepresentatives for the DNC and Gabbard did not immediately return a CNN request for comment.\nWeaver said the Vermont independent senator, running second in the polls to Hillary Clinton, is a supporter of more debates.\n\"We would love to have debates: The more debates, the better,\" Weaver said on Monday. \"It's healthy for the Democratic Party to have more debates.\"\nWeaver said more debates would keep media attention on Democrats and would feature the left's flank of the party's platform \"on the frontburner.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links":
