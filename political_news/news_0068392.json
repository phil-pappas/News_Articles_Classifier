(AP) - Two men are facing charges for the 1984 rape and strangulation of a 14-year-old suburban Philadelphia girl found dead in woods along a road.\nBucks County authorities say 55-year-old George Franz Shaw, of Geneva, Florida, raped and killed Barbara Rowan inside his home, and 51-year-old Robert Scott Sanders, of Stroudsburg, helped dump her body.\nPolice say Shaw killed Barbara while she was baby-sitting his daughter and he was high on methamphetamine.\nSanders is charged with hindering apprehension.\nTwo weeks after Barbara's parents reported her missing in August 1984, her body was found less than a quarter mile from her Bensalem home.\nProsecutors are seeking to have Shaw extradited. Sanders is jailed on unrelated charges.\nCourt officials had no information on whether either suspect has a lawyer.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:34:14.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
