John Kasich (R) (Jim Cole/Associated Press) October 18 at 7:51 PM One small detail was missing from Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s plan to return authority to the states as outlined in his Oct. 16 op-ed, “ Washington has become obsolete .” According to the governor, a Republican candidate for president, the states know how to spend their money better than the federal government does. I assume he intends for the tax dollars that states send to Washington be returned to them on a dollar-for-dollar basis. After all, if the federal government is too inept to determine how the revenue should be spent programmatically, would it be capable of determining how it should be disbursed geographically?\nIf my assumption is correct, Mr. Kasich probably would find support in the blue states of New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, which receive less in federal spending than they contribute in federal taxes.\nVictor A.
