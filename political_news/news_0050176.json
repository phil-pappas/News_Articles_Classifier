This will impact on more than 95 per cent of all juice and non-alcoholic beverages sold in New Zealand. \n\"The food industry has an important role to play in the government’s plan to reduce childhood obesity. As a result of this rating system businesses are looking more carefully at their recipes to see where there is room to reformulate and improve the nutritional content.\" \nThe Health Star Rating system is a voluntary labelling system using a star rating scale of ½ to 5 stars to help people choose the healthiest item when comparing similar packaged foods, such as breakfast cereals. The system is not designed to compare items across different product ranges, for example breakfast cereals and yoghurt. \nFor further information about the Health Star Rating system can be found on the Food Smart website, and information about the Childhood Obesity Plan can be found at www.health.govt.nz. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:08:26.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
