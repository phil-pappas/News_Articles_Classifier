(AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici)\nAssociated Press Oct. 11, 2015 | 6:00 a.m. EDT + More ANKARA, Turkey (AP) â€” Developments relating to Saturday's deadly bombings targeting a peace rally in the Turkish capital of Ankara. All times local.\n___\n12:40 p.m.\nA Turkish news agency reports that police have detained 14 suspected members of the Islamic State group in the central Turkish city of Konya.\nThe Dogan news agency says the group, which included a woman, was taken away Sunday following simultaneous raids to homes.\nIt was not clear if the detentions were related to the twin blasts in the capital Ankara on Saturday which killed 95 people and injured hundreds of others.\nPrime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said there were \"strong signs\" that the attacks were suicide bombings. He suggested the Islamic State group or Kurdish rebels could be responsible.\n___\n12:15 p.m.\nScuffles have broken out in the Turkish capital as police used tear gas to prevent pro-Kurdish politicians and other mourners from laying carnations at the site of two suspected suicide bombings that killed 95 people and wounded hundreds in Turkey's deadliest attack in years.\nPolice held back the mourners, including the pro-Kurdish party's co-leaders Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag, insisting that investigators were still working at the site.\nA group of about 70 mourners were eventually allowed to enter the cordoned off area outside the capital's main train station Sunday to briefly pay their respects for the victims.\nThe group of mourners then began to march toward a central square in Ankara, chanting slogans against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom many hold responsible for the spiraling violence that has plagued Turkey since the summer.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
