STRINGER/REUTERS The front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination also said he would revoke the passports of U.S. citizens who have traveled abroad to fight for ISIS. Previous Next Enlarge Donald Trump on Wednesday promised to close certain mosques in the U.S. if elected President.\nTrump, discussing his strategy to fight ISIS during an interview on Fox Business Network, also said he would revoke the passports of U.S. citizens who have traveled abroad to fight for ISIS.\n\"I would do that,\" Trump said after FBN host Jim Varney asked him if he would favor revoking passports and closing mosques. \"Absolutely. I think it's great.”\n“If you go out, you go fight for ISIS, you can't come back. Why can't you do it? You can do it here,” he added.\nVarney, however, then pressed the 2016 Republican front-runner, asking again: \"Can you close a mosque? I mean, we do have religious freedom.\"\nERIC THAYER / Reuters/REUTERS \"Can you close a mosque? I mean, we do have religious freedom,\" pressed Fox Business News host Jim Varney. \"Well, I don't know,\" Trump responded. \"It depends on if the mosque is, you know, loaded for bear, I don't know. You're going to have to certainly look at it.\"\nThe comment drew immediate rebuke from at least one fellow Republican — Rep. Peter King (R-Long Island).\n“Donald Trump is talking before he knows what he’s talking about. Listen I have been critical of people in the Muslim community, but the fact is you can’t be going around shutting down mosques,” King said on Fox News Channel moments later.\n“I think we should have surveillance of mosques. I think we should be trying to find out what is going on in a mosque, find out if there’s activity in that mosque, where there’s weapons or conspiracy going on,” he added. “Then yes you can take action. But to be casually, the way Donald Trump seems to be talking about shutting down mosques? No.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:17:28.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
