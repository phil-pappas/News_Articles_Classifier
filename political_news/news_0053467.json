Overfishing in our seas and harmful airborne particles released from home heating are also declining. \nThe report finds deterioration for areas like coastal sea-level rise, concentrations of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, populations of some native plants and animals, and river water quality from intensive land use. \n“New Zealanders’ past and present activities are putting pressures on our environment,” Ms Robertson said. “These pressures are growing as our population increases, our economy develops, and our lifestyles change. \n“The evidence in this report will help communities, central and local government, iwi, and business to make choices about how we manage our natural resources.” \nMs MacPherson said the report uses robust data from hundreds of sources, and follows international best practice for environmental reporting. “We would like to improve the data for future reports, and we are working on this,” she said. \n‘The report is supported by interactive web pages containing trend and regional data. I would encourage people to take a look at the areas they are interested in.” \nEnvironment Aotearoa 2015 was produced in the spirit of the Environmental Reporting Act passed on 24 September. Future reports will be part of a three-year cycle, in which individual aspects of the environment are assessed as well as an overview, like Environment Aotearoa 2015 . The next report – about fresh water – will be released next year. \nSee the key findings and background below for more information. \nSee also:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:34:59.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
