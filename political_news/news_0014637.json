This might suggest at least that he was sincere (if totally wrong) about the 'WMD threat', at least at that time. Guilty of gullibility and being manipulated by the USA if not intentional deception, although I am sure that came later You are right. It is clear he is sincere is his belief the threat was real.This is the critical part of his defence. There was evidence of WMD, it was just not as strong in hindsight as they thought. That they were utterly convinced (wrongly) is an important part of history that we should not forget - lest we repeat the mistake. It would be a mistake to assume Blair made it all up to justify war - to make him out as evil etc. - as that would not learn any real lessons. The real lesson was that the intel - before they actually got on the ground - appeared to be convincing. It is all too easy to smart after the event - but looking into the future decisions will always have to be based on intel that may not be perfect. Simply you can say the burden of proof has to be much much higher - that is no doubt true.Did the US/UK go looking for WMD expecting to find them? I suspect they did and were as surprised as anyone. Those who said they knew there weren't any are kidding themselves - they knew for certain no such thing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:20:31.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
