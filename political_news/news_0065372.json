(Photo: Danielle Duval / Lansing State Journal) \nCONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Washington — Rep. Dan Kildee has requested an investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency into the Flint water crisis, saying the unacceptable lead levels detected in the city’s water “were a failure of government at every level.”\nKildee, a Democrat from Flint Township, wrote Wednesday to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy about the need for accountability “to restore confidence and to ensure that these failures never happen again,” following revelations that lead levels existed in city water at dangerous levels for months.\n“Unfortunately, the citizens of Flint are the victims in this situation. They deserve a thorough investigation and answers to these questions,” Kildee wrote to McCarthy.\nThe request comes after Michigan’s top environmental official acknowledged late Sunday the state made mistakes in its handling of Flint’s long-running water crisis. He made changes, including reassigning a top official responsible for the safety of drinking water.\nDan Wyant, director of Michigan’s Department of Environmental Quality, said staff members applied the wrong standards of the Lead and Copper Rule that governs testing and monitoring for drinking water. The result was that proper controls regarding corrosion were not put in place when the city began drawing its water from the Flint River in spring 2014.\nKildee is requesting that, at minimum, the EPA conduct a review of its oversight of state programs, looking at issues such as whether the agency evaluated testing guidelines that the state was using in Flint.\nKildee asks whether EPA was aware that the state was applying standards of the Lead and Copper Rule designed for populations below 50,000, even though Flint has a population of roughly 100,000 requiring two, six-month testing programs of water to determine proper corrosion controls.\nKildee also wants to know when the EPA first became aware of potential elevated levels of lead in Flint’s water, and at what point the agency is required to notify officials after learning of such an issue.\nThe state released documents in the past week to the media — originally requested by Virginia Tech professor Marc Edwards — showing state officials seemingly failed to heed repeated warnings from the EPA as far back as February about potential problems with Flint’s water system.\nWyant admitted Sunday the state applied the wrong standards of the Lead and Copper Rule, using the standard for cities with populations of 50,000 or less instead of the one for a population like Flint’s, which is 100,000.\nThe congressman requested that McCarthy respond by Oct. 27.\nThe EPA is sending federal technical advisers to assist with the Flint crisis, following requests by Kildee’s office last week.\nGov. Rick Snyder said this week he's asked for a report on how the state’s environmental department didn't detect lead-leaching corrosion in the city's aging pipelines.\nProblems began with Flint's water in the spring of 2014, when the city switched to Flint River water. Residents complained the tap water had strange coloring, smell and taste.\nIn the last month, those concerns were dramatically heightened by studies that show lead levels in some children have risen since the switch from Detroit's water system. Those studies showed that, in some areas, lead levels in children's blood samples have doubled and, in two ZIP codes, tripled.\nmburke@detroitnews.com \n(202) 662-8736", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:00:14.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
