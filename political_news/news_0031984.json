Paul Ryan, R-Wis., is surrounded by media as he arrives for a House GOP conference meeting in Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015. (Photo: Evan Vucci / AP) \nCONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Washington — Some Michigan Republicans embraced the idea of electing Rep. Paul Ryan as House speaker after the Wisconsin Republican told GOP lawmakers late Tuesday that he will run only if he emerges by week’s end as their consensus candidate.\nIn the closed-door session, the 45-year-old Ryan told the House Republicans that he will “be all in” if all factions — including the hard-line House Freedom Caucus — share his vision and he receives the endorsements of the major caucuses.\nAfter the Republicans' meeting, Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Zeeland, said Ryan is plainly reluctant to take on the speakership, in part because of concerns over sacrificing time with his young family.\n“It’s really going to be a tough job, but nobody’s better-suited for it,” said Huizenga, a third-term congressman from west Michigan.\n“Nobody knows policy as well as Paul does. The guy knows this stuff stone cold. And he can communicate it,” he added. \"Beyond that, he’s been vetted at the highest levels. He knows how to handle the pressure, knows how to find his balance in life.\"\nCongress is nearing an early November deadline to raise the federal borrowing limit or invite a first-ever default. A deadline to pass spending legislation or risk a government shutdown will follow in early December.\nRep. Justin Amash, R-Cascade Township and a member of the Freedom Caucus, said on Twitter Wednesday he would vote against a measure that would effectively raise the debt limit.\nWhile the Libertarian-leaning congressman didn’t indicate how he felt about Ryan’s possible candidacy, he did retweet Tuesday night a message from the Freedom Caucus that said, “The next speaker must follow House rules and commit to an open process for debating and amending legislation. Let the House work its will.”\nSome members of the Freedom Caucus were unconvinced after hearing from Ryan.\n“I think he has to campaign for it. We’ve heard one speech,” said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa. “We’re willing to listen but it’s the beginning of the conversation as far as I’m concerned.”\nBut most of the nine Michigan Republicans seem likely to back a Ryan candidacy since they also backed the current House speaker, John Boehner, R-Ohio. Reps. Candice Miller of Harrison Township and John Moolenaar of Midland indicated late Tuesday that they would support Ryan.\n“I support Paul Ryan for Speaker. He’s done great work and been a leader of ideas and substance,” Moolenaar said in a statement.\n“He is willing to serve our country, and I hope more conservatives will continue to unite around him for speaker.”\nFreshman Rep. Mike Bishop, R-Rochester, was equally effusive in his support.\nRyan “is the right person to unite & lead us forward,” Bishop wrote on Twitter. “Proud to support him for Speaker of the House.”\nHuizenga said he got to know Paul when he first arrived in Washington and regularly worked out with him and a few others.\n“I’ve never known anyone more disciplined and focused personally and professionally,” Huizenga said. “And I just don’t see anybody in our conference able to pull together a majority of our conference to then carry that onto the floor for 218 votes, other than Paul.”\nPaul still has to win the endorsement of the conference's major caucuses, some of whom are split on his candidacy.\nHuizenga said he's optimistic about Ryan’s ability to unite the conference in part because the House Ways & Means chairman is a member of a younger generation of politicians that understands the need to prioritize communication, both inside and outside of the party — something that Boehner didn't always do.\n“That was not Boehner’s style at all. I get that, but expectations have changed,” Huizenga said.\nmburke@detroitnews.com \n(202) 662-8736", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:00:15.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
