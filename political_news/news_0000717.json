But we tell him to make the iron himself: don’t you see we are providing employment for you? Sire, this is exactly the same thing in effect as if we were to say to the country, “Work with your left hand, and not with the right.”\nAs regards the efficiency of the measure, it is incontestable. It is difficult, much more difficult than one would suppose, to do with the left hand what we have been accustomed to do with the right. You will be convinced of this, Sire, if you will condescend to make trial of our system in a process which must be familiar to you; as, for example, in shuffling a deck of cards. For this reason we flatter ourselves that we are opening to labor an unlimited career.\nThe moment your new law comes into operation, the moment right hands are amputated or tied up, the face of everything will be changed. Twenty times, thirty times, more embroiderers, polishers, laundresses, seamstresses, milliners, shirtmakers, will not be sufficient to supply the wants of the kingdom, always assuming, as before, the consumption to be the same.\nYes, we can make a touching picture of the prosperity of the millinery business. Every dress will occupy a hundred fingers, instead of ten. No young woman will be idle.\nShould your Majesty consent to pass the measure now proposed, a great principle will be established: All wealth proceeds from the intensity of labor. It will be easy for us to extend and vary the applications of this principle. We may decree, for example, that it shall no longer be permissible to work but with the foot; for this is no more impossible (as we have seen) than to extract iron from the mud of the Seine. You see then, Sire, that the means of increasing national labor can never fail. And after all has been tried, we have still the practically exhaustless resource of amputation.", "external_links": ["http://www.sabhlokcity.com/2015/09/not-all-french-economist-are-like-piketty-they-have-some-super-smart-ones-like-bastiat-as-well/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:37:51.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
