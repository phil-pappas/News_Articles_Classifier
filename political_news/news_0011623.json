Picture: TREVOR SAMSON Related articles EDITORIAL: ANC unwise to undermine ICC ANC resolves to lead continent in mass pullout from the ICC SA plans to leave International Criminal Court, says Bapela ANC failure to deal with graft opens it to capture by others EDITORIAL: ANC’s missed opportunity In this article Companies and organisations: United Nations | International Criminal Court People: Thuli Madonsela LONDON — SA should fight to reform the International Criminal Court rather than walk away from it, Public Protector Thuli Madonsela has said.\nDelivering the 10th Oppenheimer lecture at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London on Wednesday night, Madonsela said it was \"high time\" that bodies like the United Nations and the ICC were reformed, but said \"we should beg my country, and others, not to\" leave the court at the Hague. This follows the ANC’s recent decision to opt out of the ICC.\nThe world had \"become a very dangerous place for many ordinary people\". At the same time \"international humanitarian law… seems to be unable to step in and help as ordinary civilians, particularly women and children, have become collateral damage from all sides of the wars they are caught in\", Ms Madonsela said.\n\"The 200 girls captured in Nigeria are still missing. As all of this happens the centre is not holding fast, as far as global governance is concerned. The ICC, established as a bulwark against impunity for genocide and related heinous crimes not addressed by domestic courts, is facing a legitimacy crisis. The ICC is accused of targeting alleged criminal acts of African leaders in the face of unilateralism and civil massacres by Western states, principally in Africa and Muslim countries. A related grievance is that some members of UN are allowed to have a say in ICC affairs and operations while they themselves are not accountable to it,\" she said.\n\" Linked to this grievance is the perpetuation of colonial inequalities in global governance through exclusive membership of the UN security council and the use of veto powers which allegedly paralyse accountability efforts concerning some of the member states,\" Madonsela added.\nShe slammed the unilateral military action of \"powerful states\" that \"more and more… are taking the law into their own hands with regard to military strikes abroad, claiming to do so in support of friends or repelling their enemies or security threats\". This resulted in emboldening others to act unilaterally and undermined the legitimacy of global governance structures like the ICC and the UN. What the US and UK did elsewhere, Russia would do in Ukraine, for example. This lack of accountability created the perception of an unjust system of global governance.\nThe grievances against the ICC were \"legitimate and they need to be addressed\", she noted: \"I’ve not heard a single person saying that the ICC has convicted anyone wrongly. The complaint is that there is selective targeting. When I went to The Hague last year they had their own explanation. But I think that may be fair criticism; that the system allows that kind of targeting.\n\"But can ordinary people in Africa… afford a vacuum? Where there’s absolutely nothing?\" she asked.\nShould SA lead African nations in opting out of the ICC, countries in Asia and elsewhere would follow, Madonsela warned.\nShe called for the establishment of an African court to fill the vacuum that would be left if African countries opted out of the ICC. But such a court had to be \"truly independent\" and should \"not suffer the same fate as the SADC tribunal,\" Ms Madonsela said.\n© BDlive 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:42:26.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
