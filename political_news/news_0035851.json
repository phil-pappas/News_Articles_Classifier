Eighteen months after House Republicans first convened the Select Committee on Benghazi, Gowdy will finally face off with the former Secretary of State-turned-2016 White House contender.\nFor Clinton, a botched performance could be easy fodder for GOP campaign ads – if not move national polls. But Gowdy also has to tread carefully – his panel’s reputation is on the line after weeks of Democratic accusations that the committee is a partisan charade aimed at hurting Clinton.\nRepublicans, led by Gowdy, a former South Carolina federal prosecutor in South Carolina, are expected to grill Clinton on everything from the security situation at the Benghazi diplomatic compound to her controversial private email server.\nPanel Democrats, meanwhile, will try to discredit any accusations lobbed against her while a 30-person-strong, pro-Clinton war room at Correct the Record will monitor the hearing and fire off real-time press releases defending their presidential candidate.\nAnd Clinton has some ground to make up with voters when it comes to the Benghazi attack. A new NBC/WSJ poll out Tuesday shows Americans, by a 2-to-1 margin are unhappy with Clinton’s response to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans — including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens — dead.\nAnd Clinton is sure to face questions about her unusual email setup at State, where she eschewed a government account and used her own, personal email account and server. That server was discovered following document requests from the Benghazi panel – and the FBI is currently investigating whether the setup led to the mishandling of classified information.\nBut Gowdy, who has conducted all of his panel’s interviews in private, is now under pressure to show he’s uncovered something new that the previous half-dozen congressional investigations into the attacks have not.\nThe pressure on Gowdy spiked in late September when Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) bragged on Fox News that the committee has hurt Clinton in the polls. A week later, a former GOP investigator who had been fired from the committee in June claimed that the panel had set its sights on Clinton after news of her private server broke in March.\nDemocrats seized on those statements and unloaded on panel Republicans for conducting a partisan operation.\nSo Gowdy and Republicans have spent the past couple weeks downplaying Clinton’s role in their investigation, calling her “just another witness” and vowing that they’re trying to get to the bottom of what happened in Libya — regardless of Clinton’s presidential aspirations. Gowdy told POLITICO in an interview over the weekend that the attacks on his credibility have made the past week one of the worst in his life — surpassing even death threats he received as a federal prosecutor.\nAlthough Gowdy and some of his colleagues like Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) have reputations for being tough on witnesses, they’ve promised to keep a professional demeanor and avoid attack-dog tactics. But they’re also expected to press Clinton with tough questions about her general hopes and dreams for Libya after the fall of Muammar Qadhafi.\nClinton sources have said she will give a full-throated defense of why she believes it was necessary to send diplomats into high-risk areas such as Libya, a decision she does not regret.\nRepublicans may also try to pin her down on why she was not aware of numerous requests for additional security by her diplomats in Libya. A 1999 report after the East African embassy bombings recommended that the secretary of State take a “personal and active role” in security issues, Republicans — including Gowdy — have noted.\nAnd they’re expected to draw upon a series of new Stevens emails showing the ambassador asking for more protection — while Clinton’s top aides in Washington were allegedly asking him for guidance on public relations efforts.\nAn internal State Department investigation, known as the Accountability Review Board, found that security at the Benghazi mission was sorely lacking. The ARB, however, did not find anyone had breached his or her duty, and blamed bad communication and a lack of funding that led State to try to cut corners.\nRepublicans will also inquire about a number of Libya-related Clinton emails they say they’ve asked for but that Clinton never provided to State. They only discovered them because longtime Clinton ally Sid Blumenthal, who had been sending her advice on Libya and unsubstantiated intelligence form Libya sources, turned them over to the panel under subpoena.\nBlumenthal, who had business interests in Libya and often encouraged Clinton to go bold in Libya, will also come up in the hearing. The committee recently released excerpts from new Clinton emails suggesting Blumenthal at one point in the summer of 2011 told her about his business links there, after encouraging her to use her position to ensure that the fragile new Libyan government would work with American companies as opposed to the French, for example.\nClinton has said Blumenthal’s advice was “unsolicited” — an assertion Republicans are expected to challenge.\nThe broader issue of her private email account is also likely to surface, and Republicans are expected to ask her whether she has turned over all her work emails, as is required by law.\nClinton, a skilled witness, is expected to maintain a professional manner during the hearing. She successfully navigated a politically charged congressional hearing on Benghazi in January 2013 –while recovering from a concussion and a blood clot.\nShould Republicans get overheated, cut Clinton off, or try to corner her with loaded questions, Democrats said they will be ready to use their time to let her speak and set the record straight. In that regard they’ll be her first line of defense when the cameras are rolling.\nThe proceedings get under way at 10 a.m. And staff have said the hearing could easily last until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/nbc-wsj-poll-more-americans-unsatisfied-clintons-response-benghazi-attack-n448041%20"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:40:19.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
