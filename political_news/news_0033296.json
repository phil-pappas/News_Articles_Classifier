He says that in his last years of service as an MP, his reputation was trashed.\n\"At no stage during the lunch when he spoke about ways in which he might be able to assist the journalists, did Tim Yeo understand that what he was being asked to do was act as a paid advocate in breach of the rules.\"\nMr Yeo was cleared of breaking House of Commons rules by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards in 2013.\nThe libel trial is due to last for seven days.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A4F4/production/_86082224_tim_yeo_getty.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25035191"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:05:00.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
