The real goal of gun control supporters is gun confiscation,\" an NRA official said Washington (CNN) The nation's largest gun organization unleashed a broadside against Hillary Clinton on Friday, charging that she supports confiscating Americans' guns.\nClinton, who has recently called out the National Rifle Association for its opposition to gun-control laws in the wake of the deadly college shooting in Oregon, said at a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire, that she was open to gun buyback programs, but did not endorse them.\n\"I think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that could be arranged,\" she said in response to a question about Australia's nationwide buyback initiative that began in 1996.\nThat was enough to agitate the NRA, a powerful force in Washington that has successively suffocated recent attempts to limit gun ownership or manufacturing.\nRELATED: Clinton pledges to close the gun show loophole\nRead More \"This validates what the NRA has said all along.
