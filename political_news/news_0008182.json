The press conference will be held Thursday, October 15th, at 11:00 AM ET in the Lisagor Room at the National Press Club in Washington, DC .\nWe encourage all members of the press to attend the briefing in-person. Those who cannot are invited to participate by calling 800-668-9550.\nWHO: Eric Descheenie, Co-chair of the Inter-Tribal Coalition and Special Advisor to President and Vice President of the Navajo Nation\nAlfred Lomahquahu , Co-chair of the Inter-Tribal Coalition and Vice Chairman of the Hopi Tribe\nPhillip Vicenti, Head Councilman of Pueblo of Zuni Tribal Council\nRegina Lopez-Whiteskunk , Tribal Council Member at Ute Mountain Ute Tribe\nWillie Grayeyes, Chairmen of Utah Diné Bikéyah\nMalcolm Lehi , Tribal Council Member at Ute Mountain Ute Tribe\nRepresentative from the Ute Tribe of the Uinta and Ouray Reservation\nWHAT: Press Conference on the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition national monument proposal\nWHEN: Thursday, October 15th , at 11:00am Eastern/ 9:00am Mountain\nWHERE: The National Press Club in Washington, DC , in the Lisagor Room. The proposal and map will be posted online the morning of the event at http://BearsEarsCoalition.org .\nWHY: The Bears Ears region in Southeastern Utah is home to more than 100,000 Native American cultural sites. Yet despite rampant and ongoing destruction of our gravesites, cultural objects and structures, these sacred ancestral lands remain unprotected.\nProtection of these sacred sites is critically important to our people. This is why a historic consortium of sovereign Tribal nations have united in the effort to conserve the Bears Ears cultural landscape. Our five nations – Hopi, Navajo, Ute Mountain Ute , Zuni, and Ute Tribe of the Uinta and Ouray Reservation– are committed to working together with the support of 19 additional Tribes who have expressed support for protecting the Bear Ears region.\nThis proposal is unique and wholly unprecedented. Never before has a coalition of sovereign Tribal Nations petitioned the United States government to use any and all tools available to it to designate a Bears Ears National Monument.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/media-advisory-press-conference-on-1015-to-announce-unprecedented-native-american-proposal-to-protect-sacred-lands-300159602.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.press.org/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC28046&Transmission_Id=201510141110PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC28046&DateId=20151014", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://bearsearscoalition.org/", "http://www.bearsearscoalition.org/about-the-coalition/tribal-statements-of-support/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/media-advisory-press-conference-on-1015-to-announce-unprecedented-native-american-proposal-to-protect-sacred-lands-300159602.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:54:02.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
