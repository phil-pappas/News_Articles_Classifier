He set the high mark for Republicans this campaign when he drew about 30,000 to an Alabama rally in August.\nPolitical observers say Trump may not seem like a natural fit for Southerners. But the South has long been the nation's most conservative region and most distrustful of central government. That makes Trump's anti-Washington pitch easy to sell.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:06:46.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
