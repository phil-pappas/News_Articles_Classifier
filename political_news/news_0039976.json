Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., complained the cards were \"stacked\" because the powerful military was guaranteed 25 percent of the parliamentary seats. He said the vote would not demonstrate the true intention of the Myanmar people.\nRep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said the Southeast Asian nation's shift from authoritarian rule was \"a systematically manipulated democratic transition.\"\n\"If the odds are intentionally in the ruling party's favor, but they have a clean election, how should the U.S. respond?\" he asked a House foreign affairs panel that oversees Asia policy. He advocated restraint in expanding U.S.-Myanmar ties.\nAsked how the State Department will assess the credibility of the election, top diplomat for East Asia, Daniel Russel, said the U.S. \"will call it as we see it,\" including what it hears from political parties, election observers and Myanmar people and media.\nHe acknowledged there is \"nothing fair\" about the military's quota in parliament and the exclusion of 750,000 minority Rohingya Muslims from voter lists.\nBut he said that despite the defects, more than 90 parties, including that of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, was contesting what would be a competitive vote, although Suu Kyi is still excluded by a junta-era constitution from running for president.\nRussel said the U.S. would not turn a blind eye to shortcomings in the election process, and future U.S. assistance and relaxation of remaining sanctions would depend on the integrity of that process and transparency in formation of a new government.\nMyanmar, also known as Burma, has been viewed as a success for the Obama administration policy of engaging adversaries. But as the quasi-civilian government has stalled on reforms and discriminated against Muslims, Washington has voiced criticism.\nRussel warned that the politicization of religion in the Buddhist majority nation and the spread of hate speech could lead to violence, including on election day.\nRepublican Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called Myanmar's treatment of stateless Rohingyas \"abhorrent.\"\nRoyce, R-Calif., said that 140,000 have been displaced by violence and hundreds have been killed, and their plight has prompted an exodus to other Southeast Asian countries.\n\"This tragedy is what happens when a government refuses to recognize its own people,\" Royce said.\nHe called for the Treasury to blacklist human rights violators in the country. He said only one name has been added since the sectarian violence broke out three years ago.\nRussel said the State Department, working with other U.S. government agencies, is \"actively on the hunt\" for legally viable cases.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:23:52.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
