Credit: Adam Peck / PA Images Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, who has previously worked with cannabis law reform campaigners, will lead the debate.\nBut campaigners are not hopeful the petition will have any great impact, as a swift Government response online was quick to insist there would be no change to the law.\nSubstantial scientific evidence shows cannabis is a harmful drug that can damage human health. There are no plans to legalise cannabis as it would not address the harm to individuals and communities.\n– UK Government Last updated Mon 12 Oct 2015 Politics Wales Aberystwyth", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:30:26.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
