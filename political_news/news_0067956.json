Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who is the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n\"I'm endorsing Bernie because he is talking about the issues that are important to American families,\" Ellison told MSNBC Monday. \"His candidacy is important for many reasons, but I believe the most important part of his candidacy is that it has the ability to create a renaissance in voter participation, which was at its lowest in decades this past election cycle.\"\n\"We've all seen the massive crowds he is attracting, and I think that is a testament to his message connecting with people, people we will need to turn out in November,\" Ellison added.\n  Ellison is only the second congressional Democrat to back the Vermont socialist. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., the other co-chairman for the Progressive Caucus, offered up his support last week .\n\"Keith Ellison is one of the great progressive leaders in the country leading the fight for the rights of working families and the environment,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"I look forward to working with him to create a government which represents all Americans and not just the billionaires.\"\nThe endorsement also one-ups former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, literally, as Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., is the only congressional Democrat to back his campaign.\nHowever, Sanders' haul of congressional endorsements trails significantly behind former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has snagged 114 endorsements from House Democrats and an additional 30 from Senate Democrats.\nSanders has yet to receive formal backing from any Senate Democrat.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner GOP hopefuls show bona fides with scandal-scarred sheriff Despite a personal scandal that derailed a past congressional bid, Paul Babeu is still a political force.\nBy David M.
