They are full of courage and cowardice, grit and determination, victory and defeat. The fog of war ensures that truth is the first casualty and reminisces are invariably inaccurate. So when Rachna Bisht Rawat, (an army brat and an army wife) admits that she was pressed for time to write 1965: Stories from the Second Indo-Pak War , she is speaking the truth.\nThe book has all the tell-tale signs of a work created under pressure: the editing is poor, the grammar faulty and there is the occasional spelling and typing error. A veteran journalist, probably used to telling short, sharp stories in print, Rawat isn't comfortable in the longer narrative form of story telling. So what you have is a hastily put together book, full of the obvious tales of courage, and none of the truths that one could expect from such a book.\nRawat is candid when she admits that \"there are many versions of history\". She also records how some tales \"stung my eyes and made writing the book much more than a literary exercise\". A historical book is rarely a literary exercise, and her emotional attachment to the subject makes it even more difficult to accept the book as an authentic record.\nBut, more than the tales of courage and sacrifice that Rawat has tried to record so gallantly, it is the little anecdotes which left the deepest impressions. Sample this: Major Ranjit Singh Dyal (later lieutenant general), probably one of the bravest men in the history of the Indian Army, is already famous as the hero of the legendary battle for Haji Pir pass. What is not known is how this almost-confirmed bachelor, at the \"old age of 41\" as a brigadier, fell head over heels in love with a 27-year-old young woman who had come visiting. So stumped was Dyal that he immediately declared his intentions to her family and married her. Their tales of dancing into the night are probably the warmest you will read in a book on war, or otherwise.\nThere are the other favourites â€” Company Quarter Master Havaldar Abdul Hamid is a legend immortalised in independent India's chequered history. As a young 30-year-old NCO, he took out nearly seven Pakistani Patton tanks at the battle of Assal Uttar. For over 40 years, his widow has lived a lonely life, still remembering the omens she saw before he packed and went off to war.\nFinally, there is the lovely story of Brigadier Desmond Eugene Hayde, a strapping Anglo-Indian commanding officer of 3 Jat, which won the famous battle of Dograi, not once, but twice. Hayde led his battalion to glory with his indomitable spirit and obvious love for the brave Jats. The conversations he has with his Jat troops on the eve of battle is the stuff that passes into legend, to be recounted in messes on cold, wintry nights. That is where the book really scores. It captures these little nuggets of war, camaraderie and esprit-de-corps that can only be understood by men and women who have seen the ravages of war.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:14:58.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
