She had been shot in the head.\nYoga instructor Steve Carter, 67, was discovered dead on Monday near a popular hiking trail in Marin County across the Golden Gate Bridge. He had been shot multiple times while walking his dog.\nAuthorities identified the suspects as Morrison Haze Lampley, 23; Sean Michael Angold, 24; and Lila Scott Alligood, 18. They were being held without bail in Oregon, and it was unclear if any of them are represented by a lawyer.\nThey were arrested Wednesday at a soup kitchen in Portland, Oregon. San Francisco police say the stolen gun was recovered during the arrest, and they believe it's the weapon used to fatally shoot Carey and Carter.\nSan Francisco police also said the suspects were in possession of Carter's car and some of Carey's camping gear was found inside it.\nValerie Chapman, administrator of St. Francis Church in Portland, said she had to admonish the three for smoking in a no-smoking area just outside the dining hall. Some of the regular diners told her the three suspects were asking if anyone wanted to buy a Volkswagen Jetta station wagon, Chapman said.\n\"We serve low-income and homeless people, many of them with mental illness,\" Chapman said. \"It's not the smartest place to sell a car.\"\nThe suspects waived extradition proceedings in Portland and will be returned to the San Francisco Bay Area to face charges in the shooting deaths, Marin County sheriff's Lt. Doug Pittman said. He declined to say how they will be transported but said they will not return this weekend.\n\"They can't go anywhere until we come get them,\" he said.\nHe has described the suspects as drifters and said none of them has a known address.\nRecords show Portland police arrested Lampley on suspicion of possessing a weapon in a park in 2010 and graffiti-related crimes in 2012. He was sentenced to time served in the weapons case and never showed up in court for the graffiti charge, the records state.\nIn 2012, he pleaded no contest to carrying a concealed 5-inch knife in Mountain View, California, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\nIn May, he was charged in San Diego County with the unlawful selling or receiving of a stolen vehicle, a felony, and with stealing a dog, a misdemeanor, the newspaper said. He pleaded guilty to the felony charge and was sentenced to time that he had already served.\nSan Francisco detectives spotted similarities in the shooting deaths of Carey and Carter, including the locations in wooded areas. The agency collaborated with Marin County, which traced the three suspects to Portland using the navigation system in Carter's car.\nInvestigators are trying to piece together how the trio and the homicide victims met up. They're also trying to determine how long the suspects had been in San Francisco and how they got to Marin County.\nCarey had left her native Quebec and was on a solo backpacking trip when she was killed after the first day of a music festival in Golden Gate Park. Her body was found near the site where the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival is held each year on six stages spread throughout the park.\nTens of thousands of fans stream into the park each year to watch the free music performed by dozens of bands over three days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:20:16.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
