The actor has suggested some changes in the second half to director Milan Luthria, which the latter has agreed to.\nA source close to the project told us, “Those changes are being made now and that’s why the film has been postponed. We were ready to start shooting but the film will now go on floors only after April 2016.” Shruti Haasan, who was roped in for it, has walked out as the film was delayed.\nA new actress will be roped in after the required changes are made to the script. The film was to clash with Hrithik Roshan-starrer Mohenjodaro earlier but now that the release date of Badshaho has changed, the clash has been averted. It will now hit the theatres on Good Friday next year. Milan Luthria remained unavailable for comment.\n Ajay Devgn Badshaho Bollywood entertainment Also Read Before and after effects of 'Baahubali', most expensive film made in India A Rajini film title for Simha Schoolgirl Sreeja finally met Pawan Kalyan after recovery An expensive tune for Humshakals", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/entertainment-bollywood/article/badshaho-script-being-reworked", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Ajay%20Devgn%2009%20oct%20copy.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Ajay%20Devgn%2009%20oct%20copy.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:47:37.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
