Especially when considering two strikes against the Democratic debate -- no Donald Trump, and competition from a Major League Baseball playoff pitting teams from the largest television markets in the nation, New York City and Los Angeles. That series also featured the controversy surrounding Chase Utley's now infamous base slide, which broke Ruben Tejada's leg.\nI'm not complimenting policy. My focus is all about the candidates' presentation. The respective transcripts are the tale of the tape. At the GOP debate, when Jake Tapper appropriately asked the candidates to explain the differences between themselves, things quickly disintegrated into a food fight.\nCarly Fiorina fielded the first question and demurred when asked whether she'd be comfortable with Trump's finger on the nuclear codes. \"That's not for me to answer; it is for the voters of this country to answer, and I have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the United States of America,\" said the former CEO of Hewlett Packard.\nWhen Trump was invited to respond, he chose to land his first salvo -- at Rand Paul:\n\"Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage. He's number 11, he's got 1 percent in the polls, and how he got up here, there's far too many people anyway.\"\nThe volley having been served to Paul, the senator from Kentucky observed: \"I think really there's a sophomoric quality that is entertaining about Mr. Trump, but I am worried. I'm very concerned about him -- having him in charge of the nuclear weapons, because I think his response, his -- his visceral response to attack people on their appearance -- short, tall, fat, ugly -- my goodness, that happened in junior high. Are we not way above that? Would we not all be worried to have someone like that in charge of the nuclear arsenal?\"\nThe tone was thus set for the next three hours. It was hard to take your eyes off it for the same reason we rubberneck on the expressway -- to get a glimpse of political road kill. And given the success of some outsized personalities who hold sway over our political process, it would be easy to conclude that is what it takes to get attention. But the Democratic debate just proved that wrong. And not because the candidates were cut any slack.\nAnderson Cooper posed the first question to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. After enumerating a number of her policy shifts (same-sex marriage, immigration, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal) he asked: \"Will you say anything to get elected?\"\nTo Bernie Sanders, Cooper suggested he was a Republican attack ad in the making: \"You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And, just this weekend, you said you're not a capitalist. Doesn't -- doesn't that ad write itself?\"\nLike the recent GOP debate, the action in Vegas was a night of tough questioning for candidates who aspire to the highest office in the land, but unlike Simi Valley, Calif., it did not elicit name-calling or cheap shots -- and still people watched. When they criticized one another, they did it without condescension. Consider that after Sanders touted his D-minus standing with the National Rifle Association, Clinton was asked whether Sanders is tough enough on guns? \"No, not at all,\" she began, before noting that he voted five times against the Brady Bill.\nThe two also displayed differences -- and some one- liners -- when the subject was banking.\nClinton: \"You know, I -- I respect the passion and intensity. I represented Wall Street, as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 -- before the big crash that we had -- and I basically said, \"Cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.\"\nSanders: \"In my view, Secretary Clinton, you do not -- Congress does not regulate Wall Street. Wall Street regulates Congress.\"\nA few days before the debate, I jokingly asked Sean Spicer, the chief strategist of the Republican National Committee, whether he was willing to lend Trump to the Democrats for just one night to spur interest?\n\"I have a feeling that this is going to be a snooze-fest for the people who do tune in because there's really not much out there. At some point, (having) Lincoln Chafee debating whether or not we go to the metric system isn't exactly what the American people are trying to figure out, the big issues that they're feeling right now.\"\nI feared he was right, but it turns out we both underestimated the American people.\nAbout The Writer\nMichael Smerconish writes for The Philadelphia Inquirer, and is host of \"Smerconish\" on CNN.
