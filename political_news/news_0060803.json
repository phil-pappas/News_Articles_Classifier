America is an idea' Published: 1 hour ago \n(BREITBART) Breitbart News has unearthed another overlooked 2013 video that documents Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Congressman Rep. Luis Gutierrez’s aggressive stumping for Sen. Marco Rubio’s amnesty and immigration-expansion plan. \nIn a speech at the Erie House in Chicago, Ryan and Gutierrez provided more details about how they aimed to institute a formal open borders policy for the United States—that is, a federal policy of allowing any employer to legally hire any worker regardless of where they live. \nThis vision for the free movement of people across international boundaries is similar to immigration policy the European Union has among solely European countries– over the objections of rising insurgent populist parties. In his speech, Ryan lays out how the same legal structure could be adopted for the United States and all the foreign countries of the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:04:38.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
