The ceiling is strung with tinsel and an enormous fern tree is holding court at the center of a party. Tables are stacked with pyramids of Champagne and in lieu of music, the stereo system plays monkey noises and gentle cricket sounds. A group of zoo workers gather by a table topped with pigs in a blanket and crudités.]\nZoo Worker #1: Some party, eh?\nZoo Worker #2: I love the cricket soundtrack. Is that a male Gryllus cricket that I hear?\nZoo Worker #3: Wow, Sandy. You really are an entomological expert. What a pleasure!\n[The three zoo employees munch awkwardly on carrots and garlicky dip in the silence that follows. To their relief, they are saved by a loud clatter coming from the main entrance of the hall.]\nZoo Worker #1: What's all that racket?\n[They turn to face a scene, which is quickly unraveling in front of at least a hundred partygoers. A woman, identifiable as Caroline Westlake, is shrieking.]\nWestlake: Did you shag my boyfriend, you grungy monkey handler?\nKate Sanders: That's none of your business, you lowly meerkat expert!\n[Enter Adam Davies, stage right.]\nDavies: [Attempting to laugh off the commotion] Ladies, ladies. Can't we talk about this genially in the monkey sanctuary? Not in front of all these homo sapiens?\n[Both women look at him, growling. Westlake reaches for a wine glass, ready to break it over Davies's head, when a butterfly flutters in front of her eyes. The glass goes off course as it leaves Westlake's hand and instead smashes right into Sanders's face. Chaos ensues.]\nZoo Worker #3: [In a comedic, fourth-wall-breaking tone] It seems like we've got the animals running the zoo these days!\nSCENE.", "external_links": ["http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_BRITAIN_ZOO_LOVE_TRIANGLE?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT"], "published": "2015-10-15T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:17:42.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
