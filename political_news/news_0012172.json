Another 72 per cent of respondents say they will be headed to the polls on election day .\n\"It is fitting that the election takes place on the first day of small business week,\" said CFIB president Dan Kelly . \"The spotlight that all federal parties have placed on the small business community and their issues speaks to the important place they hold in Canada's communities and economy.\"\nA third of small business owners are calling it the most important election ever to their business.\nSmall business issues have taken centre-stage during the campaign. All parties have committed to reducing the small business tax rate from 11 to 9 per cent (see CFIB's leaders' surveys ) , as well as to making investments in entrepreneurship and training.\nThe campaign seems to have had an effect on entrepreneurs, with 42 per cent reporting that it has influenced their vote. Only seven per cent remain undecided.\n\"Business owners have been telling us that this election will make a big difference to their enterprises and their communities. On Election Day , they will make a big difference by casting a ballot,\" added Kelly.\nCFIB is Canada's largest association of small- and medium-sized businesses with 109,000 members across every sector and region.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cfib.ca/a7529e", "http://cfib.ca/a7531e", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C4073&Transmission_Id=201510170600CANADANWWEB______C4073&DateId=20151017"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:29:38.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
