While there is no formal cap on the amount of sick leave he can claim, it is subject to approval by Justice Ross on a case by case basis.\nJustice Ross, who declined to comment on Tuesday, is expected to tell the hearing that he was unaware - with one exception - that Mr Lawler was engaged in work assisting Ms Jackson while he was on sick leave. The one exception related to Mr Lawler providing assistance to Ms Jackson at a court appearance.\nUniversity of Adelaide law professor Andrew Stewart said on Tuesday that while there might have been no cap on Mr Lawler's sick leave, \"there is the separate question: was he entitled to take that sick leave if the purpose was to defend Kathy Jackson?\"\nState laws govern the recording of private conversations and those laws differ state by state. Commonwealth law covers telecommunication interception and access; that is up until the time the conversation becomes audible.\n Piper Alderman Intellectual Property & Technology partner James Lawrence said if the phone call was recorded in NSW, Mr Lawler had the ability to record the conversation and on the basis that it was reasonably necessary to protect his own lawful interests.Whether Mr Lawler's conduct satisfies \"reasonable necessity\" is unclear.\nHe said under NSW law if a person has recorded a private conversation in contravention of the act, they are prohibited from communicating or publishing the recording.\nMr Lawrence said he supported the principal recommendation of Australian Law Reform Commission, which last year, recommended that each state adopt uniform surveillance laws.\nLawyers said there have been about 10 cases in the last decade in Australia that have sought to rely on the clause to record to protect own lawful interest. Lawyers said the defence had been used in child sexual abuse cases where victims had covertly parents accused on the abuse.\nKing Wood Mallesons partner Cheng Lim said on Tuesday it was not an unusual defence to rely on, but was often used in criminal cases.\nHe said a court would have to decide on whether or not it was reasonably necessary that Mr Lawler record his conversations with Mr Ross.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:07:52.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
