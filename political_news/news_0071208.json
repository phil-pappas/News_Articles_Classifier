Together, the two leading parties of the right were set to hold 99 seats — just one short of half control of the 200-seat assembly.\nThe result marks a shift from the success of moderate parties in the last election four years ago: The biggest parties of the left and center all lost ground, in particular two Green parties, or held even. The outcome giving the People's Party nearly 30 percent surpassed poll predictions, while the Social Democrats — the country's second-largest party — unexpectedly lost support.\nFinal results for the National Council were expected by Monday. The makeup of the upper house, the 46-member Council of States, will be known in three weeks.\nIn Switzerland's arcane electoral calculus, the outcome sets the stage for back-channel negotiations for the real prize: Seats in the seven-person Federal Council, the executive branch, which makes decisions behind closed doors and by consensus, and includes the president — a rotating post. The incoming assembly will choose that body's makeup on Dec. 9, and the People's Party wants a second seat.\nUnder the niceties of the Swiss political system, the People's Party — already the country's most popular political movement — holds one seat, while the Free Democrats and Social Democrats each have two. The People's Party is particularly after the seat now held by Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, who is from a far smaller, more moderated party that broke off from the nationalist party years ago.\n\"It's important to listen to the Swiss people,\" People's Party leader Toni Brunner said. \"The population has to be able to express itself.\"\nBefore Sunday's balloting, the gfs.bern polling agency found that nearly half of Swiss listed immigration, integration and foreigners as their top concern. Issues like relations with the European Union, health care, unemployment and the environment scored only single digits as the top issue.\nThose concerns about immigration are the sweet-spot issue of the Swiss People's Party, which wants to strengthen rules about who can enter and live — including from EU member states that virtually surround the Alpine country of about 8.2 million people and are by far the most important trading partner of Switzerland.\nSunday's election had shaping up as a new sign of European anxiety more than 500,000 migrants and refugees from Syria, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere that have poured into Europe this year. Switzerland, which is not an EU member, has taken in far fewer than some member states like Germany and Austria — but the influx has still raised concerns about the Swiss that it may become a destination.\nAnother of the major issues ahead will be how Swiss leaders implement the results of a referendum February last year in which voters narrowly passed the People's Party's plan to cap immigration for all types of foreigners — including those from the EU — within three years. The result forced the government to take up a delicate task of revising its treaties with the 28-nation bloc.\nIn a patchwork Alpine country with four national languages, Switzerland's 26 regions predominate in daily lives more than the federal administration. The rules for voting were far from uniform: Two cantons elect their representatives by the proportional share of the overall vote gained, one allowed foreign residents to cast ballots, another set the minimum voting age at 16 — unlike 18 years old elsewhere.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:21:53.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
