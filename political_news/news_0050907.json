She was not in Calgary at the Tory headquarters on election night. \nLiepert, who was elected in Calgary Signal Hill, also elaborated on his feelings about Byrne with the Calgary Herald's Don Braid: \n“It started well before the campaign when Jenni Byrne kind of blows into town and she and I get into a 15-minute shouting match, because she was crawling all over us candidates about things in Calgary, about how concerned she was, because things apparently weren’t good in Calgary. \n\"It just went from there. It was the most inappropriate conversation I’ve ever had with somebody who’s running a campaign, and I’ve had a lot of conversations with people who run campaigns, for 35 years.” \nLiepert is not the only one blaming Byrne for the problems. \nA \"high-placed Conservative source\" told The Canadian Press that much of the campaign was \"an epic failure\" because of Byrne. \n\"While it's ultimately the prime minister's fault because he allowed Jenni to have that role, it is inexcusable that she had four years to prepare for this campaign and was simply wholly unprepared,\" said the source, speaking to Ditchburn on condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal party matters. \nJenni Byrne was a campaign chair for the Conservatives during the 2015 federal election.
