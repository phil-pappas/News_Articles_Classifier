John Hickenlooper is facing sharp criticism for his approach to addressing climate change, particularly from environmental advocates who blast his administration's new plan as \"a hollow gesture\" and \"delusional.\"\nThe Democrat's climate plan seeks to identify strategies to lower the greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming and prepare the state for the effects of climate change, but critics argue the 93-page document downplays the urgency of the issue and lacks concrete objectives.\nFor Hickenlooper, the plan highlights a deep rift with a key constituency in his party and highlights a spotted record on a crucial political issue, just as the battle on environmental regulations hits a peak moment .\n\"Just generating a report with a whole lot of words is just a complete failure for our state,\" said Leslie Glustrom of Clean Energy Action, an environmental group that promotes renewable energy.\nKevin Cross, a Fort Collins environmental activist, said the climate report \"is good evidence\" that the governor is too cozy with the oil and gas industry.\nAdvertisement The energy sector's response is more tame, but it is not offering praise either. The industry's advocates question the science in the report and argue that it minimizes the importance of the state's natural gas industry to address climate change.\nThe opposing reactions put Hickenlooper — a former geologist who studied volcanic rock in Yellowstone National Park and later worked in the oil industry — on a political island.\nIn a recent interview, he defended his approach and noted the need to balance clean air with the cost of the remedy.\n\"I believe the climate is changing, and I believe human activities are a significant part — not the whole thing ... but a significant part,\" he said. \"We should be looking at how do we limit our carbon emissions. And we should prioritize (solutions) with the least possible cost.\"\nColorado once stood in the national spotlight for its approach to climate change after voters approved a renewable-energy mandate in 2004. In 2008, then-Gov. Bill Ritter sounded the alarm on global warming with a Climate Action Plan that set a goal to cut emissions of greenhouse gases 20 percent by 2020. The Democrat-led General Assembly created a new position for a climate change czar in 2013.\nRep. Mike Foote, a Lafayette Democrat, co-sponsored the bill that forced the administration to issue the climate plan, which it did with little fanfare in late September. Foote said the report is not aggressive enough.\n\"I think it does a good job of identifying the problem. I don't think it does as good of a job in identifying ways to prevent the problem,\" he said. \"I would like to see Colorado be a leader in the area of carbon reduction and renewable-energy promotion like we were 10 years ago. And it seems like we've slipped.\"\nMixed political record\nDespite the conflict, Hickenlooper readily highlights his environmental record.\nAt a recent Conservation Colorado gala, he touted that Colorado ranks No. 2 among states in terms of LEED-certified buildings, sits in the top tier for renewable-energy standards and operates a program offering $470 million of energy performance grants.\nHis administration is developing a new residential energy tax credit program, policies to boost solar energy production and a statewide water plan that emphasizes conservation.\nStill, environmental critics easily list areas where they believe Hickenlooper's administration caved to energy industry pressure, such as the lawsuit against local fracking bans and weak setback rules that govern the distance between residential areas and oil and gas operations.\nFracking opponents also remain critical of the deal Hickenlooper brokered to vacate two 2014 ballot measures designed to put further restrictions on oil and gas drilling.\nWhen it comes to the issue of climate change, Hickenlooper is particularly vexed.\nDating back to his first bid for governor in 2010, he struggled to voice a consistent stance on the issue. At different points in recent years, Hickenlooper said he didn't believe \"climate change is happening for sure\" and suggested the scientific community remained unclear about whether \"climate change is as catastrophic as so many people think.\"\nThroughout his five years in office, Hickenlooper has emphasized a compromise approach as he worked with the energy industry and conservationists. But his dual courtship has made for awkward moments at times.\nIn June, Hickenlooper told environmental advocates at the conservation gala that the state would create a plan to reduce power plant emissions that \"hopefully everyone in this room will be proud of\" and won applause for pushing back against U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's efforts to undercut new EPA regulations.\nTwo months later, Hickenlooper spoke at a Colorado Oil and Gas Association reception in which he said it was \"fun to punch the EPA,\" as he did with the toxic wastewater spill into the Animas River, and noted that his administration developed rules to reduce methane emissions with \"as little regulation as possible.\"\nIt's a record that makes advocates on both sides skeptical and often puts Hickenlooper on the defensive.\n\"I am an environmentalist. I went to the very first Earth Day that there ever was,\" Hickenlooper said, reacting to the criticism from the environmental community.\n\"But that doesn't mean that I share every facet and every point of argument that the movement argues,\" he qualified, adding that \"somebody has got to be in the middle.\"\nNot a prescriptive plan\nTaryn Finnessey, Colorado's climate change manager, acknowledged that the report doesn't set bold new goals or outline an action plan aimed at the state's polluters and energy consumers.\n\"It's not a prescriptive plan — it is not telling private industry what they should be doing,\" she said.\nInstead, Finnessey argued, the plan takes a holistic look at how state government can address the issue and builds on current approaches to reduce emissions, such as new federal requirements in the clean power plan .\n\"It's really easy to point fingers and say we are not doing enough. But the reality is we are doing a lot more now than we were 10 years ago,\" she said. \"We actually are making progress — maybe not enough progress as people would like — but we are making progress.\"\nSo far, it's hard to tell whether Colorado will meet the goals set in the 2008 Ritter climate action plan. A chart in the latest report shows greenhouse gas levels rising continuously through 2030, but Finnessey said the numbers don't take into account current policies designed to curb emissions, such as the renewable-energy requirements and methane rules.\n\"We expect that future inventories would see substantial reductions,\" she said.\nThe environmental community wanted a stronger vision for the future — and more leadership from Hickenlooper on the issue.\nThe Coalition for a Livable Climate , a consortium of environmental organizations, argues the state needs to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 — not just reduce them. Pete May smith, executive director at Conservation Colorado, is pushing for 80 percent reduction by 2050, a benchmark set by the Obama administration.\n\"Climate change is one of the — if not the — most serious issues that our state is facing, our nation is facing and our planet is facing,\" said Gary Wockner, a environmental activist. \"The governor and his team have dropped the ball and let it slip through.\"\nAt the same time, energy industry advocates see other flaws in the plan.\nRepublican state Sen. Kevin Lundberg, the assistant majority leader, credited Hickenlooper for \"not going as extreme as some\" in addressing climate change. But he questioned the plan's premise, disputing the need to take action to address the planet's warming, which he suggests is a natural phenomenon.\n\"I still fundamentally disagree with the analysis that we have to control our 'carbon footprint' because the facts aren't there,\" said Lundberg, a Berthoud Republican who fought the initial climate bill .\nColorado Petroleum Council director Tracee Bentley, Hickenlooper's former chief lobbyist and energy adviser, expressed disappointment that the report didn't highlight the benefits of natural gas and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.\n\"Any new energy policy should support abundant and affordable energy, including oil and natural gas,\" she said in a statement.\nJohn Frank: 303-954-2409, jfrank@denverpost.com or @ByJohnFrank\nColorado climate plan\nA climate plan issued by the administration of Gov. John Hickenlooper, above, looks at seven main areas affected by climate change: water; public health; energy; transportation; tourism and recreation; agriculture; and ecosystems. Here are the key elements highlighted by the administration:\nWater : Promote drought preparedness through planning efforts and incorporate climate change into the forthcoming state water plan.\nPublic health : Coordinate state agencies in the effort to develop a Colorado-specific plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels, as required by the federal government's Clean Power Plan.\nEnergy : Ensure attainment of the state's renewable-energy standard goals in 2020; assist utility companies in identifying cost-effective renewable power sources; and increase access to money for residential and commercial entities looking to improve energy efficiency.\nTransportation : Encourage fuel-efficient vehicle technologies and provide guidance to local governments on transit-oriented solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nAgriculture : Partner with federal agencies and researchers to help the industry improve irrigation and water efficiency practices.", "external_links": ["http://cwcbweblink.state.co.us/WebLink/ElectronicFile.aspx?docid=196541&searchid=243b8969-739b-448c-bd2d-699af9b7aea0&dbid=0", "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/us/coloradans-vote-to-embrace-alternative-sources-of-energy.html", "http://ecowatch.com/2015/09/21/colorado-climate-action-plan/", "http://cnee.colostate.edu/graphics/uploads/ColoradoClimateActionPlan.pdf", "http://cleanenergyaction.org/2015/09/18/colorado-coalition-for-a-livable-climate-reaction-to-the-2015-colorado-climate-action-plan/", "http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2013a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont3/FD5B92C7D67F90F787257AEE0058A740?open&file=1293_enr.pdf", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/31/fact-sheet-us-reports-its-2025-emissions-target-unfccc", "https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/governor/news/gov-hickenlooper-responds-sen-mitch-mcconnell-letter-0"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:53:59.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
