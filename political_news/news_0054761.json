(AP) - The latest on the grand jury investigation into the Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office, which came under fire after a volunteer deputy fatally shot an unarmed man (all times local): \n4:45 p.m. \nA local civil rights organizer who helped push for an investigation into the Tulsa County Sheriff’s Office says the results of the probe represent a win for residents. \nMarq Lewis leads We the People Oklahoma, the group that organized a petition drive calling for a grand jury to investigate the sheriff’s office following the fatal shooting of an unarmed man by a volunteer deputy. \nThousands of people signed the petitions, prompting prosecutors to call a grand jury to investigate the office. The grand jury indicted Sheriff Stanley Glanz on Wednesday on two misdemeanor counts. \nLewis says the results of the investigation are “a statement to never bet against the citizens, the people of Tulsa County. We are citizens who count, we matter and we make a difference.” \n___ \n3:40 p.m. \nAn attorney for Tulsa County’s sheriff says the longtime law officer plans to plead not guilty to two misdemeanors handed down by a grand jury investigating his office. \nAttorney Scott Wood said Sheriff Stanley Glanz will enter the pleas at a Nov. 10 hearing. \nA grand jury issued the indictments Wednesday after finishing its investigation into Glanz’s office. The grand jury was called to investigate after a volunteer deputy, Robert Bates, fatally shot an unarmed man in April. \nGrand jurors accused Glanz of refusing to perform his official duties for not promptly releasing documents as part of an internal investigation of Bates, one of Glanz’s longtime friends. \nThe grand jury also accused Glanz of willful violation of the law in an unrelated incident involving a stipend he received for a vehicle allowance. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:26:25.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
