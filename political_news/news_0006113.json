As a former six-year Democratic councilman, I have a sign on my lawn endorsing the two Democratic councilmen yet I have no idea on where they stand or how they will vote on the quarry on Federal Hill. Please don't tell me that they have to wait for the results of the investigation paid for by Tilcon. \nWe all know how that will turn out! Voters have the right to know their stand on this all important issue before the election. The environmental wing of the Democratic Party that believes the quarry plan is madness and unimaginable hope that Mr. Sondermeyer and Mr. Dellaripa will have the courage to stand up to party pressure and be brave enough to do the right thing. Either way we need to hear from them soon. \nHack Miller, \nBloomingdale", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:52:02.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
