He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'\"\nCarson said the student who responded negatively to Carson's statement did so because he was \"probably fed\" some misinformation about his position, suggesting the media coverage has misconstrued his original intent.\nRead More \"I suspect he probably has had it fed to him by somebody who misconstrued it and I think if he had heard the complete explanation I gave, he'd know that I'm not complaining about any of the victims,\" Carson said.\nCarson said arming teachers could help prevent shootings.\n\"Whether it's a kindergarten teacher who is well trained or a retired policeman or someone who can stop the carnage, I think it makes sense,\" he said.\nThe Holocaust would have been less deadly had more people in Europe been armed, he said.\n\"I think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed,\" he said. \"I'm telling you there is a reason these dictatorial people take the guns first.\"\nRELATED: Oregon shooting survivor offended by Carson's comments\nThe presidential candidate has since looked to clean up his remarks, saying that he was \"not judging (the shooting victims) at all.\"\nBut Carson recounted Wednesday a story about being held at gunpoint where he reacted differently amid backlash over his earlier comments.\n\"I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeye's organization\" in Baltimore, the retired neurosurgeon told Karen Hunter on Sirius XM Radio, referring to the fried chicken fast-food chain.\n\"Guy comes in, put the gun in my ribs. And I just said, 'I believe that you want the guy behind the counter,'\" Carson said.\nIn wide ranging interview, Carson also appeared to break with fellow GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush when the former Florida governor said he would not reauthorize the Voting Rights Act.\n\"Of course I want the Voting Rights Act to be protected,\" Carson said, adding he wanted to know Bush's rational. \"Whether we still need it or not or whether we've outgrown the need for it is questionable.\"\nRELATED: Jeb Bush opposes reauthorizing Voting Rights Act\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:07:58.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
