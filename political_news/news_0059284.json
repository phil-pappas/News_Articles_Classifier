The vice president never captured more than a quarter of the vote in any reliable national poll — before or after the death of his son Beau — and only in two surveys out of dozens conducted since the start of this summer did he outpace Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for second place. Surveys showed Biden was also weak in the early-voting states: He was at just 12 percent and 11 percent in the latest Pollster.com estimates in Iowa and New Hampshire , respectively, far behind former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sanders.\nEven in South Carolina, a state Biden loyalists said would be the linchpin of the vice president’s strategy, he lagged badly. The state is polled less frequently than Iowa or New Hampshire, but a CNN/ORC poll in South Carolina last week showed Clinton roughly doubling Biden’s support, 49 percent to 24 percent.\nHis absence from the race is likely to bolster Clinton's standing in the polls, since Biden's limited support came disproportionately at Clinton’s expense. In the three national polls conducted since the first Democratic presidential debate last week that included a second-choice candidate option, Biden supporters flocked to Clinton over Sanders by a three-to-one margin.\nA Monmouth University poll released earlier this week showed Clinton with 48 percent, Sanders 21 percent and Biden 17 percent. But when Biden supporters were asked whom they would support if the vice president didn’t run, Clinton's total swelled 9 points, to 57 percent, while Sanders ticked up only to 24 percent.\nOther polls show similar results: An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll this week showed Clinton leading Sanders, 49 percent to 29 percent, with Biden at 15 percent. Without Biden? Clinton is at 58 percent, to 33 percent for Sanders. A CNN/ORC national poll this week was virtually identical: Clinton 45, Sanders 29, Biden 18. Without Biden? Clinton 56, Sanders 33.\nBiden not running for president By Gabriel Debenedetti and Nick Gass\nIn South Carolina, where a majority of the Democratic primary electorate is African-American, the results are even more dramatic. The vast majority of Biden supporters in South Carolina said Clinton was their second choice; without him, Clinton surged to 70 percent of the vote in the CNN/ORC poll. Sanders, who was at 18 percent in the initial matchup, is virtually stagnant, at 20 percent.\nWhile Biden’s decision is likely to boost Clinton in the race for the nomination, the former secretary of state’s declining poll numbers among all voters raise red flags for the general election. National polls of hypothetical general-election matchups are of limited value at this stage of the campaign, but Biden’s backers have been quick to point to data showing the vice president runs stronger against the leading Republican candidates than Clinton or Sanders.\nLast week's Fox News poll showed Clinton behind the top Republican candidates: She trailed Donald Trump by 5 points, Ben Carson by 11 points and Jeb Bush by 4 points.\nBiden, on the other hand, led all three Republicans in the poll, sometimes by wide margins: Biden was 13 points ahead of Trump, 4 points ahead of Carson and 5 points ahead of Bush.\nBut there's some evidence Biden's increasing personal favorability during the past few months was overinflating his position in the general election. This week's CNN/ORC poll showed Biden's favorability rating at 51 percent — higher than at any point since just after Biden's inauguration as vice president in 2009. That includes 30 percent of self-identified Republicans, who, by Election Day 2016, aren't likely to cast ballots for the Democratic nominee in those numbers.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2462140-debate-democrats.html#document/p11", "http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-iowa-presidential-democratic-primary", "http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-new-hampshire-presidential-democratic-caucus", "http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/4f03d197-5cae-42a6-b47a-0c1a4aeb7b6f.pdf", "http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2455141-south-carolina-and-nevada-conducted-october-3-10.html#document/p1", "http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary", "http://www.scribd.com/doc/286132150/15462-NBCWSJ-Oct-Poll-Final"], "published": "2015-10-21T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:06:08.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
