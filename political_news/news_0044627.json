Quote: \"[The FOP] have always been a force in supporting and lobbying against police reform, and for those kind of draconian police engagements that were based in 'law and order,'\" said Ron Hampton, who is the former executive director of the National Black Police Association (NBPA). Hampton was also formerly a police officer in Washington, DC, from 1971 to 1994. \"That has been their agenda and they have invested money in those politicians that support that.\" Hampton told Truthout that the 1994 omnibus crime bill passed under former President Bill Clinton with wide support among Democrats, and that the NBPA withheld support for the law because of its role in expanding the federal death penalty, and establishing an array of new crimes that would disproportionately impact communities of color, especially as it related to how the law affected immigration law statutes and gang-related crimes.\"Twenty years later ... Bill Clinton and his wife should apologize for the mass incarceration that those laws created,\" Hampton said. \"But there were Democrats, a whole lot of Democrats, that supported that ... because that was the theme of the day, and the unions had a lot to do with gathering up that support because that was what they wanted ... and they got it.\" Today, Democrats receiving campaign contributions from the national FOP still support the COPS program created by the 1994 crime bill, the largest such crime bill in US history. COPS' Campaign Cash According to data provided by the nonpartisan research organization MapLight, police unions and law enforcement lobbying groups have spent millions since 2008 to influence elected representatives and candidates, most of them Democrats. Looks as though we need to clean house and yell foul to the democrats. Let's remove these neoliberals and get them replaced with liberals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:39:55.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
