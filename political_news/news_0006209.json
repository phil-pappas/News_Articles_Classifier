Photo: Andrew Meares\n\"Put it all together and I think he has every reason to go early,\" says Jessica Elwood, the Ipsos social research director. \"There are so many other considerations at play, but this data absolutely suggests it would be a pretty convincing win were he to go early.\"\nAdvertisement But here's the thing. Turnbull's lead over Shorten is almost identical to the Turnbull ascendancy over Tony Abbott, as measured by the former prime minister's ratings before he was torn down.\nThis suggests that, much more than anything else, the Turnbull honeymoon is being driven by a sense of relief that Abbott is no longer in charge.\nTurnbull's every instinct will be turn that sense of relief into a positive endorsement between now and when the election is due in around 12 months, but the case for going before the May budget with a new plan is surely being considered by those around him.\nAside from sending a collective shiver down the Labor spine, the poll results represent a blunt message to those hardline conservatives in the Coalition who would contemplate making life difficult for the new leader: Don't even think about it!\nThere is also a verdict on the Labor tactic last week of trying to exploit Turnbull's great wealth: It backfired. This does not mean the Opposition will desist.\nEndorsements of a leadership change between elections, or of the first few weeks of a new prime minister's performance, simply do not get any better than this one.\nThe Coalition's poor performance in the polls was one of the key reasons Turnbull gave when he announced that he would challenge. Now, for the first time since before the disastrous 2014 budget, the Coalition is not just in front, but ascendant in every area.\nKevin Rudd and Bob Hawke had similarly high approval ratings after coming to power at general elections, but Turnbull's arrival was the result of tearing down the man who led the Coalition to victory at the last election. His 68 per cent approval rating is higher than John Howard's first rating (61) and much higher than Julia Gillard's when she knocked off Rudd (54) and Rudd's when he knocked off Gillard (51).\nMost significantly, it is 21 points higher than Abbott's first rating (47) and his net rating of plus-51 is a staggering 75 points better than Bill Shorten's net rating of minus-24 (which is the same as Abbott's rating in the last poll before he was dumped).\nTurnbull's challenge is to turn the perceptions of voters into reality and voter rankings on 10 positive attributes suggest where he needs to concentrate his energy. He leads Shorten by an average of 27 points in every category, but has only a single-digit lead in the areas of social policy and on commanding the confidence of his party.\nMoreover, his trustworthiness rating is just 58 per cent (still well ahead of Shorten's 36), which probably reflects the electorate's view of how he came to power.\nBut Shorten's challenge is so much greater: to change voter perceptions and give his colleagues reason to hang tough during what could be a very long Turnbull honeymoon.", "external_links": ["http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-national-news/congested-level-crossings-not-on-labors-removal-list-6958636.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:52:30.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
