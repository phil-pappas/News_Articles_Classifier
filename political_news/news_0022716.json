Both articles are about at least 72 hours of terror by the citizens living in mountain communities of Tamazula. The people reported their homes being fired upon by Marina aircraft.\nFamilies returned to gather belongings and once again leave\nSince Tuesday no less than 14 communities and their citizens have been effectively kidnapped by elements of the Mexican Marines. People scurried into the brush of the mountains, barely having time to grab a pair of shoes, or supplies for babies. Photos and videos flooded the social media outlets, people displaying babies covered with bites from insects in the brush, and adults and children cuts and scratches from running to safety through thick brush areas.\nCosala, Sinaloa: it was a little less than 72 hours that the villagers of 14 communities of the Sierra Madre Occidental lived nightmare existence due to an operation by the Mexican Marines\nThe people said it was due to a search for Chapo. The Marina denied that.\nToday Milenio published a report regarding the situation and the highlights are as follows:\nRafael Caro Quintero and Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, knowing the heat continues for their capture and that of El Chapo Guzman, usually move in a wide designated sierra region between Tamazula, Durango and Sinaloa. The search being conducted, according to intelligence reports (so say Milenio) is where El Chapo has sought refuge.\nThe area is inaccessible by road.\nclick on to enlarge\nReports reveal that RCQ and Mayo spend most of the time on the border of the two states, being protected by layers of assassin armies who have created security fences.\n“Nothing and no one can enter the area without being seen by Halcones (look outs) or sophisticated surveillance and communication systems.”\nTamazula is less than 2 hours from Culiacan, Sinaloa and 3 hours away from Badiraguato.\nSince the tunnel escape of Chapo on July 11 th federal forces have added an additional 100 highway inspection stops in 22 entities, primarily in Durango, Sinaloa and Sonora.\nThree Marina helicopters came under attack from land from high powered weapons, reports of one being shot down was not confirmed by authorities, saying instead the M1-17 aircraft made an emergency landing.\nIn the same incident, other helicopters created a group and returned fire killing 2 “aggressors” on land as the group open gunfire.\nCitizens give a different account, stating the men were not criminals; they were citizens running from the gunfire, that was aimlessly striking buildings and people. They called it an execution of two people. CNDH is taking both versions under review.\nOn a side note, The PAN deputy Lucero Sanchez called on the floor of the legislator for a halt “to abuses by the Marina against the mountain towns of Tamazula, Durango and Cosalá of 200 families.”\nYou may remember Dep. Sanchez, the rumored mother of Chapo’s youngest son, who visited Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman while he was incarcerated, by using false documents, to access the maximum security prison. She denied visiting the capo, but later Chapo’s attorney who accompanied her on at least one visit confirmed the visits.", "external_links": ["http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2015/10/they-lived-72-hours-of-terror-in.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:31:30.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
