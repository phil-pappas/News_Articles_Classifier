We want to help them do this,\" said Moschitto.\nThe month of October, Moschitto and DermaTouch RN are offering free radiation tattoo mark removal for cancer patients, utilizing the PicoSure ® laser.\nThe PicoSure is the most advanced tattoo removal laser technology currently available and the only picosecond laser platform, removing tattoo ink far more rapidly than previous laser tattoo removal treatments.\nPatients who wish to take advantage of this special offering must simply contact DermaTouch RN to schedule a consultation, 281.895.9090.
