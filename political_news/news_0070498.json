Bobby Jindal speaks at the National Press Club in Washington. Jindal offers history from a conservative viewpoint in a new book illustrating the “folly of looking to the government for the solution to all of our problems.” Tracing an arc from the Bill of Rights to President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Louisiana governor came out Tuesday with “American Will,” a book meant to advance his struggling campaign.
