What with all that flip-floppin’ on Planned Parenthood and bein’ investigated by the FBI and all, it’s no wonder Hillary Clinton needed to just set a spell and visit with her good friends in South Carolina.\nThe other day, Hillary sat down with Jamie Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, on his web show Chair Chats . If you’ve got half an hour of free time and absolutely nothing better to do with it, you can watch their conversation here . Just about anything can be improved with a couple of rocking chairs and a pitcher of ice-cold lemonade. Even listening to Hillary Clinton.\nOr, if you just want to get straight to Hillary’s wonderful Southernesque accent, Shoshana Weissmann at the Weekly Standard has compiled the highlights. The cowboy boots along the left margin measure the intensity of the accent, with 1 being the lowest and 5 the highest. Enjoy!\nShe’s as warm as she is genuine. Sorry to be so blunt.\nTags: Hillary Clinton Fourth ‘Teen’ Finally Charged In Zemir Begic Murder 2:59 PM 10/02/2015 Hillary Clinton Couldn’t Be Prouder To Have Wendy Davis On Her Team 1:23 PM 10/02/2015 Obama On Confiscating Guns: Then And Now 8:39 AM 10/02/2015 Pregnant Student Kicks Pregnant EMT During Huge Brawl At Milwaukee’s Barack Obama School Of Career And Technical Education 4:17 PM 10/01/2015 Benjamin Netanyahu And The Pin-Drop Heard ‘Round The World 3:09 PM 10/01/2015 Why Is #BlackLivesMatter Planning To Disrupt A Marathon? 11:59 AM 10/01/2015 Is It Really A Good Idea To Chemically Suppress Your Son’s Puberty Because He Thinks He’s A Girl? 10:26 AM 10/01/2015 Planned Parenthood’s Defenders Haven’t Seen Those Videos, But So What? 3:41 PM 09/30/2015 Vox Explains Why Hillary Clinton Is A Flip-Flopper On Gay Marriage 1:51 PM 09/30/2015 Why Is Throwing A Newborn Baby Out A Window Considered Murder, But Abortion Isn’t? 10:33 AM 09/30/2015 ", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxgL-v1MtIQ", "http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/hillary-clinton-put-southern-accent-south-carolina-democratic-chairman_1005486.html", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyCaller", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awSbpudJI54", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/05/exclusive-bobby-jindal-hammers-hillary-clinton-for-support-of-planned-parenthood/"], "published": "2015-10-02T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:29:31.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
