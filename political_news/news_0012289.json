For the past three months, the group has worked to unionize Trump International employees, with little success.\nClinton's Democratic challengers are likely to also make a play for union support at the debate, especially Bernie Sanders.\n\"These union workers must be relieved that Hillary Clinton's private jet got her to Las Vegas just in time to pander to them,\" Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short scoffed in a statement. \"The truth is, rank and file union members aren't running to Hillary Clinton's side after seeing her politically-motivated flip flops on trade, health care, and the Keystone Pipeline. Their guess about where Hillary Clinton will stand the next time the political winds shift is as good as anyone else's.\"\nClinton last visited Nevada over the summer speaking for the AFL-CIO annual conference.
