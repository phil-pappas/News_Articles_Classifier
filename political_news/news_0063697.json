The Scottish Government must listen to its party members as well as communities from across Scotland who do not want unconventional fossil fuels because of climate change, environmental and economic impacts.\nPromoted stories \"Fracking and unconventional fossil fuels have no place in Scotlandâ€™s future energy mix. The world has many times more fossil fuel reserves than we can afford to burn if we want to avoid dangerous climate change.\"\nThe motion that will be debated today calls on the Government to introduce a moratorium against underground coal gasification (UCG), which sees hard-to-reach coal seams set alight and gas siphoned off to the surface. Fracking sees water, sand and chemicals pumped underground in wells to fracture shale rock, releasing gas.\nThe conference resolution has been overtaken by events, after energy minister Fergus Ewing performed a u-turn and brought in a UCG moratorium.\nShare article Tom Pickering, the Ineos director in charge of the company's shale gas operation in Scotland, was manning the stall yesterday and said he was delighted to answer members' questions.\nHe added: \"At the public meetings I have attended people come to me and highlight safety concerns they have read about on the internet. Sadly there has been much misinformation put out about shale gas.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-16T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:18:39.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
