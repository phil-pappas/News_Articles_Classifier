The possibility of Mr Odinga becoming a witness in Mr Ruto’s case was first raised by Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, who, in an address to the media in January, suggested that the Cord leader should consider defending Mr Ruto. Thereafter, political leaders on all sides of the divide jumped in and, for different reasons, opposed Mr Odinga’s offer to testify, with those on Mr Ruto’s side advising him to reject the offer. Advertisement More by this Author \nThe wheel has turned full circle and the Jubilee leadership, which was once so hostile towards the possibility of Mr Raila Odinga testifying for the defence in the ongoing trial against Deputy President William Ruto, is now urging the Cord leader to offer his testimony for Mr Ruto. \nThe current round of recriminations was touched off by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria when he owned up during a public rally in Mt Elgon that he had supplied witnesses to the Kriegler and Waki commissions with a view to fixing the Deputy President, and now offered to provide exonerating testimony in his favour at the International Criminal Court. \nBut Mr Kuria also accused Mr Odinga and NARC-Kenya leader Martha Karua of also fixing Mr Ruto, an accusation that they both denied. Mr Kuria wanted the two opposition leaders to approach the ICC with a view to confessing their alleged roles in fixing the Deputy President in order to now save him. \nIn response to Mr Kuria, Mr Odinga made accusations of his own against President Uhuru Kenyatta, claiming that Mr Kuria fixed Mr Ruto on behalf of Mr Kenyatta back then. \nMs Karua has since commenced defamation proceedings against Mr Kuria, who has also reportedly attracted the attention of the ICC which has already sent officials to Kenya to meet the Gatundu South MP. \nWhat Mr Kuria had started was continued in a well-attended “prayer rally” in Meru last weekend, where Jubilee politicians, led by the Senate Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki and his National Assembly counterpart Aden Duale, urged Mr Odinga to return the favour that Mr Ruto had done him, when he campaigned for him for the 2007 elections, by testifying to save the Deputy President who faces trial at the International Criminal Court. \nSENATOR'S PLEA \nThe possibility of Mr Odinga becoming a witness in Mr Ruto’s case was first raised by Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen, who, in an address to the media in January, suggested that the Cord leader should consider defending Mr Ruto. \nMr Murkomen reasoned that as the leader of ODM at the time of the violence, Mr Odinga was in a position to convince the judges that ODM had no ideology or scheme to trigger violence and to evict other ethnic communities from parts of Kenya. The senator indicated that “as a lawyer, I would advise the DP to ask Raila to testify in his case.” \nReacting to Mr Murkomen’s suggestion, Mr Odinga issued a statement in Kisumu, indicating that “when asked to testify, I am ready and willing to do so on behalf of my party, ODM.” But he also clarified that nobody had approached him to testify for Mr Ruto. \nThe DP’s response to Mr Odinga’s offer to testify in his trial was smug. Through a spokesman, he issued a statement welcoming Mr Odinga’s offer but also insisting that he was innocent and would soon be vindicated. The statement added that: “The Deputy President welcomes Hon Raila Odinga’s offer to testify, however, his conscience remains clear. He’s innocent and in a short while he will be vindicated.” \nThereafter, political leaders on all sides of the divide jumped in and, for different reasons, opposed Mr Odinga’s offer to testify, with those on Mr Ruto’s side advising him to reject the offer. \nFor example, Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau warned that the evidence that Mr Odinga intended to give may not be genuine. According to him: “Raila has seen that Ruto’s case and that of broadcaster Joshua Sang are collapsing, the same way Uhuru’s did, and now wants to give funny cooked-up evidence in a desperate attempt to gain political popularity by hoodwinking Kenyans about bailing Ruto and Sang out.” Mr Kamau spoke in the presence of Murang’a Woman Rep Sabina Chege, who supported his views, pointing out that during the two years when the ICC cases had been in court, Mr Odinga had been silent. She termed his offer of support as “uncalled for and very suspicious” and said, “I would warn the DP to be very suspicious.” \nCOLLAPSING CASE \nA section of URP legislators also rejected Mr Odinga’s evidence, with Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi declaring at a press conference that “Kalenjin leaders don’t want Raila to testify at the ICC because the case is already collapsing and Raila wants to make political mileage out of the case.” \nOn his part, Ainamoi MP Samuel Chepkonga declared that “Raila is trying to confuse Ruto when the case is already dead. He fixed him at the ICC and now he wants to defend him there.” \nIt was not just Jubilee leaders who opposed Odinga’s offer to testify for Ruto. A section of Cord MPs from Kwale County declared that Mr Ruto should carry his own cross, and contended that his allies had “demonised” the former Prime Minister over the ICC cases. \nKwale Senator Boy Juma Boy, Msambweni MP Suleiman Dori and CORD Nominated MP Zuleikha Hassan argued, at separate public meetings, that the previous attacks on Mr Odinga by URP leaders had created irreconcilable differences, and declared that URP members should not drag Mr Odinga into Mr Ruto’s legal problems or try to entice him to testify for him. The Cord leaders recalled that URP leaders falsely convinced their supporters that Mr Odinga orchestrated Mr Ruto’s ICC trial, an issue that has resurfaced in the ongoing debate. \nReacting to last weekend’s meeting in Meru, Mr Odinga issued a statement while on a trip to China, in which he reiterated his willingness to appear for Mr Ruto, but also now observed that he had been told “publicly and privately by persons claiming to stand with Hon William Ruto that my testimony is not needed.” He observed that “Ruto and his legal team have been publicly beseeched by the same Jubilee politicians challenging me today to testify, not to accept any help from me” which he said “makes the renewed urgent call for me to testify even more curious and disturbing”. \nMr Odinga asserted that nobody was “talking about recanting and withdrawing the false testimony that they confess they used against Ruto at his trial” and concluded that “my testimony in support of Hon William Ruto will not assist him so long as the false testimony procured against him by the PNU brigade remains on record at The Hague.” \nWhat is to be made of this latest bout between the ruling Jubilee coalition and the opposition Cord? \nAt one level the debate about whether or not Mr Odinga should testify for Mr Ruto is driven by politics rather than reason. The termination of the Kenyatta trial in January, which came at a time that the prosecution in the Ruto case was also doing badly, left Jubilee ebullient and led to hasty conclusions that the coalition was self-sufficient and needed no help from other quarters. At the time, Mr Odinga’s offer was seen as an attempt to share in the coalition’s glory, and as providing an opportunity where he would take credit for saving Mr Ruto from his trial. Unexpected turn \nBut as the Ruto trial came to an end, it took an unexpected turn, widely seen as detrimental for his defence, when the trial chamber admitted the recanted testimonies of witnesses. Further reasons for concern came when a pre-trial chamber unsealed an arrest warrant against lawyer Paul Gicheru and Philip Kipkoech Bett, for offences against the administration of justice consisting in corruptly influencing witnesses. \nThese new developments have crystalised a feeling within Jubilee that the Deputy President is vulnerable where he once felt safe. In the circumstances, the plea to Mr Odinga to save Mr Ruto is probably a genuine attempt by Jubilee to reach out in a moment of desperation with a view to supporting its deputy leader. \nGiven the rank arrogance that Jubilee has previously exhibited when dealing with the subject of Mr Odinga’s role in the Ruto defence, it is humbling for the coalition to find itself in a situation where it expects favours from the opposition leadership. \nAt the same time, Jubilee is making very public attempts to absolve itself from blame for anything that might go wrong in the Ruto trial, by making Mr Odinga a scapegoat. The ground is being prepared for saying that it was the failure by Mr Odinga to testify for the DP which led to any bad luck that may befall him. \nIn all this, Mr Kuria’s “confession” is confounding. If what he claims about his own role can be verified, it would be a crime under Kenyan law, and possibly also the Rome Statute. \nAs a person to save Mr Ruto from trial, Mr Kuria would be of little use as he would face the risk of his own arrest if he travelled to The Hague.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:54:12.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
