But the transition team will be working long hours to get it right, because the early days of a mandate are critically important to set the tone and shape public perception. \n\"No one in the early days wants to see the government drop the ball,\" he said. \nCreating cabinet, hiring staff \nBoudria said the transition team — led by Peter Harder and said to include trusted campaign advisers Gerry Butts, Katie Telford and Cyrus Reporter — will work out a detailed strategy for the days ahead, from crafting the structure and mandate of the cabinet and proposing a date to recall Parliament and deliver a throne speech, to listing off names of potential senior staff. \nThis will all be planned around a busy series of international meetings including for the G20 and Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) scheduled for the fall. \n\"The government is a train that's moving. The transition team is the way to get these passengers on board the moving train without them falling off,\" he said. \"The train slows down a bit, but it doesn't stop.\" \nFormer Liberal deputy prime minister Sheila Copps, who is now travelling in Asia, said the Liberal win is being celebrated across Canada and abroad. She believes \"big change\" is on the way. \n\"We will start talking about citizens again, instead of simply taxpayers. The team will be young, as Trudeau has succeeded in recruiting a great number of new faces, and some terrific women from across the country,\" she told CBC News. \"Trudeau's vision is very inclusive and I think the Paris climate change meeting will send a strong message to the world that Canada is getting serious about sustainability in the environment.\" \nConservative strategist Geoff Norquay, who served as a senior adviser to former prime minister Brian Mulroney, said the biggest challenge for Trudeau is facing expectations that are \"enormous and unmeetable.\" \n\"The Liberals won a huge and resounding mandate for change, and that means that not only regions but cities and different sectors of the economy are going to be lining up saying, 'Here's what you promised — where is it? And how quickly will you make me happy?'\" \nAs one of the first orders of business, Trudeau will need to \"seize the agenda\" by mapping out which policy promises to deliver on fast, which to phase in, and which from the Conservative government to revoke. \nFresh faces \nMonday's historic election that led to Trudeau's majority mandate brings many fresh faces to the House of Commons. \nThere are 215 new MPs, including 15 who are returning to office after serving in the past but not the last Parliament. That's the highest number in 22 years, when 205 new MPs arrived on Parliament Hill after the 1993 election. \nAn orientation session has been set for Nov. 3, which will be administrative in focus. Another session geared to procedural matters will be held closer to the return of Parliament. \nThere is much on the to-do list for outgoing MPs and prime minister, too. \nNorquay said that aside from the necessary business of tendering an official resignation to the Governor General, sorting out cabinet documents and vacating official residences at 24 Sussex Drive and Harrington Lake, Harper will likely hold one last meeting with his cabinet and another with his caucus. \n\"That will be a difficult and emotional final goodbye,\" he said.
