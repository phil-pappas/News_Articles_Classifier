John Campbell, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, testifies about the Kunduz airstrike before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday. (Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) October 8 at 5:45 PM Regarding the Oct. 4 front-page article “ Afghan hospital hit; U.S. blamed ”:\nThe airstrike on a hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan, was an apparent violation of the Geneva Conventions. Instead of the familiar accusations and denials by people on all sides, what we need is a thorough and impartial investigation by the U.S. military into what happened, followed by a trial of whoever was responsible — not just the soldiers involved, but those who gave the orders to attack a hospital, if, indeed, this is what happened. There is too much history of the military convicting the soldiers who carried out an inhumane attack and whitewashing the officers who ordered it. The United States should live up to its responsibility to behave as a civilized nation should.\nHenry D.
