Harish Rao (Photo: Deccan Chronicle) Hyderabad: Accusing Congress leaders of undertaking padayatras only when they are not in power, irrigation minister T Harish Rao on Wednesday said that the Opposition parties were unnecessarily creating a ruckus and blaming the TRS government over farmer issue when the fact was previous rulers created the situation. “Congress leaders like Rahul Gandhi and others undertake padayatras when out of power, their aim being to stop the cadre from deserting the party. When in power, the Opposition did nothing for the farmers. Every CM ignored farmers and failed to complete irrigation projects which are lifeline for farming,” he alleged. Mr Rao was responding to Congress leaders’ Rythu Bharosa Yatra on Tuesday, during which they blamed the TRS government for the suicides. He said that the TRS government has taken several initiatives to help farmers. “Our Water Grid programme has got national and international recognition. Our government paid ex-gratia to 53 farmers who committed suicide during the Congress rule. We are implementing every promise made in our election manifesto,” he said.
