The measure would require strict oversight, including authorization by a specialist and inventory checks, Burrows said.\nUnder current Chilean law, cannabis-derived drugs are not allowed to be sold and those who want to obtain them must petition the IPS public health institute to import them from abroad. The only such drug that has been allowed for import is Sativex, a mouth spray used to alleviate symptoms of multiple sclerosis.\nIn Chile, cannabis is considered a hard drug and selling or growing it is punishable by law. Parliament is currently debating legislation aimed at decriminalising the consumption of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes. Elsewhere in South America, Uruguay both legalised marijuana and created a regulated market for it in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:18:32.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
