What does Paul Ryan stand for? FAST TRACK TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY Paul Ryan was on board with Fast Track Trade Promotion Authority and subverting Congress exclusive and constitutionally assigned duty to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Ryan promoting ignoring our Constitution and placing this power in Obamas hands. Fast-track trade power would allow the President to negotiate trade deals with foreign nations in secret and effectively eliminate the American Peoples Representatives from their assigned duty to create legislation regulating commerce with foreign nations. Congress would no longer create the legislation and the process of adding corrective amendments to Obamas deals struck in secret to insure they promote Americas best interests would be totally circumvented. The only part Congress would have in the Presidents fast-track trade power would be an up or down vote within 90 days upon receiving the presidents' deal which effectively eliminates Congress assigned duty to create regulations of commerce. This Fast-tract trade authority is a Chamber of Commerces idea to remove the peoples Representatives from amending bad trade deals struck by Obama in secret which are not in the best interests of America, but rather, are deals beneficial to international corporate giants who have no allegiance to America or promoting the general welfare of the United States. Rep. Paul Ryan gives finger to veterans, confirms he is a Washington snake! Paul Ryan drafted a plan with Patty Murray which would cut veterans benefits. See Paul Ryan Doubles Down on Cutting Veteran Pensions What Paul Ryan intentionally refuses to acknowledge is, of the defined and limited powers granted to our federal government by our Constitution, one just happens to be its power over our nations military, and that means caring for our nations war verteans . Unlike the countless federal government free-cheese programs not authorized by our Constitution and which work to balloon our annual federal deficits, providing for our nations veterans is a legitimate and constitutionally based obligation. Ryans reforms ought to begin with a twenty percent cut of every social welfare program which is not within the defined and limited powers granted to our federal government. To not do so is to advance the pinko progressive agenda which has made our productive members of society tax slaves to those enjoying the ride on Obamas free-cheese wagon. Paul Ryan embraces millions who have invaded our borders! Paul Ryan is in favor of legalizing millions of illegal entrants who, by their very presence in America, are causing devastating social and economic consequences Paul Ryan is also in favor of line item veto power being exercise by our President. Keep in mind the Presidents veto power is laid out in crystal clear language in our Constitution. If the president vetoes a bill it is returned to the House that originated the bill with the presidents objections, and the bill [not parts of the bill which the president doesnt like] is then to be reconsidered and needs a two thirds vote of that House to override the Presidents veto which then requires the bill to be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. Unfortunately, Paul Ryan is comfortable with taking it upon himself to change the veto procedure outlined in our Constitution and do for the people that which the people have not willingly agreed to do for themselves via our Constitutions required amendment process. Under Ryans circumvention of our Constitution, the president is granted extraordinary power to withhold funding for whatever he so desires and this defies appropriations made by law. We were warned about the president exercising such power during the convention of 1787! ' 'The negative of the governor was constantly made use of to extort money. No good law whatever could be passed without a private bargain with him. An increase of salary or some donation, was always made a condition; till at last, it became the regular practice to have orders in his favor on the treasury presented along with the bills to be signed, so that he might actually receive the former before he should sign the latter. When the Indians were scalping the Western people, and notice of it arrived, the concurrence of the governor in the means of self-defense could not be got, until it was agreed that the people were to fight for the security of his property, whilst he was to have no share of the burdens of taxation.'' ___ SEE: Benjamin Franklin, June 4 of the Constitutional Convention Paul Ryan also alleges that Congress has the power to enact this legislation pursuant to Article I, Section 9, Clause 7. which has nothing to do with the allowable veto power procedure which is articulated in Article 1, Section 7, Clause 2. Keep in mind our Supreme Court has already struck down line item veto powers being exercised by the president. The bottom line is, this little snake, Paul Ryan, needs to be primaried this coming election and not elevated to Speaker of the House. JWK To support Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio or John Kasich is to support a continuance of Obama's illegal immigration tyranny which includes giving legal status and work permits to tens of millions who have invaded our borders!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:24:40.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
