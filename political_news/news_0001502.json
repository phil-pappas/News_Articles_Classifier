Holt developed the game and previously used it to show that it engages procedural learning of speech and non-speech sounds among listeners who do not have dyslexia.\nCMU Researchers Use Video Games (and \"Alien\" Language) To Crack the Speech Code\nAs an alien approaches in the video game, a sound from an associated sound category plays. Participants make shooting or capturing actions according to whether the alien is a friend or foe. The four aliens have different colors, shapes and movement patterns.\nWhile navigating through a 3D outer space environment, listeners heard novel complex non-speech “warble” sounds that they had never before encountered. The object of the game was to shoot and capture alien characters. Each of the four visually distinctive aliens was associated with a different sound category defined by multiple, somewhat variable, sounds.\n[This website wants your speech mistakes]\nAs participants moved throughout the game, game play speed increased and encouraged players to rely more on aliens’ sounds to guide navigation.\nThe results showed that the participants with dyslexia were significantly poorer than the control group at learning the sound categories that corresponded with the different aliens and generalizing their learning to new sounds introduced after the game.\nThe National Institutes of Health funded this research, which appears in the journal Cortex .\nSource: Carnegie Mellon University\nThe post Does dyslexia make it hard to learn sounds? appeared first on Futurity .", "external_links": ["http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/october/effect-of-dyslexia.html", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/149/101_1170x669_822888466_555x317.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8373efVmlU8", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2015.08.008"], "published": "2015-10-16T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:15:20.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
