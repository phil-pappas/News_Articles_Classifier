Penn, a former pollster and political strategist, worked on Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign with Bill Knapp, a managing director at SKDK. Penn left Microsoft earlier this year to start a Stagwell Group, a private-equity firm focused on digital marketing with backing from Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO.\nSKDK, which also has offices in New York, Albany and Los Angeles, has worked on political and corporate campaigns from Washington State's ballot initiative on gun background checks to the U.S. Airways merger. Anita Dunn, another managing director, was White House communications director and senior adviser to President Obama’s presidential campaigns. Her husband, Robert Bauer, was Obama's White House counsel.\n“Stagwell is putting together a really exciting group of best-in-class companies and we think this is a huge opportunity to work together with sister firms in the future,” SKDK Managing Director Josh Isay said. \"It’s a great opportunity for us to continue to operate our company the way it’s been operated and at the same time broaden our horizons.”\nBob Squier, a pioneer of modern campaigning, started the firm in 1968 as the Communications Company out of his townhouse near D.C.'s Eastern Market. It will continue to operate independently with the same managers.\n\"We’ve worked for large and small non-profits and some of the largest, Fortune 100 companies,\" managing directors Knapp, Dunn, Hilary Rosen, Isay and Jennifer Cunningham said in a note to staff. \"We’ve had people in our media training room whose words and actions help move a nation. We’ve worked to combat gun violence. We’ve helped those who work for civil rights and equal rights. We’ve helped defend choice, played a critical role in making marriage equality a reality and worked with numerous companies that face complex public policy and messaging challenges, helping them better serve their customers and improve their reputations.\"\nThe purchase price was not disclosed. Stagwell has raised $250 million and may invest as much as $750 million.\nWith help from Daniel Lippman.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:04:34.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
