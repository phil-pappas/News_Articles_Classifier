Rosoff, 39, is a vice president at the Raine Group , a global merchant bank focused exclusively on technology, media and telecommunications. He declined to comment when reached by phone at his office Thursday. \nChafee, the former U.S. Senator and governor from Rhode Island, currently polls at a flat zero in an average of six recent national polls compiled by Real Clear Politics; he’s at 0.3 percent in Iowa, and 0.8 percent in New Hampshire. \n[You can leave a response , or trackback from your own site.] JohnW \nPoor Chafee.
