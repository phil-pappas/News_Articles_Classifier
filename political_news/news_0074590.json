It was a buildup of many things. Even as a child, I could see that the planet was being mistreated. To a 10-year-old, it could be simply deforestation or air pollution instead of perceiving it as a nuanced global socio-economic issue. \nHaving started as a child, were there any instances where people older than you did not take you seriously? \nPeople have expressed scepticism at my age many a time. It is easy to lose hope due to such discouragement. However, this indifference should be precisely the catalyst to spur you to work harder. The question of my age often comes up but I try to brush that aside. Young people all over the world are breaking barriers and we should accept that as a positive sign. \nDo you see any change in people’s attitude towards the environment since the past five years? \nThere has definitely been a shift, not only in terms of taking action but a change in consciousness as well. People are more aware and stakeholders in the environmental dialogue have diversified. There has been a great degree of involvement from civil society and young people. However, policies still remain entrenched in vested interests and macro-level change is sluggish. \nHow do you propose to go about cost-efficient sustainable development, considering the financial constraints of the developing countries ? \nIndeed, equity is one of the pillars of sustainable development. We need to ensure that developed nations set up mechanisms for technology transfer at low costs to developing nations and this will go a longer way than any monetary aid. Developing nations, on the other hand, need to encourage innovation and entrepreneurial spirits in their economies. For example, the well-known Indian concept of jugaad and trade must be fair so that we don’t experience disproportionate effects of globalisation. \nDuring the TEDx dialogue, you said that you still have hope for a more environmentally sound planet. What makes you hopeful? \nThe fact that there is no Planet B! It is as simple as that. We really just have one shot at this and pessimists will only moan about the status quo, not change it. It is dangerous to fall into the silos of inaction and being hopeful is one way to avoid that. How can we be anything but hopeful!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T09:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:00:55.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
