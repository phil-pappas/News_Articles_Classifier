More UK migrant benefits key to EU talks \nThe Chinese president said Britain and China were becoming “increasingly interdependent” parts of a “community of shared interests”. \nSpeaking in Mandarin, Mr Xi said he believed his four-day state visit would help lift the friendly relationship between the two countries to “a new height”. \nThe address, in Parliament’s Royal Gallery, is a high point of the first state visit by a Chinese leader for 10 years. \nMr Xi, who arrived in the UK on Monday evening, said: “Although my visit has just started, I am already deeply impressed by the vitality of China-UK relations and the profound friendship between our peoples. \n“This gives me good reason to believe that my visit will lift the friendly ties between our two countries to a new height.” \nResponding to some international criticism that Britain was not critical enough of an authoritarian regime, Mr Hammond said: “We don’t think we are being naive. We go into all relationships with our eyes wide open.” \nHe told the BBC: “We want to be the most open economy in Europe to Chinese investment. We want to trade with China to ensure British jobs and prosperity.” In depth \nXi Jinping: UK state visit \nThe Chinese president is set to address parliament, dine at Buckingham Palace and ride in a royal carriage as London rolls out the reddest of red carpets for the Communist party leader \nMr Hammond said Britain was one of the few western economies which had opened large-scale infrastructure projects — including nuclear power — to foreign investment and that China wanted “some of that action”. \nHe said it would be “dangerous” to invite China to invest in Britain for political reasons and said that any contracts signed during Mr Xi’s visit would be rooted in commercial advantage on both sides. \nOn Tuesday morning, Mr Xi was driven down the Mall with the Queen in a gilded carriage, cheered on by throngs of Chinese wearing matching T-shirts bussed in from across the UK. Protesters were limited to one small section on one side of the avenue and police could be seen asking people with Tibetan flags to move to this area. Lea Reed, 32 from Cambridge, said she had come up to London with her Chinese friend on one of “tons” of buses laid on for the occasion. She was wearing a “I love China” T-shirt with the two countries’ flags that she said was handed out onboard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:18:43.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
