Brad Zaun, who topped all candidates in a 2014 Republican primary for the 3rd District congressional seat, said Thursday he won't challenge freshman U.S. Rep. David Young in a party primary next June. \nZaun, a former Urbandale mayor and city councilman, won the GOP nomination for Congress in 2010, losing to then-Democratic Rep. Leonard Boswell in the general election. He ran again in 2014 and received 25 percent of the Republican primary vote, leading a field of six candidates. But the party's nomination was ultimately decided in district convention where Young emerged the victor . \nSince then, Zaun had left the door open for a primary battle against Young, a former top aide to U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. But he told The Des Moines Register he ultimately decided to remain in the Iowa Senate, where he has served 11 years.

Republicans have a great opportunity to gain a majority in the Iowa Senate in the 2016 elections, he added, and he has concluded it would be best to remain there. \nHe said his priorities in the legislature include education reform, curbing state spending and creating a better environment for businesses to grow. \nMiyoko Hikiji, an Iraq war veteran and author from Urbandale, has announced she will seek the Democratic nomination to oppose Zaun for the state Senate seat. \nMeanwhile, Joe Grandanette of Des Moines, who has run unsuccessfully several times for public office, says he plans to oppose Young in next June's Republican primary. The 3rd District generally covers southwest Iowa, including the Des Moines area and Council Bluffs. \nGrandanette, a retired elementary school physical education teacher, said he is critical of Young for his past support of House Speaker John Boehner, who now plans to resign from the post. Grandanette ran for Congress in 2014 and finished sixth in the GOP primary with less than 2 percent of the vote. 3 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1FICUpK TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:14:34.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
