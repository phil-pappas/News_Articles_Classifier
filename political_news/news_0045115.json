Rouhani has said Iran could complete its part of the deal and see sanctions disappear as soon as one to two months from now, a timeline analysts say is not realistic. Their estimate is closer to six months, according to the Politico article.\nSanctions leveraged against Iran for its support of terrorism and human rights violations will continue, according to a White House fact sheet.\nAs the two countries begin to implement the deal, Secretary of State John Kerry said it's important for the U.S. and its partners to remain vigilant and work together.\n\"The Middle East remains a deeply troubled place but every problem in the region would be made much worse if Iran had or was close to obtaining a nuclear weapon. The Iran agreement is the best way to ensure that this possibility is foreclosed now and for all time,\" Kerry wrote in an op-ed Saturday on Medium .\nIf there are any conflicts in the region as Iran begins to implement the deal, the U.S. may be caught short-handed. The carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt left the region earlier this week, meaning that the U.S. will not have a months-long gap with no aircraft carrier in the Middle East, The Hill reported .\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Ukrainian president warns Russia violence could spread \"Fourth, maybe, I don't know, Afghanistan. Nobody knows where the Russian ... soldiers can appear,\" he said.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/18/15 11:12 AM Earlier this week, Iran tested a new long-range ballistic missile in an action that violates U.N. resolutions, but does not violate the nuclear deal. The missile, named \"Emad,\" or Pillar, has a claimed range of about 1,000 miles.\nThe U.S. is raising the test as an issue with the U.N., but is still operating under the assumption that Iran will abide by its commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\"In contrast to the repeated violations of the U.N. Security Council resolution that pertains to their ballistic missile activities, we've seen that Iran over the last couple of years has demonstrated a track record of abiding by the commitments that they made in the context of the nuclear talks,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\nMany Republicans in Congress disapprove of the nuclear deal, saying that it does not go far enough to stop nuclear proliferation or allow for outside verification that Iran, who many say can not be trusted, is sticking to its end of the deal.\nThe House passed a bill earlier this month that would prohibit President Obama from lifting the sanctions, just one of several initiatives on Capitol Hill designed to stop the deal. All, ultimately, failed to stop the deal from going into effect.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Jeb still livid about Trump 9/11 comments \"He kept us safe and united the country. There's no denying that,\" Bush said.\nBy Curt Mills • 10/18/15 10:41 AM Some Democrats in Congress sided with Republicans in their criticism of the deal, but others said that the compromise is the best pathway right now to block Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\"This agreement will substantially constrain the Iranian nuclear program for its duration, and compared with all realistic alternatives, it is the best option available to us at this time,\" Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn., said in a lengthy statement earlier this year explaining his vote supporting the deal.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:59:52.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
