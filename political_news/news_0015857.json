No City Council incumbent has lost a re-election bid since 1992. Fritz defeated a strong challenger, then-state Rep. Mary Nolan, in the November 2012 runoff. \nIf she runs, Stahancyk said her top priority will be government transparency. \n\"I'm terribly concerned in the lack of transparency,\" she said, a worry that applies to \"the entire organization\" and not specifically to Fritz. \nStahancyk opened her law firm in 1986 and has represented former U.S. Rep. David Wu and Stimson Lumber chief executive Andrew Miller in divorce cases. A former columnist for The Oregonian wrote in 2005 that she all but wrote the legal playbook for \"bone-crushing, blood-squeezing (and) making big boys cry.\" \nStahancyk maintains an active civic calendar and is known for her boosterism at Lincoln High School and Portland State University. Stahancyk said she's always been interested in elected office and is prepared to step away from her firm if she wins a council seat. \nA summer event at Duniway Park, near her law office, got Stahancyk thinking about a political future. Stahancyk said big events at the park, with no notice to neighbors, made parking an issue. She wanted to help by opening her parking lot. \nStahancyk said she tried to reach Fritz, who oversees Portland Parks & Recreation, while Fritz was on vacation in August. Stahancyk said she was told Fritz's calendar was booked until Oct. 1. That day, the two spoke by phone. \n\"I thought in this case, that her actions running her bureaus suggested to me that she was not listening,\" she said. \nFritz said Stahancyk made \"some really great suggestions\" during their conversation about how to address parking and improve neighborhood communications. But Stahancyk remained frustrated with the situation, Fritz said, and at one point said: \"Well, maybe I'll just run against you.\" \n\"It didn't sound like she was serious,\" Fritz said. \nNow that she is serious? \"It's a democracy and nobody has a right to re-election,\" Fritz said. \"I am proud of my record and am hoping people will vote for me.\" \nStahancyk is a registered Democrat but gave $5,000 to Republican Chris Dudley during his 2010 gubernatorial bid. She also contributed $250 to Tom Hughes during his run for Metro president in 2010, $250 to Democratic state Sen. Betsy Johnson in 2013 and $500 to Multnomah County Commissioner Loretta Smith in 2014. Her firm also kicked in $600 toward Charlie Hales' Portland mayoral campaign in 2012. \nStahancyk, who lives in Northwest Portland, said she has a rule in her family: If you do something, expect to win, and when you win, do a better job than anyone expects you to do. \n\"As I look at this,\" she said, \"I will not run unless I'm convinced that I'm in a position to be able to do that.\" \n-- Brad Schmidt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:54:13.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
