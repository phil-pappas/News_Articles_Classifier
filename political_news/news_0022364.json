We said months ago that the two-year wait for a plan is far too long and the Minister has placed the issue on low priority. \n\"As we said in August, the National Governmentâ€™s policies and short term damage control are causing frustration and forcing more people into a life on the streets. Of course there are going to be more security problems at WINZ offices,\" says Mr Ball. \n\"The government needs to get its security right and implement all recommendations of the WINZ security review now - a two-year wait is too long.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:02:12.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
