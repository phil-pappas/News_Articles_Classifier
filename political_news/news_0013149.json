Through two half-day building sessions, 18 Just Energy staff members volunteered in the construction to help build a safe and suitable home for a local family-in-need.\nHabitat homes help families avoid making impossible choices between rent and other basic necessities by providing them with an affordable home, as well as no-interest mortgage payments. This enables low-income families to build assets, reduce their dependence on other forms of social assistance and ensure other important needs are met including childcare, transportation, groceries, medical and dental expenses and more.\n\"We are honored to provide further support to Habitat for Humanity through a local Build Day project,\" says Deb Merril , Just Energy's co-Chief Executive Officer. \"With our contribution to the organization, we can help ensure that some of our most vulnerable residents receive the assistance they need to secure a safe and nurturing environment. Supporting our communities is extremely important to us and our staff members also share our belief in leading change to help ensure our neighbors have a safe and healthy place to live.\"\nTogether with more than 1,400 local affiliates in the United States and more than 70 national organizations around the world, the organization has helped more than 1 million families - representing 5 million people - improve their living conditions since 1976.\nAbout Just Energy Foundation\nThe Just Energy Foundation was established in 2013 by Just Energy Group Inc. to help registered Canadian and U.S. charitable organizations secure the resources required to promote the health and well-being of communities in need. Funded entirely by Just Energy, the Foundation invests in local programs that work to enhance the quality of life in Just Energy's operating markets towards building stronger and supportive communities.
