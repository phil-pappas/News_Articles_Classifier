He ignored this advice and ploughed on with his own agenda. \n\"Michael Woodhouse was also warned the industry data he was using for his high risk list was unreliable. \n\"Despite these red flags, the Minister chose not to correct his list before publicly releasing the categories. \n\"He then had the audacity to claim he didn’t know his special list would have such ridiculous classification outcomes. \n\"Michael Woodhouse He can’t worm his way out of this. He will be forever ridiculed as the Minister who made killer worm farms safer but failed to protect people working in some of New Zealand's most dangerous industries,\" Iain Lees-Galloway says. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
