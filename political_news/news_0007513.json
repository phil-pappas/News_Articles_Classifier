Related content \nMr Bryant said the judgment had resulted in an ``ambiguity'' which needed to be cleared up urgently, adding it had also cast doubt on the protections supposedly afforded by the convention. \nHe told MPs: \"To all intents and purposes, it means that the Wilson doctrine is dead.\" \nEarlier, the Labour frontbencher told the Commons: \"The right of members of this House to be able to represent their constituents without fear or favour is intrinsic to our democracy. \n\"It is the cornerstone of the bill of rights and it is one of the most ancient freedoms of this country. \n\"In another era, before the existence of telephones and emails it meant that MPs and peers, even in war, had a right for their written correspondence not to be intercepted or be interfered with.\" \nHe said that since 1966 politicians had relied on the words of then prime minister Harold Wilson to prevent the tapping of their communications. \nConcluding his application, Mr Bryant criticised ministers for failing to offer assurances over the protections MPs have. \nHe said: \"Serious questions remain. Firstly, is the Wilson doctrine still in operation in any meaningful sense whatsoever? \n\"Secondly, have parliamentarians' communications been deliberately targeted? \n\"Thirdly, if so has this been on the authority of a minister, a secretary of state, or anyone else? \n\"This is an urgent matter and it needs consideration.\" \nCommons Speaker John Bercow said he was satisfied the issue raised should be put to a vote. \nLabour MPs stood up to vote in favour of the application – in line with what is required under standing order 24 – while Conservative MPs could also be heard shouting their support. \nGreen Party MP Caroline Lucas, Baroness Jones of Moulsecoomb and former MP George Galloway made the complaint to the IPT. \nLawyers alleged that the politicians' communications are being intercepted by GCHQ as part of the Tempora programme, which monitors and collates on a blanket basis the full range of electronic communications data produced in, or transiting through, the UK and other countries. \nOn Wedneday, the IPT declared the doctrine applies only to targeted, and not incidental, interception of Parliamentary communications, but that it has no legal effect, save that in practice the Security and Intelligence Agencies must comply with their own guidance. \nIts president, Mr Justice Burton said the IPT was satisfied that the doctrine was not enforceable in English law by the claimants or other MPs or peers by way of legitimate expectation. \nThe Wilson doctrine outlined the policy of no tapping of the phones of MPs or members of the House of Lords, unless there is a major national emergency, and that any changes to the policy will be reported by the prime minister to Parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:35:21.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
