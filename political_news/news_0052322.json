Your Right to Know Justices vote against transparency in 62% of cases By John Futty The Columbus Dispatch • Monday October 26, 2015 5:25 AM \nAn incumbent judge, an appointed judge and two magistrates are among the candidates vying for three contested seats on the Franklin County Municipal Court in the November election. \nSeven incumbent judges are unopposed in their bids for re-election. \nMunicipal Court judges, who are paid $119,800 a year, handle traffic cases and nontraffic misdemeanors, plus civil cases involving less than $15,000. \nAlthough judicial races in Ohio general elections are nonpartisan, with no party affiliations listed on the ballot, the parties endorse and campaign for candidates. In each of the races on the Nov. 3 ballot, the candidates are touting their experience. >> Dispatch Voters Guide: Check out a sample ballot customized to your residence \nCarrie Glaeden, a Republican, is the only incumbent facing opposition. A Municipal Court judge since 2004, she is being challenged by Democrat Cynthia Ebner, a Columbus lawyer, for a six-year term. \nGlaeden, 51, worked in the Columbus city attorney’s office, as deputy chief legal counsel for the governor’s office and for the Ohio attorney general before becoming a judge. \n“I have almost 12 years of experience on the bench,” she said. “I think I’m fair and impartial. I listen to the facts and apply the law to the facts.” \nEbner, 49, said her 20 years of handling criminal-defense and civil cases in Municipal, Common Pleas and Juvenile courts have prepared her for being a judge. \n“I understand both sides of the issues,” she said. “I believe in being smart on crime, not just tough.” \nSean McCarthy was appointed by the governor three months ago to a seat vacated by David Young, who was elected to a Common Pleas judgeship. McCarthy, a Republican, is facing Cindi Morehart, a Democrat and a Juvenile Court magistrate, for the right to complete a term that expires in January 2018. \nMcCarthy, 46, was appointed to the Municipal Court job after filling a vacancy as a Common Pleas judge for 3 1/2 months. He was an assistant county prosecutor for 12 years and was a member of the Army National Guard who did a tour of duty in Afghanistan. \n“I think my record shows I’m really committed to public service,” McCarthy said. \nBut Morehart, 61, appointed to her magistrate’s position in 2002, calls herself the more experienced candidate. She spent the previous decade in the city attorney’s office and the county prosecutor’s office. \n“I’ve had years of experience on the (Juvenile Court) bench, handling a civil docket and a criminal docket, and dealing with a lot of the same people I’ll deal with in Municipal Court,” she said. \nThree candidates are competing for a seat being vacated by the retirement of Judge Anne Taylor: Republican Tony Paat, a Municipal Court magistrate; Democrat Eileen Paley, a Columbus City Council member; and Green Party candidate Eddie Pfau, a Columbus lawyer. The winner will get a six-year term. \nPaat, 52, became a Municipal Court magistrate in 1994 after six years as an assistant county prosecutor. \n“My biggest strong point is my experience in Municipal Court,” he said. “I’ve tried cases as a prosecutor, and I’ve decided cases as a magistrate.” \nPaley, 52, a city council member since 2009, said her legislative experience would allow her to bring a unique perspective to the bench. \n“I have a lot more experience in the community, dealing with people and the issues” that bring people to court, she said. “I’m out every day in the community, not just at election time.” \nPfau, 52, said his 24 years as a trial attorney make him the most qualified of the three candidates seeking the opening. \n“I’ve had more trials than both of my opponents combined,” he said. “And I’m an outsider. ... I’m beholden to no one.” \nThe Columbus Bar Association has weighed in on the races with a poll of its members. The 625 respondents preferred Glaeden over Ebner, 80 percent to 20 percent; McCarthy over Morehart, 62 percent to 38 percent; and gave Paat 83 percent of the vote to 15 percent for Paley and 3 percent for Pfau. \nEvery year, those who do poorly in the bar association poll question how reliable it is, given the relatively small number or respondents. This year, more than 7,000 licensed lawyers in Franklin County received email ballots. \nJill Snipcher McQuain, executive director of the bar association, said that the number of respondents shows that lawyers are following the polls’ instruction to abstain from voting if they don’t have sufficient current knowledge or information about the candidates. \nAdditional information on the candidates is available at dispatch.com/votersguide .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:09:23.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
