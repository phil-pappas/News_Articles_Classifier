In part because voters so consistently favor confident candidates, those seeking office know that they need to express confidence,\" says Moore. \"In particular, they know they need to express more confidence than their rivals for office. The result is often excessively bold claims of what they will achieve in office and how sure they are that they know what to do. But when they are elected, then cannot help but disappoint.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:16:12.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
