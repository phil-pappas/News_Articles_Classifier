The Cubs first baseman quickly got the ball over to third base for the force out. With Harvey still running down the line, Bryant fumbled the ball, unable to turn the double play.\nWhile the Cubs did get the lead runner, it kept the inning alive for leadoff hitter Curtis Granderson. The Mets outfielder flipped a ball into center field, bringing home Juan Lagaras.\n#Chicago on Chicago crime. #NLCS pic.twitter.com/HMi9cufWxi\nâ€” Matthew Schwerha (@MSchwerha) October 18, 2015\nThe Mets would only get one run in the inning, but it was enough to regain the lead. New York scored first in the first inning off of a Daniel Murphy Home Run.\nThe game was briefly tied after a Starlin Castro double brought home Anthony Rizzo.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MSchwerha/status/655558418330210304", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Chicago?src=hash", "http://t.co/HMi9cufWxi", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NLCS?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-18T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:51:36.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
