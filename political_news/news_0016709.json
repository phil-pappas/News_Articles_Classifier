Jeff Davis. In a statement last Friday, MSF said that “the unannounced and forced entry damaged the gate to the property, potentially destroyed evidence, and caused stress and fear for the MSF team that had arrived earlier in the day to visit the hospital.”\nGerman FM calls on Arab Gulf states to aid refugees [DW]\n\"Of course we expect the region here in the Arabian Gulf to participate in humanitarian services for refugees,\" Steinmeier said during a press conference in Saudi Arabia.\"According to UN figures, Saudi Arabia hosts 561 refugees and 100 asylum seekers as of December 2014. However, Riyadh provided the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) more than $92 million (81.3 million euros) last year.\"\nU.S. Said to Approve $11 Billion Saudi Buy of Littoral Ships [Bloomberg]\n\"U.S. military aid to the Gulf nations is limited by legislation requiring that the U.S. maintain Israel’s qualitative military superiority over its Mideast neighbors, blocking the sale of cutting-edge weapons such as the F-35 fighter jet. But the ships sold to the Saudis will be the first major export of a new, U.S.-built surface naval vessel in years, the U.S. official said.\"\nSyrian Film Collective Offers View of Life Behind a Conflict [New York Times]\n\"In 11 short videos posted online, Abounaddara, an anonymous group of self-taught and provocative filmmakers, shared interviews with players on a national squad. “In the team, there are opponents and supporters of the regime,” one says. “If you’re with the opposition, it’s best not to talk. But I can’t. I’d suffocate.” Each video begins with a shot of the teammates kicking around the ball, and then a group chant: “Free Syria!”\nNepali farmers get renewable supply of ‘green’ fertilizer [Climate News Network]\n\"For centuries, Nepalese farmers have been mixing the dung and urine of their buffaloes, cows and goats with vegetable compost to make solid manure. But scientists and agricultural development experts have now helped eight “climate-smart” villages in the foothills of the Himalayas to make liquid variants of this traditional organic fertilizer. Special mixes of dung, urine, water and additives – including leaves from trees in local woods – have been developed over the past two years to help fix nitrogen and other important plant nutrients into the soil. The bio-fertilizers are collectively known as “jholmol”.\nThank you for reading @TheNewsNomad.Please feel free to forward the newsletter to anyone who might be interested in flying below the radar.Past Issues\nOriginal Artwork and WritingCopyright © 2015 James Porteous + ClipperMedia", "external_links": ["https://clippermedia.wordpress.com/", "http://www.dw.com/en/foreign-minister-frank-walter-steinmeier-calls-on-arab-gulf-states-to-aid-refugees/a-18791027?maca=en-newsletter_en_Newsline-2356-html-newsletter", "http://www.ryot.org/author/james-porteous", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/168/326_541x298_461675870_541x298.jpg", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/movies/syrian-film-collective-offers-view-of-life-behind-a-conflict.html?_r=0", "http://climatenewsnetwork.net/nepali-farmers-get-renewable-supply-of-green-fertilizer/?utm_source=Climate+News+Network&utm_campaign=5cd7a57bcf-Nepal_s_green_fertilizer10_20_2015&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_1198ea8936-5cd7a57bcf-38799173", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/168/328_800x400_185746302_800x400.jpg", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/168/324_1900x1426_563203854_900x675.jpg", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/168/317_700x394_449329812_700x394.jpg", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/168/306_600x400_514683349_600x400.jpg", "http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/10/19/us-takes-blame-for-plowing-through-gate-bombed-afghan-hospital.html", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-20/u-s-said-to-approve-saudis-buying-11-billion-in-littoral-ships"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:31:39.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
