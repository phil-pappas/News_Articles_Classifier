The protesters included members from several leftist political groups including the Karama Party and the Socialist Popular Alliance Party. They chanted anti-Israel slogans and condemned the 1977 Camp David Treaty between Egypt and Israel. They also described Palestinian protests in the occupied territories as a \"third intifada.\" Veteran activist Kamal Khalil, renowned for his support of the Palestinian cause, along with other demonstrators called for the cancelation of the Egyptian protest law. \"If it wasn't for the protest law millions would have hit the streets and gathered in squares to show support for Palestinians,\" Khalil told Ahram Online. On Tuesday, the deputy secretary-general of the Arab League, Ahmed Bin Hali called for international protection of Palestinians and said it had become a necessity. Egypt, which has recently won a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, vowed to make Palestine a 'top priority' on its UN agenda. Israel has killed at least 40 Palestinians in Jerusalem and the Palestinian occupied territories in October. Tel Aviv has cracked down on Palestinians angered by Israeli attacks on Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and continued illegal Israeli settlement policies Seven Israelis have also been killed. A larger rally is scheduled to take place on Sunday, organised by the Journalists Syndicate and BDS Egypt, in support of Palestine and to protest the violations of the Israeli occupation forces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:03:53.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
