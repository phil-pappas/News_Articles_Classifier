It added that the classroom density rate in private schools has reached 32 students per classroom compared to 44 in public schools.\nNet enrolment in primary education has declined from 95.4 percent in 2010/11 to 90.6 percent in 2013/14.\nOn the other hand, net enrolment in preparatory education has improved with an average of about 82.1 percent over the years 2010/11 to 2014/15.\nThe report concluded that Egypt is unlikely to realise the MDG targets in universal primary education.\nIn 2000, the UN issued the Millennium Declaration adopted by 189 member states, including Egypt, and more than 20 international organisations aiming to achieve the minimum level of development by 2015 through the adoption of the MDGs.\nThe MDGs include eight key goals: the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger; the achievement of universal primary education; the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women; the reduction of child mortality; the improvement of maternal health; the combating of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; the ensuring of environmental sustainability; and the establishment of a global partnership for development.\nAlthough Egypt is still far from achieving many of the MDGs, especially those concerning poverty and universal primary education, it has achieved some goals including reducing death rates associated with malaria, promoting an equal ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education and reducing the mortality rate of children under five-years-old.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:19:08.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
