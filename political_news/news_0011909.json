Papelbon recently closed on a brick colonial in the upscale Alexandria neighborhood of Belle Haven; the sale was private, according to sources familiar with the deal, as the home wasn’t listed. Papelbon and his wife, Ashley , scooped up the five-bedroom house on Belle Haven Road for $2.9 million, which sounds like a lot, but considering he sold his last place in Philadelphia for a reported $6.2 million, it’s a steal. In July, in anticipation of being traded from the Philadelphia Phillies after three seasons, Papelbon sold his 4,200-square-foot penthouse in the trendy Rittenhouse Square area of the city, according to real estate website Redfin. The Philadelphia abode came on the heels of Papelbon’s 2011 sale of a $3.1 million, 2,500 square foot penthouse in Boston, where he spent seven seasons playing for the Red Sox. (Papelbon, a Louisiana native, apparently likes top-notch neighborhoods; his Boston house was located on the city’s iconic Beacon Street.)\nStory Continued Below\nAs for his newest residence, which neighbors say Papelbon and his wife have moved into with their two young children, Parker and Gunner, that’s still up in the air as the Nats’ tumultuous pitcher sits out the rest of the season with a forced suspension resulting from two separate incidents. While rumor has it the Nationals’ front office wants to unload the hotheaded closer, they might have to eat $11 million of Papelbon’s salary to do so.\nIf all else fails and Papelbon’s tour of the East Coast’s finest real estate comes to an end, he and Ashley, who were college sweethearts and married in 2005, can always retire to their primary family compound in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, her hometown.\nA representative for the Nationals did not return a request for comment from Papelbon.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:03:51.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
