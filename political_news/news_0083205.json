Uber, Lyft should operate here, most say Rochester Business Journal October 9, 2015 \nNine out of 10 respondents to this week’s RBJ Daily Report Snap Poll say Albany should enact legislation to allow Uber and Lyft to operate in Upstate New York. People can book rides with Uber and Lyft in dozens of cities nationwide, but not in Upstate New York because of a state law that creates a barrier for the ride-sharing services outside of New York City. In 2014, Lyft tried to launch operations in Rochester and Buffalo, but shut down after state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued the company, alleging it violated the law by failing to require its drivers to hold commercial licenses, obtain adequate insurance, or comply with local for-hire licensing rules. This summer Lyft settled with the attorney general’s office, agreeing to pay $300,000 in penalties. Legislation has been introduced in Albany to amend New York’s insurance law to allow ride-sharing services—also known as transportation network companies—to set up shop. They still would need to reach agreements with local governments or taxi commissions. Meanwhile, Uber also is fighting on another front: A federal judge in California has granted class-action status to a lawsuit claiming the firm misclassifies its drivers as independent contract workers and should be forced to treat them as employees entitled to health insurance, workers’ compensation and reimbursed work expenses. Those following the case say it could have broad implications for other startups in the “sharing economy.” More than three-quarters of Snap Poll respondents say drivers for ride-sharing services should be classified as independent contractors rather than employees. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to cap Uber’s growth, but the number of Uber drivers in the city has almost doubled in the past year, growing to nearly 20,000. Roughly 650 readers participated in this week’s poll, conducted Oct. 5 and 6. Should Albany enact legislation to allow Uber and Lyft to operate in Upstate New York? Yes: 90% In your view, how should drivers for ride-sharing services be classified?
