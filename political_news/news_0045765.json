Representatives for daily and periodical press galleries in the Capitol protested Monday that the media \"should not be charged to cover elected officials at an event of enormous interest to the public.\"\nThe four-day event will be held in Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena.\n\"We are concerned that the proposed fee smacks of forcing the press to pay for news gathering,\" said Heather Rothman, chairwoman of the Executive Committee of Periodical Correspondents, and Jonathan D. Salant, chairman of the Standing Committee of Correspondents. \"We urge the (GOP convention committee) to follow the precedent of previous conventions of both parties and drop plans for an access fee so the press can continue to inform the public about a major news event.\"\nThe national committee says the $150 charge covers a fraction of the $750-per-seat construction cost. Television networks generally cover the cost of constructing their skyboxes.\nThe press organizations are responsible for credentialing media covering Capitol Hill, and staff aides in the congressional press galleries have run the press stand at both the Democratic and Republican conventions for decades, in part to prevent the political parties from playing favorites.\nA spokesman for the Republican National Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
