And the candidates were showing their fire. \n10 News political reporter and anchor Mark Rivera sat down with political expert Dr. Lars Hafner to analyze the big moments from the debate: \nMark Rivera : Let’s start with one of the big moments that had everybody in this debate on their feet tonight. \n“That the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!” Senator Bernie Sanders said to smiles and a handshake from Hillary Clinton and a standing ovation from the crowd. \nLars Hafner : What this did was energize the Democrats to say it’s a Republican conspiracy against them with the Benghazi committee and it played to the message of what Democrats want to get out there. \nMark Rivera: So who stood out as a winner of the debate? \nLars: Secretary Clinton came out swinging in terms of back and forth even when it wasn’t her turn. \n“This has gone on too long, and it’s time the entire country stood up against the NRA,” Clinton said. \nLars: but as it got more indepth with the policy some of the other candidates came along too, such as Governor Martin O’Malley, especially on the gun debate. \n“It’s time to stand up and pass comprehensive gun safety legislation as a nation,” O’Malley said. \nMark: After Hillary Clinton’s performance, where does this leave Joe Biden? Could he still step into the race? \nLars: She was very strong and her debate skills came through loud and clear tonight. That can have two impacts on Joe Biden. One, he could think, “man it’d be fun to be in there and mix it up.” But number two is, “can he overcome her? And how will that damage his legacy if he’s not able to do that? Vice President Biden may wait until after the Benghazi hearing to see how she performs in that particular setting but if she comes away with that pretty good, I really doubt the Vice President will make a run.
