(AP) - The head of Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette responded to questions from Republican state representatives about the collection of tissue after abortions. \nCEO Stacy Cross says in a letter obtained by the Statesman Journal that the center is reimbursed for expenses, but does not profit from voluntary placental tissue collection. She said it offers women receiving abortions the option to donate tissue to two studies being conducted at Oregon Health and Science University. \nOne study is researching how to prevent ectopic pregnancy and the other is researching health risks related to poor placental blood flow. \nOHSU, meanwhile, said it paid the center $11,500 for use of an exam room, storage and access to an ultrasound machine. It also paid a study coordinator $22 an hour to manage patient consent and up to $2,500 for medical supplies. \nThe representatives submitted questions to Planned Parenthood and OHSU after they were stopped by Democrats from holding a public hearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:33:31.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
