However, he later entered politics and is now a government minister.\nFollowing Mr Watson's statement, police obtained the files from Metropolitan Police archive and examined them for evidence of any offences.\nIn December 2012 the police emails seen by the BBC concluded there was \"no evidence of offending linked to [the minister] held within the files\".\nThey went on: \"There is not any further material in the file to support the inference to any level of criminal complicity on behalf of [the minister].\"\nAbuse convictions This conclusion has never been made public. The Metropolitan Police had said in a statement that it did not publish an announcement on every allegation it investigated, adding that it was \"checking records to ascertain the circumstances of the allegation\".\nThe files on which Mr Watson based his Commons statement were seized as part of an investigation into the paedophile ring and centred on senior social worker Peter Righton in the early 1990s.\nMr Watson was briefed on their content, before making his statement, by Peter McKelvie, a former child protection manager who has described himself as a \"whistleblower\".\nMr McKelvie has told the BBC he did not claim to Mr Watson that there had been a \"Westminster paedophile ring\".\nHe also pointed out that the police investigations which followed the Commons statement had led to convictions of two men who were part of the original paedophile ring.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/99C3/production/_86136393_86136390.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:06:06.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
