This week, Cherwell District Council's executive committee agreed to explore the possibility of more local transfer stations to receive household waste plus the provision of the new depot and HWRC. Councillors supported the proposals in a bid to increase recycling levels across the district, tackle the risk of increased flytips and reduce the threat of increased waste disposal costs in the future. Cllr Debbie Pickford, Cherwell's lead member for clean and green, said: 'There are a lot of changes being proposed both locally and nationally to the way in which household waste is collected, sorted and recycled and this could impact on costs to the council and the availability of services to residents. At the moment, these changes are only at the stage of being discussed but should they go ahead, we want to be in a position to proceed in a way which is the most affordable and convenient to our residents. 'We already know for certain that as Bicester grows we will need to expand our depot facilities so this creates a great starting point for us to consider what other facilities this site could offer in response to these changes. All of these proposals are still a long way off from being implemented - if at all - but this allows us the time to prepare and be ready should we need to address them in the future.' Among the options being explored is the provision of a HMRC at the new Bicester depot in place of the facilities at Ardley, which Oxfordshire Council is proposing to close due to budget constraints. Currently this represents the only centre in the south of the district, with the only other site based at Alkerton and this has raised concerns that it could lead to a rise in flytips from residents who are unprepared to travel elsewhere. Another option being considered to address the possible loss of the facilities at Ardley is a review of the council's bulky waste collection service which currently charges residents £16 to remove up to three items of furniture or white goods from household doorsteps. Elsewhere councillors agreed to further research the provision of a local Materials Recovery Centre in a bid to reduce council expenditure. Currently Cherwell transfers recyclable items from household blue bins to Helmdon Transfer Station where it is loaded onto larger lorries belonging to UPM and transported 155 miles to Shotton in Wales for sorting. The existing transport costs lie with UPM but if proposed changes go ahead, Cherwell could be liable for future costs upon the contract ending in 2018. This represents an expenditure of £300,000 - £400-000 per annum for Cherwell and South Northamptonshire Councils' shared recycling service. However by creating a local centre, this could generate significant savings. Since introducing its current waste and recycling service in 2009, recycling rates across Cherwell have remained in the range of 54 - 57 per cent. However although initiatives such as kerbside battery recycling and increased recycling banks have increased volumes of recycling, lightweight packaging means the collected weights have reduced. distributed by This content was issued by Cherwell District Council on the 2015-10-08 and was initially posted on www.cherwell.gov.uk.
