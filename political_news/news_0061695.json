Joe Heck over staff email \nTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS Published: 10/22/15 9:31 pm EDT - Updated: 10/22/15 9:32 pm EDT \nCARSON CITY, Nevada â€” The Nevada Democratic Party is accusing Republican Rep. Joe Heck 's staff of misusing an official email account. \nThe party filed a complaint Thursday with the Office of Congressional Ethics, alleging that a member of Heck's congressional staff used an official House account to invite people to an event earlier this month hosted by Main Street Advocacy. \nThe group promotes moderate conservative ideas. The event, geared toward female voters, featured two Republican congresswomen. \nDemocrats say the email violated ethics rules barring use of congressional resources for outside entities. \nA Heck spokesman called the complaint a political stunt and said the office is careful to follow the rules. \nThe move comes as Heck faces Democratic former Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto in a competitive race for retiring Harry Reid 's Senate seat. \nThink your friends should see this?
