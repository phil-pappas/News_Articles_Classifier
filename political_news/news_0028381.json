Bobby Jindal; former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; former New York Gov. George Pataki; and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. Those candidates met the minimum threshold of 1 percent in at least one national poll.\nThe prime-time debate at 6 p.m. will feature businessman and reality show star Donald Trump; physician Ben Carson; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush; former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Carly Fiorina; Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Those candidates had an average of at least 3 percent in a pool of national polls selected by the network.\nThe candidates will discuss job growth, taxes, technology, retirement, and the health of the nation's economy in a debate titled \"Your Money, Your Vote: The Republican Presidential Debate.\"\nAdvertisement CNBC's Carl Quintanilla, a CU alumnus and co-anchor of \"Squawk on the Street\" and \"Squawk Alley,\" Becky Quick, co-anchor of \"Squawk Box,\" and John Harwood, the network's chief Washington correspondent, will serve as moderators.\nAnother CU graduate, Joe Kernen, will co-host special programming leading up to the debates.\nRoughly 1,000 people will get to attend the debate at the Coors Event Center, including 100 people from CU. Students on campus became frustrated this month when they learned about the limited number of seats available to them and are organizing their own interactive broadcast of the debate.\nThe students are joining with BeHeard, a nonprofit news organization, in front of the University Club on campus for a live broadcast and discussion starting at 3 p.m. the day of the debate.\nThe campus is also hosting a student-centric watch party inside the University Memorial Center's Glenn Miller Ballroom, which begins at 4:45 p.m. CU Student Government is also launching a social media campaign to give students more of a voice in the debate, using the hashtag #BeHeardCU.\n\"We know that's a big thing, that students just want to feel like they're getting a voice in this debate,\" said Katie Haas, director of multimedia for student government. \"We think that it's a way that students can ask their questions of candidates, even if it's just within the social media realm.\"\nIn Denver on Thursday, the left-leaning group ProgressNow Colorado plans to deliver a petition with some 1,300 signatures to CU President Bruce Benson's office. The group is calling on the Republican National Committee and CNBC to make 50 percent of the tickets available to CU students.\n\"For two months, we have been calling for CU students who want to attend the GOP presidential debate to be allowed in,\" said executive director Amy Runyon-Harms. \"Debate organizers could easily accommodate them simply making available a small percentage of more than 10,000 empty seats in the Coors Events Center.\"\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/sarahkuta", "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28879339/outcry-from-cu-boulder-students-about-limited-seating"], "published": "2015-10-21T11:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:24:40.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
