The approved amount is expected to reach THB40-50bn by the end of Oct and the entire THB100bn will be approved by end 2015, president Chatchai Payuhanaveechai said. Under the scheme, state-controlled bank extends the soft loans to commercial and other state-run banks at 0.1% interest, which they relend to SMEs at 4% rate. The rapid loan approvals bode well for SMEs floundering amid the lacklustre economy and weak purchasing power without the scheme, SMEs would have struggled to get fresh loans to help with liquidity as banks have become reluctant to lend to them for fearing higher bad loans. Even SMEs whose debt had already been restructured are able to borrow the soft loans, as the Finance Ministry hopes their debt could turn back to performing loans after they receive the loans, and this could ease the banks’ non-performing loans.
