He labeled them as “hard to believe” and that the Russian President is “double-tongued” when he addressed the UN.\nPoroshenko warned UN representatives on Wednesday, September 30, that Russian promises regarding an anti-terrorism coalition should not be trusted.\n“Cool story, but really hard to believe.”\nHe said that Putin is better at inspiring terrorism rather than actually stopping it. He added:\n“How can you urge an anti terrorist coalition if you inspire terrorism right in front of your door? How can you talk peace and legitimacy if your policy is war via puppet government?”\nEven if the Ukrainian President never mentioned Putin’s name, the Ukrainian leader made sure to point out the hypocrisy coming from the Russian leader’s speech. Furthermore, Poroshenko has also accused Russia of getting involved in arming and aiding Ukrainian rebels fighting the internationally recognized Kiev government.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UTmfzEBAok?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-10-01T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:52:03.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
