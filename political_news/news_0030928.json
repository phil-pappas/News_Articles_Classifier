Hopefully that's what people will think.\" \nMorrow began serving the city of Marion 19 years ago, first as a dispatcher and two years later as a police officer. She'll officially become assistant chief on Saturday. \nThe opening was created because the current assistant chief, Dan Byrne, is retiring. At a celebration at City Hall Monday, Byrne told Mayor Bob Butler that he was only two-months-old when Butler first began leading the city. Now, that young constituent has reached retirement age. \nChief Tondini called Morrow her \"primary choice\" to fill Byrne's position. \n\"She's good with people, very articulate,\" said Tondini. \nCommissioners spent much of the night in executive session, in part because they wanted to discuss Morrow's salary in private. They then went back into open session, announcing Morrow would receive a base salary of $62,000 per year and voting to approve her promotion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:07:55.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
