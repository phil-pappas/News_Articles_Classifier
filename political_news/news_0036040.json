Lyness to be their representative in the Indiana House. \nLyness will fill the unexpired term of former state Rep. Jud McMillin, who resigned last month. \nLyness told the 46 Republican committee members at the Franklin County Government Center that good government is about team work. \n“I’m committed to keeping control at the local level,” Lyness said. “Together we can make a difference. I plan on being visible, accountable and responsible.” \nOther candidates seeking the seat were Dave White of Franklin County and Keith Hall and Robert Hrezo of Dearborn County. \nLyness is a business owner and a graduate of Indiana State University. He has been married for 43 years and has 11 grandchildren. He first ran for the House seat in 2010, losing in the primary election. \n“I got my feet wet, and I met a lot of people,” Lyness said of his first run for office. Rep. Lehman gets McMillin's House leadership job \nDearborn County had 25 precinct committee members at the caucus, Franklin County had 14, and Union County had seven. \nState Republican Party Secretary Barbara McClellan did not reveal the vote tally but said Lyness won by a clear majority. \nThe caucus drew party officials from outside District 68 who wanted to observe because such events don’t often occur, Republican staffer Kristen Williams said. \nMcMillin resigned Sept. 29 after apologizing for a sexually explicit video that was sent via text message from his cellphone. \nIt's unclear who sent the text or how broadly it was distributed. The Brookville Republican sent a separate text message apologizing to his contacts for \"anything offensive\" they might have received after he said he lost control of his cellphone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:04:13.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
