We are always focused in what we do, however. We need to play well and win. We always plan for the best possible version of our opponents.\n[Yannick] Carrasco is developing and every day is more integrated into the team. Hard work pays off and improves the best players. He is young and can continue improving. Criticism makes you grow and try to improve.\nI don't want Atlético to stop improving. Atlético are one of the best teams in Europe – we have to live with this and it's not easy. Astana did well against Benfica and were in the match against Galatasaray until the end. They surprised me with their ambition. They are a compact side who never want to lose a ball and who improve during the match. I think this shows the good work of their coach.\nStanimir Stoilov, Astana coach We feel OK and we're preparing well for this match. We are glad to play against a competitive and high-level team like Atlético. We will try to play well and achieve our objectives; we see this match as an opportunity to play against a team of the highest level. We want to show that we haven't reached this stage by luck. We will try to show our level. I think Atlético could win the UEFA Champions League because they play as a team.\nWe've left eight players in Astana because we have an important match in the Kazakh Premier League [on Sunday]. We have brought 14 players who are able to play top-class football . We won't change our strategy and will play like we did against Galatasaray and Benfica. If Atlético attack we will make an effort in defence. If not, we will try to play more offensively.\nAstana haven't got too much experience in European competition but this match is our chance to get three points. I respect Atlético so much and we'll try to reach the level they play at.\n©UEFA.com\n©AFP/Getty Images\nWeekend results Real Sociedad 0-2 Atlético (Griezmann 9, Ferreira-Carrasco 90+1) Atlético posted their first victory in three Liga outings after being given an early lead by Antoine Griezmann, the French international grabbing his fourth Liga goal this term. Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco struck the second in added time, between a pair of red cards for the hosts, as Diego Simeone 's men moved within two points of the top.\nAstana 2-1 Ordabasy (Malyi og 19, Canas 58; Tungyshbaev 71) Astana climbed to within five points of Kairat Almaty, with four games left to the leaders' three. An own goal by Serhiy Malyi and a second-half effort from Roger Cañas gave Astana victory on a day when Kairat drew. The top two meet next Sunday in what could prove a title decider.\nForm guide (all competitions, most recent first) Atlético : WDLLWW Astana : WWDLDL\nReporter's view: Joseph Walker ( @UEFAcomJoeW ) Simeone will be determined to ensure there is no repeat of matchday two's somewhat surprising home loss to Benfica when they host Astana at the Vicente Calderón. With the visitors and Galatasaray both sitting on a point after the first two games, a victory for Atlético will go a long way to helping them secure a place in the knockout stage.\nDid you know?
