I wonder why we can’t value what we have. I wonder why we can’t acknowledge that in Africa, Ghana is number one and among the top five countries,” she stressed. \nMeanwhile, the ruling party will go to the polls on November 7 to elect their parliamentary and Presidential candidates for the 2016 elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:20:17.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
