Not in the hands of responsible gun owners. Not in the hands of CHL holders.”\nThat nuance signals the next phase of the campus carry debate, as UT and other four-year universities start to get a handle on how they will implement the law in fall 2016.\nPublic university presidents can declare parts of campus, but not all of it, off-limits to gun. But it remains an open question of just how much discretion the schools have, given that the law says only that the gun-free zones must be “reasonable.”\nAnd town hall meetings — attended at UT by several dozen students, faculty, staff and graduates — are a critical step that several schools are now taking to gather feedback before making some preliminary recommendations likely by the end of the year.\n“We are here to listen,” said Steven Goode, a law professor who’s leading UT’s campus carry working group.\nExisting state law allows individuals with concealed handgun licenses to carry their firearms onto university grounds. But expanding that right to dorms, classrooms, cafeterias and other public campus buildings was a priority for pro-gun Republicans.\nCampus carry ended up joining open carry as the major gun bills passed this year. Though open carry uses existing concealed carry law as its basis, lawmakers made it so licensed Texans still won’t be able to openly carry handguns on campus.\nCampus carry backers had initially hoped to avoid any opt-out measure for public schools — save for some exceptions, such as sporting events, that are already in the law. Bill author Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, called his legislation a stand for “God-given” rights.\nA handful of attendees on Wednesday outlined their hearty support for campus carry. Among them was Madison Yandell, a student who said the measure would allow her to “have the knowledge that I could protect myself.”\n“I hope that any restrictions put in place will still afford us the right to make choices in the best interest in safety,” said Yandell, president of the campus’s College Republicans chapter.\nThe measure goes into effect for four-year schools in fall 2016; junior colleges get an extra year to prepare.\nPublic colleges and universities across the state have held similar meetings — or plan to in the near future. So across Texas, the campus carry discussion is really just starting in earnest.\n“What I told our committee on the first day that we met was that whether you are for or against campus carry, that ship has sailed,” said Eric Fritsch, a University of North Texas criminal justice professor who is leading his school’s campus carry task force.\nOn Twitter:\n @tombenning", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tombenning"], "published": "2015-10-01T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:16:59.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
