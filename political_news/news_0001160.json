Scott Walker has signed into law a bill that does away with secret John Doe investigations into political misconduct. Related Content Assembly sends bill ending secret investigations to Walker \nWalker signed the bill Friday. \nWalker has been involved in two John Doe investigations, neither of which resulted in him being charged. The most recent probe involved Walker's recall campaign and conservative groups. The state Supreme Court ended the investigation in July, saying there was nothing unconstitutional about the campaign coordination. \nThe Republican-controlled Legislature passed the bill doing away with John Does for any kind of political misconduct, including bribes, theft and campaign finance violations. They could still be used for violent felonies and some drug crimes. \nJohn Does are like a grand jury, but are done before a judge. Witnesses are under gag orders, and prosecutors can compel people to testify. \nCopyright 2015 by Associated Press.
