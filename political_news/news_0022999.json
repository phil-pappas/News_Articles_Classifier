Utter nonsense.\nITV June Sarpong: The Loose Women host is backing the In campaign\n“It is precisely because we are part of Europe that we are stronger and at our best in the world.”\nHe is expected to admit he is “not an uncritical fan of the European Union”.\nBut he will add: “Wanting reform, however, is not the same as wanting to leave.\n\"Make no mistake - I am part of this campaign because I believe that we are stronger, better off and safer inside Europe than we would be out on our own.”\nKarren Brady: The Apprentice star is also backing the In campaign\nHe will hit out at “the quitters” who “risk our prosperity, threaten our safety and diminish our influence in the world” by pushing for withdrawal.\n“To claim that the patriotic course for Britain is to retreat, withdraw and become inward looking is to misunderstand who we are as a nation,” the Tory peer will tell the campaign launch in east London.\n“In this ever changing and very uncertain world we need to engage with strength.\nPA Peter Mandelson: He is a key backer of the campaign\n“I will not allow anyone to tell me I’m any less British because I believe in the strongest possible Britain for business, for our security and our society.”\nJoining him on the Britain Stronger in Europe board are Loose Women host June Sarpong, former Head of the Army Sir Peter Wall and The Apprentice’s Baroness Karren Brady .\nFormer TUC general secretary Sir Brendan Barber, ex-Lib Dem Cabinet Minister Sir Danny Alexander and former Labour Business Secretary Lord Mandelson will also sit on the board, which Lord Rose said “represents the best of Britain”.\nReuters David Cameron: He has four key demands\nIt comes as Downing Street angrily denied claims that four key demands were central to David Cameron ’s Brussels renegotiation.\nThe Sunday Telegraph said they included Britain having an exemption from “ever closer union”; an “explicit statement” that Europe is a “multi-currency” union; power for groups of national parliaments to scrap EU laws; and fresh protections for non-eurozone countries.\nBut a No 10 spokesman said the story was “based on lots of speculation and lots of it is wrong”.\nA source pointed out it “doesn’t even include the welfare changes the PM has repeatedly talked about”.\nPA Nicola Sturgeon: She has warned it could trigger another Scottish referendum\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned that Britain voting to leave the EU could trigger “unstoppable demand” for another independence referendum north of the border.\nScots rejected separation 13 months ago by 55% to 45%.\nBut Ms Sturgeon told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: “If we do see a scenario over the next couple of years where Scotland votes to stay in the EU but we find ourselves being taken out of the EU anyway then that so fundamentally changes the nature of the UK that people voted to stay part of last year, I think it is very likely that we would see rising demand for another referendum.”\nIan Forsyth Out backer: UKIP's Nigel Farage wants Boris Johnson to lead to out campaign\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage suggested Tory London Mayor and MP Boris Johnson could lead the Out campaign.\n“We might just get him and he’s a recognisable figure and that would be good news,” Mr Farage told Sky News.\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://i2.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article5657140.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Business-Secretary-Lord-Peter-Mandelson.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/benglaze", "https://twitter.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-10-12T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:59:13.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
