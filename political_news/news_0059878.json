Our politics should not be life and death one. Ghanaians should take a cue from happenings in countries around us that are war-torn.” \nHe told the congregation that God, in his own wisdom, would choose a leader for the country in the next general elections in 2016. \nHe called on Ghanaians to eschew violence ahead of the 2016 elections because it is God who ordains a leader. \n'Our politics should never be about life and death because God in his own wisdom will choose a leader for us,' \nadding that 'Ghana is the only country that has not suffered civil war. Our nation is favoured and our nation is great.' \nHe challenged the congregation to acquire skills to enable them to benefit from the many resources that abound in the region. \nPresident Mahama said his government would continue to invest in the region since the area contributes significantly to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \nHe urged Christians to support the government in the national development agenda and appealed to the church to preach against social evils that were likely to undermine the growth of the country. \nPresident Mahama mentioned that government was constructing roads and sea defence walls, as well as expanding the ports to create numerous jobs for the teeming youth of the country. \nHe said the Western Region was the next growth pole and urged the people to support the various assemblies to achieve the goal. \nRev Dr Paul Henry Dsane, who is in-charge of the Grace Pentecostal Assemblies of God, preached the sermon. \nFrom Emmanuel Opoku, Takoradi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:04:51.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
