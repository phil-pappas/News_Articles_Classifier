Imagine being approached with these sordid personal attacks in public, and you begin to understand why she and her mother don't often favor being spontaneous or unguarded: \n“Has your mother ever told you that you’re the daughter of Webb Hubbell, and not Bill Clinton,” he said while Chelsea was looking down, signing a copy of “It’s Your World: Get Informed, Get Inspired & Get Going.” \nThe question was in reference to a long-time rumor alleging Chelsea was the result of an affair between the Clinton lawyer and Hillary. \nLooking up, smiling, Chelsea responded, “I am so proud to be my parents’ daughter,” without actually naming her parents. \nThe store staff thanked Morrow, seemingly as a way get him to move on, but obliged another question. \nReferring to Clinton’s book being geared towards kids, Morrow asked, “Would you say Bill Clinton also targets teenage girls, except for sexual reasons?” \n“I would say my book is really resonating with kids,” Clinton responded. “I was at the Ann Richards School earlier today and I’m so grateful that it’s resonating to the young girls and the young boys that I’ve been talking to across the country.” \nThe Clintons have, without a doubt, raised a very smart and self-possessed daughter who's a class act. Too bad she'll have to deal with this kind of right-wing crap for the rest of her life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:32:26.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
