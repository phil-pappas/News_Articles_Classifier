(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nIvanka Trump says she's \"incredibly proud\" of her dad for running for president. But she's more ambivalent about whether she's happy about it. \nTrump's oldest daughter appeared at a Fortune magazine forum on Wednesday. She was asked if she's happy about Donald Trump 's presidential bid. \nShe called that \"a complicated question.\" \nTrump went on to say that as a citizen, she loves what her father is doing. But she added that as a daughter, \"it's obviously more complicated\" because of the intense level of scrutiny her father is facing. \nTrump said her father was changing the dialogue of the presidential race and, in her words, \"disrupting the process in a very positive way.\" \n___ \nThis version corrects the date of the forum to Wednesday.
