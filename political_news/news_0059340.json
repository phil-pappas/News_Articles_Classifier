It later transpired that this includes an NZIER study on the Labour Market Effects of TPP. The Ministry said its release during the negotiations would prejudice New Zealand’s ability to get the best outcome, a rationale which Professor Kelsey notes no longer applies. \nThis request was part of a broader request for eight categories of information, which the Minister refused on a blanket basis. The Minister’s decision is currently subject to judicial review in the High Court. \nHowever, the Chief Ombudsman’s review of the Minister’s decision was a pre-requisite to that judicial review, and she did not form a final opinion about this particular category of information. It was therefore not able to include it in the judicial review proceedings. \nIn her report, the Chief Ombudsman said her investigation of this matter would be ongoing. That was on 27 July. Despite numerous requests, there has been no indication that it has been actively pursued in the ten weeks since then. In light of the conclusion of the negotiations, and the lack of information publicly available, Professor Kelsey has asked the Chief Ombudsman to provide a conclusive response on that category of information by Monday 12 October. \nends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:14:38.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
