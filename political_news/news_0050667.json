The surge came during a summer in which Mrs. Fiorina leapt over more established Republican rivals to become a significant contender for her party’s presidential nomination. Mrs. Fiorina’s total, more than three times what she raised through the end of June, gives her the third-biggest haul of the candidates who are actively raising money and have announced their totals for the quarter, behind Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.

Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, has not yet announced his total for the quarter. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida raised about $6 million and ended the quarter with $11 million in cash on hand. Mrs. Fiorina’s spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores, said on Twitter that the candidate began the fall with $5.5 million in cash on hand.
