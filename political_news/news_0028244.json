FILE PHOTO | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary Following the termination of President Kenyatta’s ICC case, there has been discord in the ruling coalition with leaders from Mr Ruto’s URP accusing their central Kenya counterparts for being insecure in the quest to have the DP’s case terminated. On witnesses, Mr Chepkonga said both Jubilee and Cord were in agreement that some false witnesses were procured to fix Mr Ruto and Mr Sang, and ICC has no option but to terminate the case. Advertisement More by this Author \nLeaders from western Kenya and Rift Valley regions yesterday renewed their calls on President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene in the ongoing case facing his deputy William Ruto and former radio journalist Joshua arap Sang at the ICC. \nThe leaders, among them former Lugari lawmaker Cyrus Jirongo, Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi, Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga and Uasin Gishu Deputy Governor Daniel Chemno, spoke yesterday during a prayer service-cum-fundsdrive at Africa Inland Church-Kiluka, Uasin Gishu. \nThey said Mr Kenyatta holds the key to Mr Ruto’s freedom. \n“As the President of the Republic of Kenya, Mr Kenyatta had access to all intelligent reports pertaining the ICC case which he used to free himself. He should use the same to assist his deputy; unless he holds a grudge against him,” said Mr Jirongo. \nHe added: “You know what needs to be done for Ruto to be free. Rais wacha roho ngumu kama pharaoh (Do not have a heart like the pharaoh’s).” \nMr Jirongo further hit at a section of leaders whom he said were now pretending to be supporting the termination of Mr Ruto’s case yet they have been silent all along. \nREAD: Reveal your role in the Ruto case, Raila challenges Uhuru \nWhen he spoke, Mr Sudi cautioned Jubilee leaders against politicizing the ongoing anti-ICC prayers for Mr Sang and the Deputy President. \n“We cannot talk of who will take which seat in 2017 and 2022 when the ICC cloud is hanging over the heads of our two brothers. \n“We will talk about that when our people are set free and that is our message as Kalenjin leaders,” said Mr Sudi, a close ally to the DP. In the Jubilee Alliance Party pact, the Rift Valley leaders have agreed to support President Kenyatta for two terms and want Mr Ruto to take over from 2022. \nFollowing the termination of President Kenyatta’s ICC case, there has been discord in the ruling coalition with leaders from Mr Ruto’s URP accusing their central Kenya counterparts for being insecure in the quest to have the DP’s case terminated. \nOn witnesses, Mr Chepkonga said both Jubilee and Cord were in agreement that some false witnesses were procured to fix Mr Ruto and Mr Sang, and ICC has no option but to terminate the case. \n“It is becoming evident that the two are implicated unfairly. We cannot seek justice at the expense of two innocent people,” said Mr Chepkonga. \nHe hit out at Cord leader Raila Odinga for giving conditions prior to testifying for Mr Ruto .“He (Raila) was a co-principal to former President Mwai Kibaki and he knows very well what is contained in exhibit 19 and 19A. \n“President Kenyatta was also an ICC suspect and there is no way he could get access to such vital documents,” said Mr Chepkonga. \nMr Chemno urged all witnesses who were coached to implicate the two to confess for the country to move forward. \nHuman rights activist Ken Wafula, who was involved in the protection of witnesses, said the case should be terminated following claims by Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria that some witnesses were coached.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:00:27.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
