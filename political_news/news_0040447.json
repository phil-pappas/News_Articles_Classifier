Today, it has about 612, of which 570 work in front line fire suppression, said Superintendent Tim McConnell.\n\"Finally we are seeing the chief move forward with hiring employees for the Fire Department,\" said Nick Felton, head of the local firefighters' union and a vocal critic of what he calls the department's dangerous understaffing.\nMcConnell acknowledged that the department's staffing is lower than it would be in an ideal world â€” he reckons the department should have about 656 firefighters. But he disputed Felton's assertion that firefighters or the public have been put at risk due to lack of manpower.\nMayor Mitch Landrieu has authorized overtime to keep the fire companies staffed, McConnell said, so the effective firefighting capacity of the department has not been jeopardized.\nThe Fire Department needs fewer firefighters because it's fighting fewer fires, McConnell said. The department fought 764 structure fires in 2002, compared to only 306 last year, a drop of nearly two thirds, McConnell said. \"That's a good thing,\" he said. \"We should be working to put ourselves out of a job.\"\nMcConnell attributed the drop in fires to better building codes and a renewed focus on fire prevention.\nFelton said the department does fight fewer fires than it used to, but firefighters are now asked to do much more, taking on jobs like monitoring air quality and staffing an ever increasing number of festivals and special events.\nA manpower shortage has caused many fire companies to roll with three firefighters rather than the usual four, Felton said. National guidelines advise a minimum of four firefighters should be on the scene if entry into a burning building is necessary.\nMcConnell pointed out that its common for 20 or more firefighters to be dispatched to a working fire and many of them arrive on the scene within a minute or so of the first unit. He said no firefighters are put in danger by a company rolling with only three firefighters. Since only about 1 percent of calls are for structure fires, McConnell said, the four-firefighter rule rarely comes into play.\nMcConnell said his department has been trying to hire new firefighters since the beginning of the year. But he said the Civil Service Department, which is responsible for administering entrance examinations and screening applicants, has only recently moved forward with the hiring process.\nFirefighter recruits are paid $24,000 during their 32-week training period and start out at $32,800 per year when they go on duty. That bumps up to $38,800 once they've been with the department for a year. Firefighters who complete EMT certification, which McConnell said will be mandatory for new recruits, earn an additional 5 percent of their base pay rate.\nThe firefighters' union and the Landrieu administration have been at odds since shortly after the mayor took office and began withholding part of the city's annual contribution to the system. That sparked a legal battle that has been raging ever since and nearly landed the mayor on house arrest last month.", "external_links": ["http://joinnofd.org/"], "published": "2015-10-10T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:45:26.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
