The number of pay cases being brought before the courts is reflective of a sector that is riddled with pay inequities and disparities. \nNZDSN is pleased to be part of the working group to negotiate a means of addressing the low pay of workers in the disability, home support and aged care sector. \n\"We are encouraged that the Government is taking an approach that we recommended as a more sensible way forward in our Sector Briefing document released in July this year. The responsibilities undertaken by disability support workers are often complex and increasingly require a far broader range of skills and qualities,\" says NZDSN Chief Executive, Garth Bennie. \n\"The overall lack of investment in the sector is holding back the implementation of changes, innovation and quality being demanded by disabled people themselves. \n\"The requirements for a more skilled and qualified workforce need to be matched with appropriate levels of pay and funding for providers.\" \nNZDSN acknowledges that the willingness of Government to enter into a negotiated settlement on the issue of pay is an important first step. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:24:49.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
