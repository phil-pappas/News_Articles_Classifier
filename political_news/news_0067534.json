Such positive, optimistic sounding bullst. I'd prefer \"We repeatedly screwed up\".I'll file it next to \"Lessons will be learned\", which I expect to make an appearance shortly.\"Shortfall\" is a less common one- I look forward to increased takeup of this expression. It is a shame that despite ample and recurring evidence, people make judgements on skimpy evidence. You can 'prefer' all you want, but if things are missed it is quite likely that they were not obvious at the time and it is even possible that some of the keyboard warriors might have missed it.There is a background of violence that the police and other agencies see every day. Both the police and social services have to make decisions as to the best way to use resources and normally there is no 'right' answer.I know nothing other than what I've read in the media about this case, so like others I know too little to make a judgement, but I also know that people cannot be locked up for what they might do, that social workers are remarkably underfunded and overworked, that there are often no options.If you don't like the fact, and fact it is, that with too few resources some things will slip through, why aren't you pushing for more resources to be dedicated to social services. It is a tragedy, and one with horrific overtones, but blaming it on people with pensions is not the way to ensure it does not happen again. An additional tragedy is that it will happen again, and again, and again until the various services are properly resourced. One cannot expect people to be 100% correct if they have to make value judgements as to which nasty person they need to dedicate resources to. If you want policing on the cheap, then welcome to it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:01:18.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
