That of Double Trouble. But more than ten days into the game and there are already small groups and pairs teaming up with each other. Like always, the game of clashes, bizzarre fights, manipulations and bitching has already begun.\nAmidst all this, the group which is turning out to be a formidable one for the other pairs is definitely the trio of Suyyash Rai, Kishwer Merchant and Prince Narula. Suyyash-Kishwer-Prince have become very thick, they are the famous trio of the house. The trio is very kicked about bitching and gossiping about the other contestants. They often form an opinion and influence the others in the house. Prince seems to have no qualms to be stuck between Kishwer and Suyyash like he was seen cribbing when he was stuck between Rochelle-Keith and Mandana. Infact now Prince looks rather happy!\nWhile the others are still in pairs, there are three contestants who are now playing the game, without the bondage. After Ankit Gera's eviction, Arvind Vegda was the odd man out so he is devoid of any bondage. Interestingly, after winning the Lagaan task, Aman Verma and Kishwer were given the special power to walk out of the pairing and play the game individually.\nEver since then, Kishwer can be seen sticking to Suyyash and Prince's pair and the three together are playing the game really smartly. A little behind the scene? Kishwer and Suyyash have carried matching sweatshirts inside the house and Prince and Suyyash were seen wearing it and singing 'ye dosti' along with Kishwer. Will this terrific trio become a scare for the other pairs? Let's wait and watch!", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:47:48.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
