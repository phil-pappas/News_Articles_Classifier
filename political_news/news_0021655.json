A further 16 were given permission to be absent, including four shadow ministers. \nOne of the shadow ministers given permission to miss said that Mr Corbyn's handling of the party has been \"incompetent\". \nThe shadow minister said: \"He has got no control over his party but he doesn't seem to care. It is only a matter of time before there's a resignation, it's inevitable. \n\"It will not be a big thing that slips him up, he and his team are not thinking ahead of anything. This isn't just about politics, it's about his competence.\" \nJeremy Corbyn at PMQ Photo: BBC \nMr Corbyn is expected to offer free votes on Trident and extending air strikes to Syria amid concerns that he will face a mass rebellion if he fails to do so. \nA total of 21 MPs directly defied Mr Corbyn, including former ministers Tristram Hunt, Liz Kendall and Chris Leslie. \nEd Miliband, the former Labour leader, Yvette Cooper, the former shadow home secretary and Chuka Umunna, the former shadow business secretary, were among those who backed Mr Corbyn. \nSources close to Mr Corbyn confirmed that shadow cabinet ministers and MPs had been given permission to abstain from voting on the deficit proposals, but insisted it was because they were on \"on other business\". \nThe decision to allow MPs to abstain came after a major policy reversal by Mr Corbyn. John McDonnell admitted the reversal had been \"embarrassing\", adding that he had been \"trying to out Osborne Osborne\". \nThe vote came as Mr Corbyn suffered yet more indecision. \nHe was said to be undecided over whether or not to wear White Tie to a state banquet next week, which will be hosted by the Queen in honour of the Chinese President . \nThe Labour leader has accepted an invitation to Tuesday's dinner at Buckingham Palace in honour of President Xi Jinping of China but his wife, Laura Alvarez, has declined to attend. Mr Corbyn is expected to confront the Chinese President over his human rights record. \nThe party also reversed its position of blanket opposition to air strikes against Isil in Syria by suggesting it could support military action without UN support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:31:42.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
