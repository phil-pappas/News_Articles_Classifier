But the cat doesn't purr. It doesn't meow or hiss or twitch or rub up against you. The cat doesn't even move, because the cat isn't a cat, it's a creepy-ass bag that your friend has stuffed her Sephora gift cards into.\n三毛猫ボストンさんここまで進みましたヽ(*ﾟ∀ﾟ*)ﾉ pic.twitter.com/nlzzLrGa7U\n— 猫製作pico (@picopoco08) September 17, 2015 Or how about this scenario: You're on your bike waiting at a stoplight next to someone in a cab when you see a rustling motion from inside. You notice a docile, doe-eyed cat comfortably situated on the backseat. \"What a chill cat!\" you think. \"He doesn't even need a carrier!\" That's when the cab's passenger reaches into the cat's spine, digs around in its innards, and retrieves a vape pen. She takes a big hit and smiles.\n本日もお知らせ流させて頂きますm(_ _)m\n明日終了ですが猫さんのフェイスショルダーバッグを出品しております（＾◇＾）\n宜しければ覗いてみて下さい(´ω｀) pic.twitter.com/DhQf3ZVWTs\n— 猫製作pico (@picopoco08) August 8, 2015 Cat purses are for people who do not actually like cats.
