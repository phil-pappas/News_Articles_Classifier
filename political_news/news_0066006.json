In a statement, Schimel said he wanted to keep the videos out of the hands of the public because they include sensitive information about victims and explain how prosecutors investigate crimes. \nJudges have rejected those arguments, saying information about the cases is already available to the public and don't show criminals how to evade investigation. \nThe state Democratic Party sued in 2014 to get the videos, and a Dane County judge ruled days before Schimel was elected attorney general that they must be released under the open records law. Circuit Judge Richard Niess allowed the videos to remain secret while the matter was appealed by the Department of Justice, then headed by GOP Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen. \nOn Wednesday, the Court of Appeals issued a decision that found the training videos must be released. \nSchimel's filing on Friday asked the appeals court to stay its ruling while he asks the state Supreme Court to review the matter. \nTaxpayers will likely have to pay the Democratic Party's legal bills if Schimel ultimately loses. Already those bills top $10,000 and will rise because of the attempt to get the matter to the high court. \n\"The decision by Attorney General Van Hollen in 2014 to withhold disclosure of these videos was based on sound principles of victim protection and maintaining confidentiality of prosecutorial techniques,\" Schimel said in a statement. \"I supported that decision as a candidate, and as attorney general I continue to believe it was correct. Accordingly, we will ask the Supreme Court to correct the lower court's erroneous conclusion in this case.\" \nThe department argued the videos should remain private to protect victim information and keep predators from learning prosecution strategy. The court found there was nothing in the videos that wasn't otherwise known and the public had a right to see what the government was doing to protect children from predators. \n\"The DOJ neither made the exceptional case required to shield public records from public view...nor overcame the presumption of complete public access to public records,\" the judges wrote. \nSigning the opinion were Judges Patricia Curley, Lisa Stark and Thomas Hruz. \nThe Democratic Party sought the videos to find out if they include Schimel making questionable comments. Schimel denies that they do, and the circuit judge who reviewed them last year said they were mundane and did not show any misconduct. \nTogether, the videos include about two hours and 25 minutes of material. \nIn one of the videos, Schimel discusses lessons learned from the case of Anthony Stancl, who posed as a female on Facebook to lure teenage boys into sending him naked pictures of themselves. Stancl then threatened to release the photos as a way to blackmail his victims into performing sex acts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:06:49.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
