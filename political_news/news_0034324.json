Videos Clinton sent GOP 2016ers copies of... \nThe vice president and the former secretary of state are already engaged in a cold war of sorts, both jockeying for the mantle of heir to President Barack Obama's legacy as they trade veiled shots over political styles, foreign policy decisions and more. \nThough the two profess warm feelings toward each other, Clinton's campaign knows Biden is a threat: Polls consistently show he pulls most of his support from Clinton if he enters the race -- turning the campaign into a three-way race and giving Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders room to pass both. Tuesday, she rolled out a long list a long list of endorsements -- more than 50 African-American mayors, many of them from the key early-voting state of South Carolina. \nAnd Biden knows he'll have to cut away at Clinton's base -- in part by wrestling Obama supporters away from her. \nBiden made the contrasts hard to ignore Tuesday morning at a tribute to former Vice President Walter Mondale, when he invoked Clinton -- not by name, but also without prompt, signaling that she is clearly on his mind -- several times. \nOne was a shot at Clinton's remark during the first Democratic presidential debate a week ago that Republicans are among the enemies she's most proud of making. \n\"I really respect the members up there and I still have a lot of Republican friends. I don't think my chief enemy is the Republican Party. This is a matter of making things work,\" Biden said. \nIt was the second such remark Biden made in two days, as the vice president made similar comments at a climate change event on Monday. \n\"I don't consider Republicans enemies,\" Biden said. \"They're friends.\" \nThe vice president sought to subtly one-up Clinton in several ways Tuesday. He noted that Obama offered him a choice between the jobs of vice president and secretary of state. He said he'd traveled 1.1 million miles on behalf of the United States -- topping the 1 million that Clinton has said she traveled during her four years in the Obama administration. And he said Obama tapped him, not the secretary of state, as the closer with foreign leaders. \n\"I will get sent to go to speak with Putin or speak to Erdogan or go speak to whomever and it's because the secretary of state -- and we've had two great secretaries of state -- but when I go they know that I'm speaking for the president,\" Biden said. \nClinton unveils key endorsements \nBut Clinton has made a number of moves to demonstrate that it'd be difficult for Biden to find a path to victory in recent days, including the endorsements of more than 50 African-American mayors. \nDuring last week's debate, she also touted as one of her biggest differences with Obama the fact that, as a woman, she'd be the first female president. On Tuesday, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent a fundraising note on Clinton's behalf, saying that Clinton would \"fight harder for women and girls than any occupant of the White House ever has.\" \nThe implicit message: With the backing of women and minority voters and a Southern firewall, Clinton is locking up all the support that Biden would need if he's to seriously challenge her standing as the Democratic front-runner. \nBiden's bin Laden raid account changes \nPerhaps most revealing of Biden's thought process -- and relevant for a Biden-versus-Clinton campaign -- is that he retold the story of the night Obama green-lit the raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed. \nThe public version of the story, included in Clinton's book, was that Clinton supported the raid while, she wrote, Biden \"remained skeptical.\" Biden himself has said that in a meeting with cabinet officials, he advised the president to see if more proof of bin Laden's presence at the compound in Pakistan could be obtained. \nOn Tuesday, he said he reserved his final word for a private conversation after the cabinet meeting had wrapped -- when he was the last member of the administration to have Obama's ear. \n\"We walked out of the room and walked up stairs,\" Biden said. \"I told him my opinion: I thought he should go, but to follow his own instincts.\" \nHis latest comments are being heavily scrutinized as the political world waits on a decision from Biden on whether he'll enter the 2016 Democratic primary, where Clinton and Sanders are the two leading candidates. A new CNN/ORC poll shows that Clinton is backed by 45% of likely Democratic primary voters nationally, with Sanders in second place at 29% and Biden in third at 18%. \nA decision on whether Biden will take on Clinton is likely to come soon. \nThe first state filing deadlines are nine days away, which means that by delaying any further, Biden would give up chances to win delegates that would be crucial in a close nominating contest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:25:04.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
