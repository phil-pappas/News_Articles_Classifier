Should Lowe’s pull the trigger, it could set off a chain of events that lands Bunnings a greater hold on the local market.\nElsewhere, the value of the Seek-led float of IDP Education remains up in the air, telcos emerge as important players in the TransGrid race and Crown Resorts looks to trim its Las Vegas bet.\nMasters is in the spotlight once more as Lowe’s is now able to exercise a put option that would force JV partner Woolworths to buy out its 33.3 per cent stake in the hardware business. It remains unclear whether the US giant will head for the exit, though it appears likely Woolies would follow should Lowe’s decide it’s too hard to compete with Bunnings .\nIn such a circumstance, Masters could either be hived off to private equity or liquidated, with its sites seen as the best opportunity for Woolworths to recoup some of its costs. Already Bunnings has been declared as a suitor for 15 sites worth around $600 million, but it would likely meet competition from Harvey Norman , Fantastic Furniture , Ikea and Chinese property developers.\nMeanwhile, the proposed float of IDP Education will be closely scrutinised by potential investors this week as the Seek -backed group looks to justify a valuation between $586m and $687m. A report in The Australian Financial Review suggests as much as 40 per cent could be up for grabs, which would leave Seek with little skin in the game post-listing given its JV partner Education Australia is tipped to retain its 50 per cent stake.\nIn infrastructure, telcos are seen playing a role in the auction of NSW electricity network TransGrid . According to the AFR , consortia involved in the $9 billion auction have tapped telcos to get their advice on TransGrid’s telecommunications network, with the likes of Telstra and TPG Telecom potentially even in line for a minor stake in the business.\nIn finance, IOOF’s takeover push for HUB24 appears certain for failure without a sharp lift to its valuation after leading shareholder Alex Waislitz said the bid grossly undervalued the business. With key shareholders and the board offside, IOOF may need to raise its $144m offer to somewhere above $160m to secure a deal.\nThe big banks, AMP and QBE have been labelled as other potential suitors for HUB.\nIn media, WIN Corp owner Bruce Gordon continues to position for potential media reforms that could pave the way for a wave of consolidation in the sector. WIN yesterday agreed to purchase 13 per cent of Nine Entertainment through a deal with US hedge fund Apollo Global Management , a likely precursor to a takeover play in coming years.\nIn gaming, Crown Resorts is believed to be eyeing a sell-down of its 73 per cent stake in a planned $4bn Las Vegas casino. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are assessing interest in Asia for an 11.5 per cent slice for around $350m, the AFR reports.\nElsewhere, iSelect appears certain to fall into the hands of suitor Providence Equity Partners , with rival bidders believed to be thin on the ground.\nFinally, questions continue to linger about IAG’s aborted expansion into China as investors chase details on how close the firm came to an acquisition worth as much as $1bn, while the AFR reports brokers chasing cornerstone bids for a $250m raising at TasFoods to fund the planned purchase of dairy group Van Diemen’s Land Company .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:28:19.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
