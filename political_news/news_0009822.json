Obama thinks we are.\nObama was Quote: d once as saying: “Do you remember what happened to Dr. King?” This was his response when asked why he wasn’t doing ANY of the things he promised… That Quote: says it all. He believed everything he said before he was elected. Then Obama found out about the Illuminati. Now he’s nothing but a puppet for the NWO.\nSince Obama became President, a lot of things have changed. Executive MEMOS are now treated as if they are laws; the POTUS is treated as a dictator who can bypass Congress whenever he can’t get his puppet master’s wishes fulfilled by legal means.\nMaybe we should call him the King of False Flags? Keep reading and you’ll agree. In 2011 Obama signed the U.N. Small Arms Treaty which promises the U.N. that the U.S.A. will ban firearms. Since then there have been 108 “mass shootings”; in less than a 4 year period… In the 4 years BEFORE Obama was elected (2003-2007) there was a TOTAL of 27 “mass shootings”. Prior to 2003 there was an average of 2.5 “mass shootings” per year. In 2015 ALONE, there have been OVER 58! That is over 20 times higher than it was before! That looks pretty bad if you ask me.
