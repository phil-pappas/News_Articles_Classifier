Leopoldo Cintra Frias, head of Cuba’s Armed Forces, recently visited Syria to lead a group of Cuban military personnel joining forces with Russia in their support of Assad, according to information received by the University of Miami’s Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies.\nOn Wednesday, a U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that Cuban paramilitary and special forces units are on the ground in Syria, citing evidence from intelligence reports. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Cuban troops may have been training in Russia and may have arrived in Syria on Russian planes.\nOn the surface, the story makes no sense. After all, why would Raul Castro want to upset the U.S. with such a move?\nWe do remember that Cuban troops fought in Africa for much of the 1970s. At one point, Cuba had 30,000 troops in Angola , or a rather sizeable commitment for a small country!\nOf course, that was Cuba as a satellite of the USSR or a country paying back the sizeable Moscow subsidy. Cuba didn’t really a choice in the 1970s because the USSR was keeping the regime alive.\nWhy would Raul Castro do this today? In other words, he is no longer attached to the USSR and needs the U.S. desperately to save his regime.\nPerhaps because he does not fear consequences. He has seen the Obama administration make concessions in order to reestablish diplomatic relations.\nThe U.S. has not demanded a single thing in return for a U.S. Embassy, the release of convicted spies and so on.\nMy guess is that Raul Castro is following the strong horse and his name is Putin!\nP.S.
