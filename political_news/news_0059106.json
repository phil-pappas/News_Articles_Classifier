Videos A timeline of Hillary Clinton's email... \nAt a campaign event in New Hampshire, Carson noted that many people believe a situation like what took place in Germany in the 1930's and 1940's could never happen in America. \n\"I beg to differ,\" Carson said. \"If you go back and look at the history of the world, tyranny and despotism and how it starts, it has a lot to do with control of thought and control of speech.\" \nAt a press conference after the speech, reporters asked Carson who he thinks is like Adolf Hitler in the U.S. \n\"I'm not going to go into that that. I think that example is pretty clear,\" he responded, without elaborating. \nWhen another reporter asked if he was comparing President Barack Obama to Hitler, Carson said, \"No. I am saying in a situation where people do not express themselves, bad things can happen.\" \nEarlier, Carson had said, \"If people don't speak up for what they believe, then other people will change things without them having a voice. Hitler changed things there and nobody protested. Nobody provided any opposition to him.\" \nMeanwhile, as he was leaving the event, a reporter asked Carson how he would respond to Hurricane Joaquin if he were in the White House. \n\"I don't know,\" he replied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:27:19.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
