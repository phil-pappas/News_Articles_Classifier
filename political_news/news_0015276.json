He says the pastor and 25-year-old man had prior \"issues.\"\nDolunt said the man threatened the pastor with a brick. The pastor shot him several times with a pistol. The man died at a hospital.\nBeasley-Dorsey declined to discuss the case further while the investigation continues.\nNo one answered knocks from The Associated Press Monday afternoon to the front and side doors of the church, which occupies at least the first floor of a two-story building along one of Detroit's neighborhood business district arteries. It shares the short block with a cellphone store, pizza shop, apartments and vacant nail salon.\nAn old, darkened neon sign in one of the church's small front windows reads Xbox 360, iPod, Play Station, PSP Repairs.\nAcross the street are a tire shop, closed-down African market and liquor store. Several other churches are within several blocks of The City of God in the neighborhood - a mix of stable blocks with its share of vacant houses.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:32:52.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
