(Dave Killen/The Oregonian via AP) more > By - Associated Press   \nROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) - The latest on a deadly shooting at a community college in Oregon (all times local): \n1:51 p.m. \nPresident Barack Obama says opponents of gun control laws know how to stir up fear and scare politicians. \nObama is lamenting the inability to pass stricter gun laws even after incidents such as the shooting Thursday at an Oregon community college that killed nine people. \nObama said at a news conference Friday at the White House that interest groups and Republican politicians know how to organize and raise money. He says the American people must match their sense of urgency if the country is to stop the flood of mass shootings. \nThe president says he plans to keep talking about the issue and “will politicize it” because inaction is itself a political decision the U.S. is making. \nHe says it’s impossible to identify mentally ill people likely to perpetrate mass shootings ahead of time. He says the only thing the U.S. can do is ensure they don’t have an arsenal available “when something in them snaps.” \n___ \n1:12 p.m. \nFormer California neighbors of the gunman who killed nine people at an Oregon community college say he was temperamental and ignored people. \nThe neighbors encountered 26-year-old Christopher Harper-Mercer at an apartment complex in the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance, where he lived with his mother until a few years ago. \nNineteen-year-old Reina Webb told The Associated Press on Friday that he kept to himself, but if he did talk, it would be as if he was having a temper tantrum. She says he often rode a red bicycle. \nAnother neighbor, Jason Lee, says no one really knew Harper-Mercer because he would ignore people who said hello and just ride on by. \nWebb says Harper-Mercer’s mother was friendly, chatted with neighbors and told her they were moving to make a new start in Oregon. \nHarper-Mercer attended El Camino College in Torrance from 2010 to 2012. Campus spokeswoman Ann Garten says she has no details on whether he graduated or what he studied.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:46:53.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
