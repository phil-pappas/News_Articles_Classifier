Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Clinton’s main Democratic presidential rival, raised $104,001 during the same period from Michigan donors, but he did not hold a fundraiser in the state.\nDr. Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and Detroit native, led the crowded field of Republican candidates by collecting $351,954 in itemized contributions from Michigan donors during the third quarter.\nCarson had the largest base of individual contributors in the state — some of whom made multiple donations to his White House campaign.\nCarson’s average donation of $163 was far lower than the other leading fundraisers.\n“He’s got a bigger base of contributors, and they will give $25, $50, $75 a month,” said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.\n“The great news (for Carson) is you can go back to them again and again and again and almost none of them hit the donation limit. When you have a donor who’s given the $2,700 limit, that’s it.”\nThis appears to be the situation in which candidates such as Clinton and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush find themselves. Hundreds of their larger donors have made the maximum contributions permitted under the law for this election with about two and a half months to go before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.\nIn addition to Carson, Sanders also relied heavily on small donors. His average contribution in Michigan was the lowest at about $94, according to a Detroit News analysis of campaign finance data.\nBush’s third-quarter contributions in the state declined 65 percent to $115,675, compared with the $332,650 he raised from Michigan donors April 1 through June 30.\nBush also has seen his standing drop in the polls, where he now trails Trump, Carson, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 7 percent, according to an average of recent surveys by Real Clear Politics.\nCruz had the fourth-largest haul among Michigan donors for the quarter, bringing in $106,059 through Sept. 30. Cruz’s contributors included Republican National Committeeman Dave Agema, who gave $500.\nmburke@detroitnews.com \n(202) 662-8736", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:50:56.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
