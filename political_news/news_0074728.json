According to an article in Reuters, Judge Mary Johnston in New Castle County, Delaware , said that the damages that were awarded to the female plaintiff in May, which were the largest to date in a transvaginal mesh trial, were \"grossly disproportionate to the injuries suffered and shock the court's conscience and sense of justice.\" The article also said that Boston Scientific wanted the verdict set aside altogether, as well as a new trial, but the judge denied that bid. The judge decided that the jury's award was simply too high compared to other verdicts in mesh trials, which punitive damages ranged anywhere from $1.75 million to $7.76 million . A spokesman for Boston Scientific said \"the company intends to appeal the verdict because it believes there were factual and legal errors.\"\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140714/126845\nLegal-Bay, a law cash advance company, is a leader in transvaginal mesh, transvaginal tape, and bladder or pelvic slings, as well as verdict on appeal settlement advances for all cases, including large hip recall verdicts and mesh cases. The company has seen an increase in transvaginal mesh settlement funding and hip recall settlement funding as the much publicized settlements have been very slow to be paid; and in particular with the transvaginal mesh cases, the manufacturers seem to be slowly going from firm to firm to make settlements, which are wide ranging in settlement amounts or values.\nChris Janish , CEO of Legal-Bay, commented on the recent news in the Boston Scientific verdict, \"We are not surprised that the judge has reduced the verdict to $10MM, however, the positive is that the verdict was not set aside but affirmed for the lower amount. Although most of the news has been positive for plaintiff verdicts, unfortunately our clients have been calling to try and access money off their proposed settlements for the simple fact that they are taking way too long.\"\nLegal-Bay can also assist injured parties who believe they may have a possible hip recall or transvaginal mesh claim. If you, or a loved one, have been injured from a transvaginal mesh product or bladder sling, please feel free to contact Legal-Bay with any questions you may have.
