It's getting an extra Â£10bn of money during this Parliament, over and above inflation, and that enables us to meet some really clear goals.\n\"Parents and people in our country want to access the NHS on a seven-day basis. Let me be clear, this doesn't mean that all staff in the NHS have to work every seven days, it just means the services are available.\n\"So, I can announce today that we will be publishing a new GP contract to get rid of the box-ticking and the form-filling.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/77948000/jpg/_77948246_003047409-1.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-34437542"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T18:04:19.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
