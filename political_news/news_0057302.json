This battle is occurring in the Church herself, and the devastation is all too evident.” \nBishop Olmsted has been a vocal defender of life and Church teaching on sexuality. \n“How did it come about that a culture so steadfast in supporting marriage and spousal commitment two generations ago became a culture that has reduced sexuality to mere pleasure and self-serving ends?” he asks, answering that it is the Sexual Revolution, which has “ushered in the scourge of abortion, pornography, and sexual abuse so rampant in recent decades.” \nThe Sexual Revolution has given fake freedom, he says, and undermined the family. \n“Instead of real and authentic love, this false ‘liberty’ offers cheap pleasures that mask a deeper loneliness and pain,” states Bishop Olmsted. “Instead of the security of traditional family bonds, it leaves children longing for the stability of a mother’s and a father’s love.” \nThe Revolution also violates Natural Law, according to the bishop, and has failed in its purpose. \n“Instead of the freedom that comes with accepting the truth of God’s design for human love between a man and woman, the Sexual Revolution has arrogantly rebelled against human nature, a nature that will never thrive in confusion and lack of self-control,” he continues. “Indeed, the ‘love’ promised by the Sexual Revolution has never been found.” \n“In its wake is wreckage, countless broken hearts bound by fear of more pain, broken lives, broken homes, broken dreams and broken belief that love is even possible,” the bishop says. “This is the rotten fruit of the Sexual Revolution”… \n\nWhile the Apostolic Exhortation is targeted towards Catholic men, it is a must read for all people of faith, especially men. It’s inspiring to hear a prominent man of the cloth speak so boldly about Truths that need to be spoken and debunking the lies the Secularists are peddling today in our schools, our media, and pop culture. \nWe at ArizonaInformer would like to extend our gratitude to Bishop Olmsted and the Phoenix Diocese for their steadfast leadership in guiding Catholics (and everyone of goodwill) out of the darkness of Secularism and into the Light and Truth that can only be found in Jesus Christ.
