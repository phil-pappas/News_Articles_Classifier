Clinton \"will unveil proposals intended to equip prosecutors with better tools in order to prosecute Wall Street executives who break the law,\" an aide said. \"She will also outline new ideas for holding financial executives accountable for egregious misconduct by their subordinates -- ensuring that they lose their bonuses or in some cases their jobs. These proposals will be a key part of a larger financial reform agenda that will bring more accountability to Wall Street and constrain risk-taking at large banks and elsewhere in the financial system. As she's said, 'Too Big to Fail is still too big a problem.\"\nAccording to details provided by the campaign's initial briefing, Clinton's plan includes tax on high-frequency trading, closing the hedge-fund loophole of the Volcker Rule under Dodd-Frank, and making individual actors and banks more accountable when they break the law.\nIn going after individuals responsible for financial calamity, Clinton would require that \"would require that large financial institutions pay for a portion of major civil or criminal fines from the incentive-based pay of culpable employees, their supervisors, and the relevant senior executives of the firm—anyone who was responsible for or should have caught the problem.\"\n\"Moreover, she would empower regulators to require that senior executives leave their jobs when particularly egregious misconduct takes place under their supervision. Her bottom line is simple: supervisors and senior executives should be held accountable when wrongdoing happens on their watch,\" the text goes on to say.\n\"Clinton believes that the best way to deter corporate wrongdoing is to hold individuals accountable for their misconduct. She would enforce our laws against the individuals who break them—plain and simple. That includes holding corporate officers and supervisors accountable when they knew about misconduct by their subordinates and failed to prevent it or stop it,\" the text provided to POLITICO says. \"When people commit crimes on Wall Street, they will be prosecuted and imprisoned.\"\nAnd those who are convicted of \"egregious crimes\" would be prohibited from future employment in the financial services industry, in an effort to charge and prosecute individuals convicted of \"serious crimes under securities, commodities, consumer, and banking laws would result in employment bars across the entire financial services industry.\"\n\"Firms shouldn’t treat penalties for breaking the law as merely a cost of doing business, and we need to put an end to the patterns of recidivism we see in some institutions today,\" the text says.\nFor the institutions themselves, they would be required to admit wrongdoing as part of any settlement agreement. Clinton's plan also calls on prosecutors and regulators to have the tools they need to properly hold individuals and corporations responsible, calling on an increase in funding for the Justice Department, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. She would also increase penalties on SEC and CFTC enforcement actions.\nOn the high-frequency trading tax, Clinton would target \"strategies involving excessive levels of order cancellations, which make our markets less stable and less fair.\" The plan also pledges to ensure equal access to markets and transparency, with Clinton pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission to make sure the interests of individual and corporate issuers who invest rather than financial firms and high-frequency traders.\nClinton would close the hedge-fund loophole in the Volcker Rule, as well.\n\"She would fully enforce the Volcker Rule, in a manner that stays true to its underlying goals—ensuring that banks can’t avoid its prohibitions on risky activities by using evasive business structures. And she would reinstate the 'swaps push-out' rule for banks’ derivatives trading, which was repealed at the behest of the banking lobby in last year’s budget deal,\" according to the text.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:38:00.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
