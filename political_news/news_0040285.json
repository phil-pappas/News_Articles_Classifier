It would also position party leader Heinz-Christian Strache to bid for Austria's chancellorship in federal elections to be held within three years. \nPolls had shown the Socialists ahead by only a few percentage points before the vote, with concerns about immigration a major issue for voters. \nBelying the significance of the election, both top candidates exuded calm as they cast their ballots. \nIncumbent Michael Haeupl said he had an \"excellent\" night's sleep. Asked about the importance of Sunday's elections, he replied \"every election is important.\" \nAlluding to the Freedom Party's Eurosceptic, anti-immigrant image among its critics, he said that every vote for the party \"is not good for the international reputation of this city.\" \nStrache expressed hope for his party's \"best showing in history,\" saying he hoped to at least match the Socialist showing. \nVoting stations opened at 0500 GMT (1 a.m. EDT) and were to close at 1500 GMT (11 a.m. EDT) Sunday. Full results were expected by late evening.
