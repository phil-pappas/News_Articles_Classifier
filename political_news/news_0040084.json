The disgust level is too high, both for him and for the Congress that allows him free reign to ruin and endanger the United States. \nSome of that disgust has to be reserved for the voters and particularly the non-participating sheep of America who couldn't care less about anything that happens in Washington. \nThere are people who believe Obama will seek a third term, against the Constitution's 22nd Amendment. \nI doubt it. Obama is more the smash and grab type, working to create chaos and leave behind a big mess to cover his exit. He's not in this because he loves to rule but because he loves to be adored and to acquire things. The White House permanent staff should count the silverware when he and his mooching wife finally leave for good. \nThe fact that he's willing to cut our military while Russia rises to world dominance, China threatens to expand its circle of authority and Iran is preparing for a huge military push in the Middle East just shows -- for about the millionth time -- that this president is no friend of America. \nSo what are you gonna do?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:01:18.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
