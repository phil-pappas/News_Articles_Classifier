This experience changed her perceptions of cross-cultural interactions, leading her to believe that ethics must transcend cultural traditions. Stewart writes, \"We must understand that, although we operate in separate spheres, humanity as a whole is constantly impacted by the opinions we hold as individuals…if we are unable to put aside our differences to surmount the barriers we have created for ourselves, perhaps we are missing the point of life itself.\"\n\"Today's college students are listening to the ethical voices within. They are drawing on their memories and the lessons of their teachers, and are concerned with the morality of their private and public experiences. They are challenging us all to make a difference,\" said Elie Wiesel .\nThe Prize in Ethics Essay Contest is an annual competition that challenges college students in the U.S. to submit essays on the urgent and complex ethical issues that confront us in the modern world. Since the contest's inception in 1989, thousands of young people have composed essays for consideration. In November 2010, Yale University Press published \" An Ethical Compass: Coming of Age in the 21st Century ,\" an anthology of some of the most outstanding entries from the prize's first two decades. Last year, the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity and LRN partnered with the Miami-Dade County Public Schools to introduce the Prize in Ethics at the high school level.\n\"It's an honor to continue our partnership with the Elie Wiesel Foundation and its Prize in Ethics, which has inspired thousands of students across the country,\" said Dov Seidman, CEO of LRN. \"Together, we are helping cultivate the next generation of leaders to think and act ethically, a critical virtue in our interdependent world where the actions of so few can impact so many.\"\nAdditional winners of the 2015 Prize in Ethics Essay Contest include:\nSecond Prize: Andrew Mueller , for his essay, \" The Ethics of Giving: Lessons from the Ship and the City ,\" in which he illustrates a developed framework for ethical giving after witnessing firsthand acts of inhumanity during his time at sea visiting the port of Djibouti .
