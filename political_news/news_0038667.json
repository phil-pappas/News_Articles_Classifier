(AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)\nAssociated Press Oct. 15, 2015 | 6:32 a.m. EDT + More BERLIN (AP) — The latest news as migrants fleeing war or seeking a better life make their way across Europe by the tens of thousands. All times local.\n12:30 p.m.\nThe operations chief for Europe's top law enforcement agency says established organized crime networks are making new connections as they jump into the business of smuggling migrants hoping for a better life.\nWil van Gemert, Europol's deputy director for operations, told The Associated Press that the networks were taking advantage of desperation to make a profit. He spoke on the sidelines of a joint conference Thursday with Interpol that gathered law enforcement representatives from 50 countries to discuss how to join forces against the smuggling networks.\nSyndicates from different parts of Europe, with backgrounds in drugs and money laundering or other illicit trade, are in communication to offer a form of coordination in moving people northward.\n___\n12:05 p.m.\nA top European Union official is pressing leaders of the 28 member states to live up to pledges to tackle the refugee emergency and says their credibility is at stake if they fail to act during Thursday's summit meeting.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker says \"the member states have got to do what they promised to do.\"\nJuncker says that \"it's a question of credibility, of ... whether they can live up to their promises.\"\nJuncker's statement came as EU leaders converged on Brussels for a summit focused on the refugee crisis. The leaders promised last month to massively step up spending and provide more experts to help fingerprint and screen the thousands of people arriving in Europe daily seeking refuge or jobs.\nBut few countries have come forward with money or personnel.\n___\n11:15 a.m.\nGreece's coast guard says it has rescued 830 people in 20 search and rescue operations between Wednesday morning and Thursday morning off eastern Aegean islands.\nThe rescues, which occurred near the islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Agathonissi and Kos, do not account for those who reach the shores themselves, generally in overcrowded inflatable dinghies.\nOn Wednesday, authorities recovered the bodies of a woman, a young girl and an infant from an overturned dinghy spotted by a helicopter of the European Union border policing agency Frontex. The recovery came after an all-day search following the rescue in nearby Turkish waters of 21 others who had been in the dinghy.\nHundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in their homelands have crossed illegally from Turkey to Greece this year.\n___\n10:15 a.m.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe must cooperate with Turkey in order to tackle the migrant crisis.\nMerkel says that by improving conditions in those regions where migrants come from they may be dissuaded from traveling to Europe.\nShe told German lawmakers Thursday that \"without doubt Turkey plays a key role in this matter\" because it hosts almost 2 million Syrians and is a key transit point for migrants coming to Europe.\nMerkel, who travels to Istanbul on Sunday, says talks with Turkish leaders won't tie cooperation on the refugee issue to the country's future membership of the European Union.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
