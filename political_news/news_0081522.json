(AP) â€” An exit on Interstate 84 has been named in memory of a state trooper who was killed in an ambush at his barracks.\nA large green sign designating Exit 30 in Blooming Grove as the Corporal Bryon K. Dickson II exit was dedicated Friday at a ceremony attended by Gov. Tom Wolf , a large contingent of state troopers, several legislators and members of Dickson's family.\nDickson was killed and Trooper Alex Douglass was critically wounded when they were shot by a sniper on Sept. 12, 2014, outside the Blooming Grove barracks, about a mile from the exit.\nShooting suspect Eric Frein , a self-taught survivalist, led police on a 48-day manhunt before U.S. marshals captured him near an abandoned airplane hangar. He was charged with murder and related offenses and has pleaded not guilty.\nLast month, Penn State University established in Dickson's honor a memorial fund officials hope will finance annual $2,250 scholarships to promising undergraduates majoring in criminology. A Penn State alumna has pledged $25,000 to match gifts of any size in hopes of raising at least $50,000.\nDickson was a graduate of Penn State's criminology program and an honors college student.\nThe memorial fund total stood at $29,500 on Friday, a spokeswoman said.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:25:54.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
