The video was uploaded on Yotube which has gone viral. \nIn the video, Kushwaha is seen taking the bribe by promising contracts in the next government if the JD-U comes to power. The authenticity of video is yet to be established but JD(U) said it believes that the “sting operation is true.” \nIt is also not clear in the video that who is giving the alleged bribe. \n\"His (Awadhesh Kushwaha) resignation has been sent to the governor's house,\" JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav said. \n\"Party believes that the sting operation is true,\" he said. \nHighlighting the promptness with which the party acted on the allegations, Sharad Yadav said, \"Whether it was the Vyapam Scam, Lalitgate or Sushma Swaraj's matter, that party did not take any action.\" \nThe stage is set for voting in 49 seats of Bihar assembly elections in the first phase of the five-phase poll on Monday. \nA total of 1,35,72,339 electorate are eligible to decide the fate of 583 candidates for the 49 seats in 10 districts in the first phase of elections. \nVoting will start from 7am. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:02:55.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
