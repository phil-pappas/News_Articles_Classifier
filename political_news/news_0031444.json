(Picture Courtesy: YouTube) Artist Martin Mull was right when he remarked that we should never underestimate a child’s ability to get into more trouble. In this video clip, these little twin boys defy all odds to successfully slip away from their high cots and sneak out of their nursery as soon as their mother leaves.\nKnowing fully well about how super-smart children can be, their mother secretly leaves a camera in their room to record their antics. Moments after mommy leaves the room closing the door behind her, one of the two toddlers quickly climbs down his cot. He tiptoes towards the door and even gestures towards his twin brother to not make a sound.\nNeedless to say, the boys get caught by their mother soon enough.
