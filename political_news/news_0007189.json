The accusations come from U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. (Video via The White House ) \nIn a blog post , the firm wrote that over the last three weeks it had \"detected and prevented a number of intrusions into our customers' systems from actors we have affiliated with the Chinese government.\" \nThe company said some of the hacks were on technological and pharmaceutical companies and were likely an attempt to steal trade secrets and intellectual property.

CrowdStrike says the first hack was just one day after the agreement was inked.
