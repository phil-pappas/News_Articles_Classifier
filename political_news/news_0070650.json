Martin O'Malley may have the most on the line for Tuesday night's Democratic primary debate, former Obama aide David Axelrod says. Axelrod's message is clear in an op-ed published Monday: The debate and the primary is still Clinton's to lose. And if she were to stumble, the Democratic pining for Vice President Joe Biden could intensify.\nThe former secretary of state's mission \"is to rise above the tactical and present a coherent, value-laden vision that will make her flood of policy papers seem like something more than positions of convenience,\" writes Axelrod, who is currently a CNN contributor.\nSanders, her closest competitor in the polls, \"is utterly authentic,\" Axelrod wrote. \"And right now, that is Clinton's challenge.\"\nFor his part, the Vermont senator would do well to be more personal and to \"present a more empathetic side â€” less grumpy old man and more caring advocate,\" Axelrod wrote.\nClinton schedules Q&A with Hispanic business group By Eliza Collins\nIn the case of O'Malley, his chances have been hurt by a smaller and less frequent debate schedule than the last time Democrats were selecting their nominee, he added.\n\"By October in that cycle, there already had been 13 faceoffs among the Democratic candidates. The absence of them this cycle has deprived the challengers to Clinton of a major vehicle to lift their profiles, which may well have been the point,\" he remarked.\nOne potential approach, he wrote, is that O'Malley could challenge Sanders on his position on guns.\nThe other two candidates on stage, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. and Sen. Lincoln Chafee, have their own challenges.\n\"Look for Webb to brandish his national security chops on the discussion of Syria, perhaps setting up a soft contrast with Clinton,\" he wrote.\nChafee, Axelrod remarked, \"has made nary a ripple thus far. He also is a former professional horseshoer, who, having lost the governorship, is accustomed to getting the boot.\"\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/12/opinions/axelrod-las-vegas-dem-debate-preview/index.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:42:32.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
