But while those heading up the teams campaigning for Britain to leave or remain in the European Union may be familiar to those in the City or Westminster, will they help punch through to undecided voters across the country?\nLord Stuart Rose, who is heading up the Britain Stronger In Europe group, has a storied history leading M&S and now Ocado, but with the greatest of respect, he is hardly a household name.\nThe same can be said for those millionaires whose cash will be greasing the wheels of the Vote Leave group : former Labour donor John Mills, Tory supporter Peter Cruddas and UKIP's former treasurer Stuart Wheeler.\nThe politicians on either side are familiar to those who are regular viewers of PMQs, but voters who can't even untangle those initials are unlikely to be moved.\nPlay video \"Britain Must Stay 'Come What May'\" Video: Britain Must Stay 'Come What May' Internal polling for one of the campaign groups has shown that whatever the Prime Minister renegotiates, 30% will vote to stay and 30% will choose to leave.\n:: The Case For Staying In By Numbers \nThat leaves 40% of voters up for grabs, who will need to be sufficiently engaged in this potentially long process (we know only that the vote will be held by the end of 2017).\nSo surely the texture of the campaign groups will need to include those away from Westminster or the Square Mile.\nPlay video \"EU In Or Out: In Numbers\" Video: EU In Or Out: In Numbers Monday's launch is being attended by June Sarpong, the Loose Women presenter, which is something of a start, but surely there must be engaged and opinionated comedians, cooks, sportsmen and women, or actors and authors who could also be deployed. \nThe Scottish independence referendum attracted significantly more high-profile voices on both sides (JK Rowling, Sean Connery).\nThis is a sufficiently important issue for all of us in Britain: a wide spread of voices is needed to ensure as many people as possible understand the implications.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:34:33.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
