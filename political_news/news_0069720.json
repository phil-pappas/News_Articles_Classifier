William Wulf , CEO of COPC. \"Working together with other like-minded independent medical groups improves our ability to utilize data and develop clinical initiatives that will create healthcare value for Ohio . Remaining independent provides a broader network of specialists and services for our physicians and patients.\"\nThe physician groups of OIC now offer care in more than 35 specialties, in addition to an extensive network of primary care locations. In addition to COPC, members of OIC include: Community Health Care, Inc., Northern Ohio Medical Specialists (NOMS Healthcare), Pioneer Physicians Network, Premier Physicians and Unity Health Network.\n\"By creating and building strong relationships with independent medical providers across the state, we're able to strengthen the local medical landscape and allow patients to receive great care at the same hometown offices that they've relied on, sometimes for generations,\" said Dr. Robert Kent , OIC chairman. \"We're able to create high-quality new care options for patients in the same locations they already know, trust and depend on.\"\nThe OIC members will collaborate on initiatives that will improve clinical quality, patient care and access to providers, creating a new care option in the marketplace contrasted to the large health system corporations. The Collaborative also serves as a platform that enables strategic business benefits for members, including the ability to take advantage of group purchasing opportunities.\nFor more information on the Ohio Independent Collaborative and its members, visit the organization's website at www.ohioindependentcollaborative.org , or contact Mark Bosko at (330) 608-7395, or mark.bosko@ohioindependentcollaborative.org .\nContact: Mark Bosko\nmark.bosko@ohioindependentcollaborative.org\n(330) 608-7395\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/central-ohio-primary-care-joins-ohio-independent-collaborative-growing-statewide-organization-300158011.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.ohioindependentcollaborative.org/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/central-ohio-primary-care-joins-ohio-independent-collaborative-growing-statewide-organization-300158011.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CL25577&Transmission_Id=201510130730PR_NEWS_USPR_____CL25577&DateId=20151013", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:23:27.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
