The Commission for Case Manager Certification® announced today that its Case Management Body of Knowledge® (CMBOK®) online learning resource has expanded its integrated online process, allowing subscribers to earn a potential 75 continuing education credits on topics ranging from health care reimbursement to managing care transitions.\n\"Our survey of board-certified case managers found that online learning is the preferred method for continuing education, with face-to-face learning a close second,\" said Patrice Sminkey , the Commission's CEO. \"We listened, and are committed to adding to the CMBOK with new education resources every year. Access to a wide range of topics in an online learning environment supports case managers in their ongoing professional development efforts.\"\nFive years ago the Commission invested in development of the CMBOK with foundational information for case managers. Today, the Commission is showcasing the CMBOK's value as a workforce development resource for both seasoned case managers and those new to the field.\nFresh articles, webinars and corresponding continuing education modules keep case managers current in a rapidly changing health care landscape. New CMBOK technical capabilities make it easy for board-certified case managers to log in, select a continuing education activity, complete it, and take a test to earn immediate credit.\n\"Case managers harness critical thinking skills every day to assess a patient's situation and to address a wide range of needs-physical, financial, emotional, social and cultural,\" Sminkey said. \"Professional development and ongoing learning about topics specific to case management are essential to ensure the workforce remains in front of changes in how health care is delivered.\"\nFor example, the Commission recently added two modules focused on ethics in case management practice, based on the principles of the Code of Professional Conduct for Case Managers. The modules were developed following the first comprehensive review and update in the Code's history; they include an overview of the Code plus practical considerations and common ethical scenarios that occur in case management practice. The ethics modules were co-authored by Emory University professor and medical ethicist John Banja , PhD, who is also a presenter at the CCMC New World Symposium 2016 , the Commission's first national, in-person meeting for case manager workforce development.\nAbout the Commission for Case Manager Certification\nThe Commission for Case Manager Certification (the Commission) is the first and largest nationally accredited organization that certifies more than 37,000 professional case managers. The Commission is a nonprofit, volunteer organization that oversees the process of case manager certification with its CCM ® credential.
