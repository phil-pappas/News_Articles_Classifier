The split between the two indicators has caused some economists to question whether fewer people are bothering to claim unemployment benefits they're eligible for as the jobs outlook has improved.\nIn any case, the extremely low level of jobless claims will provide at least one positive indicator for officials at the Federal Reserve, who will wrestle with whether the economy is strong enough for tighter money at meetings in Washington at the end of this month and in December.\nThe overall improvement in the jobs outlook over the course of the recovery is clear. The total number of people receiving benefits, which are available for up to 26 weeks, was 2,158,000 at the beginning of October. That was the lowest such number since late 2000, long before the financial crisis and during the dotcom boom.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Poor enrollment expected for Obamacare Administration expects 14 million people to sign up for coverage next year\nBy Robert King • 10/15/15 11:33 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:11:47.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
