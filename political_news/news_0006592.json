The forum is taking place at Antioch University Midwest. So far, most of those speaking at the forum have voiced support for the issue. Others have raised concerns about possible increased access for those younger than 21 and about an industry monopoly they say would be created by the amendment. One proponent discussed his concerns about a monopoly, when the crowd chanted \" pass the mic, pass the mic \" so his turn speaking would end. WHIOâ€™s Lauren Clark is covering the event and will have a full report tonight at 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:14:27.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
