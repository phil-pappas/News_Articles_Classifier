Maez to step down in wake of son’s arrest By - Associated Press - Thursday, October 22, 2015 \nSANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - State Rep. Stephanie Maez has decided to step down in order to focus on her family in the wake of her son’s arrest. \nHer 18-year-old son, Donovan Maez, has pleaded not guilty to murder in connection to a fatal drive-by shooting of an Albuquerque teenager. \nThe Albuquerque Journal reports (http://bit.ly/1RqwZqb ) that Maez says she will submit her letter of resignation to the Legislature on Thursday. She says it will not be effective until Nov. 5. She says it has been an honor to represent Bernalillo County. \nMaez had previously said she planned to run for election next year, but that was before her son’s arrest in August. \nAfter Maez steps down, the Bernalillo County Commission will have to pick a successor to serve the remainder of her two-year term that runs through 2016. \n___ \nInformation from: Albuquerque Journal, http://www.abqjournal.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:27:09.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
