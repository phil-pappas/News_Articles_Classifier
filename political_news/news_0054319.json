(AP) â€” A Pierce County man has been found guilty in the 2014 shooting death of his fiancee, whose body was found in a secluded area near Belfair.\nThe News Tribune reports ( http://bit.ly/1LajV4j ) that the jury chose to convict 42-year-old William Grisso Thursday of premediated first-degree murder in the death of 45-year-old Nancy Gardner .\nGrisso had reported his fiancee missing in June 2014. Detectives later found Gardner's body near Belfair with gunshot wounds.\nProsecutors in the case had argued that Grisso killed Gardner because he wanted to begin a relationship with another woman.\nGrisso's attorney maintained that there was no evidence connecting his client to the crime.\nThe jury deliberated for less than a day before finding Grisso guilty. His sentencing has been set for November.\n___\nInformation from: The News Tribune, http://www.thenewstribune.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1LajV4j", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:53:38.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
