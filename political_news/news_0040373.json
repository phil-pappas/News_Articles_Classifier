He was to meet later with Abbas and Jordanian King Abdullah II.\n\"We have to stop incitement, we have to stop the violence. And I think it's critical,\" Kerry said before his meeting with Netanyahu.\n\"Obviously, this conversation that you and I will have is very important to settle on the steps that will be taken that take us beyond the condemnation and beyond the rhetoric. It is absolutely critical to end all incitement and all violence, and to find a road forward to build the possibility that is not there today for a larger process.\"\nNetanyahu, who has complained about U.S. statements seen as equating Israeli actions with those of Palestinians, thanked Kerry for his support, but said more needed to be done.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton: Here's why I didn't fire anyone over Benghazi debacle Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., was the first to ask why no one has been fired yet.\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 10/22/15 1:26 PM \"I think it's time for the international community to say clearly to President Abbas: Stop spreading lies about Israel, lies that Israel wants to change the status quo on the Temple Mount, lies that Israel wants to tear down the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and lies that Israel is executing Palestinians. All of that is false. We remain committed to the status quo, we are the ones that protect all the holy sites, and Israel is acting to protect its citizens as any democracy would in the face of such wanton and relentless attacks,\" he said.\n\"We have to stop the terrorism. To stop the terrorism, we have to stop the incitement.\"\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu stirred further controversy by claiming Amin al-Husseini, the Muslim grand mufti of Jerusalem and political leader of Palestinians during World War II, had persuaded Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to exterminate the Jews during a meeting between the two on Nov. 28, 1941. Though nearly all historians say there's no reliable evidence of that, it is true that Husseini was an enthusiastic supporter of the Third Reich who recruited tens of thousands of Muslim soldiers for the SS and helped institutionalize anti-semitism in the Palestinian movement.\nTop Story Gowdy scolds Benghazi Dems for focus on 'money,' not 'heroism' Gowdy tore into Democrats at the Benghazi hearing for complaining about the $5 million price tag Thursday.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/22/15 4:34 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:59:23.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
