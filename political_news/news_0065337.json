This should include the review of the Emissions Trading Scheme, which is scheduled shortly. \n“Without committing Government, Climate Change Minister Tim Groser indicated personal support for a Climate Forum. He said that he thought we had made good progress and that action on climate change had some real momentum behind it now. \n“Energy and Transport Minister Simon Bridges also indicated a willingness to engage with a collaborative process that would focus on the complementary measures that could sit alongside the ETS. \n“Green party co-leader James Shaw and Labour spokesperson Dr Megan Woods also indicated support for the Forum or something like it. \n“The Climate Forum would bring business, local government and environmental interests together to consider the science and policy challenges and address how we can reach the required reductions over time, measure progress in a credible and responsive way and adjust policy settings to get there. \n“EDS will engage with stakeholders over the next few weeks to get the Forum off the ground. It’s our view that it should be business-led,” Mr Taylor concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:56:22.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
