Possums, rats and stoats do not read land titles and do not care who landowners may be. \n\"I also congratulate NgÄ Whenua RÄhui’s use of technology in the field, from smartphones that capture biodiversity monitoring data to map journals which provide digital flyovers of conservation land. \n\"One of NgÄ Whenua RÄhui’s most inspiring success stories can be found in the Motatau Forest in Northland, which had suffered significant damage from predators. DOC passed guardianship of the land to local iwi, NgÄti Hine, while NgÄ Whenua RÄhui helped double the land area available. The area is now largely predator-free, pigeons are flocking back, and Kohekohe trees are also recovering well. \n\"There is a lot to be inspired about and together we are making a real difference. I wish NgÄ Whenua RÄhui all the best for the next 25 years and beyond,\" Ms Wagner says. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
