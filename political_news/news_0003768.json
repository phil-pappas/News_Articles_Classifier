Photo: Daniel Munoz\nThe Turnbull government is paying former NSW premier Barry O'Farrell more than $50,000 for three months' work on a review into the offshore online gambling industry.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison announced the review when he was still the social services minister last month but new government tender documents reveal the former Liberal leader will be paid $52,500 for the September to December job.\nMr Morrison says online gambling is a $1.6 billion a year business in Australia, with 60 per cent of revenue going overseas to more than 2000 sites beyond the reach of Australian regulators and tax collectors.\nMr O'Farrell resigned as premier in April 2014 after misleading the Independent Commission Against Corruption over receiving a $3000 bottle of Penfolds Grange wine from Liberal Party identity Nick Di Girolamo.\nAdvertisement He retired from the NSW Parliament in March.\nIn June, Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop appointed him to the unsalaried position of deputy chairman of the Australia-India Council.\nThe council is chaired by Ashok Jacob, a former lieutenant of billionaire casino mogul James Packer and his late father, Kerry. He is a former director of Crown Ltd, which was awarded a licence to operate a \"restricted gaming facility\" at Barangaroo while Mr O'Farrell was premier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:32:44.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
