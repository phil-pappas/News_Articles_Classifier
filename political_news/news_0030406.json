At the end of the evening (in question) Scalia suddenly got up on stage and sang ... We had wonderful evening,\" she was quoted as saying in an interview published in German on Thursday. \nGinsburg, 81, makes occasional public appearances with Scalia, including attending operas together. \nShe said she had never in her long legal career worked in an environment in which colleagues showed such respect and even fondness for one another. \nEven when the high court narrowly split in a 2000 ruling that awarded Republican George Bush the presidency over Democrat Al Gore, \"a week later we treated each other nearly normally. That is practically always the case with us. 'Get over it', as one of my colleagues here would say.\" \nGinsburg voted with the majority to allow same-sex marriage in the United States. Scalia issued a fierce dissent.
