John Kitzhaber in June 2012. (Benjamin Brink/Staff) Comments \nBy Scott Roberts \nThe Oregon attorney general's office butchered the recently proposed right-to-work initiative beyond all recognition and in doing so has exposed how political the office has become. \nNotwithstanding the valiant efforts of chief petitioner Jill Gibson and her backers, the recent comedy of errors that characterized Oregon's right-to-work ballot title mishap was predictably foreshadowed by her initiative attempt two years ago. \nGibson's objective — and the crystal clear intent of her proposed initiative — was to make the payment of in-lieu-of fees by non-union members voluntary rather than mandatory for government employees in the Beaver State. And Matthew Lysne, a senior assistant attorney general, could have easily reflected those wishes by writing a concise, accurate, objective ballot title such as, \"Allows public employees a choice of whether to pay fees in lieu of union dues.\" Instead, he demanded one that shows only his bias and was deliberately calculated to discourage support: \"Non-union public employees may benefit from union bargaining without sharing representation costs; modifies representation obligations.\" \nLysne had two goals with this language. First, he evaded the main point of the initiative and focused on a minor point — albeit the one most offensive to the unions — which is commonly known as the \"free rider\" argument. Unions define free riders as people who receive benefits of union-negotiated contracts but don't pay dues to the union. Lysne focused on this point instead of recognizing that Gibson's initiative would have relieved the unions of the obligation to represent employees who don't want representation in the first place. \nSecondly, Lysne made the title confusing because confusing voters is the best way to kill any ballot measure — and not even the most ingenious marketing can overcome this disadvantage. Lysne knows perfectly well the consequences of writing a confusing ballot title; just because the equally biased Oregon Supreme Court upheld his text in a recent legal challenge doesn't make it any less politicized. \nFor Gibson, the episode was déjà vu all over again. Two years ago, following a bruising legal battle, the Oregon Supreme Court assigned this title to a similar ballot measure: \"Allows non-union member public employees receiving required union representation to refuse to share representation costs.\" Again, the ballot title has the same two fatal flaws: First, it dodges the main point of the initiative, which was to give employees a choice to join the union or not; and secondly, it is confusing. \nOrganized labor has a stranglehold on Oregon government, and until its grip is loosened, few if any conservative ideas will advance — let alone an initiative the unions perceive as a frontal attack on their very livelihood. \nBallot titles have become highly politicized and the attorney general's office — as well as the Oregon Supreme Court — have become complicit in the political jousting. \nAnother recent example of mangled ballot titles is this one issued last week by the attorney general's office: \"Requires government actions/communications in English (with specified exceptions), limits laws allowing non-English documents/services.\" Unbelievably, this is a ballot title for an initiative that aims to make English the official language of Oregon. Apparently the irony of creating an incomprehensible ballot measure requiring English as the state's official language was lost on the authors. Perhaps the petitioners should begin by making English the official language of the attorney general's office. \nConservatives have to be asking themselves whether to just stop filing initiatives until the attorney general's office and the Oregon Supreme Court at least begin acting as though they are unbiased. And sadly, that's just exactly the way the left wants it. •", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:34:46.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
