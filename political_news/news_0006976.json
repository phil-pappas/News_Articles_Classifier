Promoted stories \nDeveloper TH Real Estate had planned to replace St Clements before starting work on shops and homes because the new centre has to open immediately after the Tanner Street site closes. \nDoctors have long been frustrated by delays to the relocation, first discussed more than a decade ago. Many rooms in the 1970s building are less than half the size required by modern NHS standards. \nAnswering Cllr Gottlieb's claims, council corporate director Steve Tilbury told a meeting earlier this month: \"A new surgery can't be developed as a separate project because the business case doesn't take into account that without the development of Silver Hill, there's no buyer for the doctors surgery and therefore there's nobody to move them along.\" \nSeeking a new deal would further delay the move, he added. \n\"We can't be certain, as I understand things, that the NHS would sanction the new surgery [if a new buyer is sought] – it will cost significantly more in rent.\" \nHowever, Mr Tilbury said in 2011 there could be \"significant private interest\" in building the surgery. Share article \nIn a report on the scheme, written before TH Real Estate agreed to take on the redevelopment, he said: \"Because the NHS will pay for a fair market rent for premises and provides an excellent covenant there could be significant private interest in the development of a new surgery building.\" \nSt Clements was unavailable for comment.
