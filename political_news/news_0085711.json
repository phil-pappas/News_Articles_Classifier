The Taliban claimed they shot the plane out of the sky, but the group is prone to exaggeration. \nThere are about 1,000 coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan, including U.S. and Polish forces, as well as about 40,000 Afghan troops, according to NATO. \nThere are also up to 35,000 civilian contractors across the country.
