(AP) â€” A Michigan city will receive $6 million in state funding to help switch its drinking water source after lead and other problems.\nGov. Rick Snyder approved nearly $9.4 million in aid for Flint on Thursday, the same day lawmakers finalized the legislation. It also includes money for water filters, inspections and lab testing.\nFlint stopped getting its water from Detroit's system last year in a cost-cutting move but has had trouble with water from the Flint River.\nThe state corroborated findings of elevated lead levels in children and disclosed higher levels in three Flint schools. Residents have complained about the water's safety, smell, taste and appearance.\nReturning to Detroit will cost $12 million through June.\nFlint will pay $2 million. The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation has pledged $4 million.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
