By Daniel Beekman Seattle Times staff reporter \nSeattle drivers might soon see reminders that they’re harming the environment each time they gas up their cars. \nThe city — following the lead of San Francisco and Berkeley — is considering requiring stickers on gas pumps telling drivers that burning fuel contributes to climate change. \nThe Seattle City Council sent a letter to the San Francisco board of supervisors this week applauding the supervisors for jump-starting the discussion. \n“Like you, we are feeling the effects of climate change acutely. Wildfires are raging in Eastern Washington and our hydro-powered utilities are suffering from less water flow than in previous years,” the letter said.

Councilmember Tom Rasmussen objected to the approach during a council briefing Monday . \n“I met with the young people who are promoting this,” he said. “What I would suggest first before regulating businesses would be to talk to the businesses … to see whether they would, on a voluntary basis, put labels like this on the pump handles.” \nCouncilmember Kshama Sawant disagreed. “Just to be clear, we’re talking about the oil lobby here,” she said. \nProponents of the stickers compare them to health warnings on packs of cigarettes. \nAji Piper, a West Seattle High School student who visited City Hall with Plant for the Planet, said he likes the idea of labeling gas pumps “because putting something in front of people that way might work better than trying to talk to them on the street.” \nPiper, 15, said the stickers could inform drivers about climate change and also suggest ways to help the environment, such as planting trees or riding the bus. \n“The choices we make today directly impact how I’ll be living tomorrow,” he said. \nThe Western States Petroleum Association, an oil-industry lobbying group, wrote letters to Berkeley officials last year objecting to legislation requiring the labels. \nThe association argued that such an ordinance would be unconstitutional because it would force gas stations to advance certain political opinions. \nO’Brien said his understanding is that San Francisco officials have an ordinance drafted and ready to be voted on. But he said he doesn’t know when a vote may occur. Officials in the city of North Vancouver, B.C., are moving ahead with gas-pump stickers. \nO’Brien said labels for Seattle likely would be inexpensive to produce and install and would make drivers think more about their cars and global warming. The result might be some drivers using their cars less or using electric cars, he said. Daniel Beekman: 206-464-2164 or dbeekman@seattletimes.com .
