Antonio “Moe” Maestas, an Albuquerque Democrat, although Duran acknowledged some of the issues could be due to simple misreporting. She also said Maestas could face a fine of up to $5,000 for amending his reports long after the filing deadline.\n“I trust that your office will thoroughly investigate this matter, including a thorough investigation of Representative Maestas’ personal and campaign filing accounts,” Duran wrote in her Sept. 24 letter to Balderas.\nAfter learning of Duran’s actions, Maestas criticized the secretary of state for not alerting him to the decision to refer his case for further investigation.\n“Going to the attorney general and the media instead of writing to me, in direct violation of state law, calls into question your motives in this matter,” Maestas said in a letter sent last week to Duran, citing a statute requiring that candidates be notified if they are found to be in violation of campaign finance guidelines.\nIn addition, the Democratic Party of New Mexico called on Duran to resign Tuesday, accusing her of embarking upon a “political vendetta” in an attempt to distract from her own legal case.\nAnd the New Mexico Political Journal, a blog edited by Rod Adair, a former top staffer in the Secretary of State’s Office who helped out on Duran’s re-election effort, said this week that Duran should step down for improperly handling the Maestas situation.\nThe secretary of state’s chief of staff, Ken Ortiz, said Tuesday that Duran approved the letter to the AG’s Office after staffers in her ethics bureau reviewed Maestas’ campaign reports and made a preliminary decision. He also said Maestas was one of 23 candidates referred to the Attorney General’s Office in recent weeks for campaign finance issues, though Maestas is the only sitting legislator.\n“Because the offices of both the secretary of state and attorney general extend far beyond the individual elected officials and the statutory relationship created between the offices in the Campaign Reporting Act, we do not believe a conflict of interest exists,” Ortiz told the Journal.\nDuran is a Republican who was elected secretary of state in 2010 – she became the first GOP secretary of state in 80 years – and was re-elected last year. Balderas is a first-term Democrat.\nMaestas, who has been a House member since 2007, is one of several lawmakers whose campaign reports have come under scrutiny since the charges were filed against Duran on Aug. 28.\nHe acknowledged earlier this month that he failed to report more than $11,000 in contributions to his re-election campaign last year, describing the issue as an error that will not be repeated. Maestas also updated his online campaign reports to reflect the contributions in question and provided bank records.\nIn his letter to Duran, Maestas said he worked this month with top staffers in the Secretary of State’s Office to amend his 2014 campaign reports, after KOB-TV reported on his undisclosed contributions.\nHowever, in the secretary of state’s referral to the attorney general, Duran said her office also conducted its own independent review of Maestas’ campaign filings and identified 15 apparent violations – including instances in which donors failed to list their occupations or addresses – and 15 additional discrepancies that had not been fixed.\nThose discrepancies were contributions reported by registered lobbyists – including a $300 donation from Maestas’ wife to his campaign – that Duran said did not appear on Maestas’ campaign filings.\nThe number of “anomalies” in Maestas’ campaign reports led the secretary of state’s ethics staff to determine it was more appropriate for the AG’s Office to handle the case, partly because it is better-equipped to review bank records, Ortiz said.\nBut an Attorney General’s Office spokesman said Duran’s referral cited potential civil violations of the state Campaign Reporting Act, not criminal violations.\n“Of course, regardless of the specific provision under which the referral was made, the attorney general will thoroughly investigate and follow up on this matter,” AG’s Office spokesman James Hallinan told the Journal .\nThe criminal charges against Duran include charges of fraud, embezzlement, money laundering and other crimes in connection with allegations that she used thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to cover personal spending at casinos.\nDuran has pleaded not guilty to the charges and indicated she intends to remain in the $85,000-per-year job, although a special legislative committee has been formed to investigate the charges against Duran and weigh possible impeachment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:48:46.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
