Advertisement More by this Author \nMombasa Governor Hassan Joho’s outburst against his critics for questioning his travels abroad and calling them “idiots” during the Mashujaa Day celebration has sparked mixed reactions from across the political divide. \nOn Tuesday, the governor shocked residents at Mombasa County Stadium when he lost his cool and made derogatory remarks against those questioning his foreign trips. \nAnd in defiance he told his critics that they were yet to see the last of these tours: “I have directed my people to book me a ticket. I am going to Turkey.” \nBut one of his close allies and Mvita MP Abdullswamad Nassir said people were reading too much from the public spat and missing the bigger picture of what the governor was doing to supplement the national revenue allocation. \n“Why are people creating a mountain out of a mole hill?” he asked and wondered why the governor was receiving the flak from some leaders and bashing from the social media. \nFor every trip the governor has taken, Mr Nassir said, there are results to show and his critics should not fear to establish the same by paying him a courtesy call. \nBut in a quick rejoinder, Nyali MP Hezron Awiti challenged Mr Joho to tell residents what the source of his travelling money was. \n“Our governor has made more foreign trips than the Head of State and we cannot see any changes here. Look at the mounting garbage, trust land is being grabbed left, right and centre and what is the governor doing – nothing!” he claimed. \nHe told the Sunday Nation that he would not stop criticising Mr Joho whether he called him an idiot or not until all the six constituencies receive their share of the county budget without discrimination.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:10:57.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
