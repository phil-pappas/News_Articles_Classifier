It has not come at the Broncos' expense since Peyton Manning arrived in Denver. The Broncos sauntered across the Bay Bridge with a perfect record as an imperfect team.\nThe offense remains too reliant on the pass, and Manning is throwing interceptions at a clip not seen since his first two seasons in the league. This is no longer Manning's team. But unlike the previous seasons, it no longer matters.\nFor the 14th consecutive time, the Broncos jumped into a boiling cauldron and climbed out with an AFC West road victory, stiff-arming the Raiders 16-10 Sunday with a defensive effort every bit as gnarly as the score.\nWATCH: Raiders Nation in Broncos Country: Behind Enemy Lines\n\"We treat these division games like championship games. That's why we win them all,\" said Pro Bowl cornerback Chris Harris, who clinched the victory with a 74-yard fourth-quarter interception return for a touchdown. \"We know how much they mean, trust me.\"\nAdvertisement This wasn't a bare knuckle win. It was white-knuckle. The Broncos once again made maddening mistakes, among them a pair of Manning interceptions. He has been picked off in the season's first five games for the first time since 1998 and 1999. The transgressions provided a window of opportunity for the Raiders, and the championship-caliber defense slammed it on their fingers.\nA Manning-led team won for only the fourth time without scoring an offensive touchdown. However, it's the second time this season, joining the season-opening triumph over the Baltimore Ravens. This didn't come down to the last play, only a recover of the Raiders' onside kick attempt by receiver Demaryius Thomas.\nThree words sum up the Broncos' victory, which moved them to 5-0 and in complete command in their division: No Fly Zone. Broncos cornerback Chris Harris adopted the slogan as a warning for quarterbacks not to test the Broncos' secondary last season. As they have for a month, the Broncos delivered their biggest play when it mattered most. They received some good fortune with a pair of missed field goals by Oakland's Sebastian Janikowski, but there's nothing lucky about the defense. Or Harris.\nWith the Raiders driving for a go-ahead a score, the Raiders quarterback Derek Carr tapped his feet, looking for an open target 5 yards down field. Receiver Seth Roberts streaked across the middle, appearing open. Carr threw behind Roberts. Roberts hails from West Alabama, the same school as New England Patriots Super Bowl savior Malcolm Butler. Roberts failed to deliver a miracle finish, watching helplessly as Harris snared the errant pass and created a vapor trail to the end zone.\nThe Orange Rush's fingerprints — the team is averaging four-plus sacks per game — remain smudged all over the Broncos' season. Harris' interception return represented the defense's third touchdown this season, more than running backs Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson combined. Without the defense, the division streak ends in Oakland. The unit, which welcomed back defensive end Derek Wolfe from suspension, but lost defensive end DeMarcus Ware to a back injury, proved the difference in the second half.\nThe Broncos secured their first lead on back-to-back possessions. Von Miller set up the first of Brandon McManus' second-half field goals with a strip sack. Manning, who was intercepted in the end zone in the first half on arguably his worst throw of the season, zipped a pass through Thomas' hands in the back of the end zone.\nThe next possession shoved Denver ahead 9-7 as McManus nailed a 52-yarder. Oakland Raiders safety Charles Woodson celebrated veteran's day, providing the raucous crowd hope with the second interception of Manning moments later. Woodson had never picked off the quarterback before Sunday, an asterisk he wanted to erase for the two 1998 draft class products.\nThe Raiders played just well enough to lose. They have dropped eight straight to the Broncos. Manning has never lost to Oakland. But more salient on his sun-bleached afternoon, Harris has never lost a division road game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:59:28.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
