This represents one of a number of energy storage projects in development by Johnson Controls for customers across North America .\nIdentifying the need to install a distributed energy storage system through its partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund Climate Corps Program (EDF), the Merchandise Mart chose to partner with Johnson Controls to enhance its energy storage capabilities.\nThe Merchandise Mart has relied on Johnson Controls' Integrated Demand Resources Group for many years to generate energy savings through multiple demand response programs. Leveraging this new energy storage solution, the Merchandise Mart will be able to participate in advanced fast response programs such as frequency regulation to adjust demand in response to changing conditions on the electric grid. Johnson Controls' Active Load Management strategy coupled with distributed energy storage, which is being used by the Merchandise Mart, has the potential to reduce a facility's annual electric spend up to 35 percent.\n\"Johnson Controls has been a longtime partner with the Merchandise Mart and its expertise in making buildings safe and comfortable is the reason we know their energy storage system will help our building become even more efficient,\" said Mark Bettin , vice president of Engineering and Sustainability for the Merchandise Mart.\nEncompassing 4.2 million square feet and hosting nearly 25,000 people each day, the Merchandise Mart, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, a New York company, is already the world's largest LEEDÂ® EB certified building, the benchmark recognition awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council for energy efficiency.\n\"The Merchandise Mart is a thought leader when it comes to energy management and we look forward to working with other facility owners who want to improve efficiency and unlock greater value to both the facilities and the overall reliability of the electric grid,\" said John Schaaf , vice president, Distributed Energy Storage, Johnson Controls. \"Our distributed energy storage solutions leverage our broad capabilities in battery and building technology and offer customers an effective way to lower their utility and operating costs.\"\nAccording to projections published by Navigant's Q4 2014 Community, Residential Energy Storage report, the distributed the energy storage market is forecast to grow to $16 billion by 2024.\nJohnson Controls will unveil its distributed energy storage solutions at Energy Storage North America in San Diego, California Oct. 13-15 .
