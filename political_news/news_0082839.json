In a letter to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), the California Democrat said Congress needs a select panel to study why mass shooting deaths occur and what legislation lawmakers could pass to stop the violence.\nThe shooting at Umpqua Community College was the 45th school shooting this year.\n\"I urge you to create a Select Committee on Gun Violence to confront this crisis and report back common sense legislation to help end it,\" Pelosi wrote. \"The bipartisan committee would be charged to present its recommendations to the House within 60 days â€“ in time for a vote before the third anniversary of the Newtown shooting this year.\"\nCreating select panels to probe specific issues is not unheard of in the House. There is the select committee investigating the Benghazi terrorist attacks and a proposed committee to look at Planned Parenthood.\nJeb Bush on gun violence: 'Stuff happens' By Daniel Strauss\nDemocrats have been pushing their Republican counterparts to pass stricter gun control laws since the school shooting at Newton and the attack on former congresswoman Gabby Giffords.\nThe efforts have stalled in the House and Senate.\nPelosi has pushed for bipartisan legislation that would strength background checks.\n\"How can we in good conscience engage in moments of silence to honor these victims of gun violence, if we refuse to take action. We take a solemn oath to protect and defend the American people,\" Pelosi wrote. \"We must not accept the horror of gun violence as routine.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:50:09.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
