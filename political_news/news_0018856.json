More than 500 schools are expected to be “modernized” under the plan.\nEmanuel said he visited with FCC officials five times during the last two years in order to secure the funds.\n“It allows us … to have education not just between the hours of eight and three, but so much learning goes on afterward,” Emanuel said. “While it’s still important to have a field trip, [a student] could actually have a field trip while sitting at their desk — in going to see art, going to see another part of the world, and having the highest speed and the capacity that allows kids to explore the world in a way that [earlier generations] were not allowed to and capable of.”\nClaypool said the upgrades will help CPS teachers “access cutting edge curriculum” available online.\n“Also, this will speed up by a year the mayor’s commitment to make computer science a requirement for graduation from Chicago Public Schools,” Claypool said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:12:28.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
