The government is expected to be sworn in next week.\nCenter-left opposition parties were incensed by the head of state's decision. They promised to use their combined parliamentary majority to quickly bring down the minority government by voting against its four-year policy program, which will be the first item on the new Parliament's agenda. Rejection of the program would force the government's resignation next month.\nSocialist leader Antonio Costa, who has been negotiating the creation of a left-of-center majority government with the Communist Party and radical Left Bloc, accused the president of triggering \"a pointless political crisis.\" He said President Anibal Cavaco Silva's decision was \"unacceptable\" and only postponed the inevitable rise to power of his unprecedented leftist alliance.\nAt the source of the current political upheaval is the 78 billion-euro ($86.6 billion) bailout that debt-heavy Portugal needed in 2011, when it was engulfed by the 19-nation eurozone's financial crisis. Creditors who provided the rescue loan demanded cuts in pay, pensions and public services, and tax hikes.\nThe government says more savings must be made. It got 38.4 percent of votes in the election but is outnumbered in the 230-seat Parliament, where its anti-austerity opponents have 122 seats.\nThe head of state said he couldn't give power to parties which oppose Portugal's membership of the shared euro currency — a reference to the Communists and Left Bloc.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
