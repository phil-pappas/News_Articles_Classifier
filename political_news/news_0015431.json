Martin O' Malley said he would make a good President 'for these times especially.' Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley — who’s made little secret of the fact he’s considering a 2016 White House bid — suggested over the weekend that he won’t wait to see whether Hillary Clinton enters the race to launch his own campaign.\nO’Malley, a popular blue-state Democrat with little national visibility, told the Washington Post Saturday that he has been meeting with policy experts, on both domestic and international issues, to develop a platform that would provide a “better way forward for our country.”\nO’Malley, 51, added that he felt he would be a good President, “for these times especially.”\nIn making his most direct comments to date regarding a potential 2016 bid, the Maryland pol also addressed how his own consideration of a run may intersect with Hillary Clinton’s plans.\nSean Gardner/Getty Images Former Seceratary of State Hillary Clinton would be the odds-on favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination if she runs. “I have a great deal of respect for Hillary Clinton,” O’Malley said . “But for my own part, I have a responsibility to prepare and to address the things that I feel a responsibility to address.”\n“To squander this important period of preparation because of horse-race concerns and handicapping concerns is just not a very productive use of energy,” he added , suggesting he won’t wait for Clinton to made a decision before he makes his own. “Right now, I’m going to keep doing what I’m doing — the thought work and the preparation work.”\nNevertheless, O’Malley wouldn’t say whether he had created a timeline for his decision and insiders told The Post he would probably skip a 2016 run if Clinton did decide to launch her own bid, out of loyalty to her.\nWashington Post/Getty Images Former President Bill Clinton and Maryland Gov. Martin O' Malley share a moment at an event for Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski. The two-term governor, however, would face an uphill battle for the nomination whether Clinton runs or not. According to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, Clinton received the support of 73% of likely Democratic and Democratic-leaning independents in a hypothetical race for the party’s presidential nomination.\nVice President Joe Biden received 12%, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren received 8%. O’Malley did not register any support in the poll.\nA separate Quinnipiac poll from January showed Clinton getting the support of 65% of likely Democratic voters. Biden followed with 8%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo got 3% and O’Malley got 1%.\nRelated Stories Hillary: I haven't driven in 18 years Rand Paul slams Bill Clinton's 'predatory' sexual behavior Benghazi is not enough to sink Hillary Day after State of the Union, Obama hits road to tout plans to boost wages For governors with an eye on 2016, 'State of the State' speeches are a pivotal moment Lis Smith vacations with Eliot Spitzer Tags: martin o'malley", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/not-waiting-for-clinton-md-gov-omalley-prepares-for-possible-presidential-bid/2014/02/01/d92fb132-8a85-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:13:18.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
