Islands States from the Pacific and Caribbean called UN and the major world powers for urgent action on climate change, when they took to the podium of the United Nations General Assembly on October 1st.\n“I speak as an islander who has walked the shores of many atoll islands, where there was once sandy beaches and coconut trees. Now there are none. I am told this will continue,” President Peter Christian of Micronesia told the Assembly and added that the international community must orchestrate cohesive actions “to bring a useful conclusion to help mitigate the threat of sinking islands and prevent the potential genocide of Oceanic peoples and cultures.”\nSolomon Islands’ Prime Minister Manasseh Sogovare noted that Solomon Islands tourism, fisheries and the livelihood of 85 per cent of its people are at risk from ocean acidification. Sea level rise already has seen land inundation, loss of biodiversity, threat to food security and the resulting relocation of populations from low lying islands to other parts of the country.\nPrime Minister Gaston Browne of the Caribbean State of Antigua and Barbuda chided the industrial world for its long-standing emission of globe warming gases for which the less developed islands are now paying the price.\n“The sadness is that these disasters are not occurring in these islands through their own fault,” he underlined and added. “They are happening because of the excesses of larger and more powerful countries, who will not bend from their abuse of the world’s atmosphere, even at the risk of eliminating other societies, some older than their own.” Browne underlined that “all industrialized nations should accept their responsibilities as the chief contributors in emitting high levels of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.”\nAntigua and Barbuda PM against listing of the islands as tax havens\nBrowne also condemned the recent listing in the United States and Europe of many Caribbean and Pacific Island States as “tax havens” and warned that “such wrongful tarnishing” could lead to US and European financial institutions cutting relations with their banks.\n“If that happens, no one in our small States will be able to pay for any goods or services purchased from the United States and Europe, including food, tuition for our young studying abroad and medication and medical bills for our people in need of specialist treatment,” he explained.\n“The consequences would be disastrous, since we would be excluded from the international payment system and would be unable to settle our trade and investment transactions. Our banking system would collapse, our economy would be irreparably damaged and our people would be plunged into abject poverty.”\nClimate Change Conference in Paris\nOn 27 September, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed his hope that a “durable, meaningful agreement,” at the UN climate change conference in Paris (COP 21) on December that “applies to all countries,” will be reached.\nBan said that the world leaders have voiced broad support for reaching a durable agreement in COP 21, that will accelerate investments in clean energy and spur a global, low-carbon transformation well before the end of the century, consistent with a below 2 degrees Celsius pathway.\nYesterday, President of Micronesia, also voiced hope that the COP21 would resolve the disagreements over allowable emissions of greenhouse gases by industrial nations. In addition, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands’ Manasseh said that “it is imperative that the Paris Conference delivers an ambitious, comprehensive and robust climate change Agreement that is inclusive and leaves no one behind.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:51:45.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
