(AP) â€” The South Carolina Supreme Court has rejected a request to remove the prosecutor investigating the police shooting of a 19-year-old man during a drug sting in Seneca.\nLawyers for the teen's parents said Solicitor Chrissy Adams should be taken off the case because she works closely with Seneca police.\nThe request asked the justices to stop allowing prosecutors to investigate law enforcement agencies in their counties. Prosecutors say only the Legislature can change that.\nIn a Monday ruling, the justices also said the parents aren't under threat of being prosecuted, so they can't challenge the prosecutor.\nZachary Hammond was killed in July by an officer who says he felt threatened as Hammond's car came toward him. Hammond's family says he was shot in the back, showing any threat was over.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:33:43.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
