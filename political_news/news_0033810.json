Since then, SynED has provided implementation and technical support to integrate Pearson applications to manage digital badges.\nABOUT SynED\nSynEd is a non-profit organization focusing on the gap between what business employers need and what education can offer. on Listening closely to employers, students, educators and government, SynEd identifies priorities, values and synergies of intention and technology that increase transparency and establish trusted communication between employers, jobseekers and education providers.\nSynEd understands the business environment and is able to identify and gain access to key business leaders that can contribute valuable information and appreciate the scope and purpose of educational innovations.
