Paul Ryan (R-WI) (Win Mcnamee/Getty Images) By Chris Cillizza October 23 at 1:17 PM Follow @thefix Congrats, Paul Ryan! You’re going to be the speaker of the House !\nOf course, you got the job (which you said you didn’t want just two weeks ago) only after the uber-conservative House Freedom Caucus tanked Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s chances . Even then, you couldn’t rally 80 percent of its members behind you.\nAnd while you’ll get the 218 votes you need to be the top-ranking Republican in the House — something no other GOPer could do! — it’s not entirely clear whether you will be able to get 218 of your party pals to support you on, say, raising the debt ceiling or funding the government. You know, the big stuff.\nThe good thing is that other members of your conference have pledged to help carry the fundraising burden of being speaker, so that you can spend time at home in Wisconsin with your wife and kids.\nOne thing on that, though: Donors are going to want to see you and not those other guys — particularly with McCarthy (Calif.) diminished and former speaker John Boehner (Ohio) soon gone. So . . .\nLook, being House speaker is still a great gig. You are going to love it. Just ask Boehner. Actually, on second thought, don’t.\nPaul Ryan, for getting the most powerful job you didn’t want with no guarantees that you’ll be able to succeed doing it, you had the worst week in Washington. Congrats, or something.\nEach week, Chris Cillizza awards the worst week in Washington to an inhabitant of Planet Beltway who stands out for all the wrong reasons.
