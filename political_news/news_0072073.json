(NASDAQ: MAR) celebrates more than 25 years of its global diversity and inclusion program, along with the 25 th anniversary of the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and National Disability Employment Awareness Month in the U.S. The company's recently released 2015 Sustainability Report highlights its support for diversity and inclusion commitments such as these, as well as its recent achievements and initiatives supporting the environment, local communities and youth employment.\nMarriott spotlights a nonprofit partner that shares its founders' name - the Marriott Foundation for People with Disabilities. Celebrating its 25 th year, the Foundation's Bridges from School to Work program was designed by Marriott's human resources associates and experts in the field of disabilities to transform the lives of young adults through the power of a job. More than 20,000 youth have benefitted from the program's services with more than 80 percent of participants securing local, competitive jobs in nine U.S. cities. The Foundation is committed to serving 1,500 Bridges young adults annually by 2018; this represents a 50 percent growth rate in just three years.\nThe personal stories of those who have benefitted from the program, such as that of this year's Annual Youth Achievement Award recipient, Maurice Dupree , inspire investments that make a difference. His story and thousands of others include the common themes of personal growth, potential realized and a path to a brighter future - discovered through hard work, resiliency and perseverance.\n\"Youth unemployment is a significant issue globally, and young adults with disabilities are that much more challenged to secure a job with employers like us,\" said Mari Snyder , Vice President, Corporate Social Responsibility at Marriott International. \"The Bridges team amazes me with their ability to work in a customized way to match the skills and potential of young adults with employers who can offer competitive opportunities in banking, retail, entertainment, foodservice, and hospitality, as well as in the government and nonprofit sectors.\"\nIn addition to featuring Marriott's work with the Bridges program, the 2015 Sustainability Report highlights the company's ongoing support for diversity and inclusion.
