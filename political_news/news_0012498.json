Chief Henry has my full support for his run for Sheriff and I could think of no one more qualified and able to continue to do all the good things we started on 7 years ago.” \nSteve Henry stated, “Sheriff Paul Babeu is a friend and we have accomplished great things together. I can think of no one else in Pinal County that has given so much back to the community and impacted peoples lives in such a positive way.
