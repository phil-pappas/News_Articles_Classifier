Cruz merely wanted to know if Mair was presented with evidence that the earth isn’t warming if he would acknowledge the evidence or change his mind on climate change. For warmists, that’s way too much to ask. But we’re supposed to trust their “science” which changes by the month, depending on the weather.\nAsked about the term “the pause” used by global warming activists to refer to the inconvenient data, Mair repeatedly squirms and confers with advisors – then persistently ignores Cruz’s questions.\nLikewise, when Sen. Cruz asks Mair if the Sierra Club would be willing to issue a retraction if presented with data showing the Earth is not “cooking,” as Mair claimed it is, Mair stubbornly refused to answer, repeatedly saying that his organization stands by its position that man-made global warming is plaguing the planet.\nWhen Mair asserted that the “science is settled” and the debate over because “a preponderance of the evidence” suggests he’s right, Cruz – who practiced law as Solicitor General for Texas – set him straight, pointing out that “preponderance of evidence” means as little as 51% – not nearly enough to forbid debate on a subject.\n( Read More )\nThe Pirate’s Cove summed it up pretty well :\nThat’s ‘climate change’ belief in a nutshell: there is nothing that will convince 97% of Warmists that they’re beliefs are wrong. If, as some scientists suggest, the Earth goes into a slight cooling phase, similar to the 40’s through 70’s (which resulted in news magazines wondering if the Earth was headed for a new ice age), members of the Cult of Climastrology will have plenty of excuses, while at the same time blaming Mankind for the cooling while still claiming that destructive warming is coming soon. If the Earth went into an typical Holocene cool period, ala the Little Ice Age, or even a new glacial period, they would do the same.\nNothing will ever change their minds because this is not about science, but political belief.
