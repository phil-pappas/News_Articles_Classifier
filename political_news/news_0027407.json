The survey was conducted by pollster Daron Shaw and was in the field from Sept. 8 to Sept. 21. A professor of government at the University of Texas, Shaw says Texans' attitudes on marriage follow a similar trend as national numbers. \n\"We're slightly less accepting than the nation, but that makes sense given the religious and political structure of Texas,\" said Shaw. \"So there's a trend towards support for gay marriage.\" Poll shows Texans not so conservative on marriage, pot \nThe most Texans, 24 percent, again listed immigration as the top issue facing the state, followed by education, jobs and border security. A 62 percent majority supported lawmakers' decision to spend $800 million on controversial border security efforts. The issue has remained politically potent even as the economy improves, leading Shaw to wonder whether border security has become a sort of proxy for feelings that the government isn't doing its job. \n\"Maybe we're seeing that a little bit in Texas, that that's something that's a marker with long-term disaffection for the way things are going,\" said Shaw. \nA full 46 percent of Texans support legalizing marijuana, while 57 percent support lowering the penalty through decriminalization. \n\"Support for that position is going up considerably,\" Shaw said, \"And I was speculating that maybe it's a case that the conversation around sentencing is influencing attitudes towards legalization.\" \nThe bottom line: the results are a reminder that Texas is as diverse as it is vast. \n\"But that diversity is manifest in kind of complex opinions on a wide range of issues,\" said Shaw. \"We're not reflexively conservative on things necessarily. How you frame an issue, the policy options that are presented to people has a big influence on whether we're supportive or opposed.\" \nView more 2015 Texas Lyceum Poll results HERE .  //kvue.tv/1FGvnry TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:46:08.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
