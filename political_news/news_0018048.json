Anna Rose of U.S. Park Police said Friday morning that the operators of the drone were on Washington Monument grounds overnight. She says the drone landed — and may have crashed — across Constitution Avenue on the Ellipse, a grassy park just south of the White House.\nRose says the operators were issued federal tickets, but were not arrested. Rose says there's no indication that the operators had any nefarious intent.\nShe says she expects to release more details later in the day.\nWashington and communities within a 15-mile radius of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport are part of a \"No Drone Zone\" under rules adopted after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:15:32.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
