When he is not teaching, he is at home raising his two children, Josyln, 6, and Joey, 4 with his wife Christina. \"I am not a politician. I am a teacher and family man who became tired of watching the political circus and decided to jump in and fix things,\" Fraser explains.\nFraser's campaign emphasizes the need for the right representative in office to be the voice of the constituents in the district by calling for a voter referendum. As representative, when an issue requires Fraser's input, he will call upon the people of his district. \"The process is really simple,\" Fraser assures. \"Voters will send in a registration card, be assigned a polling location near their homes, and when the time comes, they will be asked to voice their views and opinions on the issues that will affect them by placing a vote.\" After volunteers tally up the votes and notify Fraser of the majority, he will place the vote the people want him to.\n\"I will vote the way the majority of my constituents tell me to, regardless of what my own personal beliefs or opinions are,\" said Fraser. \"By electing me for Representative of the 8 th District, you will be guaranteed true representation in Washington .\"\nIn addition to Fraser reciprocating the opinions of the voters, he does not plan on keeping his salary. Instead, his $174,000 annual salary will be used to pay for official travel, an expense which is actually reimbursable. \"I will not be taking my salary nor the travel reimbursements,\" Fraser explained. \"I am not doing this for the money. I want the voters to know that I am running for the right reasons.\"\nAs an Independent, Fraser's petition period for signatures to place him on the General Election ballot next year begins March 29 . \"We plan to hit the ground running come springtime,\" Fraser said.\nWebsite: www.voteforfraser.com\nTwitter: @VoteBillFraser\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/voteforfraser\nMedia inquiries: contact Jay Flynn , Campaign Manager, at jay@voteforfraser.com .\nPaid for by Founding Fathers for Fraser, Inc.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schaumburg-high-school-teacher-announces-run-for-congress-300163360.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.voteforfraser.com/", "http://www.facebook.com/voteforfraser", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/schaumburg-high-school-teacher-announces-run-for-congress-300163360.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG33829&Transmission_Id=201510201647PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG33829&DateId=20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:14:47.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
