Lindsey Graham and John McCain came to stump for Graham's bid for the Republican presidential nomination, maybe the best question the South Carolina senator fielded was from a woman who asked why he wanted to be president. “I think I am the best qualified to be the next Commander in Chief,” Graham said. “I am running because I hate what is happening to our country right now. I believe I have the skill set to work with both Republicans and Democrats to do what is needed.” The senators stopped by the Pink Cadillac Diner, aptly named for the 1955 pink Cadillac with the Elvis license plate displayed high in the air outside the diner. Owner Lennie Bernard said the diner is a popular stop for politicians. “They can all come here,” Bernard said. “They call and ask, and I am fine with them, Democrats and Republicans. Rand Paul and Chris Christie have already been here. We have had George Pataki and Kelly Ayotte. People can come hear who they want to.” Graham talked about his simple beginnings and how he earned his way. “My dad owned a liquor store, a bar and a pool hall,” he said. “I learned a lot growing up. I was the first in my family to attend college. I have learned a lot by being mentored by John (McCain).” If elected, Graham said he will rebuild the country's military. “I think if we do not deal with threats from groups like ISIL, they will be coming here,” Graham said. “I want us to go there and deal with them. They are waging a religious war and believe they must wipe out infidels like us. They are the way they are and I don't why, but we have to recognize that and deal with them on their soil. I want troops in their country. I have 33 years of experience in the Air Force and I will make this country strong.” Addressing mental health issues and not stricter gun control is how Graham would address the school shootings and other violence in the country. “I am not in favor of banning assault rifles, and I own an AR15 myself, among other guns,” he said. “I am a believer in the Second Amendment. I think we need to identify mental health issues and address people who buy guns illegally. Schools need to add better defenses and I would leave that up to individual states to decide how. I would be willing to work with them but they are on the front line.” Graham said the country has debt the next generation cannot possibly repay. He said it is important to protect Social Security and Medicare but adjustments need to be made. “Becoming the world power the U.S. once was means investing in countries like Africa, helping them become self-sufficient,” Graham said. “They will become allies and it's a smart thing to do.” The Affordable Care Act needs to be replaced with private sector competition, Graham said, adding people should be able to choose their health care plans on their own. Graham also spoke about his views on immigration and the heroin epidemic in the country. McCain, a longtime friend, said he is campaigning with Graham because he believes Graham is the best choice for the country. “I believe   are not swayed by political ads,” McCain said. “You make up your own minds, based on what you see. Well, our country is in crisis right now and we need a candidate who can bring us back to what we were. I think that is Lindsey Graham.” McCain spoke of the unrest in the Middle East and his opinion that Russia's Vladamir Putin is exploiting that because he senses weakness in the United States. “The next president has to reverse eight years of a decline in our power,” McCain said. “That person is here today.” By Karen Dandurant", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:37:59.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
