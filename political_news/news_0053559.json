Let's tell all the immigrants working at Trump Hotel to stay home tomorrow.' See what happens. Are you kidding me? ... Look who's serving you. Guess who's cooking in the back,\" Powell said. \"Next time you walk through Dulles or Reagan, look who's manning the counter. Look who's cleaning things up. These are first generation American immigrants, who will raise children, who will grow up to higher things.\" \nPowell said the Republican Party has \"shifted much further right than the country is,\" and said that party leaders \"cannot keep saying the things that they are saying ... and hope to be successful at national level elections in the future.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:58:41.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
