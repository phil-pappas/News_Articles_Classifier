Continued tax increases to our county’s suburban communities are financially strangling residents, from those in starter homes to senior citizens on fixed incomes.\nThis year, the Democrat machine raised taxes astronomically countywide. County taxes in my hometown of West Milford increased over $1.2 million this year – about a 6-percent increase – with no increase in county level services.\nThe same story holds true throughout most of Passaic County, where it seems that Paterson and Passaic reap the benefits of tax relief from the Democratic freeholder board. It is no wonder that, in turn, the Democrats receive much support from the voters in those two cities.\nBut where is the relief for the people of West Milford? Bloomingdale? Pompton Lakes? Ringwood? Wanaque? Wayne? Continued tax increases with nothing to show for it seem to be an all-too-familiar mantra. It is time to break this absolute control and show the Democrats that we all need some relief.\nOn Nov. 3, 2015, we have a choice to end the insanity. We have a choice to restore fiscal responsibility and accountability to the freeholder board. We have a choice to stop senseless spending, end unnecessary bonding, and take our stand against the Democrat machine’s way of doing business.\nThis Election Day, I encourage those who are fed up with how things have gone to set the tone for how things are going to go in Passaic County. I ask that residents please join me in voting for better government by electing Joe Cupoli, Joan Walsh, and Sami Merhi for freeholder.\nMatthew Conlon, \nRepublican Municipal chairman, \nWest Milford", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:26:13.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
