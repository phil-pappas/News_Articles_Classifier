It tags her on the property tax increase and asks the question “Is the Tax Queen a Career Politician?” 16 Years is too long. It’s time for a change” \nSheehan has said the message has gotten distorted, and that imposed caps on commercial properties led to a substantial decrease in revenue that led to a 40 percent decrease in the city’s revenue and the $7 dollar per month increase is below 2009 levels. \nNavy Veteran Aretha Olivarez is also running.
