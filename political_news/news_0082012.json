John Kasich has been pushing Ohio lawmakers for three years to increase Ohio’s tax on shale fracking, and it looks like the wait will continue. \n\nAs part of a two-year budget that excluded any changes to Ohio’s severance tax, a new legislative panel, the 2020 Tax Policy Study Committee, was ordered to produce a report on potential changes to the tax by today, Oct. 1. \n\nThat committee has not yet met, and a subgroup of lawmakers who have been working behind closed doors specifically on the severance tax issue is not yet ready to release its report to the 2020 Committee.\n>> Keep up on political news and insights with our Dispatch Politics newsletter.   Sign up today. \nSenate President Keith Faber, R-Celina, told reporters on Wednesday that he expected the report would be ready today. \n\nSen. Bob Peterson, R-Sabina, said the final report is still being written and should be ready within the next week or two. \n\n“We’re reporting our discussions to the 2020 Study Committee. Then the 2020 Study Committee will have a more detailed report, I would expect,” Peterson said. “We are trying our best to meet the deadline within the challenges of some of the nuances of Ohio Revised Code.” \n\nThe politically influential oil and gas industry largely opposed a severance tax increase when oil prices were significantly higher, and they continue to oppose it now that prices have fallen, arguing that the industry is in a recession and cannot absorb additional cost without significant consequences. \n\nThe Kasich administration has long argued that so long as the valuable resources are here, and Ohio’s tax rates are in line with or lower than other major energy-producing states, oil drillers will continue to come to Ohio. \n\n“Oil and gas productivity in our state continues to break records, yet our outdated tax system hasn’t kept up,” Kasich spokesman Joe Andrews said today. “The governor remains committed to making sure that these companies pay a fair share of the profits they reap by tapping Ohio’s new-found oil and gas resources so that we can continue to cut the income tax for all Ohioans and invest in communities.” \n\nKasich has proposed severance tax increases four times as part of traditional and off-year budgets, but GOP lawmakers stripped out the provisions each time. The oil and gas industry has argued hard against Kasich’s tax increases are too large, hurting drillers as they try to expand in Ohio and costing the state jobs. \n\nOil and gas interests gave about $1.2 million to legislative Republicans last election cycle, and the industry's increased operations in a handful of eastern counties has made it popular among lawmakers from those regions in both political parties. \n\nThe governor said during his 2015 State of the State speech: “I'm disappointed by those who say the severance tax reform will kill the industry. That's a joke. That's a big fat joke because I've talked to them in private.” \n\nKasich has called Ohio’s current rate of 20 cents on a barrel of oil a “total and complete rip-off to the people of this state.” \n\n“It isn’t fair to Ohioans, because these resources are being depleted,” Kasich said in February. “Much of the wealth the shale boom is generating is being shipped out of our state.” \n\nThe Ohio House passed a severance-tax bill in 2014, but Kasich criticized it as “puny” and the Senate declined to act. The Senate appeared ready to take the lead on the issue this spring as part of the two-year budget that passed in late June, but a deal ultimately fell apart, leading to further study and the deadline of today for a report. \n\n“The severance working group is diligently working on its draft report,” Peterson said. “ Changing market conditions within the oil and gas industry provided an extra challenge, and we believe it is far more important to get it right than to meet a calendar guideline.” \n\nFaber, according to Gongwer News Service, said Wednesday that the severance tax report would be a “concept document,” and Ohioans shouldn’t expect to see any tax impact on state revenues for years. Faber has talked about implementing some type of tax trigger related to market prices. \n\njsiegel@dispatch.com \n\n@phrontpage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:26:08.283+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
