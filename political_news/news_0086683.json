If they want to be taken seriously they need to have a good look at what they think their objectives are. The Education Secretary must investigate this.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-03T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:55:32.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
