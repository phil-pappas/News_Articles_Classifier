It is why he has, throughout his life, embraced Marxism and Islam, both of which have a mutual hatred of Judeo-Christian democracy and a shared belief that the United States, as the cornerstone of Western civilization, is the embodiment of evil in the world.\nObama’s “transformation” is a euphemism for the degradation and humbling of a great nation he considers racist, oppressive, venal and dysfunctional unless properly controlled by the collectivist prescriptions of world government.\nPerhaps any tendencies toward malignant narcissism that Obama might have, his constant lying and his antipathy for the American experience can be traced to a traumatized childhood, a mother who disregarded his basic needs and ultimately abandoned him; an absent father, who was replaced by a hardcore, card-carrying communist and pornographer.\nObama’s childhood mentor, Frank Marshall Davis was pro-Soviet, pro-Red China and wrote for Party-line publications such as the Chicago Star and the Honolulu Record; contributors to the former actually served as secret agents for Joseph Stalin. Davis argued that President Harry Truman was a fascist, racist, and imperialist, and the United States was handing West Germany back to the Nazis, while Stalin was pursuing “democracy” in East Germany and throughout the Communist Bloc. He portrayed America’s leaders as “aching for an excuse to launch a nuclear nightmare of mass murder and extermination” against the Soviets and the Chinese- as eager to end all civilization.\nAccording to Paul Kengor , writing in The American Spectator, there are some truly remarkable similarities between the political actions of Obama and the ideas contained in Frank Marshall Davis’ columns, such as: rejecting Winston Churchill; advocating wealth redistribution; favoring taxpayer funding of universal health care; supporting government stimulus; bashing Wall Street; trumpeting the public sector over the private sector; lambasting “excess profits”; warning God-and-gun clinging Americans about huckster preachers; seeking the political support for “social justice;” excoriating the “tentacles of big business,” bankers, big oil, corporate profits; lambasting tax cuts that “spare the rich;” singling out the “corporation executive” for not paying his “fair” share; and so on.\nBy the autumn of 1980, as a student at Occidental College, nineteen-year-old Obama was already known as an ardent Marxist. Some years later he would become a friend and colleague of the America-hating, radical leftist and unrepentant domestic terrorist Bill Ayers.\nI have previously described the policies of the Obama Administration as the intersection of radical ideology and incompetence.\nObama is “incompetent” as a President in the sense that his narcissism prevents him from accepting responsibility and learning from his mistakes. His ideologies, namely Marxism and sympathy for Islam, compound that “incompetence” by driving him to pursue policies that run counter to the national interest and the well-being of the American people.\nSorry, but I just don’t think he’s on our side.\nhttp://familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/what-makes-obama-tick\nRead more great articles at Familiy Security Matters:\nhttp://familysecuritymatters.org/\nPermission to Post", "external_links": ["http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/imgLib/20151014_obamatickwatch_.jpg", "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/narcissistic-personality-disorder/basics/definition/con-20025568", "http://familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/what-makes-obama-tick", "http://spectator.org/articles/34799/dreams-frank-marshall-davis", "http://familysecuritymatters.org/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_narcissism", "http://www.familysecuritymatters.org/publications/detail/americas-only-remaining-choices-civil-disobedience-or-collapse", "http://www.wnd.com/2012/07/heres-why-obama-lies/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1550591983"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:13:39.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
