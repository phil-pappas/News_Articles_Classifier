(AP) - The West Virginia Ethics Commission has fined the mayor of Marmet $2,000. \nThe commission announced the fine and public reprimand Thursday against Mayor Bill Pauley. In an agreement with the commission, Pauley admitted using his office for private gain. \nHe admitted that after a voters’ registration deadline has passed in 2013, he drove people to the Marmet Town Hall to vote early in the town’s 2013 general election despite knowing they either weren’t properly registered or weren’t residents of the town. \nHe also admitted instructing Marmet poll workers to accept the ineligible voters’ votes. \nThe commission dismissed a separate complaint alleging Pauley asked the town’s computer and software vendor to generate a check reimbursing him for work during town bingo games. \n___ \nInformation from: Charleston Daily Mail, http://www.charlestondailymail.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:09:03.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
