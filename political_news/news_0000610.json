However, there was word of a possible up or down vote on the Governor’s proposed tax package Thursday morning, which could turn the tide in negotiations.“There aren't the votes in the House for the broad-based tax increases that the Governor has proposed and it's Republican and Democrat,” said Rep. Dave Reed, (R) House Majority Leader.But that question will be answered next Wednesday when the Governor's tax package plan to fund the state budget will go to a full floor vote. Republican leaders agreed to let this happen because they don't think there is enough votes for it to pass.That means House Democrats, who are sorely outnumbered in the chamber, will have less than a week to rally 102 votes to try and get the Governor's spending plan through the Republican controlled House. The proposal includes an increase in the personal income tax from 3.07 to 3.49 percent, and a severance tax on natural gas.“What we are for is restoring the spending cut that have happened over the past four years,\" said Representative Frank Dermody, (D) House Minority Leader. \"This is the fifth year of a Corbett budget. It doesn't treat human services and education fairly. We want a comprehensive budget that does just that.\"Negotiations for a final state budget have been hinging for months on the Governor's tax package. The governor wants to raise the income tax from 3.07 to 3.49 percent. He also wants to get rid of a bunch of exemptions in the state's sales tax code while instituting a severance tax for natural gas drillers. The governor and democrats want to put this new money towards increasing education funding and health and human services. The Republicans say, the problem is there isn't enough interest from lawmakers to get it passed.“We can fool ourselves all we want. There are not enough votes in this chamber to raise the personal income tax and sales tax to increase spending,” Reed said.The republicans think the measure will fail next Wednesday and when it does, they fully expect the Governor to finally give up on the tax increases and negotiate a state budget with some new numbers.The Democrats would need to persuade at least 18 Republicans to vote in favor of their plan.At the same time, there is a push by a Republican lawmaker to raise the income tax to 3.32 percent, instead of the Governor's 3.49 percent. The future of that bill is still undetermined. Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:53:21.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
