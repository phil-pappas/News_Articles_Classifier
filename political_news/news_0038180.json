The term is sometimes misidentified as \"strict constructivism.\" The practice of strict constructionism requires a judge to apply the text of the law in a formalist way -- only as it is written. This means a judge or panel of judges must first obtain a clear meaning of the text. Once the text of a law is interpreted clearly, there is no need to draw further inferences from statutes of the law. Strict constructionism belongs to a family of judicial interpretation theories known as \"originalism.\" Employing strict constructionism is one way for conservative judges to practice judicial restraint. \nPronunciation: strikt kunstrukshinizim \nAlso Known As: judicial conservatism, originalism, textualism \nAlternate Spellings: strict constructionist, strict construction \nCommon Misspellings: strict constructivism \nExamples: \nWhen President George W. Bush campaigned for president, he promised to nominate \"strict constructionists in the mold of Justices Rehnquist , Scalia , and Thomas .\" Related Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:18:36.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
