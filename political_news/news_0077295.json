Gov. Kathy Hochul met with the Central New York Regional Economic Development Council on Wednesday to discuss the region's proposal to win a portion of the $1.5 billion Urban Revitalization Initiative competition. Seven regions are competing and three winners will receive $500 million each, which will go towards permanent private sector jobs and investments. \nHochul, who was in Syracuse for the governor's Capital for a Day event, said central New Yorkâ€™s council has made a good effort to reach out to the community for input about its submission. \n\"It's all about, bringing the stakeholders together. Business, academia, labor, not-for-profits but even the citizens of this community need to have their voices heard and that's what's been accomplished.\" \nThe deadline for central New York to submit its proposal to the economic competition is Monday. A decision on the winners will be made in December. \nHochul also announced a new transportation initiative for low-income people. The state will invest $100,000 in Syracuse Express , a company that transports people from Syracuse to New York City. The funds will be used to buy two, 14-seat buses that will bring people in low-to-moderate-income neighborhoods to workforce training centers. Syracuse Express will collaborate with workforce development organizations such as the Syracuse Work Train, the Spanish Action League and the Syracuse Model Neighborhood Facility.
