We know that extended solitary confinement deprives people of meaningful activities, frequently leads to despair and anger, destabilizes the sense of self, exacerbates mental illness and makes it harder for people to relate to others.\nWhen will we stop worrying about “coddling” people who are incarcerated and start worrying about public safety and the effective use of tax dollars? Putting aside for a moment the issue of whether as a country we mind subjecting people to what is arguably a form of torture, and whether we are at all bothered by the fact that many people end up in solitary confinement for minor offenses, do any of us want someone who has experienced such extreme treatment for extended periods to be released into our neighborhoods?\nSusan Hills Rose , Columbia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:29:53.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
