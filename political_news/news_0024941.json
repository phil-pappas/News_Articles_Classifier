(Photo: AFP) Rajkot : Riding on a superb all-round performance by Ravindra Jadeja, Saurashtra have taken a first innings lead against Jharkhand on the first day of their Group C Ranji Trophy match here on Thursday.\nAfter bundling out Jharkhand for a meagre 168, Saurashtra scored 205 to take a slender 37-run lead in the first innings at stumps on day one.\nElecting to bat, Jharkhand kept losing wickets at regular interval as Jadeja wreaked havoc, taking six wickets for 71, while Kamlesh Makvana (4/46) also chipped in with four scalps.\nOpener Ishan Kishan top scored with 87 but only three other batsmen could reach the double-digit mark. Replying to Jharkhand's total, Saurashtra also did not have a good start and they also failed to apply themselves.\nBut thanks to Jadeja's 75-ball 58, the home team managed to take a slight edge over their opponents. For Jharkhand, Shahbaz Nadeem claimed four for 38.\nBrief scores: Jharkhand 1st innings: 168 all out (I Kishan 87; R Jadeja 6/71, K Makvana 4/46); Saurashtra 1st innings: 205 all out (R Jadeja 58, C Pujara 27; S Nadeem 4/38).\n Cricket Ranji Trophy Ravindra Jadeja Team India Cheteshwar Pujara Also Read A five-for tomorrow will be my answer to critics: Ravindra Jadeja All-round Ravindra Jadeja gives Saurashtra a bonus point in Ranji game Captain Dhoni backs Ravindra Jadeja Happy birthday to 'Sir' Ravindra Jadeja", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/sports-cricket/article/ranji-trophy-sir-ravindra-jadeja-teaches-jharkhand-lesson", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Sir_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Sir_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:41:32.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
