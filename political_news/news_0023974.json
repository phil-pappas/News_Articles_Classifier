Federal Judge Leigh May said she will make her decision on whether the case against the city of of Atlanta should be dismissed \"soon.\" Kelvin Cochran was fired from his position after he published the comments in his book Who Told You That You Were Naked?. The book called homosexuality \"unclean\", \"a sexual perversion\", \"vulgar\", and \"inappropriate\". In January, Mayor Kasim Reed said Cochran was fired for violating personnel rules. \nWas it wise for Cochran to publish a book on a controversial issue when he holds a prominent position with the City? Maybe not. But if he wasn't selling copies of the book at the workplace or on company time, his book truly serves as an expression of his beliefs, so he has the right to express them as a private citizen, and it would seem the City as not right to terminate him. \nCochran's attorneys told News 11 this, “A religious or ideological test cannot be used to fire a public servant, but that’s what the city did,” Theriot said. “That places every city employee in jeopardy who may hold to a belief that city officials don’t like. Tolerance must apply to people of all different viewpoints, not just those who agree with the beliefs the government favors.” \nTolerance is something the left begs for everyone from homosexuals to animal rights activists, but they seem to forget that people who disagree with them deserve the same right. Tolerance is for everyone, not just those on the left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:51:55.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
