That whole area was used for clay extraction from about the 15th c. and many of the clay-pits were used by the Victorians as landfill sites. Wouldn't be surprised if a few more holes open up around there as loose material settles or gets washed away. Thanks for the insight.Got to feel sorry for the residents. The location of the hole means the entire street of around 40 houses cannot use their cars and have to leave the street on foot via someone's garden - what a major ballache for them.I can't imagine it will be quick to fix either - several weeks or maybe even months. In China it would have been filled and tarmaced over already!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:44:54.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
