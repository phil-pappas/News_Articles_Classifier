At least 19 are dead... \nHe added, \"An airstrike was then called to eliminate the Taliban threat and several civilians were accidentally struck.\" \nThe following day, however, Campbell told the Senate Armed Services Committee, \"To be clear, the decision ... was a U.S. decision made within the U.S. chain of command. A hospital was mistakenly struck. We would never intentionally target a protected medical facility.\" \nAsked about the location of any U.S. troops on the ground, Campbell said, \"We had a special operations unit that was in close vicinity that was talking to the aircraft that delivered those fires.\" \nHis remark did not make clear whether any American on the ground had a direct view of the hospital. Military officials declined to answer questions, citing the investigation. \nAccording to the former intelligence officer, the commander on the ground has told superiors he was in the worst firefight of his career while taking fire from the building, which he said he did not know was a hospital. He requested the gunship strike. In that scenario, it's not readily apparent why his unit couldn't have retreated. The hospital is within a compound surrounded by a 12-foot wall that could have offered cover from fire emanating from one building. \nThe intelligence analysts who were gathering information about suspected Taliban activity at the hospital were located in various bases around Afghanistan, and were exchanging information over classified military intelligence systems. Typically, a decision to order a strike in a populated area would require many layers of approval and intelligence analysis of the potential impacts and civilian casualties. \nIt would be significant if U.S. intelligence had concluded that Pakistani spies were continuing to play an active role helping the Taliban. The U.S. and Afghan governments have long accused Pakistan of aiding the Taliban, but U.S. rhetoric on the issue has cooled over the past year as American-Pakistani counterterrorism cooperation has improved. \nYet it's theoretically possible that a staffer at a hospital in Afghanistan was working for Pakistan's intelligence service. Two days before the strike, Afghan defense officials accused Pakistan's intelligence service of playing a key role in the Taliban's seizure of Kunduz. \nNicolai said, \"There were only Afghan staff and nine international staff, none of whom were from Pakistan, working in the hospital. There was absolutely nothing that indicated at any level, including at senior management, that any of our staff was working for Pakistani intelligence.\" \nDisputes within the U.S. government about airstrikes have played out before. In December 2013, the U.S. military's Joint Special Operations Command bombed a group of people it considered militants, but whom outside groups claimed were civilians attending a wedding. Even after the CIA assessed that some civilians were killed in the strike, Pentagon officials continued to insist that all those hit were combatants. \nThe incident added an argument for some members of Congress who were resisting Mr. Obama's proposal to shift the CIA's drone killing program to the military.
