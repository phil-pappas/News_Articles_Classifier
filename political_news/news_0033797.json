(AP) - The Wisconsin state Assembly is poised to approve making Wisconsin the first state in the country to make it legal for candidates to coordinate with outside issue advocacy groups. \nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court in July ruled that candidates can coordinate with groups that do not expressly call for the election or defeat of a candidate. The bill before the Assembly on Wednesday would put that into state law. \nIt also makes a series of additional changes in reaction to other court rulings striking down portions of Wisconsinâ€™s law. \nThe bill would double how much candidates can accept from individuals, allow unlimited corporate donations to political parties and legislative campaign committees and do away with the requirement that donors over $200 disclose their employer. \nDemocrats oppose the bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:51:47.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
