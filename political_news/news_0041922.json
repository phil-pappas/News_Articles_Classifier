We vote for Mr. Trump!\"\nRead More She said Friday that she was not at all concerned about Trump's plan to deport all estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. or his comments that undocumented Mexican immigrants are \"rapists\" and \"killers.\"\n\"It doesn't bother me at all. Mr. Trump he is 100% right,\" she said. \"He is our perfect man. He is my perfect man ... everything he says is absolutely right.\"\nShe said she was motivated to support Trump after reading his books and hearing about his charity work.\n\"He is our man sent from heaven. He's a very very beautiful human being, beautiful heart, a lot of love and compassion,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:51:43.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
