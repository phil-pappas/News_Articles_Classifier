But they will have to wait a little longer for new features that will allow them to search for plans that cover specific doctors and prescription drugs, administration officials said.\n“The consumer experience this year will be easier and faster,” said Andrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, unveiling a website that has been overhauled and improved. “The response time will be 40 percent faster than last year.”\nAdministration officials gave journalists a preview of the new website on Friday. Consumers can begin window shopping for health plan options on Sunday. Actual purchasing of plans begins Nov. 1, the first day of open enrollment.\n Related Coverage Investigation Finds Errors in Coverage and Payments Under Affordable Care Act OCT. 22, 2015 Tests of New Features on HealthCare.gov Go to the Wire OCT. 19, 2015 Careful Calculus Guides Obama Administration in Health Insurance Projections OCT. 16, 2015 Makeover Coming for HealthCare.gov OCT. 12, 2015 Jeb Bush Offers Health Plan That Would Undo Affordable Care Act OCT. 13, 2015 Little Growth Predicted on Health Exchanges OCT. 15, 2015 The website, the main entry point for people seeking insurance in 38 states served by the federal exchange, includes three major new features.\nOne, which will be ready on Sunday, allows consumers to see an estimate of total yearly costs for each health plan, based on factors like their age, sex, income, ZIP code and how much health care they expect to use.\nA second feature will allow people to enter the names of doctors and hospitals and get back a list of health plans that cover those providers. In the last two years, consumers had to visit the website of each insurer to see which doctors and hospitals were in its network. That could be laborious and time-consuming.\nA third new feature will allow people to find health plans that cover their prescription drugs.\nKevin J. Counihan, the chief executive of the federal insurance marketplace, could not say when the doctor and drug search tools would be available, beyond promising that it would be soon. The government and insurers are still testing the tools.\nInsurers were supposed to provide the government with data on their doctors, hospitals and drugs by Oct. 1, but much of the information has not been submitted in the proper format or checked for accuracy, officials said.\n“In an ideal world, we would have gotten 100 percent of the data and have it validated, and we would be ready to go right this second,” Lori Lodes, a spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Friday. “But we have a little over half of the data validated, and that needs to be better.”\nMr. Counihan added: “This is new technology for everybody. We don’t want to introduce anything that is not fully working.”\nFederal officials said it would be a challenge to sign up more people for coverage through the exchanges because many of those with the greatest need and desire for insurance already have it.\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said last week that she expected 10 million people to be enrolled through the federal and state exchanges at the end of next year. Some outside experts described that as a surprisingly modest goal. About 9.9 million people were enrolled through the exchanges at the end of June.\nThe open enrollment period ends Jan. 31. The administration is aiming to sign up more than one of every four uninsured consumers eligible for coverage through the marketplaces. People who already have coverage can renew it or pick different plans.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/20/us/20health/20health-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/16/us/16healthweb/16healthweb-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/17/us/17health-web/17health-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/us/23insure-web/23insure-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/13/us/13health/13health-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/us/14health/14health-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:06:23.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
