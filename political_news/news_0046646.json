ALBANY — Gov. Cuomo Thursday night is expected to announce a plan to provide anti-discrimination protections to people who are transgender.\nA bill known as the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act that would make it illegal to discriminate in the areas of employment, housing or public accomodations based on gender identity or expression has been stalled in the Republican-controlled state Senate.\nCuomo, like he did in raising the minimum wage for fast-food workers, is set to announce a plan to bypass the Legislature to enact a GENDA-type measure through a regulatory process he controls, sources said.\nThe governor is set to announce the plan at an Empire State Pride Agenda dinner in the city Thursday night.\nCuomo’s office had no comment.\n“When executives are faced with obstructionist Legislatures they try to find creative ways around it,” said one supporter of the plan.\nState law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender. But it does not include protections specifically for those who are transgender.\nSome localities, including New York City, have enacted their own protections for the transgender.\nCuomo in 2011 pushed through legislation to legalize gay marriage in New York.\nRelated Stories EXCLUSIVE: Cuomo demands state protect transgender students Biden backs transgender people serving openly in military", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:42:48.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
