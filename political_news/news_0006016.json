(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Last week, Mayor Rahm Emanuel joined other big city mayors and police chiefs in Washington, D.C., to discuss the violence plaguing their cities. One of the conclusions they drew is that the increase in violence is partly due to the decrease in policing. During the discussion in D.C., the many of the leaders, including Emanuel, agreed that part of the problem is the \"YouTube effect,\" meaning officers are less aggressive now than they were before due to the fear of becoming the star of the next viral video about police abuse.

And officers will tell you that. And I tried to speak up for the good officers that are doing community policing that make up the men and women of the Chicago Police Department.\" Cubs' Rondon Stuck in Bullpen Bathroom During Game 1 At last week's meeting, New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton backed up that thought, saying the perception of police in New York would have been even worse if two of their officers were not killed execution-style in December. The summit was held following a particularly violent September in Chicago. For two consecutive weeks, more than 50 people were shot . Just a few weeks later, the Daily Beast named Chicago \"America's mass-shooting capital.\" Published 2 hours ago \nNews breaks at inconvenient times.
