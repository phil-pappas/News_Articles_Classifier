Denis Carnahan and Rocco Fazzari reflect on budgets past. With apologies to Don McLean (and Madonna).\nPT1M7S 620 349 It is going to cost taxpayers at least $1 million because Joe Hockey is sick of politics. The Australian Electoral Commission has said it cost $1,263,383 to conduct the byelection for the seat of Griffith after Kevin Rudd spat the dummy in 2014, a year after his electorate had voted him back in. But Rudd was a deposed prime minister, not a demoted treasurer.\nHockey is a likeable politician and it is easy to see why he has lost his mojo. His first budget, designed to stop Australia's drift into further debt, was widely excoriated. He engaged in an expensive and protracted defamation action against Fairfax Media, which yielded a partial victory. Then he was removed as treasurer after the Liberals changed leadership (a leadership he came close to winning in 2009).\nHis departure from such a blue-ribbon seat, after holding preselection for 20 years, offers the Liberals a once-in-a-generation opportunity to attract a heavyweight candidate with success and wide experience outside of politics.\nIllustration: Michael Mucci\nThe public support for Malcolm Turnbull's installation as Prime Minister shows the electorate likes people who have made a success of their careers outside of politics.\nAdvertisement Here was a chance for the party to give the 500 or so Liberal members in North Sydney – the numbers are confidential – the opportunity to chose their next MP. It would be an exercise in democracy, transparency and respect for the believers who hand out voting cards during elections.\nBut we are talking about the NSW Liberal Party.\nThere will be a contest for pre-selection, but the outcome is pre-ordained. The machine wants Trent Zimmerman to replace Hockey.\nZimmerman is a former political staffer for Hockey. He was in Hockey's office for seven years. He is also the acting president of the NSW Liberals, and has nominated for election as state president. Occasionally there have been politicians who also served as state president, but it was only transitory as the party job was forsaken for the parliamentary position.\nThis is the first time someone has nominated to run both for Federal Parliament and the state presidency at the same time.\nZimmerman's day job is deputy chief executive of the Tourism and Transport Forum, which represents about 200 tourism and transport companies. He also spent eight-and-a-half years on North Sydney Council, so has deep roots in the electorate. He is clearly the candidate to beat, with or without the machine's support.\nBut the machine is leaving little to chance.\nLast Wednesday, during a teleconference of members of the state executive, it was proposed that rank-and-file Liberal members in North Sydney be almost completely shut out of the pre-selection process.\nThe proposal was to invoke emergency powers – even though there is clearly no emergency – to appoint just 36 people to decide the election: 18 would be from the state executive, plus 18 local branch presidents in the North Sydney electorate.\nThis caused such consternation from some that the machine acquiesced, slightly. It will now allow voting by 48 members of local branches, plus 48 members of the central organisation (20 members of state executive, 28 from state council).\nThat still leaves 90 per cent of the local membership excluded. So what is the point of being a member?\nIn summary: the machine does not want the rank-and-file involved. It has declared an emergency which does not exist. It is tacitly supporting someone who thinks that being a federal MP and president of the NSW Liberal Party are jobs that can be done at the same time.\nThis is the primacy of machine politics.\nIt is identical on the other side of politics. This is why Australian political life is increasingly occupied by a political class that engages in politics as a career, is not even remotely reflective of the general community, and acts as a barrier to entry for talented potential candidates from outside the insider bubble.\nThis self-serving insularity was personified last week by the comment from Labor's deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, who said Malcolm Turnbull, because of his wealth, was \"out of touch\" with ordinary Australians.\nThis is coming from someone who spent her career as a public servant or political staffer and is married to a career public servant, Michael Coutts-Trotter. Their combined annual income is about $800,000, all paid for by the taxpayer.\nWe know who is out of touch. The new front-line of the federal government – Malcolm Turnbull, Scott Morrison as Treasurer and Christian Porter as Minister for Social Services, the biggest-spending portfolio in the government – is wiping the floor with Labor.\nAll three are highly adroit public speakers and it is no coincidence that all had successful careers before entering Federal Parliament. Turnbull's life as a lawyer, merchant banker and journalist is well known. Morrison was the managing director of Tourism Australia. Porter was treasurer and attorney-general of Western Australia before seeking a seat in Federal Parliament.\nTheir Labor shadow ministerial counterparts were all union officials and/or staffers before being elected to Parliament.\nThe electorate's preference for a leader who has achieved distinction beyond politics is such that the opinion polls have become devastating for Bill Shorten since Turnbull became Prime Minister.\nThe most recent poll, a Roy Morgan Poll released on Friday, was the worst. It had support for Turnbull as preferred prime minister at 76 per cent, with Shorten preferred by just 14 per cent.\nShorten was elected Labor's leader in 2013 with the support of the union factions, which trumped the rank-and-file majority vote in favour of Anthony Albanese. The rank-and-file appeared to know better.\nIt is a lesson the NSW Liberal Party should heed, for the long term health of the party.\nTwitter: Paul_Sheehan_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Paul_Sheehan_"], "published": "2015-10-26T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:38:19.543+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
