I wasn't aware of this... Didn't realise the extent of their involvement. Good to hear some positives for once. Just shows how the media only feed you what they want you to believe. And this is the media feeding 'you' with what 'they' want you to believe!I think the majority of British people (of a certain age) understand fully the role played by Commonwealth forces in the War(s).And we do know who the Indian Army, Sikhs, etc, were fighting alongside and with, not against.This article is via a new Think Tank group called 'British Future'. Think Tanks invariably have agendas. Like this one.The article starts 'Forgotten heroes who have had their names erased from the history books'.Really?What utter vile rubbish. Perhaps they should read some WW1 & WW2 books.Are they trying to suggest that the British public has never heard of Khudadad Khan?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:24:56.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
