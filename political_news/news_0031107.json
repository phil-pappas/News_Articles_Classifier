Alex Ellinghausen by Joanna Mather A thousand refugees fleeing conflict in the Middle East have been referred for processing ahead of settling in Australia, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton says.\nBut another 640 \"potentially illegal immigrants\" on 20 vessels have been turned away after trying to come to Australia by boat since December 2013.\n\"I won't allow the people smugglers to get back into their treacherous trade,\" Mr Dutton said amid reports the change of prime minister is being used by traffickers to encourage people to pay for boat journeys.\nMr Dutton provided an update on Friday of Australia's plans to take 12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq, as well as the latest statistics from Operation Sovereign Borders.\nHe refused to speculate on whether Australia was close to reaching a deal with the Philippines to settle asylum seekers.\nThere have been reports the Philippines might enter an agreement similar to that struck with Cambodia, although only four asylum seekers have been re-settled under that arrangement.\nAustralia agreed to take an extra 12,000 refugees from the Middle East following extensive reporting of the masses of people trying to get to Europe.\nFamilies, women and children Mr Dutton said some applicants had been \"screened out\" in keeping with the Coalition's pledge to take mostly families, women and children.\n\"We want to make sure we are providing people who are legitimately in need of the opportunity to come to our country,\" Mr Dutton said.\nOperation Sovereign Borders commander Andrew Bottrell told reporters the most recent turnback occurred in August, when a vessel was returned to Indonesia.\n\"It has now been over 430 days since the last successful people smuggling venture made it to Australia,\" he said.\n\"More importantly, nearly two years since we had the last known death at sea.\"\nMajor General Bottrell said anybody who believed Australian policy had softened with Malcolm Turnbull's appointment would be disappointed.\n\"We know people smugglers are trying to lie to people ... that the policy has changed,\" he said. \"Nothing has changed.\"\nThe Christmas Island immigration detention centre was \"hardening\" because it was housing fewer illegal boat arrivals and more criminals awaiting deportation, Mr Dutton added.\nHe said there were 285 people in the centre. Among them are 96 who arrived by boat compared to 125 whose visas have been cancelled.\n\"My judgment is that the population on Christmas Island detention centre will include increasingly people with significant criminal history,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:55:46.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
