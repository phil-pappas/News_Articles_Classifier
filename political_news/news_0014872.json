Since then, drug manufacturers have continued to modify their formulas and develop new chemical mixtures. \nReports of synthetic marijuana products identified by local, state and federal drug labs have skyrocketed since 2009. That year, labs reported 23 cases. Last year there were roughly 37,500. \n___ \nFollow Alicia A.
