Instead, prosecutors, defense lawyers, witnesses, victims and family members had to go to them. \nThe Daily Press ran several stories in 2010 about the little-used courthouse that was costing the government $165,000 a month to lease. \nIn stepped U.S. Magistrate Judge Tommy E. Miller, who developed a plan to have the magistrate judges come to the Peninsula at least twice a week, on top of their regular misdemeanor dockets there. \n\"This is just huge,\" Jimmy Ellenson, a local lawyer who practices in federal court, said at the time, saying \"this eliminates so many of the travel issues.\" \nFive years on, the magistrates are still coming to Newport News. And more Peninsula attorneys have signed up for federal court-appointed work. \"We wanted to do it so that Newport News lawyers could get to the cases, so the family could be there,\" Miller said. \nBut it was common for Miller, 66 — who retired Sept. 1 after 28 years as a judge and another 15 as a state and federal prosecutor — to be at the fore of trying to fix issues arising in the local judicial system. \n\"He was my 'go to' for everything,\" said former courthouse clerk Beth Wingrove Orga in an 11-page commemoration packet handed out at Miller's retirement ceremony. \"He always had the time and patience for any question I may have had.\" \nThe court's law clerks found Miller so approachable that one year they voted him as the judge they'd call first should they ever get arrested. \n\"I was taught that by my parents,\" Miller said recently of being willing to listen to everyone. \"People come and ask the questions, and I give them an answer. And they know that if it's the wrong answer, that I will say it was me who gave them the wrong answer.\" \nRaised in Norfolk, Miller graduated from the University of Virginia in 1970 and got a law degree from the College of William and Mary in 1973. During law school, he twice joined the Virginia Beach police as one of 50 \"summer police officers\" after six days of training. \n\"We wore the same uniforms and carried the same guns as the regular officers,\" he said. \"We wrote tickets, took reports on burglaries, did what a police officer does.\" \nHe later landed a job as a legal adviser for the Norfolk Police Department, then spent six years prosecuting criminal cases with the Norfolk commonwealth's attorney's office. He rose to the federal level in 1980, becoming part of what was then a five-man team of federal prosecutors in Hampton Roads. \nHe took several cases to trial at the old Newport News federal courthouse, then above the U.S. Post Office on West Avenue, including one involving drug smuggling up the Chickahominy River. \nIn 1985, one of Miller's cases made national headlines — the espionage trial against Arthur J. Walker, a retired Navy officer and defense contractor who sold classified secrets to the Soviet Union between 1968 and 1985. \nMiller got a call from the FBI at 11 p.m. the night before Walker's arrest, drafted a series of search warrants that night, \"and never asked to be taken off.\" Walker was convicted within three months, and sentenced to three life terms plus 40 years. \nWhen the former spy died in prison last year at age 77, the New York Times obituary quoted Miller from the 1985 trial, saying Walker acted with \"the evilness that is characteristic of the traitor.\" \nIn 1987, the court's district judges selected Miller became to become a U.S. magistrate judge. \nMagistrates, who currently receive a salary of $185,012, have a wide array of duties. \nThey hold pre-trial hearings, felony and civil cases, and some civil trials. They hear misdemeanor and traffic dockets from federal bases and property. They hold settlement conferences to push litigants to come to terms before trial, and write recommendations to district judges on whether state court defendants deserve a new trial, among other tasks. \nOn a bookshelf in his Norfolk chambers, Miller always kept a Polaroid picture from a 1974 police lineup, stemming from a robbery-shooting case he prosecuted as a state prosecutor in Norfolk. \nUsing that lineup, the shooting victim had identified a man and a juvenile as his assailants. Miller landed an initial conviction against the juvenile, with an appeal in that case and another trial still pending. Then, Miller said, another man confessed to the crime. \nA senior Norfolk prosecutor ribbed the younger Miller: \"Anyone can convict the guilty,\" he said in jest. \"You have to be really good to convict the innocent.\" \n\"I felt really badly,\" Miller said. \"I kept the picture wherever I went. It was my sort of talisman to myself, to make sure you are always acting to the best of your ability. … It was a nudge on the back of the head that, 'We could be wrong.'\" \nAlso in his office was a sketch of himself at the 1985 spy trial. \"That's to remember that I was a trial lawyer, and that trial lawyers lead difficult lives,\" he said. \"To remember to be patient.\" \nMiller said he began enjoying hearing misdemeanor cases, such as the reckless drivings, DUIs, assaults and larcenies at Fort Eustis, Langley Air force Base, the Colonial Parkway and elsewhere. \n\"After having tried felonies for 15 years, I found that the misdemeanor docket had a lot more twists and turns than I thought,\" Miller said. \nIn the late 1990s, Miller was asked to help out with a case involving the SS Central America, a 280-foot steamer that sunk off the South Carolina coast in 1857. An explorers' group found the shipwreck — and its more than $100 million in gold — in 1988. \nAfter 10 years of litigation, Miller was on hand at a local Brinks site in 1998 when the bounty was divvied up between explorers and insurance firms who made payments at the time of the wreck. \n\"We had a court reporter, and you looked around, and the floor was covered with gold — stacked up bars of gold, bags of gold dust,\" Miller said. \"It was amazing. I just was there to make sure that the process went correctly, and it did.\" \nMiller's 1997 bid to become a district judge didn't pan out, but he said it worked out for the best. \"I'm perfectly satisfied in my career,\" he said. \"As a magistrate judge, you have a lot more contact with people, and I enjoyed it. It's a great position.\" \nMiller will continue to work as an adjunct professor at William and Mary, which he's done for 16 years. He's also exploring options, but he's \"not going to practice law, and not going to mediate.\" That means that if he ever wants to be put on the judicial recall list, he will still qualify. \nDujardin can be reached at 757-247-4749 \nTommy E.
