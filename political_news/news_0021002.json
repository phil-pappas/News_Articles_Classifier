The memorandum of understanding, now in effect, \"includes specific safety protocols for air crews to follow\" but does not coordinate policy between the U.S. and Russia. Russia's airstrikes in Syria are largely aimed at bolstering the regime of close ally President Bashar al-Assad, while the U.S. wants him to go and its coalition is focused on hitting ISIS targets. Recently, U.S. and Russian aircraft have flown in close proximity over Syria, and there have been concerns about the safety of pilots given the risk of miscalculation in the tight airspace. The memorandum's protocols include maintaining \"professional airmanship\" at all times, the use of specific communications frequencies and the establishment of a communication line on the ground, Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook told reporters. \"The U.S. and Russia will form a working group to discuss any implementation issues that follow.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:17:49.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
