About 52 percent of the city's black men, meanwhile, are out of work, according to an oft-cited administration statistic.\nStand with Dignity, a grass roots group that has lobbied hard for the city to use its tax dollars to address social equity, held a rally in support of the rules in front of City Hall.\nAddressing the City Council, Stand member Divonite Almestica said that a lack of opportunity was to blame for the city's struggle with crime. Citing a recent rash of holdups in Uptown restaurants, Almestica called the robberies acts of terrorism that may have been spawned by a sense of desperation.\n\"Terrorism, it doesn't breed itself,\" Almestica said.\nUnder the new rules, any contractor on a big city project will be expected to make a \"good faith effort\" to perform an escalating share its of work using locally sourced labor and to target a certain amount of hiring to disadvantaged groups such as the homeless and chronically unemployed.\nThe rule forbids the city to sign contracts with firms that refuse to commit to the goals.\nThe contractors will also be required to use the city's workforce development program, Pathways to Prosperity, as the \"first source\" for hiring, meaning they will be required to offer jobs to those in the city's training and job readiness pipeline before publicly posting openings.\nThe targets are apparently aggressive enough to have spooked the Louisiana Association of General Contractors, a powerhouse lobby on both the state and local political stage. \"It establishes a horrible precedent,\" said the group's chief executive, Ken Naquin.\nThe city is being disingenuous in presenting the ordinance as a real solution, he said, because the law won't apply to many of the biggest projects. On the projects where it is applicable, a giant loophole will put local firms at a disadvantage, making it more likely that out-of-state contractors will swoop in and import their own labor, Naquin said.\nAlthough the ordinance's primary sponsor, James Gray, made reference to \"billions\" of dollars in construction projects in the pipeline for New Orleans, many of those are funded through FEMA and other federal agencies. Federal law prohibits states and cities from imposing local-hiring laws such projects.\nIn a cash strapped city like New Orleans, that greatly narrows the potential impact of Landrieu's new program.\nNaquin's second claim, that local firms would be put at a disadvantage, is harder to pin down.\nThe language of the ordinance says that the local hiring goals apply only to work hours performed by \"Louisiana workers.\" That would seem to give firms based in neighboring states an advantage. If they can import laborers willing to work for less than those in New Orleans, they will be able to underbid local firms.\n\"All you have done is make our local guys less competitive than the out of state guys,\" Naquin said.\nWhen Councilwoman Stacy Head pushed the administration on the point, Ashleigh Gardere, Landrieu's point woman for the program, said the city had to work within the law, but legal limitations should not prevent the city from doing everything it can to steer locally raised tax money back into the community, she said.\nThe requirements of the program are considerable.\nAny contractor on a city project worth over $150,000 or more will be required to make a \"good faith effort\" to ensure that 30 percent of the work-hours go to Orleans Parish residents, 20 percent of which must qualify as \"disadvantaged.\" Contractors will also be required to try to hire as many officially credentialed apprentices as allowed under the law, and to ensure that 10 percent of them qualify as disadvantaged.\nThose benchmarks, \"subject to periodic review,\" will escalate by five percent each year so that, by 2020, contractors will be expected to have local laborers and tradesman performing half of all the work on city contract, and 30 percent the work should be performed by local workers who qualify as disadvantaged.\n\"Disadvantaged,\" for the purposes of the new hiring rules, means people who fit into one of the following categories: those who live in a household that makes less than half of the area median income, are homeless, are eligible to receive public assistance, suffer from chronic unemployment, are single parents, are military veterans, are products of the foster-care system or were formerly incarcerated.\nHow residency will be established and income thresholds verified are among the many rules the administration has yet to establish.\nEven core aspects of the program, such as how the work hours will be counted and the benchmarks applied, have not been ironed out.\nFor example, there is nothing in the ordinance that would allow employers to exempt current employees from the benchmark calculations. Yet, when Head and Naquin said that local firms would almost certainly have to fire employees who live in other parishes in order to hit the targets, Gardere dismissed the concern, saying nothing in the ordinance envisions forcing companies to fire people.\nGardere said that, if contractors who can demonstrate that their out-of-town employees have been with the company since before the ordinance was passed, the city will take that into consideration when it assesses whether the firm's effort met the \"good faith\" standard.\nIt also remains to be seen how the public would be able to assess the relative success of the program. Since certain personnel records are exempt from public records laws, it would be difficult for anyone outside City Hall to verify official statistics.\nDespite the concerns, all seven City Council members ultimately voted in favor of the rules.\n\"We will be working with the administration pretty aggressively to make sure the rules are appropriate and they are followed,\" said Councilwoman LaToya Cantrell.\nThe administration expects the rules to be in place before the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:30:49.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
