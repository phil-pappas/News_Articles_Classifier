Rio Permana .\nWorkers were unable to put out the fire with extinguishers. It took firefighters several hours to bring the blaze under control.\n\"We are still investigating the cause of fire,\" Permana said, adding that a preliminary investigation indicated a short circuit.\nHe said some panicked people smashed windows and fled into the street, while many others were stuck in black smoke billowing from the second floor as there was only one access door to the building.\nAll 17 people who died were Indonesians. Most died from smoke inhalation rather than burns, Permana said.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:47:30.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
