Later, he’ll attend an evening reception at the Woodside home of money manager Paul Edwards and his wife, Woodside Elementary School District Trustee Silvia Edwards . \nA ticket to either costs $2,700, though raising $10,000 confers co-host status – with access to a photo reception – and raising $27,000 earns a place on the California finance committee with the photo op and a ticket to a future debate. Both events will be closed to the press. \nOther co-chairs of the Bay Area events include Cavalry Asset Management managing partner John Hurley and his wife, Kamilla, of San Francisco; brokerage and banking mogul Charles Schwab and his wife, Helen, of Woodside; and Sequoia Capital partner and former U.S. Ambassador to Portugal Tom Stephenson and his wife, Barbara, of Atherton. \nCo-hosts so far include Thumbtack general counsel Katie Biber Chen of San Francisco, who was general counsel to Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign; venture capitalist Bill Draper of Atherton, former president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States and a longtime Bush family friend; William Grayson of San Francisco, a senior advisor at Bernstein Global Wealth Management; Ed Hearst of Danville, an attorney and government affairs executive; Greg Johnson of Hillsborough, chairman and CEO of Franklin Templeton Investments; Jay Kern of Ross, a founder and general partner of Kern Whelan Capital; attorney Josh Lipshutz , a partner at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher; and Carole McNeil of Belvedere, widow of late real estate mogul Robert McNeil. \nThough Bush has seemed to be the odds-on favorite of establishment Republicans, and while the super PAC backing his campaign raised a record $103 million in the year’s first half, Bush currently ranks fifth in an average of seven national polls compiled by Real Clear Politics, behind Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Marcio Rubio and Carly Fiorina. He’s sixth in Iowa behind Trump, Carson, Fiorina, Ted Cruz and Rubio, and fifth in New Hampshire behind Trump, Fiorina, Carson and Rubio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:55:04.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
