Prosecutors said they expect to reach a written plea agreement with Hastert by then. Defense attorneys also indicated they are not waiving any right to back out of the deal in the next two weeks.\nHastert’s legal team let a crucial filing deadline pass earlier this week, signaling such a deal could be in the works.\nHastert has not shown his face in court since he pleaded not guilty June 9 to skirting banking laws and lying to the FBI. The charges were unveiled by federal prosecutors in a bombshell indictment announced May 28. It accused Hastert of an alleged $3.5 million hush-money scheme.\nThe case became even more sensational when sources told media outlets, including the Chicago Sun-Times, that Hastert paid millions of dollars to a longtime male acquaintance to cover up alleged sexual misconduct.\nHastert lawyer Thomas Green has said those leaks were “unconscionable.” He told Durkin in July the leakers “effectively amended” Hastert’s indictment in an “impermissible” way, and he said “there’s now an 800-pound gorilla in this case.”\nThe indictment against Hastert, a man once second in line to the presidency, is vague. It triggered a search for Hastert’s alleged hush-money recipient, but that hunt has so far been unsuccessful. Known only as “Individual A,” that person is described in Hastert’s indictment simply as “a resident of Yorkville” who has known Hastert “most of Individual A’s life.”\nBetween 2010 and 2014, Hastert allegedly withdrew $1.7 million in hush money from his bank accounts, handing it over to “Individual A” to keep quiet about past misconduct, according to the indictment. Hastert had ultimately agreed to pay that person $3.5 million, the indictment alleged.\nBut Hastert illegally split up the withdrawal of $952,000 to evade the banks’ reporting requirements, according to the feds. Then, when the FBI got suspicious and asked Hastert if he made withdrawals as large as $50,000 because he didn’t trust the banks, he allegedly lied and said, “Yea … I kept the cash. That’s what I’m doing.”\nBy reaching a plea deal with prosecutors, Hastert could avoid a trial where more embarrassing details could spill out. Experts have repeatedly predicted Hastert would try to avoid such a proceeding. Each count he faces carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.\nStill, the guilty plea would force Hastert to return to the Dirksen Federal Courthouse, where he was mobbed in June by reporters eager for a look at the man who has gone into hiding ever since he was criminally charged.\nHastert’s lawyers said last month they were trying to resolve his case short of trial, and authorities confirmed that plea negotiations were underway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:48:25.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
