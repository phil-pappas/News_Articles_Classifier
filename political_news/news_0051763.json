And it might be the clearest sign that Clinton is worried about the challenge she faces from Bernie Sanders, a vociferous opponent of TPP, and the potential for one from Vice President Joe Biden, who supports the agreement.\nIn the interview with Judy Woodruff, Clinton said she was worried that the deal would not create jobs and raise wages for American workers, which she had previously said would be her standard for judging it. In particular, she cited concerns that the agreement did not adequately address currency manipulation and that it was too favorable to big drug companies—she recently came out in favor of stronger regulations on the price of prescriptions. “As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,” she said. “I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar that I have.” (Notably, Clinton did leave herself a bit of wiggle room by cautioning that she had not read the lengthy text of the deal, which won’t be public for another month.)\n“I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar that I have.” In a lengthier statement released after the interview, Clinton cast blame on Republicans for blocking Democratic proposals to strengthen the economy, leaving the U.S. in a weakened competitive position. As a result, she said, “we’re going into this with one arm tied behind our backs.”\nI still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was Secretary of State. I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don't believe this agreement has met it.\nTrade has been a vexing issue for Clinton in both of her presidential runs. She struggled to defend NAFTA—signed by her husband—in 2008, and she avoided taking a position on TPP for months earlier this year. Her opposition to the final deal also opens her up to charges of flip-flopping, since Republicans have dozens of video clips of Clinton praising earlier drafts of TPP when she was secretary of state—including one in which she said it was “the gold standard” of trade pacts.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jeh-14A8Rbc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fju459PbqIc"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:04:14.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
