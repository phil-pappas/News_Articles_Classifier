Any American who is unemployed, in massive debt, or can't afford healthcare who has been a cheerleader of that mindset. Congratulations, you built that. I beg to differ with you after being a third owner of over million dollar company. Cash flow was the immediate problem and the three owners worked without pay during the hard times and our employees got paid every payday. After we got our shit together the owners reaped the profits as well as our employees. Originally Posted by Jimmyb Actually I am antithetical to all of your left-wing copy and paste propaganda. That article was nothing but historical record, based upon the events as they actually occurred. I can see why you would be antithetical to it.

Anti-ethical is an oxymoron or a contradiction in terms, similar to military intelligence.

The article is a dizzying and disjointed array of jejune and sophomoric manipulation of history, data, and a yearning for Marxism. That is the best that can be expected when a leftist journalism major wants to pontificate about economics and history on a left-wing rag.

If what you say is true, then you have confirmed my thesis by learning the history of the failed policies of the past. I find your statement interesting that it wasn't until you got your shit together that any profits were reaped by the employees. Which apparently led to success by the ownership. The point being that success by the ownership doesn't benefit the country as a whole, if there is no success reaped by the workers. Any policy that benefits the few at the expense of the many is bad policy, as the article very clearly lays out. Carly Fiorina making $100 million, and 30,000 people being unemployed, is bad policy, I don't care what your politics are. It is the reason I made this post, as the article points out why that specific circumstance started with men like Roger Miliken.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:36:12.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
