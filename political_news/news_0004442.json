The missing emails raise more questions about her stewardship of official documents during her tenure and whether there is a complete record of the early diplomatic efforts of President Barack Obama’s administration.” \nPolitico : “The controversy over Hillary Clinton’s use of personal email while she was secretary of state is showing no signs of easing, as the number of messages now deemed classified doubled with the State Department’s latest release and as more details emerged about the potential vulnerability of her account.” Related Posts Never miss a Political Wire post Your email address: * Please enter all required fields Correct invalid entries  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:38:10.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
