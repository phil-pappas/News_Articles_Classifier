Thankfully, Munoz was wearing a bullet proof vest. What happened next truly went above and beyond the call of duty:\n“We don’t want to kill you—drop the gun!” Munoz shouted. “You need some help. I know you shot me but we’re not going to shoot you.” Theodore Johnson had every opportunity to save his own life. Instead, he raised his gun again and four police officers shot him dead, having already placed more value on the man’s life than he did himself.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/05XKmpeu2e8"], "published": "2015-10-09T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:21:08.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
