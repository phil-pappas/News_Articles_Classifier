He didn't provide a list of the duties she can't perform.Kane, 49, is a first-term Democrat after winning the 2012 election for the office. She has maintained her innocence against the charges filed against her in Montgomery County.In the ruling to suspended Kane's license, it was stated, \"This order should not be construed as removing Respondent (Kane) from elected office and is limited to the temporary suspension on her license to practice law.\"Kane has repeatedly stated she will not resign from office, despite several top leaders, including Gov. Tom Wolf, calling for her to step aside.\"A resignation would be an admission of guilt,\" she said at the time charges were filed, \"and I'm not guilty.\"Kane was charged in August with perjury, conspiracy, and other counts for allegedly leaking the material in 2009 in an effort, prosecutors said, to embarrass political foes. She's accused of lying under oath about the leak, ordering aides to illegally snoop through computer files to keep tabs on the investigation into it and harming the reputation of a former civil rights leader named in the leaked documents.She could face up to seven years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge, perjury.A new perjury charge was filed earlier this month after she claimed she had never signed a secrecy oath preventing her from releasing information from past grand jury cases.Investigators with the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office said they recovered such a document when they search her Harrisburg office Sept. 17.Kane had claimed she cannot be held criminally culpable for any leak from old cases because she had not signed a secrecy oath.The suspension of the attorney general's law license is unknown political and judicial territory, as state law requires the attorney general to have a law license to hold office.Kane is maintaining her license, but cannot practice law.Should Kane choose to resign, the process of choosing a successor is spelled out clearly in state law.The Commonwealth Attorneys Act leaves the decision up to the governor and the state Senate.The Office of Attorney General will be headed by First Deputy Assistant Bruce Beemer, who will automatically take over an interim attorney general until a successor is appointed to complete the four-year term Kane began in 2013.The law says any successor must be nominated by the governor and approved by two-thirds of the 50 members of the Senate.Kane isn't the first state Attorney General to face criminal charges. Ernie Preate Jr., resigned after pleading guilty to corruption charges in 1995.According to the Pennsylvania constitution, elected officials charged with a crime may continue to serve in office until the individual is both convicted and sentenced.
