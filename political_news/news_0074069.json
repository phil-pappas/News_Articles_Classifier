REUTERS More + \nThe secret to real estate mogul Donald Trump's popularity in this election season has eluded pundits, pollsters, the Republican establishment, and really, everyone else. \n\"Honestly it's my looks,\" Trump said before a rally in Atlanta on Saturday. \"I'm very handsome. That's the only thing I can think of right now\" \nThere you have it. Trump held a press conference before his speech, where he once again weighed in on the race for Speaker of the House. With word that Rep. Paul Ryan was the new establishment favorite - albeit undeclared - to take the departing Speaker John Boehner's seat, Trump expanded on his tweet from earlier in the day which said that Ryan was not his first choice. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump weighs in on the House GOP leadership race during an interview set to air Sunday on \"Face the Nati... \n\"Paul Ryan is a nice man,\" Trump said. \"I would love to see somebody extremely tough in there. I think the Republicans need somebody extremely tough. But that vote's not up to me. It's up to the people that are voting.\" \nHe also downplayed Texas senator Ted Cruz's comments on Friday to WABC radio. Cruz had suggested that Trump's long-term prospects for the GOP race are limited, saying \"I don't believe Donald is going to be the nominee, and I think in time the lion's share of his supporters end up with us.\" He has typically gone out of his way to profess admiration for Trump during the campaign cycle. \n\"Well of course he's going to say that. What's he going to say?\" Trump said. \"I mean I love it when they hit me. Because so far as you know, everybody I've hit has gone down the tubes. Okay? They've all gone down. A lot of them are out of the race.\" \nThousands flocked to the North Atlanta Trade Center to catch the campaign's first appearance in Georgia. His speech contained mostly the same rhetoric that has catapulted Trump to the top of the polls. He did tweak his attack on Florida Senator Marco Rubio, one of his fellow rivals for the GOP nomination, saying that he sweats too much to deal with Russian president Vladimir Putin. \n\"So you have Putin - he's sitting over here,\" Trump said. \"And he's waiting to kill the stupid Americans because he's been just destroying us so badly. So he figures, and a guy walks in, and he's soaking wet and sweating. \"Hello, hello, can I have some water?\" And Putin's sitting there what the hell kind of stuff is this? This is not exactly a poker player here folks.\" \nBefore Trump took the stage, Herman Cain, the former fast food executive and presidential candidate , addressed the crowd. His \"9-9-9\" tax plan briefly pushed Cain to the top of the polls in the 2012 race for the Republican nomination. Cain, who at one time led the National Restaurant Association, held an actual fork in his hand, to illustrate that the country had reached a fork in the road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:37:08.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
