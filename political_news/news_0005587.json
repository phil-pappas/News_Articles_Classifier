Comment By Alex KuffnerJournal Staff Writer Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 11:54 am Updated at 11:56 AM PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- The state Department of Transportation must correct years of inaction and take immediate steps to prevent polluted storm water from draining into Narragansett Bay and other local waterways under a consent decree filed in federal court Thursday morning by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency. The filing follows 14 months of negotiations between federal regulators and state officials over the DOT’s protracted failure to comply with the federal Clean Water Act during many years of neglecting to maintain an estimated 25,000 storm water catch basins on state roads, 3,800 outfalls and 100 other treatment systems. Last month, when the DOT announced that it was planning a 20-year program to clean and repair drainage systems along 1,100 miles of roads around the state, newly-appointed director Peter Alviti Jr. said the program had to start with an inventory because the agency does not have accurate records of the locations of all of those systems. According to the complaint in federal court, the DOT violations affected 235 impaired water bodies, including waterways that flow into Narragansett and Mount Hope bays. The agency violated the Clean Water Act in four major areas: -taking appropriate steps to evaluate and address the impact of its systems on impaired waters in Rhode Island -detecting and eliminating illicit connections and discharges of pollutants, including sewage, from illicit connections -inspecting, cleaning, and repairing its drainage systems -and conducting adequate street sweeping to reduce the flow of contaminants “For nearly a decade, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation has ignored its obligation to the people of Rhode Island to protect the waterways of this state,” U.S. Attorney Peter F. Neronha said in a statement. “Instead, through its neglect and indifference - through its failure to inspect and maintain its storm water run-off system - RIDOT has contributed to the pollution of those waters.” Under the decree, the DOT must pay a civil penalty of $315,000 and will also undertake two so-called “Supplemental Environmental Projects” that will result in the protection from development of two parcels of land, one in Johnston and another in Lincoln. The properties abut other protected lands and lie within impaired watersheds subject to the decree, according to the Justice Department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:38:41.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
