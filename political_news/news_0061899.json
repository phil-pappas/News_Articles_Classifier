It would be the first to focus on inversions. \nThanks to the US Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, corporations are also allowed to funnel money into political causes through super-PACs. \nIn a letter to members of Congress announcing his as-yet-unnamed super-PAC, Mr Icahn wrote: “I promise, the PAC we have started will leave no stone unturned to find out who is most responsible for this ridiculous and unconscionable situation and what can be done about it. The inability of Congress to enact desperately needed legislation because of certain members not willing to compromise is reprehensible, and the members responsible must and will be held accountable.” \nMr Icahn did not immediately elaborate on how exactly his action committee would put pressure on members to vote in favour of legislation. I promise, the PAC we have started will leave no stone unturned to find out who is most responsible for this ridiculous and unconscionable situation and what can be done about it \n- Carl Icahn \nIn the absence of congressional action, the Obama administration tweaked tax rules last year to reduce the attractiveness of inversions. But they have not stemmed the tide and at least five more multibillion-dollar deals have been agreed since then. \nWhat Mr Icahn called “foundational American companies”, including Pfizer, Walgreens, Monsanto and others, have been considering merger deals with foreign companies, which would allow them to switch domicile and gain access to overseas cash. \nMoody’s calculated that $1.1tn is held offshore by US companies, and Mr Icahn said the number could be twice that. Allowing it to be repatriated and taxed would bring in $200bn, he said. \nMr Icahn said he would seek meetings with members of Congress in the coming weeks, and warned them that nothing short of US “hegemony” was at stake.
