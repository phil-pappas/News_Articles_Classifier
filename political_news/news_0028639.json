Private universities don’t have to comply. \nBut lawmakers allowed schools to carve out gun-free zones so long as it doesn’t cover most or all of campuses. \nGun rights activists call campus carry a personal safety measure. Opponents say it’ll cause more campus violence. \nThe law takes effect next August. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:18:13.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
