Tom Wolf is warning that he may halt horse racing in Pennsylvania in a week because a state budget stalemate has compounded the troubles of the State Racing Fund. Wolf's spokesman told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Thursday that the four-month budget stalemate with the Legislature has left the state without the resources to prop up the fund. The Inquirer reports that Wolf press secretary Jeff Sheridan says the administration will shut down racing Oct. 30 if a solution isn't reached before then. Six Pennsylvania tracks offer thoroughbred or harness racing. The fund pays for licensing, safety, equine laboratory operations and drug-testing of horses and is funded through a tax on horse racing wagers, which have been steadily declining for years.
