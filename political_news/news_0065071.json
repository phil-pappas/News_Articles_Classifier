The resulting measure broadened the federal government’s responsibility over controlling pollution while authorizing the creation of an emissions trading market between various sources of industrial air pollution. The original act, passed in 1963, had not been updated since 1977.\nIn June 1989, President George H.W. Bush had proposed sweeping revisions to the Clean Air Act. Building on congressional proposals advanced during the 1980s, Bush sought legislation aimed at curbing three specific threats to the nation’s environment and to the health of Americans: acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions.\nThe final bipartisan measure retained all the major components of the president’s proposals while striking a compromise between environmental and automotive interests. It was steered through the House by Democratic Reps. John Dingell Jr. of Michigan and Henry Waxman of California, and through the Senate by Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.). Dingell described it as “the most complex, comprehensive, and far-reaching environmental law any Congress has ever considered.”\nIn its final form, the legislation encouraged the use of market-based principles and other innovative approaches, such as performance-based standards and emission “banking” and “trading” of pollution “credits.” It also provided a framework from which alternative clean fuels could be used to set upgraded standards in cars and trucks, while supporting a California pilot program that called for pollution controls to be met by the most cost-effective combination of fuels and technology. Furthermore, the measure promoted the use of clean low-sulfur coal and natural gas as well as new technologies to “scrub” high sulfur coal and thus curb acid rain.\nBush signed the bill into law on Nov. 15 after it had cleared the Senate, 89-11, and the House 401-21.\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HOUSE HISTORIAN AND CLERK OF THE HOUSE OFFICE OF ART AND ARCHIVES\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:12:41.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
