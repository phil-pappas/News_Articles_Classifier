We have even greater respect for law. When judges behave lawlessly, it is the law that must be honored, not lawless judges. \n“The Supreme Court is supreme in the federal judicial system. But the justices are not supreme over the other branches of government. And they are certainly not supreme over the Constitution. \nIn Obergefell v. Hodges, five justices, without the slightest warrant in the text, logic, structure, or historical understanding of the Constitution presumed to declare unconstitutional the marriage laws of states that maintain the historic and sound understanding of marriage as the conjugal union of husband and wife. \n“Obergefell is not ‘the law of the land.’ It has no more claim to that status than Dred Scott v. Sandford had when President Abraham Lincoln condemned that pro-slavery decision as an offense against the very Constitution that the Supreme Court justices responsible for that atrocious ruling purported to be upholding.” \nIt was predicted that those holding traditional views of marriage as a the covenantal partnership of one man and one woman would become vilified, legally targeted, and denied constitutional rights in order to pressure them to conform to the new orthodoxy. This has been seen over and over again, such as restaurant owners who are threatened, harassed and run out of town – not for refusing service, but merely for expressing an opinion. \nMany Christian conservatives are wondering what to do next. \n“Some suggest we retreat from politics, because (and they are right about this) politics is not enough,” notes Gallagher. “The true Benedict Option [becoming a hermit] in the contemporary world is not available – there is nowhere to go that aggressive equality progressivism may not follow. For cultural reasons alone, politics is too important to abandon. Then there is the practical question of who will prevent the more aggressive equality progressives from redefining Christian views as the equivalent of racism and using powerful legal and cultural levers to repress Christian ideas from the public square and our own children.” \nGallagher notes the problem is Christian conservatives are too-little invested in politics. They generate partisan hostility without building the army of activists, donors and especially networks to carry the message and protect Christians, as well as making it “expensive” to hurt them. \nAt the moment, conservative Christians are vulnerable to the vindictive harassment that comes in the wake of such landmark overreach of power. \nOne option is to sign the call to action put out by the Campaign for American Principles (CAP), urging presidential candidates to reject judicial edicts that undermine the sovereignty of the people, the Rule of Law and the supremacy of the Constitution. \n“We will resist them by every peaceful and honorable means,” notes Prof. Robert George of CAP. “We will not be bullied into acquiescence or silence.” Text smaller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:29:39.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
