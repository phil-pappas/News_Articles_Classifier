Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House transportation committee, and Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., the senior Democrat on the committee, also authorizes current spending levels plus inflation, but doesn't add any extra money.\nTaken together, the bills suggest Congress is unlikely to launch significant initiatives in the near future to tackle the nation's growing transportation maintenance and modernization backlog.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
