Ron Maag, R-Lebanon, that he could freeze access to his credit report to block would-be thieves from opening up accounts in his name, but he couldn’t do the same for his daughter, whose identity was stolen when she applied for college.\n“We can freeze ours, but we can’t freeze a child’s,” Maag said the constituent complained.\nOn Sept. 2, Maag introduced legislation that would allow parents or guardians of children up to age 16 to freeze their credit record. Maag said he hopes the legislation will pass this year or in early 2016.\nIdentity theft has become the No. 1 consumer complaint in the country, according to the Federal Trade Commission.\nOf the more than 2.5 million consumer complaints the agency received in 2014, 13 percent involved ID theft. Six percent of the complaints that the FTC received about ID theft — a total of 12,062 complaints — involved children or young adults up to age 19.\nThe problem of ID theft of children was documented in a 2012 investigation by The Dispatch called “Credit Scars.” Read the series at Dispatch.com/credit .\nIn one case, a child supposedly owed debts of $150,000 after her identity had been stolen at the age of 14. She didn’t find out until she was a college freshman when she was denied a JC Penney credit card.\nAdults whose identity has been stolen can contact the major credit-reporting agencies to have a freeze put on their credit reports that blocks anyone from opening a line of credit in their name. But a parent or guardian can’t do that for a child.\n“It is quite a problem,” Maag said. “Unfortunately, you don’t realize it’s a problem until it’s too late.”\nAttorney General Mike DeWine agrees.\n“To identity thieves, a child’s identity is a perfect target — a blank slate,” DeWine said in a news release announcing support for the legislation. “With the right information, impostors can take out credit cards, loans or even a mortgage in a child’s name, ruining victims’ credit before they’re even old enough to drive. This bill will help parents stop the problem before it occurs.\"\nThe legislation would allow the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 16 to apply a security freeze in the child’s name.\nIf the child does not have a credit report when the freeze is requested, the credit-reporting agencies would create one and then apply the freeze to that record.\nMaag said the legislation is one of his priority bills and that he is optimistic it will pass late this year or early next year.\n“I can’t imagine anybody other than the crooks have any objection to it,” he said.\nmawilliams@dispatch.com\n@BizMarkWilliams", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/BizMarkWilliams"], "published": "2015-10-01T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:48:56.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
