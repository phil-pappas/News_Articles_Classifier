Obama Makes Surprise Cameo at San Diego Wedding Sanders has passion, while Clinton has experience in presidential primary debates. But don't look for the two to go after each other in dramatic fashion. Each needs the supporters of the other to win in a general election, and they're not likely to risk alienating them with open hostility. Yet distinctions will be drawn. Mom of 5 Waiting for Bus Killed by Coca-Cola Truck: Family Sanders has broadcast that he's not bothering with formal preparation for the debate. As a self-described democratic socialist, he's been advocating for middle- and lower-income Americans for years in the legislative arena. He's likely to cast Clinton as a late-comer to efforts to make college more affordable, for example, and a flip-flopper on such issues as the Iraq War and trade. As a senator from New York, Clinton voted for the war, which she's since said she regrets. Last week, she reversed her support as secretary of state for the Pacific trade deal backed by Obama. Clinton, meanwhile, is sure to suggest her proposals are more realistic than those offered by Sanders, including his call to make college tuition free for all Americans. ___ Friends Stage Personal Parade for Ailing Classic-Car Lover THE FRONT-RUNNERS VS THE REST Clinton and Sanders are the unquestioned front-runners, but there will be three other candidates on stage â€” each sure to be searching for a breakout moment. UConn Mac-and-Cheese Student: 'I Am Ashamed' Expect former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to be the most aggressive. \"It's a very, very important opportunity for me to not only present my vision for where the country should head, but also 15 years of executive experience, actually accomplishing the progressive things some of the other candidates can only talk about,\" he said ahead of the debate. It's a little bit of a mystery how former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, a decorated Vietnam veteran, and Lincoln Chafee, a former governor and senator from Rhode Island, will engage with the rest of the field. Neither has campaigned as much as Clinton, Sanders and O'Malley up to this point, although both are critics of Clinton's vote for the Iraq War. ___ THE FIELD VS JOE BIDEN Will he or won't he? Updated Fight Leads to Shooting After Cowboys-Patriots Game Hovering over the debate will be Vice President Joe Biden, grieving father of son Beau, who is expected to announce within days whether he will make a late entry into the race. If asked about the potential candidate who isn't at the debate, look for the candidates to offer up familiar responses about giving Biden time to mourn his son's death. While Biden's advisers have been talking to potential staff and donors, those familiar with his thinking say they don't expect him to upend the debate by revealing his plans before the candidates take the stage. ___ Chicago Man Runs Marathon in Son's Memory TRUMP VS THE DEMOCRATS Never one to miss a chance at the spotlight, Republican front-runner Donald Trump said Tuesday that he planned to watch the debate and offer color commentary. \"At the request of many, and even though I expect it to be a very boring two hours, I will be covering the Democrat Debate live on twitter!\" Trump wrote in a tweet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:46:27.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
