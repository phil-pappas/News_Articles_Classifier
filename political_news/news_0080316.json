(Photo: Jan Woitas / AP) \nCONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Washington — House Democrats on Monday urged the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to hold a hearing into Volkswagen AG’s admitted cheating in 11 million diesel cars.\nReps. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J. and Brendan Boyle, D-Pa. — all members of the Transportation and Public Assets Subcommittee — urged the committee’s chair, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, to convene a hearing on the implications and consequences of Volkswagen’s actions for American consumers and to identify solutions solutions to keep similar actions from occurring again.\nA House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will hold a hearing Thursday on the cheating scandal. It will call VW’s top U.S. executive, Michael Horn, to testify, along with EPA officials. The panel has also sought documents from both EPA and VW. The Justice Department, at least 30 state attorneys general and regulators around the world are investigating. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has not taken any steps to open a probe.\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has previously held hearings on Toyota Motor Corp.’s sudden acceleration crisis, Delphi Corp.’s decision to end salaried retiree pensions and General Motors Co.’s Volt battery fires, among other auto related issues in recent years. But it has not taken a big role on autos since Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., stepped down as chair of the oversight panel.\n“Clearly, there appears to be a growing and pervasive disregard for consumer safety, public health, and environmental protections by some within the auto industry. By convening a hearing on the implications of deceptive practices within the auto industry, the Committee can thoughtfully consider the negative consequences for U.S. taxpayers, auto workers, and federal regulatory agencies, and determine if adequate protections are in place to minimize or eliminate future occurrences,” the three Democrats wrote.\nThe three want a new hearing.\n“As former chair of the Transportation Committee in the California State Senate and a member of the California Air Resources Board, I am deeply concerned about the blatant and pervasive disregard for environmental protections, consumer safety, and public health in the automaker industry. Individual bad actors must be held accountable to dis-incentivise corporate wrongdoing, and we must fully comprehend the role of federal agencies in regulating these companies,” DeSaulnier said.\nDozens of lawsuits have been filed, VW’s CEO has stepped down and the company has set aside $7.3 billion to handle the costs.\nColeman said, “There’s no excuse for misleading and outright deceiving American consumers. We need to understand what happened here, and whether actions like these have become a trend within the auto industry that requires additional action at the federal level. Consumer safety, environmental stewardship, and the well-being of our communities are vital. Our committee can and should play an important role in safeguarding these priorities.\nDShepardson@detroitnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:46:25.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
