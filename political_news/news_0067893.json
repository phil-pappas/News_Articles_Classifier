First it had to deal with competition from more sexually explicit magazines like Penthouse and Hustler. Now the Internet is awash in high-definition porn.\nPlayboy has decided that the answer is less skin, not more.\n\"You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it's just pass√© at this juncture,\" Playboy Enterprises CEO Scott Flanders told The New York Times.\nStarting in March, Playboy's print edition will still feature women in provocative poses, but they will no longer be fully nude. It will become more like Esquire and other magazines with PG-13-type pictures.\nThe Times said the magazine has not decided whether to continue having a centerfold.\nPlayboy became famous for publishing naked photos of some of the world's most famous women. Marilyn Monroe was its first centerfold, 62 years ago.\nAlthough the change represents a major shift for the magazine, it is also the latest step away from full nudity, which was banned from Playboy's website in August 2014. That helped make the site safer for work and public places, and enabled Playboy to get onto Facebook, Twitter and other platforms.\nThe magazine has said its online audience soared with that move, averaging a fourfold increase in monthly unique visitors.\nThe Times said taking full nudity out of the magazine was also something the 89-year-old Hugh Hefner signed off on when Playboy editor Cory Jones ran the idea by him.\n\"The political and sexual climate of 1953, the year Hugh Hefner introduced Playboy to the world, bears almost no resemblance to today,\" Flanders said in a statement. \"We are more free to express ourselves politically, sexually and culturally today, and that's in large part thanks to Hef's heroic mission to expand those freedoms.\"\nThe shift will be accompanied by other changes in the magazine, including a slightly larger size and heavier, higher-quality paper meant to give the magazine a more collectible feel.\nPlayboy's print circulation, measured at 5.6 million in the 1975, is now about 800,000, according to Alliance for Audited Media, the Times reported.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:28:38.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
