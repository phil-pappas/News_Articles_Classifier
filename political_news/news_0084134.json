PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton is downplaying the prospect for significant gun law changes in the wake of the latest mass shooting at an Oregon community college. \nDayton said Friday he was “abhorred by” the campus shooting that left more than a dozen people dead or wounded, including the suspected gunman. But he says stricter gun laws wouldn’t necessarily change the dynamic or keep people intent on carrying out similar rampages from getting firearms illegally. \nThe two-term Democratic governor has proposed tightening background checks for firearm purchases at gun shows. But he says “Minnesota’s laws are as strong as you’re going to get out of the Minnesota Legislature.” \nPast pushes to toughen gun laws in the state have fizzled in the Legislature amid bipartisan resistance. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:38:58.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
