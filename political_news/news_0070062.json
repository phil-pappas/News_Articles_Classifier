But district board president Fred Gralinski charged Monday night that Governor Raimondo and state revenue officials duped district taxpayers by drafting a plan of “smoke and mirrors” insufficient to meet the district’s debt — and then did virtually nothing as a local bank froze its cash accounts. “As of this moment we don’t have any money,” Gralinski told about 300 district residents gathered in the high school auditorium. “They stuck it to us … The state left us as a train wreck.” “I want you to know the state wants this district to fail,” Gralinski said. “They want the [neighboring] Anthony district to fail, too” and then have them folded into a town fire department. The state’s announcement last month that it was retreating from reorganizing the district came weeks after a federal bankruptcy court judge raised serious questions about its feasibility since it relied on tax increases. Under the district’s charter, only residents — not a state receiver — can approve any tax increase. And they have repeatedly said no. At the time David Sullivan, the acting director of the department of revenue, and a Raimondo spokeswoman emphasized that the state wasn’t leaving the district broke; because of months of work by receiver Mark Pfeiffer, the district’s financial picture had improved, they said, and it had more than $1 million in cash to pay obligations for a time. But Gralinski asserted Monday that state officials knew Centerville Bank would move to freeze the district’s accounts — now totaling about $875,000 — once the reorganization plan fell apart and they did nothing until it was too late. On Sept. 30, the day before the district was scheduled to take control of its finances again after three years of state oversight, Gralinski said he received a letter from Pfeiffer suggesting the board may want to get insurance for its accounts to preserve their cash flow. But Gralinski said the district wasn’t yet in control of the district’s finances when he received Pfeiffer’s letter and couldn’t move to protect the money. State officials “knew that money would be grabbed,” Gralinski said. “They did it to you. They did it to me.” Monday’s meeting was initially scheduled to set the district’s annual budget. But Gralinski told the audience the board couldn’t at the moment because the required assessment of real estate in the district hadn’t been completed. Page 2 of 2 - The assessment is usually done annually before a tax rate can be set, he said, but during the time the district had been in state receivership, “the evaluation has not been upgraded.” It was one more thing they state “dumped on us,” Gralinski said before the meeting. Gralinski said the board had hired an accountant to conduct the property assessment. The review should be completed Wednesday. The board moved to continue last night’s meeting until next Thursday to set a budget. The district’s finances were first thrown into chaos in 2011 when it was discovered that the previous board had overestimated tax revenues for two straight years, and furious taxpayers refused to approve a tax increase to cover the $1.6-million mistake. That led to the district being taken over by the state. The district is also facing $5.1 million in debt, Gralinski said. The state bankruptcy filing had shielded the district from those debts and would have required creditors to take less than they were owed. One resident Monday night asked: who was to blame for all of this? “I guess there are a lot of people to blame,” Gralinski said. The district “was allowed to operate without any oversight.” “Democracy,” he said, “means involvement. It means paying attention.” tmooney@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:10:42.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
