(UAII), who provide services to around 300,000 Native Americans. They come from many of the 500+ national Indian tribes scattered across the US but live in the Los Angeles area. \nSteve said UAII are an organisation looking for solutions. \n“They are the Waipareira of Los Angeles, “explained Steve, who will had back to the US soon. \n“They like the concept of Whanau Ora. We have shared with them the learnings of Waipareira and Te Pou Matakana, and hopefully on the back of that, Whanau Tahi will join all their dots.” \nSteve said like urban Maori, urban Indians face the same types of issues, as in health and social services. \nHe met with United American Indian Involvement Inc. when he and Waipareira CEO John Tamihere went to the US as part of the Auckland Council Mayoral delegation to Los Angeles and the korero started from there. \n“This MoU will be realised by us sharing key documents, and then look to support and consult with them,” Steve said. \nWhanau Tahi i- which is wholly owned by Waipareira – has recently acquired the Connected Care IT system from HSA Global. \nFor more information on Whanau Tahi go to www.whanautahi.com For more information on the United American Indian Involvement Inc. go to www.uaii.org \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:26:17.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
