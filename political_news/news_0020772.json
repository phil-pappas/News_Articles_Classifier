In a speech on Thursday at the annual gathering of the Valdai Club, a group of Russian and international analysts and politicians, Putin said the US had attempted to use terrorist groups as “a battering ram to overthrow regimes they don't like”. He said: “It's always hard to play a double game – to declare a fight against terrorists but at the same time try to use some of them to move the pieces on the Middle Eastern chessboard in your own favour. There's no need to play with words and split terrorists into moderate and not moderate. I would like to know what the difference is.”", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/vladimir-putin-accuses-us-backing-terrorism-middle-east"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:31:42.222+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
