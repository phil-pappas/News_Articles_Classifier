Bush’s campaign said he had $10.3 million in the bank – providing a stark contrast with fellow Floridian Rubio’s campaign, which raised only $6 million last quarter but reported having $11 million cash on hand.\nWith the pace of his fundraising appearing to slack off amid falling poll numbers, Bush has been scaling back some expenses as donors and supporters have grown increasingly nervous. Rubio, meanwhile, has run what appears to be a leaner campaign.\nRather than compare the former governor to his current rivals’ fundraising efforts, Bush had his campaign issue a detailed memo outlining the campaign’s size in the early-voting states, the number of voter contacts it says it has made (1 million) and the relative challenge of raising money in such a competitive field compared to the GOP’s last presidential cycle. Bush's team noted that Mitt Romney pulled in $14.2 million in the third quarter of 2011.\nBush campaign manager, Danny Diaz, also took a shot at front-runner Donald Trump, who has raised and spent nearly nothing but has rocketed to and remained at the top of the field on the force of his personality and name ID.\n“We knew from the start this was going to be a hard fought and close race, but few could have anticipated just how volatile this field would be,” Diaz wrote. “I – for one – would be less than forthcoming if I said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer health care and partial-birth abortion would be leading the Republican Primary.”\nDiaz also boasted about the super PAC that’s bearing the bulk of Bush’s advertising expenses, just as a political nonprofit called Conservative Solutions is helping Rubio, albeit to a lesser extent.\n“The Right to Rise Super PAC has $33 million reserved for advertising in Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina,” Diaz wrote. “The only other committee with reservations that even approach that amount is Senator Rubio and The Associated Press recently reported that with his current cash on hand he “cannot afford the space he has reserved.”\nDiaz also shrugged off the polling data showing the once-frontrunning Bush trailing in fourth and fifth place in many national and early state surveys: “Voters in Iowa and New Hampshire are notoriously late deciders. In 2012, Rick Santorum won Iowa having just 2 percent in October. In New Hampshire, exit polls showed 46 percent made their decision the week before the election.”\nMore importantly, Diaz said that key political endorsements matter more. “Jeb continues to dominate this category,” Diaz wrote.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:48:13.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
