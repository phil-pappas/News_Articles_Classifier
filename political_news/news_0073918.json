Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and the Ranking Member of the Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-M.D.) about their upcoming hearing with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We also discussed the heated investigation with President Obama's former senior adviser and Democratic Strategist David Axelrod.\nRepublican chairman Trey Gowdy issued a strong response to members of his own party making comments about the nature of his investigation. \"Shut up talking about things that you don't know anything about.\" The congressman said, adding \"unless you're on the committee, you have no idea what we have done, why we have done it and what new facts we have found.\"\nGowdy's remarks come just days after another Republican member of the House, Rep. Richard Hanna (N.Y.) made accusations that the Committee has turned the Investigation of the September 11, 2012 attacks in Libya into a politically motivated quest to damage Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. While Gowdy acknowledged that the former Secretary of State is an \"important witness\" he also told our host, John Dickerson, that she is not the only focus of this investigation.\n\"She's one out of 70 [witnesses].\" He said. \"I get that she gets more attention than the other 69. But frankly, if you ask me, the eyewitnesses on the ground that night in Benghazi are more important to me.\"\nOur conversation with the South Carolina Congressman made headlines in AP , The Washington Post , CNN , Business Insider and Reuters .\nThe Ranking Member of the Committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-M.D.) was also on \"Face the Nation\" this week and told Dickerson that Clinton's hearing on Thursday will be a \"sad day for all of us,\" because the Benghazi Committee has \"strayed away from what we were supposed to be doing\" which Cummings says should be figuring out \"how to make sure that this doesn't happen again.\"\nCummings' comments were covered by The Huffington Post , FoxNews.com , USA Today , Politico and The Hill .\nFinally, joining us this week was Democratic strategist and CNN senior political commentator, David Axelrod. The former Senior Advisor to Barack Obama weighed in on the investigation and the pressure that this will put on Hillary Clinton and her 2016 presidential campaign. \"There are stakes for her, but they have been reduced by kind of the circus around this committee,\" he said.\nThe interview with David Axelrod was covered by The New York Post , The Daily Mail , and MSNBC.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/18/bengahzi-investigator-tells-gop-lawmakers-shut-up-probe/74177420/", "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/trey-gowdy-tells-republicans-shut-about-benghazi", "http://www.newsday.com/news/nation/trey-gowdy-chairman-leading-congress-benghazi-investigation-tells-gop-critics-to-shut-up-1.10978681", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3278323/House-Benghazi-chairman-Republicans-shut-Trey-Gowdy-tells-GOP-zip-members-said-panel-politically-motivated-Hillary-Clinton.html", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/18/trey-gowdy-to-gop-colleagues-shut-up-if-youre-not-on-benghazi-p", "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/18/50c2ad2a-2095-4f3e-9559-9737b39c726c/thumbnail/270x150/8839519d518f91aa6b7c5ba18a51db5d/ftncummings1018.jpg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/trey-gowdy-gop-benghazi-shut-up-2015-10", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/19/us-usa-election-benghazi-idUSKCN0SC12L20151019", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/benghazi-trey-gowdy-elijah-cummings-214908", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/18/politics/trey-gowdy-hillary-clinton-benghazi-hearing/index.html", "http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/trey-gowdy-benghazi-committee-shut-up", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/18/benghazi-chairman-to-gop-colleagues-shut-up/", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/18/gowdy-benghazi-panel-has-new-facts-focused-on-four-dead-americans-not-clinton/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-benghazi-cia_562414f3e4b0bce3470122c5"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:51:52.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
