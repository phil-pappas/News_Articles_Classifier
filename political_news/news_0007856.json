A woman works in a factory manufacturing solar power panels on Oct. 11, 2015, in central China's Jiangxi province. China's economic growth decelerated in the third quarter but exceeded analysts' expectations.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 19, 2015 | 5:48 p.m. EDT + More The bar has been set pretty low for China's economic growth this year – so low, in fact, that the country's worst quarter of economic growth since the world was just emerging from the global financial crisis actually surprised analysts to the upside.\nLet that sink in for a moment. China on Monday announced its third quarter GDP expanded by only 6.9 percent year over year. The country's titanic economy hadn't previously slowed that much since 2009, immediately following one of the worst international financial crises in decades.\nAnd some analysts actually speculated whether Monday's figures were too good to be true.\n\"We don't have total confidence in the numbers, and we are surprised by the acceleration in services output given the collapse in the equity market,\" Bloomberg economists Tom Orlik and Fielding Chen wrote in a research note this week.\nSee Photos\n5 Signs the Labor Market's in Trouble Global economists were generally expecting the Chinese economy to have grown about 6.8 percent in July, August and September from a year before – dragged down by the country's recent trade slowdown, stock market volatility and currency devaluations that have taken a toll on consumer demand.\n\"[The Chinese economy] is slowing down, and we have it slowing down further next year. But gosh, 7 percent growth is pretty strong, and so is 6.5 percent next year that we have,\" Kurt Karl, chief economist at Swiss Re, said in an interview with CNBC's \" Street Signs .\" \"The real challenge for the global economy with the transition that China's in now is not so much the slowdown as the shift from investment-led to consumption-led.\"\nBut it's hard for multinational firms to appeal to Chinese consumers when domestic currency devaluations that began in August have made imports more expensive for locals. Imports into China in September plummeted 20.4 percent year over year following August's 5.5 percent drop.\nRELATED\nSeniors Miss Out on Social Security Bump And as third quarter financial data start to roll in, it's clear that international corporations are feeling the sting of higher prices for the goods they sell in China. Nestle S.A. saw sales fall 2 percent in the third quarter and attributed at least some of its weakness to \" slower sales recovery in China .\" Yum! Brands, whose operations include Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, last week announced that operating profit for its China business is expected to be \"about flat to prior year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange,\" which is likely to further drag on the company's finances.\nAnd a recent earnings update from luxury goods producer Burberry said the company's global sales in the last six months were \"impacted by [an] increasingly challenging environment for luxury, particularly Chinese customers.\" In a conference call, chief financial officer Carol Fairweather said sales in China accounts for \"something between 30 percent and 40 percent\" of the company's total revenue.\n\"Retail revenues slowed in the second quarter, reflecting a more challenging external environment for luxury customers – with increased global and Chinese stock market volatility, currency swings and concerns over slowing economic growth,\" Fairweather said in a conference call last week. \"We believe this affected the confidence of, and thus demand from, luxury consumers and especially the Chinese customer in some of our key markets.\"\nIt's important to keep in mind, however, that most American firms don't actually have much direct exposure to China. Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, estimates China only accounts for \"less than 5 percent of S&P 500 profits,\" though he notes the country's downturn \"is responsible for a lot of the weakness in commodity sector earnings.\"\nRELATED\nFortune Favoring the Freelance Economy But the indirect international consequences of a weakened China should not be overlooked. Although China's GDP growth clocked in at a better-than-expected pace last quarter, the price of oil still dipped further Monday to roughly $46 per barrel on fears that China would ease up on its substantial oil consumption.\nPersistently low oil prices have slashed the revenues and workforces of major energy companies like Chevron and Halliburton as they struggle to generate profits, and a further price plunge will do little for such firms' corporate earnings. Halliburton recently incurred $257 million in charges during the third quarter \"primarily as a result of the downturn in the energy market and its corresponding impact on the company's business outlook.\"\nAnd trading outfits at the likes of Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have recently posted extremely underwhelming equity trading profits, as markets around the world have been hampered by Chinese volatility and reduced Chinese demand for imports. Whether directly or otherwise, it's difficult to look at particularly weak quarterly earnings performance and not find some sort of smudge left by China.\n\"This quarter's earnings preview could almost be a copy and paste of the second quarter preview: It looks like we will get meager earnings growth, if we get any at all,\" White wrote in a recent research note, citing \"more evidence of slower growth in China\" as a complicating factor in the third quarter.\nTAGS: China GDP economy", "external_links": ["http://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nine-month-sales-2015", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecsnv%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=China%20Syndrome%20Dampens%20Third%20Quarter%20Earnings", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecsnv%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://washpost.bloomberg.com/Story?docId=1376-NWB25V6TTDS301-6EH6GSHBLELO3TROMEFT7Q2P0Q", "http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000433822", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecsnv%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecsnv%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=China%20Syndrome%20Dampens%20Third%20Quarter%20Earnings", "http://ir.halliburton.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=67605&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2098064", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecsnv%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecsnv%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=China%20Syndrome%20Dampens%20Third%20Quarter%20Earnings&summary=China%27s%20economic%20slowdown%20has%20left%20its%20mark%20on%20several%20third%20quarter%20corporate%20earnings%20reports.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.burberryplc.com/documents/results/2015/brby20151015_final.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:12:51.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
