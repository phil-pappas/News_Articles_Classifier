This one was a professor of ethics.\nWhen she arrived at the house on Memorial Day in 2011, Anna didn’t know what D.J. planned to do. His brother, Wesley, was working in the garden, so she went straight inside to speak with D.J. and his mother, P. They chatted for a while at the dining table about D.J.’s plans for school and for getting his own apartment. Then there was a lull in the conversation after Wesley came back in, and Anna took hold of D.J.’s hand. ‘‘We have something to tell you,’’ they announced at last. ‘‘We’re in love.’’\n‘‘What do you mean, in love?’’ P. asked, the color draining from her face.\nTo Wesley, she looked pale and weak, like ‘‘Caesar when he found out that Brutus betrayed him.’’ He felt sick to his stomach.

What made them so upset — what led to all the arguing that followed, and the criminal trial and million-­dollar civil suit — was the fact that Anna can speak and D.J. can’t; that she was a tenured professor of ethics at Rutgers University in Newark and D.J. has been declared by the state to have the mental capacity of a toddler.”\nRead the rest, if you can stomach it, at the New York Times", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/magazine/the-strange-case-of-anna-stubblefield.html?_r=0", "http://therealrevo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/anna-stubblefield-600x362.png", "http://therealrevo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/anna-stubblefield.png"], "published": "2015-10-23T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:00:51.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
