Maybe that's not such a bad thing Today, the Women's Equality Party held a policy launch - revealing practical measures aimed at tackling gender equality, for the first time. Cathy Newman listened with interest Sophie Walker has launched the first WEP policy document By Cathy Newman , Presenter, Channel 4 News 2:02PM BST 20 Oct 2015 Comments \nThe Women's Equality Party does what it says on the tin. Or to spell it out more clearly, their strategy is \"to win seats and influence, and in so doing put women’s equality where it belongs, at the top of the agenda”. \nI've got huge respect for the three women running the show: journalist Sophie Walker , broadcaster Sandi Toksvig, and writer Catherine Mayer. \nBut I'll be honest. My initial gut reaction to the launch of the party was that it was a rather depressing admission of defeat. After all, the only reason it’s necessary is because the men who run the mainstream political parties haven’t taken equality seriously. Campaigners for women’s rights will only have won when politics is no longer a patriarchy and when the policies they espouse address centuries of inequality. \"The only way we’re going to get fundamental change is by having Sandi Toksvig and co bang on about it until the blokes get the message\" \nSo I’ve changed my mind. I see now that it's ridiculously over-optimistic to think the political mainstream will voluntarily change its ways. The shifts towards a more equal society have in recent decades been microscopic – despite the fanfare. \nI’m willing to believe that the only way we’re going to get fundamental change is by having Sandi Toksvig and co bang on about it until the blokes get the message. \nSandi Toksvig is co-founder of the Women's Equality Party \nThey’ve been derided as a women’s UKIP. Now I think about it, though, why is that such a bad thing? \nUKIP may have failed to win more than a single parliamentary seat at the elections, but they won what they'd consider a moral victory, pushing the Tories into taking a far tougher line on both immigration and Europe. That's changed the debate, whether you like it or not. \nWomen’s Equality makes no bones about this in their policy launch document, urging other parties to “work with us” to deliver the policies “or simply to steal them”. \nIf Labour and the Conservatives pay more than lip service to equality , WE won’t need to exist. On the evidence to date, I’m not holding my breath. \nTake equal pay, for example – one of WE’s most prominent policies. David Cameron tried to recall his modernising roots and win his daughters' approval, by calling out pay discrimination, telling conference delegates earlier this month: \"You can't have true opportunity without real equality.\" \nYet he’s been in power for five years, and still, as WE points out, women earn only 52 per cent of what men do every year. This isn’t just because of the gender pay gap, but because they end up sacrificing their career to bring up children. \"WE's solution isn't everyone's cup of tea. They want quotas to achieve a balanced parliament\" \nWE rightly demand action on both issues. And it’s been far too slow to materialise from the government. On pay, the coalition ditched the section of the Equality Act which would have forced firms to publish salary details. \nAdmittedly, Mr Cameron U-turned on this in the summer , putting in place a plan for businesses with more than 250 employees to make public their wage breakdown. But he could and should have taken action sooner. \nWhere the Conservatives plan to double free childcare for 600,000 families faces a massive funding shortfall , WE insists that sweeping subsidies should be a financial priority. There have been fine words from the government on this, but again action has been limited. \nDavid Cameron's childcare plan could lead to a funding shortfall Photo: REUTERS \nSimilarly, on equal representation in parliament, progress has been glacial. Since 1918, a total of 450 women have been elected as MPs - fewer than the 459 men plonked on the green benches right now. \nWE's solution isn't everyone's cup of tea. They want quotas (“as a temporary measure”) to achieve a balanced parliament - 50:50 men and women - by 2025. If the means are radical, the end sounds entirely reasonable. \nEnding violence against women is another big policy area. The valiant campaign led by the former foreign secretary William Hague has drifted somewhat under his successor Philip Hammond, and closer to home, spending cuts have had a drastic impact on women’s refuges. \nWE’s pressure for extra resources on this might not get much of a hearing from the treasury, but perhaps it will make the chancellor think twice before wielding the axe again. \"While the government still dithers on compulsory sex education, WE suggests it should be addressed 'from the start' of primary school\" \nThen comes ‘everyday sexism’– the things that impact the lives of women and girls at a cultural level. \nRetailers and schools have been allowed to get away with forcing our children into gender stereotypes for too long. \nThe ‘pinkification’ of girls’ play and education matters, because if girls at playschool wear princess dresses, while boys get to build Lego, it’s a slippery slope from that to a dearth of female engineers , as young women pursue “softer” subjects. \nSo perhaps including gender equality in education guidelines - setting out what under-fives should learn, as WE proposes - is no bad thing. While the government still dithers on compulsory sex and relationships education , WE suggests it should be addressed 'from the start' of primary school. Controversial, perhaps, but learning about sex from porn sites isn’t working out too well for our troubled teenagers either. \nWE is calling for improved sex education and earlier Photo: ALAMY \nWE’s critics say being a single-issue party risks ghettoising equality. \nBut in fact, the reverse could well be true. Having authoritative, influential voices continually holding our elected representatives’ feet to the fire will force equality on to the agenda. \nThat, rather than some of the admittedly micro policy details, is why today’s launch mattered. Women's Equality Party policies at a glance \n• Gender pay : WE will require companies with more than 250 employees to publish an annual report covering women and men’s pay, employment status and working hours. To be extended to businesses with more than 50 employees. \n• Childcare : government-funded childcare available from end of paid parental leave at nine months. First 15 hours a week free, the rest payable at £1 an hour. \n• Equal parenting : parental leave to guarantee both parents six weeks away from work on 90 per cent of pay. \n• Violence against women : Restore legal aid for all cases involving domestic violence. \n• Equal representation : Ensure 66 per cent of candidates replacing retiring MPs and 66 per cent of other candidates are women. Grant 75 per cent of new peerages to women.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:10:53.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
