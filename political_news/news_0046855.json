Yantis said the home’s age and the size of the overall facility make for “unique challenges.”\nAll but one of the 13 Quincy residents who died from Legionnaires’ disease since August lived at the veterans home, and more than 40 other people at the facility were diagnosed with the disease. The elderly facility residents who died had underlying health conditions, making them more susceptible.\nLegionnaires’ disease is transmitted by breathing vapor or mist from contaminated water systems. Yantis said no new cases have been reported since Sept. 11, and no more deaths have been reported since Sept. 15.\nDemocratic U.S. Sen Dick Durbin has called for a federal review of the state’s response to the outbreak. Durbin spokeswoman Christina Mulka said he still feels federal agencies should be involved in preventing future outbreaks, as the facility receives federal funding.\nState Sen. John Sullivan, D-Rushville, said he hopes the state’s response is enough.\n“They serve a pretty vulnerable population,” Sullivan said. “It was a serious situation with the deaths. Obviously there is going to be a cost involved in fixing it.”", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1jQvIxw"], "published": "2015-10-19T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:54:19.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
