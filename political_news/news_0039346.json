Listen / 1:00 \nIn the meantime, Clinton says she will continue to talk gun policy and do so loudly. \n\"We have to be willing to take on those who are not in favor of sensible gun-safety measures. That includes the NRA, and it includes a lot of people in public life today who are intimidated.\" \nClinton never mentioned her main democratic rival, VT Senator Bernie Sanders, but gun policy is an area where Clinton has sought to draw a contrast. VT has very few gun laws and Sanders voted against the federal background check law known as the Brady Bill, which Clinton praised in Keene. \nClinton also called it “outrageous” that current law gives liability protections to gun makers and sellers, a policy Sanders backed as a Congressman but Clinton opposed as a Senator.
