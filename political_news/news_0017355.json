The audiences' laughter filled the White House East Room, which had been transformed into a concert venue with an elevated white stage and blue spotlights. \nObama called the group of performers helping him to celebrate American music \"an eclectic bunch.\" The concert was hosted by Carol Burnett and included performances by Guy, Usher, James Taylor, Queen Latifah, Smokey Robinson, Esperanza Spalding, MC Lyte, Audra McDonald, Trombone Shorty, Keb' Mo' and Brian Stokes Mitchell. \nAt a morning workshop at the White House, the first lady advised students training with some of the artists that failure and rejection are part of the steps toward achieving success. \n\"Failure is a part of that whole process,\" Mrs. Obama said. \"You just learn to pick yourself up. And the quicker and more resilient you become, the better you are.\" \nThe students from middle schools in Manassas and Herndon, Virginia, and Landover, Maryland, learned to rhyme and produce and write songs during the workshop titled \"A Celebration of Song.\" At the conclusion of the lesson, they broke out into five groups to craft and perform original work with their celebrity mentor. They were also treated to an impromptu performance by Spalding, Trombone Shorty and Keb' Mo'. \nMrs. Obama encouraged the students to work hard and practice their craft — whether that was writing or mathematics. \n\"It's really important that you all experience this stuff here in this house,\" she said. \"You all are just as important as those dignitaries that we invite here.\" \nShe added, \"Sometimes it takes sitting in this room to make you start dreaming about all that you can be.\" \n\"In Performance at the White House\" will be broadcast on PBS stations in January.
