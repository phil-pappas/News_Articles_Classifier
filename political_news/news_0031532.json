The NDC and the Peoples National Convention (PNC) are against the call for a new register. \nDan Botwe says NDC’s argument that compiling a new register would cost the nation is moot because the John Mahama-led administration has wasted money on less important things. \n“Since day one in our democracy, we always get assistance from our partners if the need arises” the MP for Okere said. \nBut the Director of Elections of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo disagrees with Dan Botwe. \nAccording to Ofosu-Ampofo, getting a new register is a huge cost to his party [NDC] because monies that will be invested for its agents to monitor the process is huge. \n“If you do analysis of the current almost 30,000 polling station across the country and the number of agents that will be deployed by my party to monitor the process is a huge cost to our party that’s our concern” Ofosu-Ampofo stated. \n“I do not believe that throwing the current voter’s register away for a new one is the panacea for a credible elections,” he said. \nMeanwhile, the EC is set to meet the various political parties and other key stakeholders next week on the controversies surrounding the current voters’ register.
