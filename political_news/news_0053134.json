Why is this not being shouted by the news media?\n“Yes, CO2 has an effect, but it’s about a fifth or tenth of what the IPCC says it is. CO2 is not driving the climate; it caused less than 20 per cent of the global warming in the last few decades”.\nOh. That’s why. The CoC doesn’t want to admit that the hysteria and doomsaying they’ve engaged in for almost 30 years has been based on a lie, and, really, they do not care a whit about the science, because this is about implementing a far left Progressive (nice fascist) agenda.\nDr Evans has a theory: solar activity. What he calls “albedo modulation”, the waxing and waning of reflected radiation from the Sun, is the likely cause of global warming.\nHe predicts global temperatures, which have plateaued, will begin to cool significantly, beginning between 2017 and 2021. The cooling will be about 0.3C in the 2020s. Some scientists have even forecast a mini ice age in the 2030s.\nIf Dr Evans is correct, then he has proven the theory on carbon dioxide wrong and blown a hole in climate alarmism. He will have explained why the doomsday predictions of climate scientists aren’t reflected in the actual temperatures.\nTime will tell. If Dr. Evans is correct, we can expect the CoC to admit they were wrong, right? For governments to finally say “enough. Just stop”, right?\nNa. The CoC will once again find creative Excuses which will still allow them to blame Mankind’s “carbon pollution” output, and say that the future is rather doomy from heat.", "external_links": ["http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/opinion/miranda-devine-perth-electrical-engineers-discovery-will-change-climate-change-debate/story-fnhocuug-1227555674611", "http://www.thepiratescove.us/2ea8a268/429b2804/ping.blo.gs/2.0.gif"], "published": "2015-10-05T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:07:53.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
