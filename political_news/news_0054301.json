Mayor Kim Bracey heard testimony from city staff and the public so she could draw up a budget for next year. \nThursday afternoon she heard from a fire chief who explained why he needed money to take care of the past due work equipment. \n\"We didn't do our annual aerial ladder testing this year. So the increase gets us back to where we were to be able to do some things that we should be doing with the trucks,\" York City Fire Department Chief Dave Michaels said. \nThe chief is also requesting the city add two fire fighter positions.
