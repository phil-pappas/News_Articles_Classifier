More Obama U-turn on troops in Afghanistan \nCrowdstrike, which detects intrusions on computers, said Chinese attackers appeared to be pressing on with attempts at breaking into American corporations, particularly in the intellectual property-rich technology and pharmaceutical sectors. \nDmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of Crowdstrike and a former senior leader at McAfee, said the first intrusion came just a day after President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping agreed not to conduct or knowingly support the theft of trade secrets to improve companies’ competitiveness. \n“The very fact that these attempts occurred highlights the need to remain vigilant despite the newly minted cyber agreement,” he said. “The intrusion attempts are continuing to this day, with many of the China-affiliated actors persistently attempting to regain access to victim networks even in the face of repeated failures.” \nThe agreement, reached on September 25, came after the US threatened Chinese individuals and companies with sanctions in an attempt to stop the alleged theft of commercial information from US company networks. \nMr Obama has declared cyber threats from abroad a “national emergency” and it was a priority during the first state visit of Mr Xi to Washington DC. \nLast year the US made its first ever indictments of Chinese soldiers for hacking into US companies. FT Series \nCyber insecurity \nDevastating cyber attacks are on the rise, putting vast amounts of personal and business data at risk. FT examines how banks, companies and governments are trying to mount a concerted fight-back against the hackers \nUS authorities have concluded that three state-owned Chinese companies benefited from trade secrets stolen in the attacks on five US companies and a US trade union, according to people familiar with the indictments. The three companies were Chinalco , the biggest aluminium company in China, Baosteel, a large steelmaker, and SNPTC, a nuclear power company, they claim. \nIf the US were to issue cyber sanctions against these three companies, it would represent a significant escalation because of their centrality to the Chinese economy. \nCrowdstrike tracked only attempted intrusions that appeared to be seeking intellectual property, rather than conventional cyber espionage for national security reasons, which was excluded from the agreement. \nMr Alperovitch called on the governments to make it clear if there was an agreement on how long it would take to implement the deal, saying it was “not entirely unexpected” that it could take some time for China to dismantle its corporate intelligence gathering operation. \nThe US has not withdrawn the threat of cyber sanctions. John Carlin, the cyber security official at the Department of Justice, restated the US threat of sanctions for hacks a couple of weeks after the agreement was reached, saying that the US would pursue Chinese hackers if it believed they were engaging in corporate cyber espionage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:35:01.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
