In a statement issued through Crown, the artist said he would describe the \"struggle for individual freedom and self-expression in this old society.\"\nAi often uses his work to draw attention to injustices in China. He also played a key role in designing the \"Bird's Nest\" Beijing National Stadium ahead of the 2008 Olympics, a project he later said he regretted.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:34:32.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
