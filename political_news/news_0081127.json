Do you think we should move to a higher wage, lower welfare economy and ultimately that's the decision we are all being asked to take as Members of Parliament,\" he said. \n\"We all know this is fundamentally a judgment call and I'm comfortable with the judgment call that I've made and that the House of Commons supported this week.\" \nHe added: \"The House of Commons has passed this measure twice, it now sits in the House of Lords and the question for the House of Lords is, is it going to respect the 1911 settlement that says the House of Lords must not second guess the House of Commons on financial matters?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:48:51.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
