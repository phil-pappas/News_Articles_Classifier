It’s just two words at the top: first name, surname.” \nMr Cameron’s promise to tackle discrimination partly reflects his “compassionate Conservatism” agenda, but it is also partly to dispel any fears that his crackdown on Islamic extremism is racially divisive. \nHe will announce today that the civil service, the BBC, the NHS, learndirect, local government and the Conservatives will implement name-blind recruitment, together with private sector companies HSBC, Deloitte, Virgin Money and KPMG. Teach First, one of the UK’s biggest graduate employers, already hides applicants’ names. \nThe government hopes the practice will spread more widely through the private sector. It cannot eliminate discrimination on its own, though, not least because it only covers the initial stage of sifting through application forms. In addition, most companies only plan to use it for graduates and apprentices. In the civil service, it will be used for a wider range of roles, but not for those at Senior Civil Service level. \nThe prime minister’s spokesperson said that was because some recruiters would use headhunters to find top external people, when individual reputations were important. She said it was most important to tackle discrimination at the start of people’s careers. \nThe government’s push on discrimination coincides with a growing realisation within some large companies that they will have to change their recruitment processes if they want more diverse workforces. Deloitte recently decided to hide the schools and universities of applicants from its recruiters, for example. \nAt the same time, the government is ratcheting up the pressure on employers to tackle gender discrimination . It announced on Sunday that it would force large companies to publish information on the average bonuses they pay to their male and female workers as part of its gender pay gap disclosure rules. Women’s hourly earnings are on average 9 per cent lower than men’s, although the gap has almost closed for full-time workers under the age of 40. \nThe government also plans to extend its target for women to take up one in four seats on company boards to publicly listed businesses in the FTSE 350 share index. \nThis year for the first time businesses in the FTSE 100 hit the government target for 25 per cent of their board members to be female. \nA third of FTSE 350 companies told a FTSE/ICSA survey this summer that they would not reach the target by the end of the year, and nearly two-thirds had no plans for how they might do so. \nThe 25 per cent target originated in an interim report by Lord Davies of Abersoch, published in 2011. Lord Davies is due to publish his final report this week. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
