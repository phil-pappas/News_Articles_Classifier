I like it here just fine, and what’s more, I’m not from St. Louis, hardly know my way around there beyond getting in and out of the ballpark, never even had a frozen custard from Ted Drewes.\nI’m from central Illinois where the Cubs-Cards rivalry is a raw affair dividing neighbors and families, the friction honed from a lifetime of conflict that has little to do with the cities behind the ballclubs.\nGrowing up there, I always thought it was split evenly between Cubs and Cards fans, but my childhood friends who favored the Cubs told me later they were the minority, a very oppressed minority.\nLooking back, it does occur to me that discovering a friend was a Cubs fan was like learning of some disappointing character flaw I should have spotted sooner. Learning that a family member was a Cubs fan was worse, even if only by marriage. What did she see in that guy anyway?\nAt this point in the conversation, someone invariably accuses me of being a Cubs hater, which I categorically deny. Why would I bother hating a team that historically has posed so little threat to my own?\nIn fact, the Cubs have often figured prominently in great moments in Cardinals history.\nThe Cubs were kind enough to play the fall guy for the 3,000th hits of both Lou Brock and Stan Musial and for Mark McGwire’s 62nd home run (it seemed important at the time.)\nBut there aren’t many great team memories involving the Cardinals and Cubs for the simple reason that it’s quite rare for both teams to be good in the same season.\nThe Cardinals have made 10 trips to the World Series during my lifetime, winning only five of them, a source of some frustration I must admit.\nYes, Cardinals fans are greedy. We always want more, which brings me to the upcoming series.\nSpeaking only for myself, I’ve been dreading the possibility of facing the Cubs in the playoffs.\nFor one thing, this Cubs team is good. Cardinals fans know it. We saw the young Cubs players come up, witnessed for ourselves their talent and sensed the shifting balance of power.\nAnd now this whole Cubs history mojo is upon us, which normally would work in the Cardinals’ favor, except these young Cubs players seem oblivious to the hex thanks to free-spirit manager Joe Maddon, a sharp contrast to the Cards’ dour Mike Matheny.\nWatching the Cubs and Cardinals these past two seasons has reminded me of when my younger brother started catching up to me in size and strength, injecting a new uncertainty into the outcome of our occasional fights.\nFor a few more years, I held him off with guile and cunning, but then came the day when I realized it was no longer a good idea to pick fights with my little brother.\nThe difference, or course, is that I could choose to avoid fighting him, while the Cardinals must keep playing the Cubs.\nI expect the Cards have enough cunning, guile — and pitching — to get past the Cubs this one more year, and then I will pray they get stronger before next season.\nYou see, I don’t hate the Cubs, but I truly hate losing to the Cubs, and now I have gone and picked another fight.\nFollow @MarkBrownCST\nTweets by @MarkBrownCST", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MarkBrownCST"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:36:00.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
