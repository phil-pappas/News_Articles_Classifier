Really bad news for Russia, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Way better news than the many doomsayers that are predicting $30/bbl. Location: nunya Posts: 2,922 I have always liked T.Boone. He seems to be a pretty straight matter of fact kind of person Better to reign in Hell Location: Massachusetts Posts: 2,741 Tbone is the guy that got killed in like season 2 of the walking dead right? I didn't know he was in oil now. Good for him. He thought OPEC would cut production, and that US shale oil production would fall. Both went up. Oil should stay low for a while, like for years. There's just so much of it. Location: Ohio Posts: 460 What does T. Boone Pickens know? Warren Buffet don't know shit from shinola. It is unprecedented that OPEC has not cut oil production to raise the price of a barrel of crude. Perhaps Bush 1 and Bush 2 cut a deal with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States to save their butts in Gulf 1 and Gulf 2. Quote: Originally Posted by Twisted Sister What does T. Boone Pickens know?

There is no \"free market\" in oil. 90% of oil is government controlled and governments have \"other priorities\", maximizing profits can come second or even third, so their behavior is unpredictable. In this case, OPEC and US shale oil producers behaved exactly the way market theory predicts they should behave, by increasing production to cover revenue shortfalls caused by lower prices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:07:21.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
