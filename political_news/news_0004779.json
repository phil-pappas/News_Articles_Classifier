Earlier this year, the budget office estimated 21 million people would get coverage through the marketplaces next year.\nAdministration officials defended the slow growth in the marketplaces, noting that as the number of Americans lacking insurance goes down, reaching the remaining ones is difficult.\n“We believe 10 million is a strong and realistic goal,” said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell. “We’ve seen high levels of satisfaction with the marketplace and expect the vast majority of our current customers will re-enroll.”\nBut the lower projected enrollment will likely fuel criticism from Republican opponents of the health care law, who continue to argue that it should be repealed.\nAdministration officials and other supporters of the law counter that the slow enrollment growth partially reflects some of the law’s success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:50:53.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
