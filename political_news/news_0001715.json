Her sister and fellow model Bella tells Porter magazine that she began riding horses at age 3. \"My devotion stemmed from my mom's love of horses,\" she says, \"I have been riding since I could walk and the fact that my mom knew everything about horses really helped my passion grow.\" Now, Hadid is training to compete in the 2016 Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro. She is hoping to compete in three equestrian categories: eventing, jumping, and dressage.\n\"You know how every model is like, 'I do yoga'? Well, I find horses have the same effect,\" she says. \"You have to put your ego aside and concentrate on making the horse do the things you want it to do, and move in the way you want it to move.\" Anything that helps dissipate your ego sounds like good training for a career in fashion.", "external_links": ["https://www.portersubscription.com/?prom=PTRLG&cm_mmc=GoogleUKc-_-LDN_-_Brand_-_Porter_Magazine-_-Porter_Magazine-_-porter%20magazine_e_kwd-59309820765_PorterMagazine_FallIssue_Phase2&gclid=CNLF_b76oMgCFevpwgodmDECng"], "published": "2015-10-01T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:34:40.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
