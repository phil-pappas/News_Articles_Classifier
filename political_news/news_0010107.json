But this is the right position. \n\"And I think it's the position Jeremy Corbyn was outlining in his leadership bid and it was the position that I was outlining. We shouldn't go along with these traps and stunts, this is what they're doing, I think the public can see through that.\" \nAndy Burnham Photo: Geoff Pugh/The Telegraph 10:55 GCHQ permitted to monitor communications of MPs \nThe Investigatory Powers Tribunal has ruled that the Wilson doctrine, set up 50 years ago to prevent British spies listening in on MPs, “has no legal effect”. \nInstead they said it was “a political statement in a political context, encompassing the ambiguity that is sometimes to be found in political statements”. \nCaroline Lucas, the Green Party MP, has described today's judgement on the Wilson Doctrine as a \"dangerous body blow for parliamentary democracy.\" Today's judgement on the Wilson Doctrine is a dangerous body blow for parliamentary democracy: http://t.co/z5F0Emx2wl — Caroline Lucas (@CarolineLucas) October 14, 2015 \nThe tribunal stated: “The Wilson doctrine does not operate so as to create a substantive legitimate expectation. \n“The Wilson doctrine has no legal effect but in practice the [intelligence] agencies must comply with the draft code and with their own guidance. \n“MPs’ communications with their constituents and others are protected, like those of every other person, by the statutory regime established by part 1 of Ripa 2000.” \nCaroline Lucas has described today's judgement as a \"dangerous body blow for parliamentary democracy\" Photo: REX FEATURES 10:40 MPs left frustrated by the shadow chancellor's fiscal charter U-Turn \nLabour MPs have been left frustrated by John McDonnell's decision not to back George Osborne's fiscal charter despite previously saying he would, Kate McCann reports. \nA confusing memo sent out to all of the party's MPs last night claimed Labour has changed its stance because the new fiscal charter is different to the one that came before it. Yet the 'lines to take' document makes no mention of the interview Mr McDonnell gave to the Guardian in which he promised to back the Chancellor's position to counter claims Labour isn't tough enough on the economy. \nUnder the heading 'Why have you changed your mind?' it states: \"The Fiscal Charter Parliament is debating on Wednesday is different to the one Labour voted for in January. There is now no collective Shadow cabinet responsibility in our Party, no clarity on economic policy and no credible leadership. @BBCr4today — Mike Gapes (@MikeGapes) October 13, 2015 \n\"The previous vote was for the Government’s previous fiscal charter. Labour voted for this Charter because our stated policy was to cut the deficit every year and get the current budget into surplus and national debt falling as soon as possible in the next Parliament. The previous Charter was consistent with that position so we voted for it. \n\"This Charter is different. It binds the hands of a government to austerity, regardless of what’s right for Britain, it would mean that we couldn’t borrow for capital investment. \n\"It’s becoming increasingly clear that George Osborne is simply playing political games, regardless of the changing economic situation. Labour will vote against this Tory ideology of austerity.\" \nIt even calls Mr Osborne out for the \"shift\" between the old charter and the new one. \nBut not a word about how Mr McDonnell has shifted his own position. 10:30 Nick Clegg: Big mistake sitting next to Cameron at PMQs \nNick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat leader, told Newsnight on Tuesday: “The optics of politics made it almost impossible for people to understand what Liberal Democrats did in the Coalition. \n“Sitting mute next to David Cameron at Prime Minister’s Questions every week was a sort of terrible encapsulation of what our critics said about us, that we were somehow just sort of passengers in the Government when in fact we were active architects rather than observers of the Government. \n“And maybe my biggest mistake was sitting where I did during Prime Minister’s Questions and I should have sat somewhere else. \nDavid Cameron, left, and Nick Clegg, right, have traded blows on the campaign trail Photo: Getty Images 09:57 Employment rate highest since records began \nThe latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show unemployment has fallen to a seven-year low while a record number of people are in work. \nThe jobless total fell by 79,000 to 1.7 million in the quarter to August, the lowest figure since the summer of 2008, giving a jobless rate of 5.4 percent. New stats show highest rate of employment in our history at 73.6%, youth unemployment rate at 7 year low & pay rising strongly at 3% — George Osborne (@George_Osborne) October 14, 2015 \nIain Duncan Smith, Work and Pensions Secretary, said: \"This is a fantastic set of figures, which show more people in work than ever before and a strong growth in wages. \n\"That is a credit to British business, and a credit to the hardworking people of this country. \n\"Alongside this, unemployment has fallen to the lowest level since 2008, and long-term unemployment has dropped by a staggering quarter over the last year. Unemployment falls: \"Hopefully now people are starting to feel better off\": Iain Duncan Smith http://t.co/JoBK70ijOT — Victoria Derbyshire (@VictoriaLIVE) October 14, 2015 \n\"This positive picture is replicated up and down the country, demonstrating that this one-nation Government is delivering a society with opportunity and security for all at its heart.\" \nAverage earnings increased by 3 percent in the year to August, 0.1 percent up on the previous month. \nThe number of people on the claimant count last month increased by 4,600 to 796,200. \nIain Duncan Smith Photo: Rex Features \nGeorge Osborne, responding to the new figures, said: \"It is great news that Britain’s economic plan continues to create jobs and increase pay. We’ve got the highest rate of employment in our history, and real terms pay rising strongly. \n\"But with recent data showing our trading partners’ growth is slowing we must not be complacent. All of this progress will be at risk unless we carry on with our plan to build a resilient economy, delivering the economic security of a country that lives within its means.\" \nJames Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: Another month of impressive jobs figures and strong wage growth show that the business-led recovery is well on track. \n\"Despite uncertainties at home and abroad, employers have continued to create jobs, raise productivity and boost pay in a vote of confidence in the British economy. Employment is up in most sectors and across the country, pay is growing and long-term, short-term, and youth unemployment are all falling. \n\"This is a welcome sign of a healthy economy, a strong private sector, and a tightening labour market. 09:55 John McDonnell says Labour won’t play \"these silly Westminster games anymore\" \nWriting in the Mirror this morning, the shadow chancellor writes: “Labour won’t play these silly Westminster games any more. \n“We are calling on Labour MPs to oppose this Tory Charter trick. \n\"George Osborne is pretending he wants Parliament to tie his hands. What he’s really trying to do is play a Westminster trick, and tie ours.\" \nHe said the Chancellor is preventing Labour from even making changes to the Charter and is \"closing down debate.\" \nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell at the Labour Party Conference in Brighton Photo: Heathcliff O'Malley/The Telegraph 09:50 Boris Johnson says rugby rules should be changed after Japan crashes out of the world cup. \nMr Johnson described the team as \"heroic\" and said it was \"totally unfair\" that the team had won three matches in a row, but still failed to make it through to the quarter finals. \nAsked if he backed a rule change in the game, Mr Johnson told the BBC: \"I'd support that.

We're trying to get onto serious economic debate today not those sort of political stunts any more.\" \nHe also admitted MPs were confused: \"Most probably yes but we'll make it clear today. We've had to change position on a couple of issues but today we'll clarify everything.\" \nShadow Chancellor of the exchequer John McDonnell Photo: REUTERS/Luke MacGregor 09:19 Today's Telegraph cartoon \nIn a dramatic U-turn on Monday, Labour MPs were told to vote against Osborne's Fical Charter, which has triggered open attacks from MPs against the leadership. \nAdams cartoon, 14 October 08:40 Fiscal Charter is not a 'stunt' \nDavid Gauke, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has told Radio 4 the Fiscal Charter is \"perfectly reasonable\" and not a stunt. \nHe also argued it \"increases accountability of politicians.\" \nDanny Blanchflower, Labour's new economic adviser, told the same programme that George Osborne's Fiscal Charter was \"a silly rule that nobody is going to obey.\" \nMr Gauke said: \"We need to show that in normal years when the economy is growing strongly we can run an overall surplus so we can get debt down, and ensure that we're well prepared for future shocks to our economy. \n\"It's important that we have in place a sound framework for delivering sound public finances and I urge all members of Parliament of whatever party to support this charter so that we can put it in place\" \nDavid Gauke has also introduced a number of measures that are expected to raise more than £2bn and protect a further £5bn by 2015 Photo: John Taylor 08:25 Labour could support military action in Syria without UN authorisation \nHilary Benn, Shadow Foreign Secretary, has indicated that Labour has adopted a new position on carrying out military action in Syria. \nDuring Labour's conference in Brighton earlier this month, delegates made it clear they would only support RAF strikes in Syria if there was a “clear and unambiguous” UN authorisation. \nBut in an article for the Guardian, which has been endorsed by Jeremy Corbyn, Mr Benn has suggested Labour could now support using British military personnel in Syria, without the backing of the UN. \nPhoto: IAN JONES \nMr Benn writes: “On the question of airstrikes against Isil/Daesh in Syria, it should now be possible to get agreement on a UN security council chapter VII resolution given that four of the five permanent members – the USA, France, Britain and Russia – are already taking military action against Isil/Daesh in Iraq or Syria or in both countries.\" \n“Of course, we know that any resolution may be vetoed, and in those circumstances we would need to look at the position again.” \nMr Corbyn has backed the change in position, saying: “I met with shadow cabinet colleagues today and Hilary Benn is setting out the position today.” \nThis marks a huge shift for Mr Corbyn, who has repeatedly outlined his opposition to any military action in Syria. \nUS air strikes in Syria, clockwise from top left : F-22 stealth fighter, Tomahawk cruise misile and Reaper drone Photo: Alamy 08:05 Osborne says there is still 'so much more' Britain needs to do to get the economy operating at full speed \nCNBC has spoken to George Osborne, UK Chancellor of the Exchequer at the IMF annual meeting in Lima, Peru. \nMr Osborne said: “We've got one of the highest participation rate, highest employment rate in our history at the moment and low unemployment. But I don't come here feeling it's a case of 'job done.' \n\"I always come to these meetings thinking, 'God, there's so much more we need to do: to expand our exports, make our productivity better, build more infrastructure, make sure our workforce is better trained. So I come away, more with a sense of lots to do, rather than what's done.\" \nGeorge Osborne photographed in the gardens of the British Ambassador's Residence in Paris Photo: Heathcliff O'Malley/The Telegraph 07:45 Osborne urge moderate Labour MPs to support 'economic sanity' \nThe Chancellor is looking today to exploit Labour's 'obvious chaos' after this weeks sudden policy reversal. \nLast month John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, pledged to “support” George Osborne’s fiscal charter – which would force the government to run a budget surplus within three years during “normal times. \nHowever in a dramatic U-turn on Monday, Labour MPs were told to vote against the proposal, triggering open attacks from the PLP against the leadership. \nParty leader Jeremy Corbyn applauds shadow Chancellor John McDonnell (L) after he delivered his keynote speech at the Labour Party Conference in Brighton Photo: REUTERS/Toby Melville \nThe Chancellor warned: \"This is not socialist compassion - it's economic cruelty. \n\"So today, with Labour's economic policy in obvious chaos, I call on all moderate, progressive Labour MPs to defy their leadership and join with us to vote for economic sanity. \n\"Failing that, they should at least follow the advice of the former shadow chancellor and abstain.\" \nOn Tuesday Mr McDonnell explained he still belives the deficit needs to be reduced. \nHe said: “I have changed my mind, but I haven’t changed my mind on the principles of what the charter is standing for, which is we need to tackle the deficit and we will tackle the deficit.\" \n“But I have changed my mind on the parliamentary tactics. Originally what I said to people was ‘look that charter is a political stunt, it’s a political trap by George Osborne, it is virtually meaningless – he ignores it himself time and time again. \n• Dan Hodges: McDonnell is a dangerous, ideological clown \n“He never meets his targets. So this is just a stunt and let’s ridicule it in the debate and vote for it because it’s a meaningless vote.\" \nIn an email to Labour Party members, party officials said: “It is crucial that we reduce the deficit, and Labour takes this mission seriously, but it must never be on the backs of the most vulnerable, or at the cost of the key public services we all rely on.” \nChris Leslie, the former Shadow Chancellor and Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said the U-turn “sends the wrong message to the public”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:14:45.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
