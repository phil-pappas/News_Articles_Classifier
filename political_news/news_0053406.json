(The Washington Post accidentally and briefly published such an article about Joe Biden several days ago, for example.) Below, you’ll find the analysis that Nate Cohn wrote in the event that Mr. Biden did run for president. We’re publishing it now anyway, because we think it still makes some important points. Above all, it helps to explain why he didn’t run, based on the severe challenges he most likely would have faced. — David Leonhardt There might not have been an opening for Vice President Joe Biden in the spring, but he apparently sees one now. Since then, just about every longer-term political development has gone his way — so much so that he decided on INSERT DAY OF THE WEEK to start a presidential bid with less than four months until the Iowa caucuses. Yet he enters the race behind both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders in almost every respect. He trails in the polls and in support from party leaders. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have had a huge head start in fund-raising and building a campaign organization. Mr. Biden’s decision is a gamble that the favorable political trends that have tempted him into the race will continue and ultimately overwhelm Mrs. Clinton’s underlying advantages. It’s not impossible, but it is a long shot. Mrs. Clinton will not easily collapse, as she reminded us in the last debate, but the Biden boomlet might. Late-breaking candidates like Mr. Biden are prone to falter once they enter the fray. Their standing at the start of the race is often more reflective of a favorable political tide than their true appeal. It is easy to be a sympathetic figure, or the vessel for the hopes of a political party, when you’re an imagined candidate at a feel-good moment. It is much harder to keep it up once you enter the fray, take positions, give speeches, make mistakes and face attacks. \nAdvertisement But will recent trends last?

SEPT. 11, 2015 Mrs. Clinton can vouch for the difficulty of staying popular in a presidential campaign. In 2013 and 2014, her favorability ratings were higher than Mr. Biden’s current ratings, but they eroded long before the revelations about her private email account and server as she transitioned from secretary of state to a presidential candidate. Facing the scrutiny of a campaign is, of course, a challenge for every politician. But it can make late entries look deceptively good compared with a field that already wears the scars of inevitable attacks and criticism. In the last three cycles, Wesley Clark, Fred Thompson and Rick Perry were all hailed as their party’s saviors. They rose in the polls as their advocates promoted their case. They entered the contest when their numbers were high and the front-runners were struggling. But the idea of each was better than the reality, and coverage shifted from the former to the latter almost as soon as they entered the race. Like those candidates before him, Mr. Biden could be joining the race at or near his peak. After all, relatively few were calling for Mr. Biden to join the presidential race early this year. A wave of sympathy and good will followed the death of his son in late May , and his informal presidential campaign started at a time when his persona seemed to be the perfect contrast to the beleaguered and supposedly inauthentic Mrs. Clinton. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Now he is in the race, and Mr. Biden’s policy positions and behavior will come under the scrutiny that Mrs. Clinton has been facing for months. There is no shortage of ammunition: his long record on issues like crime, finance and the Iraq war, as well as his view on the raid to kill Osama bin Laden, and going further back, his role in the contentious confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Just as the email controversy and Mrs. Clinton’s new position on the trans-Pacific trade deal have revived a longstanding story line about her trustworthiness and judgment, a misstep on Mr. Biden’s part might rekindle his reputation for being gaffe-prone or unserious. Despite avoiding the harsh spotlight of presidential politics and benefiting from recent news, Mr. Biden still starts at a disadvantage against Mrs. Clinton, and that raises big doubts about whether he should be expected to overtake her. Political News, Now. It is Mrs. Clinton, after all, who possesses the advantages that usually come with being vice president. So far, there are virtually no signs that Mrs. Clinton’s army of donors, endorsees and operatives are defecting to Mr. Biden in meaningful numbers. He may be more likable at the moment, but it’s worth recalling that this is a relatively recent development. It has been easy to forget because of her difficult summer, but Mrs. Clinton is well liked among Democrats and won 48 percent of the popular vote in a tight contest against then-Senator Barack Obama in the 2008 primaries. Mr. Biden’s two runs at the presidency were failures; he left the 1988 race after a plagiarism scandal . Making matters even harder for Mr. Biden is Mr. Sanders, who has won the loyal and passionate support of the party’s white, activist, progressive base — the natural opposition to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Biden will have to compete with Mrs. Clinton for the same set of older, nonwhite and moderate voters, but without her great organizational and financial strength. It is possible to imagine how Mr. Biden could keep gaining. The initial wave of favorable media attention could bring further gains in the polls, depending on just how vulnerable the email controversy has really made Mrs. Clinton. A three-way race could give Mr. Biden staying power, especially if donors, operatives and officials come to believe that Mr. Biden would be a better general election candidate than Mrs. Clinton. But realistically Mr. Biden is counting on an implosion by Mrs. Clinton, not on an ability to simply outmuscle her for the same voters. As long as the F.B.I. is investigating her emails, it’s hard to rule out the possibility that the controversy could take a more damaging turn. Mr. Biden would certainly stand to benefit if Mrs. Clinton imploded. He, not Mr. Sanders, tends to be the second choice of Mrs. Clinton’s older, nonwhite and moderate supporters. In a head-to-head matchup, a YouGov survey found Mr. Biden leading Mr. Sanders, 58 percent to 42 percent, even though Mr. Biden trails Mr. Sanders in the three-way race. There doesn’t seem to be much question about whether the party’s establishment, with all of its resources, would prefer Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders. The party would find it much easier to abandon a badly damaged Mrs. Clinton for Mr. Biden if he were actually in the race and on the ballot. Otherwise, the party would be far likelier to prop up a flagging Mrs. Clinton against Mr. Sanders. No matter what, Mr. Biden can make Mrs. Clinton’s life more difficult. If he had stayed out, she could have consolidated the coalition of voters who have traditionally given establishment candidates an advantage over the party’s liberal, activist wing. Now she’ll face a candidate who can contest her advantages, and perhaps prevail. But Mr. Biden could use a few more breaks his way before closing the gap. Otherwise, he might not even win a state. \nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter . Sign up for our newsletter.
