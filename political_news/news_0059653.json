This year's annual Giveaway will be held at the Fred Jordan Missions, located at 445 Towne Avenue, on Thursday, Oct.1, beginning at 9:00 a.m.\nThanks to a unique 27-year partnership between Foot Locker, a global athletic specialty retailer, and Fred Jordan Missions, this partnership has supplied more than 100,000 children with new athletic shoes. For many of these children, this will be their first opportunity to receive a brand new pair of athletic shoes.\n\"Children throughout the Southland look forward to this day all year,\" said Willie Jordan , President of Fred Jordan Missions. \"Countless children come to this event with old, ragged, too-small shoes stapled or taped together and yet they leave with brand new beautiful, colorful athletic shoes.\"\nOn Oct. 1, dozens of Foot Locker associates – dressed in their trademark black and white striped uniforms – will measure each child for new shoes. Volunteers from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, corporations, churches and schools will escort the children to tables piled high with donated gifts and hygiene kits. In-N-Out Burger will bring their signature red and white food trucks to serve the children and their parents a delicious burger hot-off-the-grill, followed by a visit to Paul Mitchell's tent, where stylists will cut and style each child's hair.\nFred Jordan Missions, open 365 days a year, has fed hundreds of hungry people and provided assistance to impoverished individuals and families since 1944. The Mission is a non-profit, faith-based, educational, and relief organization that focuses on education, job training, and self-reliance.\nFoot Locker\nFoot Locker is part of Foot Locker, Inc., a specialty athletic retailer that operates approximately 3,500 stores in 23 countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
