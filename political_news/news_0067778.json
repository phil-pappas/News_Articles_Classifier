Once Wolfe is officially activated, the Broncos will have to make a corresponding roster move to open up a spot.\n\"I expect him to hop right back in there,\" Kubiak said. \"It was great to see his face here in the room.\"\nThe defense should reap the benefits of Wolfe's return, but that'll mean fewer snaps for the current defensive ends.\nSports Poll: Running back Who should be the Broncos' starting running back? C.J. Anderson Ronnie Hillman Kapri Bibbs Juwan Thompson Voting Requires Javascript\nKubiak commended defensive end Vance Walker for playing his best game of the season Sunday against Minnesota. And because of depth, defensive end Kenny Anunike didn't even suit up Sunday.\n\"We have a very competitive environment right there,\" Kubiak said. \"That's only going to make us better.\"\nWolfe has started all 43 games since being drafted 36th in the 2012 draft.\nRamblin' running Ronnie\nRonnie Hillman was the Broncos' offensive player of the week. Kubiak gave him the award based not only on the 72-yard run that broke the game open, but also his tenacity in pass protection.\nThe burst brought about questions about Hillman potentially overtaking C.J. Anderson as the feature back due to the latter's recent struggles. Kubiak hasn't made that move.\nAdvertisement \"I think of them both as starters, to be honest with you,\" Kubiak said. \"I know somebody has to walk out there on play No. 1, but they are both going to play and probably play right down the middle. It's obvious that Ronnie has earned the right to get a few more carries and play more than he has in the past. That happened yesterday and I see it continuing to happen.\"\nKubiak was impressed with the improvement from Hillman and Anderson. He saw a couple situations where the backs gained more yards than they should have based on the blocking. That's Kubiak's goal — to maintain that effort going forward.\nThe big run brought a boost to the offense and a run game that desperately needed it.\n\"Going back to watch the film, we still felt like we had a few more that could have came out of there,\" Kubiak said.\nInjury updates\n• Kubiak said he hadn't watched the film to see if Vikings safety Harrison Smith's helmet-to-helmet hit on Demaryius Thomas was legal.\n\"Neck is a little sore, but he's fine,\" Kubiak said of Thomas.\nDenver Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe (95) heads to drills during practice on day 3 training camp August 2, 2015 at Dove Valley. ( John Leyba, The Denver Post ) After the game, Thomas said his neck jerked back initially and he hadn't received as hard a hit.\n• Left tackle Ty Sambrailo is still recovering from his shoulder injury, but Kubiak did say he was feeling better Monday. His status is still considered \"day-to-day.\"\nIt had to be a pleasant sight to see Michael Schofield not make any egregious mistakes or give up any sacks in his first start at right tackle. The latest offensive line shuffle raised questions heading into a game against a tough Minnesota front, but Schofield and the rest of the Broncos' big guys held their own.\n\"For a guy that played his first NFL football game, I think he played really well,\" Kubiak said of Schofield. \"I liked his effort and I liked the way he got to the second level.\"\nKubiak also commended the job offensive tackle Ryan Harris did in switching from the right to left side.\n• Kubiak said that he had no update on receiver Cody Latimer's groin injury. He's still considered \"day-to-day.\"\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1005/20151005_023041_derek-wolfe.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1004/20151004_051328_ronnie-hillman.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:14:02.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
