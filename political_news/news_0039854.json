House Speaker John Boehner speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Sept. 25, 2015.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Oct. 15, 2015 | 2:24 p.m. EDT + More Departing House Speaker John Boehner has prioritized passing an increase in the debt ceiling in his final weeks in Washington, hoping to take the contentious issue off the table for his successor in an election year and to leave office on a positive note.\nOn Thursday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew sent a letter to members of Congress warning that the U.S. would reach the limit on the amount of money it is allowed to borrow to pay existing debts on Nov. 3, two days sooner than previous estimates.\nSee Photos\n5 Things to Know About Congress This Week: 10/9/2015 “Based on our best and most recent information, we now estimate that extraordinary measures will be exhausted no later than Tuesday, Nov. 3,” he wrote. “At that point, we expect Treasury would be left with less than $30 billion to meet all of the nation’s commitments – an amount far short of net expenditures on certain days, which can be as high as $60 billion.”\nNewly unconstrained from the need to please the conservatives in his party who have dogged his efforts to govern throughout his speakership, Boehner has made it clear he hoped to strike all manner of deals to “clear the barn” before he departs.\nIn addition to raising the debt limit, likely to an amount that would push the next deadline past next year's elections to 2017, the Ohio Republican would also like to see an agreement to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year, as well as a resolution to several smaller items facing deadlines in the coming weeks.\nRepublican and Democratic members of the congressional leadership have begun discussions in earnest in the hopes of coming to an agreement that would both stave off a default and lift the sequester caps that force across-the-board cuts to discretionary spending.\n[ READ: With McCarthy Out, Who Will Be the Next Speaker? ]\nWhile details remain sparse for what the deal may ultimately entail, it is expected to include elements that will get Democrats on board, relieving Boehner from the need to convince conservatives who have shown little interest in supporting plans that could get through the Senate and would be signed by President Barack Obama.\nComplicating matters is a Dec. 11 deadline to keep the government funded and avert a shutdown.\nIdeally, Congress would combine the two issues, but the month-long gap between them actually makes doing both more difficult, one Republican aide says.\nDespite promises from Republican leadership after winning the majority last year that they would stop governing from crisis to crisis, this Congress has been largely unable to pass legislation ahead of critical deadlines.\n[ ALSO: Speaker Race Turning into Headache for GOP ]\nIf they are unable to get both a budget deal and the debt ceiling hike through at the same time, says one Democrat, Boehner will put forward a clean debt ceiling bill.\nRepublicans’ disarray over their leadership has complicated efforts to craft a solution.\nBoehner has said he still intends to leave at the end of October and believes the House GOP will be able to select a new speaker, but it’s unclear who, if anyone, would be capable of attaining the support of enough Republicans to win the gavel.\nIf Boehner leaves before completing either task, it will be that much harder for his successor – whoever that may be.\nTAGS: Boehner, John Congress Republican Party", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8aho%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Boehner%20Pushing%20Debt%20Limit%20Increase%20as%20Treasury%20Bumps%20Up%20Deadline", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8aho%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8aho%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Boehner%20Pushing%20Debt%20Limit%20Increase%20as%20Treasury%20Bumps%20Up%20Deadline&summary=The%20outgoing%20House%20speaker%20hopes%20to%20cement%20his%20legacy%2C%20but%20the%20clock%20and%20chaos%20in%20the%20GOP%20caucus%20are%20working%20against%20him.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8aho%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8aho%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/October-2015-Debt-Limit-Letter.aspx", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8aho%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Boehner%20Pushing%20Debt%20Limit%20Increase%20as%20Treasury%20Bumps%20Up%20Deadline"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:29:42.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
