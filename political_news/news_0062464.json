Now maybe it was '60 Minutes,' I don't know, but I took a big jump, but we're substantially ahead of everybody. If you would have said that, I probably would not have thought that was the way it was going to go.

Not just in real estate or whatever I do,\" he responded.\nVanity Fair is a \"failing magazine,\" he added, saying that he doesn't read a lot of the people whose pieces Cavuto mentioned.\n\"These are all people that said I was never going to run, and that if I did run, maybe I wouldn't do well,\" he explained. \"And a lot of them know differently and they understand differently, but that's what they want people to believe.\"\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/10/the-serious-problem-with-treating-donald-trump-seriously"], "published": "2015-10-13T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:29:41.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
