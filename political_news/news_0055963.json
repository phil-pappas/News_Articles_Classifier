It is a disgrace the fastest-growing economy in Europe can’t house its citizens. \n“The British reaction to 250,000 made homeless by the Blitz in World War II is instructive. \n“I’d demand the appointment of a TD with complete control over the issue. \n“He’d be granted extraordinary powers. Council employees would be required to work a seven-day rota to get boarded-up, empty properties back on the market. \n“There would be an immediate purchase of modular housing for urban areas to clear the backlog. \n“If Britain could clear a quarter-of-a-million backlog, surely we can do one in 700 families?” \nThe radio show also said a Hook-run Government would refuse migrants from the Middle East until all Irish citizens were housed. \nHe added: “I would demand that the Government give a commitment to the final figure to be accepted, rather than the interim figures which have steadily risen from 650 to 5,000.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:06:04.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
