Former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the rest of the Democratic candidates will hit the stage at the Wynn Las Vegas resort and casino, a venue usually reserved for boxing prizefighters rather than presidential wannabes.\nThe debate will mark the first time Clinton, the bloodied but battle-tested front-runner, and Sanders, the surging populist, have directly spoken to each other in public since the presidentail race began.\nAnd it kicks off a crucial two-week stretch in the Democratic primary.\nClinton will be on Capitol Hill for a day of sparring with the House Benghazi Committee next Thursday.\nHow she handles her grilling could determine whether her campaign’s worst days are behind her - and influence Vice President Biden's long-awaited decision on whether to run for president, a determination most expect before the end of the month.\nClinton has consistently led the field in national polling, as well as in most early states.\nThe other three candidates onstage Tuesday have barely registered in the national polls.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley has the most professional political operation of the dark horse candidates and has fared slightly better in early-state polling, while former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee have barely registered in the polls.\nBiden is a no-show at the debate, even though CNN kept a podium in the wings for him just in case he changed his mind at the last minute.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:27:34.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
