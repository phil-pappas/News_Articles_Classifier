Don't invite your emotions to the meeting, and remember that name-calling is a big no-no.\nBy Laura McMullen Oct. 13, 2015 | 10:13 a.m. EDT + More The last several weeks have felt like an obstacle course. You shimmied up the knotted rope of your job search – a slow, painstaking journey with stalls and starts (and re-starts). You snagged an interview and then hopped from tire to tire, nimbly answering rapid-fire questions. And finally, you landed a job.\nCongrats! Now that your hands are blistered and your legs are sore, here's one more challenge: Take on the exit interview – a 10-foot wall standing between your old job and the next one. Scale it gracefully, and you'll move on with your career safe and sound – and with a feeling of achievement as you land on the other side.\nJust like any challenge, it helps to know what you're getting into before taking it on. Start training for your final step by studying up on exit interviews:\n1. You don't have to participate in an exit interview – but you probably should. For one, this meeting is the perfect opportunity to tie up loose ends about logistics, says Rebecca Mazin, human resources consultant and co-author of \"The HR Answer Book.\" What will happen with your vacation days and benefits? What about your 401(k)? And – a particularly important detail if you're moving – does the employer have your correct mailing address? Prepare these questions before the interview, Mazin says, and then \"get clarification on what to expect and what the next steps are.\"\nThe exit interview is also an \"invaluable tool\" for your company, says Edward Yost, who focuses on employee relations as an HR business partner at the Society of Human Resources Management. Employers can learn why an employee is leaving, as well as what the company is doing well and what it can improve, he says. For example, if several employees cite a lack of training and development opportunities as their reason for leaving, their employer would likely look into fixing that issue. If employees typically quit because their salaries aren't competitive within the industry, their employer would likely focus on improving compensation packages.\nWhen you take the time to provide this insight, you leave a positive impression with your employer – more on why that's important later. Plus, Yost says, \"it gives [employees] the platform to be honest about their experience with the expectation that if they share that information with us as an employer, we're going to make the appropriate adjustments and improvements.\"\n2. Confidentiality in these meetings is a gray area. \"[Confidentiality] can never be guaranteed if the person complains about harassment or discrimination,\" Mazin says. \"An employer has the responsibility to investigate that claim.\"\nHowever, your comments are more likely to stay hush-hush if they're run-of-the-mill critiques about management that have nothing to do with an infringement of your legally protected rights . Or, at least, you'll probably have some anonymity – no \"Bethany said __", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1rqw%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1rqw%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1rqw%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=3%20Things%20You%20Should%20Know%20About%20Exit%20Interviews&summary=Resist%20ranting%2C%20and%20give%20constructive%2C%20professional%20feedback.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1rqw%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1rqw%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=3%20Things%20You%20Should%20Know%20About%20Exit%20Interviews", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1rqw%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=3%20Things%20You%20Should%20Know%20About%20Exit%20Interviews"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:31:30.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
