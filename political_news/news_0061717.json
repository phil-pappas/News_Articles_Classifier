We've become numb to this.\"\n\"We talked about this after Columbine, and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston,\" Obama said. \"It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.\"\nThe shooting at the Roseburg campus left 10 people dead and seven wounded, officials confirmed during a late-afternoon news briefing.\nObama already this year has given national statements in response to the movie theater shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana, and the Charleston, South Carolina, church massacre.\nObama this time said that the nation's grief isn't enough. \"But as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we have one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel.\"\nThe president urged the Americans and Congress to take action on \"sufficient common sense gun safety laws.\"\nHe also directly addressed the gun lobby for what he predicted will draw comments that he is once again politicizing the issue. \"Well, this is something that we should politicize,\" Obama said. \"It is relevant to our common life together. To the body politic.\"\nHe added: \"We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.\"\nObama, who is nearing the end of his second term, said the nation is going to have to change its laws. \"That is not something I can do by myself,\" he said.\nHe closed with a prayer for Roseburg family and friends and a somber note.\n\"I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I cannot guarantee that, and that is terrible to say.\"\nHe then took a long pause. \"And it can change.\"\nBelow is a full transcript of Obama's speech:\nThere's been another mass shooting in America. This time in a community college in Oregon.\nThat means there are more American families, moms, dads, children, whose lives have been changed forever. That means there's another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families, or their children.\nI've been to Roseburg, Oregon. There are really good people there.\nI want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today.\nFederal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and we've offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs for as long as they need.\nIn the coming days we'll learn about the victims. Young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard with their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives. And America will wrap everyone who is grieving with our prayers and our love.\nBut as I said just a few months ago, and I said a few months before that, and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It's not enough.\nIt does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel, and it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America. Next week, or a couple of months from now.\nWe don't yet know why this individual did what he did. And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds. Regardless of what they think their motivations may be. But we are not the only country on earth that has people with mental illnesses who want to do harm to other people.\nWe are the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.\nYou know earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, \"The United States of America is the only advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common sense gun safety laws even in the face of repeated mass killings.\" And later that day, there was a mass shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana.\nThat day.\nSomehow this has become routine. The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. The conversation in the aftermath of it. We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine, and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston.\nIt cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.\nAnd what's become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common sense gun legislation.\nRight now, I can imagine the press release is being cranked out. \"We need more guns,\" they'll argue. \"Fewer gun safety laws.\"\nDoes anybody really believe that? There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country, they know that's not true.\nWe know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws, including the majority of responsible, law abiding gun owners.\nThere is a gun for roughly every man woman and child in America. So how can you with a straight face make the argument that more guns will make us safer?\nWe know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.\nSo the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns, is not borne out by the evidence.\nWe know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours. Great Britain. Australia. Countries like ours.\nSo we know there are ways to prevent it. And of course what's also routine is that somebody somewhere will comment and say, \"Obama politicized this issue.\" Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to our common life together. To the body politic.\nI would ask news organizations, because I won't put these facts forward â€” have news organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks in the last decade, and the number of Americans who've been killed by gun violence, and post those side by side on your news reports.\nThis won't be information coming from me, it will be coming from you.\nWe spent over a $1 trillion and passed countless laws and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so. And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?\nOregon school shooting: Emergency responder audio, abbreviated This is a truncated version of a 30-minute audio recording of Roseburg police scanner traffic posted to audio site Clyp.it Thursday by an anonymous user.\nThis is a political choice that we make, to allow this to happen every few months in America. We, collectively, are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction.\nWhen Americans are killed in mine disasters, we worked to make mines safer. When Americans are killed in floods and hurricanes we make communities safer. When roads are unsafe, we fix them, to reduce auto fatalities. We have seat belt laws because we know it saves lives\nSo the notion that gun violence is somehow difference, that our freedom and our constitution prohibits any modest regulation of how we use a deadly weapon, when there are law abiding gun owners all across the country who could hunt and protect their families and everything do everything that they do under such regulations, doesn't make sense.\nSo tonight as those of us who are lucky enough to hug our kids a little closer are thinking about the families who aren't so fortunate, I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws, and to save lives, and to let young people grow up. And that will require a change of politics on this issue.\nAnd it will require that the American people, individually, whether you are a Democrat, or a Republican, and an Independent, when you decide to vote for somebody, are making a determination as to whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor in your decision.\nIf you think this is a problem then you should expect your elected officials to reflect your views. And I would particularly ask America's gun owners who are using those guns -- properly, safely, to hunt, for sport, for protecting their families â€” to think about whether your views are being properly represented by the organization that suggests its speaking for you.\nAnd each time this happens I'm going to bring this up. Each time this happens I'm going to say we can actually do something about it, but we're going to have to change our laws. And this is not something I can do by myself. I've got to have a Congress, and I've got to have state legislatures, and governors, who are willing to work with me on this.\nI hope and pray that I don't have to come out, again, during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. But based on my experience as president, I can't guarantee that, and that is terrible to say.\nAnd it can change.\nMay God bless the memories of those who were killed today. May he bring comfort to their families, and courage to the injured as they fight their way back, and may he give us the strength to come together and find the courage to change.
