Buy this photo \nLast Wednesday, as the Nov. 3 general election looms, Clifton council and school board candidates participated in a forum held at the Elk's Lodge on Clifton Avenue. \nA day later on Oct. 15, about 50 residents attended a candidates night held by the Dutch Hill Residents Association at the Family Fellowship Church on DeMott Avenue. On hand were three Clifton City Council candidates, several Board of Education hopefuls, general assembly competitors and Passaic County Freeholder candidates.

An independent and a community activist, Goldberg holds a master's degree in psychology and a master's in educational administration. The special election will mark the second time the father of three runs for a seat on the City council dais. \nFirst on the special election ballot to fill the remaining three years left on vacant seat, Goldberg contends Cliftonites enjoyed more services when he first moved into town two decades ago. He said there was less traffic, the City picked up leaves and the sewer fee was contained within residents' taxes which resulted in a tax deduction.

He attended Fairleigh Dickinson University where he was a business management major. For the past 35 years, he's operated the Clifton-based business G. Frank LLC and lives in the Rosemawr section. This is his third time running for City Council. Gaccione previously served one full term on the Council from 2002-2006. Buy this photo \n\"The sewer fee is not a bad thing. It was created many years ago and it was a good idea,\" Gaccione said in the DeMott Avenue church basement. \"But what has come out of it is because of the way it's structured.\" \nAnother top priority, Gaccione said, involves the funding and restoring of community policing. \nRay Grabowski, 61, born and raised in Clifton, graduated from Fairleigh Dickinson University with a BA degree in elementary education and taught in the Harrison school system. He currently owns Ray Grabowski Landscaping and lives in the Athenia section. Grabowski previously ran in 1986 and again in 2010 with his younger brother, Councilman Matt Grabowski, who died in February following a year-long battle with cancer. \n\"I think the City should pick an individual who can jump aboard the council,\" Grabowski said at the Dutch Hill forum. \"I think I'd bring a lot of knowledge to Clifton. If you give me the opportunity I promise to do the best I can.\" \nMatt Grabowski had won reelection to the council dais less than four months before his death. Officials observed a month of mourning but, by the end of March, the council appointed the election's eighth place finisher, Joe Cupoli, to fill the late councilman's seat until the end of the year. \nOn Oct. 9, the City's traditional ballot box event, which invites every local candidate to answer a set of questions, was hosted by Angela Veliky and Suzanne Sia. \nDuring the forum, Goldberg said local issues are very important to Clifton residents, claiming that whoever wins the council seat will have a greater effect on Clifton's residents than the presidential election's winner. \nGoldberg stated he is running on a platform of \"four Hs\" that prioritizes homes, health, happiness and hope for the future which, he said, could only be achieved if Clifton attracts middle and upper class homeowners. \n\"Everyone's talking about celebrating Clifton's 100-year anniversary but I'm excited about the next hundred years,\" Goldberg said. \"We have to bring Clifton into the future. We have to be innovative and hear from homeowners to find out what they want so we can give it to them.\" \nGaccione said zoning laws should be revisited because, otherwise, they can become antiquated or obsolete. \n\"We are a city in transition because most of our industry is leaving,\" Gaccione contended. \"In order for the City to attract new businesses we need to redo our zoning laws to make sure that they're welcome here.\" \nGrabowski, who has spent the last five years on the planning board, said he would \"bring a lot to the able\" if he were elected. \n\"I think people that know me see me out everywhere,\" Grabowski said. \"They know I love the community, I love the town and would do anything for the City. I just ask for the opportunity to serve in that capacity as a councilman.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:53:31.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
