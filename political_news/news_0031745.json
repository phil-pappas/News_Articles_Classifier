Rand Paul says no matter what Hillary Clinton says about the terror attack in Benghazi, Libya -- it happened under her watch.\nSpeaking on CNN's \"New Day\" with Alisyn Camerota, the Kentucky Republican noted that the State Department received multiple requests for additional security in Benghazi that were denied in the lead-up to the attack.\nThough the Democratic front-runner testified Thursday in a marathon congressional hearing that the requests were all made to and decided on by the security team, Paul said the responsibility still falls on Clinton's shoulders.\nRELATED: Clinton weathers Benghazi hearing\n\"I think in this case, specifically requests were made for more security and they were denied, and that is on Hillary Clinton's watch,\" Paul said. \"She sent an ambassador into harm's way and didn't provide him with adequate defense.\"\nRead More Paul referenced the infamous campaign ad Clinton run against Barack Obama when the two were facing off for the presidential nomination in 2008, questioning whether he would be ready for a \"3 a.m. phone call\" as president.\n\"I think she ran this strong campaign against President Obama saying she'd be there for the 3 a.m. moment â€” I do think this was her 3 a.m. moment and when she was called, didn't provide adequate security in Benghazi,\" Paul said. \"She's never getting away from that. I think it will preclude her from being commander in chief.\"\nPaul is running for president on the Republican side, clustered in the middle to back of the pack of candidates in polling.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:33:38.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
