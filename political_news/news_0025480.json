Our second, on an early call for a RICO investigation into fossil fuel companies — a parallel to the Big Tobacco investigation — is here . Our third, on the op-ed written last May by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, which also calls for a RICO investigation, is here . \nThe calls for a RICO investigation are starting again, thanks to the Exxon revelations. Here's Climate Hawks Vote , a climate-conscious PAC that scores congressional climate votes and vets candidates, with their own RICO request. It's in the form of a petition, and you, if you like, can sign it. \nThey write : Sign Now: Prosecute Exxon For Deliberate Climate Denial \nNewly revealed documents show that Exxon’s own scientists were aware of and studying the dangerous impacts of greenhouse gases in the 1970s and 1980s -- until Exxon’s leadership decided to shut down the research and promote climate denial instead, in order to protect the company’s unfathomably large profits. \nThe United States Department of Justice has the power to prosecute Exxon’s deliberate deception under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act - just as the DOJ did to the tobacco industry for knowingly lying about the dangers of cigarette smoking. \nTell U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch: \nLaunch a RICO prosecution of Exxon and its fellow fossil-fuel companies for deliberate and malicious climate deception. \nWill you sign? \nFeel free to join the call.
