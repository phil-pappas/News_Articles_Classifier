This week the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Cunha, is expected to decide whether or not to accept requests for the start of impeachment proceedings against the President.

The TCU’s recommendation gives legal justification to critics of the administration to request impeachment proceedings. \nA day earlier, the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) had decided to re-open an investigation requested by opposition party, PSDB, into the 2014 Presidential elections. The opposition party wants the dissolution of the mandates of Dilma Rousseff and her vice-president, Michel Temer. To add to Rousseff’s troubles, Congress was unable to vote whether to uphold the vetoes issued by the President on bills which would increase significantly public spending.

Rousseff ‘handed over’ most of the important ministries (health, mines and energy, agriculture, aviation) to allied party, PMDB, in the hopes that the largest party in Congress will be able to prevent impeachment proceedings from going forward. \nYet while the administration is having a tough month, Chamber Speaker also has troubles of his own. An investigation by Swiss authorities found that Cunha and his family have Swiss bank accounts that were never disclosed and may hold money linked to the Lava-Jato (Carwash) corruption scheme. The Lava Jato money-laundering scheme is said to have paid billions of dollars to executives and politicians for contracts with oil giant Petrobras. \nOpposition leaders both in the Lower House and Senate have called for Cunha to step down. Even some members of his own PMDB party have expressed doubts as to whether or not the representative should continue to lead the Lower House. Cunha continues to deny any wrongdoing and denying he has bank accounts in foreign countries.
