The Matrices Guide provides information on how SUT components are characterized and qualified. Main features of the Guide include:\nCoverage of six component categories (Chromatography, Connectors, Containers & Film, Sensors, Tubing, and Filters); Coverage of six test categories (Physical, Functional, Biological, Chemical, Regulatory, and Sterilization/Sanitization) ; Live links to public domain test methods or source locations; and A description of how each test is applied (e.g., in material qualification, product qualification and lot release). This technical guide was a major 2015 BPSA initiative, with more than twenty participating technical contributors, and represents a milestone in BPSA's output on technical issues, to the benefit of users and suppliers alike. The document is intended for both SUT users and component and systems suppliers of single-use equipment. The guide also covers terms and definitions and is inclusive of a complete reference section.\nThe BPSA 2015 Quality Matrices Guide was executed by BPSA under the guidance of a volunteer member committee of subject-matter experts, and funded by BPSA's Elite Sponsors: Thermo Fisher Scientific , EMD Millipore , Pall Life Sciences , Parker domnick hunter , Renolit, Saint Gobain, AdvantaPure/NewAge Industries , Catalent , Charter Medical , Chemic, CPC, Entegris , Nordson Medical, and Sartorius-Stedim Biotech .\nThe Matrices Guide may be accessed free of charge at www.bpsalliance.org . For more information e-mail BPSA Executive Director Kevin Ott at ottk@socma.com .\nAbout BPSA\nThe Bio-Process Systems Alliance (BPSA) was formed in 2005 as an industry-led corporate member trade association dedicated to encouraging and accelerating the adoption of single-use manufacturing technologies used in the production of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines. BPSA facilitates education, sharing of best practices, development of consensus guides and business-to-business networking opportunities among its member company employees.
