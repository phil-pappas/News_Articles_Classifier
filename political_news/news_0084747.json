Just last year, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded a grant to the CAP Foundation that affirmed See, Test & Treat is a well-articulated program that is implemented in a consistent manner across many different kinds of health care settings serving highly diverse populations.\n\"These are significant strides for See, Test & Treat, which is proving to be an effective coordinated care model to advance public health,\" said Rhode Island pathologist Latha Pisharodi , MD, FCAP, recent recipient of the CAP Foundation's Herbek Humanitarian Award, which awards a grant for continued program innovation to pathologists engaged in See, Test & Treat.\nCAP pathologists lead the coordination of each See, Test & Treat cervical and breast cancer screening programs, bringing together pathologists, gynecologists, radiologists, family medicine practitioners, laboratory technicians, nurses, outreach specialists and community advocates for screenings, test results, follow-up care and health education counseling. Each program serves medically at-risk populations faced with financial, linguistic, social, and cultural barriers to health care.\nThrough CPRIT's collaboration with the CAP, CPRIT will award up to $25,000 for each See, Test & Treat program to provide screenings with same-day results for uninsured and underserved women in Texas . Guidance and educational materials will be provided by the CAP Foundation. Applications must be submitted by January 7, 2016 .\n\"As physicians who diagnose disease, pathologists understand the value of routine cervical and breast cancer screening. We must help women realize the need for regular cancer screening,\" said CAP Foundation Board President Jennifer Laudadio , MD, FCAP. \"That's why we are thrilled to be collaborating with CPRIT and expanding our reach to serve more women in Texas .\"\n\"Our collaboration with the CAP Foundation underscores CPRIT's emphasis on targeting populations in Texas where significant disparities in cancer incidence and mortality exist,\" said Becky Garcia , PhD, CPRIT's chief prevention and communications officer. \"By providing Texas women screenings and opportunities to learn more about their risks, we can detect cancers earlier, when the potential for survival is greatest.\"\nBreast cancer is expected to take the lives of nearly 3,000 women in Texas this year and cervical cancer will account for close to 400 deaths, according to the Texas Cancer Registry. The incidence of both breast and cervical cancer among minority women is higher and is more likely to be fatal compared to the general population.\n\"See, Test & Treat allows women to be seen, tested, and referred for follow up care in one visit, removing significant barriers, including financial, language, transportation, or the need to take additional time off work,\" Dr. Garcia noted.\nSince 2010, the program has provided services to women in 12 U.S. cities, including three in Texas-Austin, Houston and Conroe. In Austin, more than 15 percent of the women screened had abnormal mammograms.\nFor general information on eligibility criteria, the application process and other details about the CPRIT grant visit www.cprit.state.tx.us/funding-opportunities .\nAbout the College of American Pathologists and CAP Foundation\nAs the leading organization for board-certified pathologists, the College of American Pathologists (CAP) serves patients, pathologists, and the public by fostering and advocating excellence in the practice of pathology and laboratory medicine worldwide.
