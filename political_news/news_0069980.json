The site: A 10-acre Army post, Fort Severn, in Annapolis, Maryland. The school had a five-year course, with the first and last years spent at the school and the middle three years at sea. The academy initially was formed during the administration of President James Polk with the support of George Bancroft, secretary of the Navy. Bancroft named Commander Franklin Buchanan as its first superintendent. During the Civil War, Buchanan served in the Confederacy.\nIn 1850, the school came under the Navy’s Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography and was renamed as the United States Naval Academy. It adopted a four-year course of study; summers were spent at sea. In 1892, Congress took control of appointments to the academy. Today, each member can have up to five constituents attending the academy at any time.\nCmdr. George Dewey, who defeated the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay in 1898, was one of the academy’s most famous graduates. Dewey recalled in his memoirs having served during the Civil War under Adm. David Farragut. Farragut, who received his naval training before the academy’s founding, once asked Dewey, “Now, how the devil do you spell ‘Apalachicola?’ Some of these educated young fellows from Annapolis must know!”\nConstruction of an updated 338-acre campus began in 1899; Fort Severn was demolished in 1909. The newly rebuilt facility reflected the importance of the Navy to President Theodore Roosevelt. (Jimmy Carter remains the sole academy graduate elected to the presidency.)\nThe first female officer instructor and the first civilian female member joined the academy’s ranks in 1972. The first women midshipmen entered in 1976. Today, some 1,200 men and women comprise each incoming class.\nSOURCE: U.S. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:43:52.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
