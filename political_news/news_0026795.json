Under the state constitution, senators serve staggered four-year terms, with 20 seats up in a given election cycle. But during redistricting years when district lines shift, all senators are on the ballot. \nLawmakers are currently in a special session to redraw the Senate districts after Senate leaders admitted they violated Florida’s anti-gerrymandering laws when they drew districts in 2012. But whereas House leaders believe all districts that change during redistricting should be on the ballot in 2016, Senate lawyers have said that’s not the case. \nA spokeswoman for the Department of State declined to say how the agency intends to interpret the issue, even though it’s the agency in charge of enacting elections laws. Instead, the agency will wait for the Legislature to draw the Senate districts and have the case play out in courts before weighing in on the issue. \nBut the voter groups that have brough the lawsuit against the Senate districts, the League of Women Voters and Common Cause, haven’t challenged the interpretation of which Senate seats should be on the ballot in 2016. \nThe lawsuit centers on whether lawmakers abided by the anti-gerrymandering districts. So the courts might not rule on the matter as part of the lawsuit unless a specific request is made by one of the parties involved. \nThat would leave the Department of State in the same position it's in now: having to decide which Senate seats should be on the ballot with no direction from the courts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:56:46.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
