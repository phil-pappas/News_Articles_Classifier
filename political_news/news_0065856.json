Andrew Cuomo on Thursday announced an executive action establishing the first-ever statewide regulations protecting transgender New Yorkers from discrimination. The regulations extend the provisions of a 1945 state human rights law to prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity in housing, employment and public accommodations like restaurants, hospitals and schools. They also protect transgender people from discrimination when seeking mortgages, credit cards and other financial services. Transgender people who have experienced discrimination can file a complaint in court, with the attorney general or with the State Division of Human Rights. If the division finds that discrimination has occurred, it can award compensatory damages, require policy changes, and levy fines and penalties of up to $100,000. The regulations come after years of failed efforts to enact a state law. The State Assembly has passed an anti-discrimination bill called the Gender Expression Nondiscrimination Act, or Genda, eight times , but the Republican-controlled State Senate has repeatedly blocked it. Several cities and counties in New York have passed anti-discrimination laws protecting transgender people, but nearly 40 percent of transgender residents of the state, or about 23,000 people, live in areas without protection. And transgender people in New York face disturbingly high rates of discrimination: 75 percent have experienced workplace harassment, 53 percent have suffered discrimination or harassment in a public place like a restaurant, and 19 percent have been denied a house or an apartment because of their gender identity, according to a 2011 survey . Nationwide, transgender people are at high risk of unemployment and homelessness. In the absence of an anti-discrimination law, Mr. Cuomo’s executive action offers much-needed protections quickly — the regulations will be posted for public comment by early November, and the governor’s office expects them to take effect by the end of the year. And, of course, the governor’s action does not preclude future legislative efforts. The new regulations set an important example for the country. More than 30 states lack comprehensive anti-discrimination laws that protect transgender people. Their governors should study Mr. Cuomo’s move and see if they can do the same. A version of this editorial appears in print on October 24, 2015, on page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: New York Leads the Way on Transgender Rights .
