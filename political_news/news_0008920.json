Rapid deforestation, mainly due to the oil palm industry and other agricultural plantations, the illegal pet trade, and poaching by killing mothers so their young can be taken, has resulted in the population in Borneo decreasing by more than 50 percent.\nMany orangutans, forced from their forest homes, have been taken to rehabilitation centers and are now scheduled to be reintroduced into the wild.\n[Crop fires are isolating rare monkeys in Africa]\nIf the orangutan population is to increase, conservationists must know which habitats will enable these great apes to thrive and reproduce successfully. The orangutan populations followed in the new study are two of the largest remaining populations of orangutans in Borneo.\n“If you want to increase the populations of this endangered species , you need to make sure that they are being reintroduced into suitable habitats,” Vogel says. “It means looking at forests carefully, making sure they are productive, and that there is enough food to eat in terms of caloric gain.”\nThese long-haired, orange-colored, apes depend on low-protein fruit to survive and store fat when food is abundant, so they can survive on these fat reserves when food is scarce.\n[Baboons with ‘boyfriends’ live longer]\nFemale orangutans give birth to one offspring only every seven to nine years. Reproductive success, Vogel says, is linked to the nutritional quality of orangutan diets and can have an impact on the density of the population.\n“This work not only helps us understand why orangutan abundance varies between sites, but also suggests a mechanism through which forest degradation may reduce the number of orangutans that can be supported in an area because of the quality of foods available,” says Mark Harrison Harrison, managing director of the Orangutan Tropical Peatland Project and an honorary visiting fellow at the University of Leicester.\n“Such considerations are likely to become increasingly important as orangutan habitat continues to be lost and damaged across Borneo and Sumatra, including by the dreadful forest fires currently blighting the region.”\nSource: Rutgers University\nThe post How to save orangutans: High-calorie forests appeared first on Futurity .", "external_links": ["http://news.rutgers.edu/research-news/endangered-orangutans-face-new-threat/20151008#.Vh-cSiuJ2Cj", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0138612", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/148/559_1170x669_150903596_555x317.jpg", "http://www.futurity.org/baboons-friends-763342/"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:15:59.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
