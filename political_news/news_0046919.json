Today is the International Day of Peace and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called all fighting sides around the world to lay down their arms and have a 24-hour cease-fire.\n“On this day, in the lead-up to the Day of Peace, I am asking all partners to lend their voices to this call for a laying down of arms, and to work non-stop in the days to come to bring about a 24-hour cease-fire on September 21st,” Ban said in a statement issued on 17 September.\n“Let’s make this International Day of Peace a day without violence, and a day of forgiveness. If, for one day, we can live in a world without aggression and hostility, we can imagine how much more is possible,” he added.\nInternational Day of Peace\nThe theme of the 2015, International Day of Peace, is “Partnerships for Peace – Dignity for All” which aims to highlight the importance of all segments of society to work together to strive for peace.\nThe UN was the first international organisation which praised the significance of partnerships, stressing that without the creation of thousands of partnerships each year between governments, civil society, the private sector, faith-based groups and other non-governmental organizations the work of the Organization in achieving its future goals, would be impossible.\nThe United Nations General Assembly established the International Day of Peace in 1981 as an opportunity for people around the world to promote the resolution of conflict and to observe a cessation of hostilities.\nThis year’s celebrations for the International Day of Peace will include a Peace Bell Ceremony at UN Headquarters in New York, featuring senior UN officials and Messengers of Peace, as well as a student videoconference. UN offices worldwide, including peacekeeping operations, will also be holding events with local communities.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-21T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:58:25.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
