Israel will “overcome this [wave of] terror and return safety to Israeli civilians, because we have no choice, we have no other land,” Ya’alon said in a statement. The defense minister sent his condolences to the family of Sgt. Omri Levy, who was killed in the attack, prior to criticizing the brutal beating of Habtom Zarhum — who was shot by a security guard after being misidentified as a terrorist. “Such behavior is forbidden, even when anger and sadness are great,” he said. Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein and Maj. Gen. Meni Yitzhaki, head of the Israel Police investigative and intelligence wing, spoke on Monday regarding the recent spate of attacks. Weinstein reportedly suggested that in light of the severity of the attack and the circumstances, he should be involved in all phases of the investigation. Meanwhile, Eritrea’s ambassador to Israel asked the Foreign Ministry for information pertaining to the lynching. Zarhum had been living in Israel for nearly four years, but visited Ve’er Sheva to extend his temporary residence visa and was on his way back to Moshav Ein Habesor, where he worked in a garden center. An autopsy of Zarhum’s body could potentially lead to indictments or charges against those caught on tape as involved with the beating. The Abu Kabir Forensic Institute will be held responsible for conducting the autopsy to determine the cause of Zarhum’s death. If killed by a gunshot wound, those involved in his beating will likely not face murder charges, however if it was determined that the beating led to his death, charges would still be in play for those that physically assaulted him. The Israel Police vowed on Monday that a further investigation into Zarhum’s death will ensue. Police decided to open an investigation considering the attack was on a defenseless person after the terrorist was killed and there was no longer any presentable threat. Police explain that they will proceed with this investigation “cautiously.” On one hand, police don’t want to deter citizens from acting during terrorist attacks, but on the other, they must hold each individual accountable for their actions, officials said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commented on the attack and sent condolences to the victims’ families. “We are in an extended struggle that we will surely win,” said Netanyahu, adding, “The matter causes confrontations between citizens at the sites of terror attacks. Citizens act logically and determinedly. People who are caught at the scene need to make way for security personnel. No one should take the law into his own hands.” Print Friendly 10/20/2015 1:37 PM by Ryan Haas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:52:41.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
