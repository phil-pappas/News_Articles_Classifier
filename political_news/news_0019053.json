He was the first to suggest the idea of staking stimulus measures to a specific unemployment goal, a measure that the Fed took in 2012 with its massive bond-buying program.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner House passes bill lifting oil export ban Lifting the oil export ban has become a major GOP priority.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/09/15 2:58 PM In his speech Friday, Evans suggested that the risks of waiting longer to raise rates were manageable. If inflation began to rise out of control, he said, the Fed could simply raise interest rates in response. He also mentioned that \"there is no problem in moderately overshooting\" the Fed's inflation goal, rather than undershooting it as they have in recent months.\nTop Story Book: Valerie Jarrett got Joe Biden 'psychiatric help' for 2016 Ed Klein's book claims   hard for Biden to enter the race.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/09/15 1:43 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:02:55.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
