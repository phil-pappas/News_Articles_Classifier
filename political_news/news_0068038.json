However, any vote int he bill's final readings would include MPs from across the United Kingdom.\nLast updated Thu 22 Oct 2015 Politics Scotland Cumbria Dumfries and Galloway Scottish Borders", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:46:32.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
