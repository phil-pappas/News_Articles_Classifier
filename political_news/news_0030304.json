He addressed the issue on his official Twitter account. \n“Earlier tonight, a technical glitch caused publication of a just-in-case/when-we-kno story of VP running for president,” Kane tweeted. “It happened when editors were embedding video file. It carries my byline. I regret that it was published accidentally. Deep apologies. Finally, to be clear, we don’t know if it’s a yes or a no. Full disclosure: I have a he-says-no-story also written.” \nAlso Read: Trevor Noah Calls CNN 'Amateurs' for Pressing Joe Biden to Join Debate \n“Biden world has been classy,” he continued. “Someone from VP orbit wrote me: ‘At least you didn’t accidentally publish his obit.'” \nSpeculation has been running rampant as to whether or not Biden will seek the Democratic nomination for President, with some reporting he will announce by Wednesday of this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:06:49.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
