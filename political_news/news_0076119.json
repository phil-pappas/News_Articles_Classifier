Hundreds of protesters were on the scene to demonstrate against Obama's visit. \nAccording to the Post, Obama is considering a rule change that would apply new background check requirements to gun dealers that exceed a certain threshold of sales each year. \nThe Obama Administration first drafted the plan in late 2013, nearly a year after the Sandy Hook massacre and in the months after the failed attempt to pass stricter gun regulations in the spring of 2013. The expanded background check plan, as of 2013, would have applied to dealers that sold at least 50 weapons a year. \nHere's what the Post said about the ongoing controversy: In the wake of last week's tragedy, Obama said he had asked his team \"to scrub what kinds of authorities do we have to enforce the laws that we have in place more effectively to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\" \"We are hopeful we can find a way to do this,\" said one senior administration official, who noted that lawyers were still working through details to ensure that the rule could pass legal muster. \"It's a lot more clear today than it was a year ago how to work this out.\" \n-- Andrew Theen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:43:03.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
