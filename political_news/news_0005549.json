The results also reveal that 74 percent view him favorably, a jump from 58 percent in August.\nThe news bodes well for the Catholic faith, which has seen its numbers in the United States tumble in recent years as the tally of unaffiliated people rises. A recent Pew survey found that there are about 51 million Catholic adults living in the United States today, which is about a fifth of the U.S. population. That's roughly a 3 million drop compared to 2007, although the margin of error could mean the decline is closer to 1 million.\nThe aftermath of the pope's six-day visit to Washington, D.C., New York City and Philadelphia also left people with improved feelings about their faith, whether Catholic or not.\n  Colorado to close Obamacare co-op Insurer is the third to close in a week and the seventh of 23 taxpayer-funded startups to shutter.\nBy Robert King • 10/16/15 12:34 PM More than half, 56 percent, feel better about their faith because of Francis' visit, and 86 percent of Catholics felt that way.\nA majority say they now understand Pope Francis' vision for the Church.
