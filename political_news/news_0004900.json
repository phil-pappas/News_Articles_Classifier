It is a symbol of our Jewish pride and it feels like this act is challenging that,” Center Director Rabbi Yisroel Bernath said in a statement. \nPolice claim they have no suspects or leads. Investigators have opened a file, but are not calling the incident a hate crime just yet. \nRabbi Bernath made a series of statements following the menorah being vandalized. \nHe said he discovered the 12-foot menorah missing on Sunday morning — which usually stands in front of the Rohr Chabad House of NDG — and contacted the police. \nBernath claimed the menorah had toppled over, leaving the base broken. \n“This is very hurtful,” he said. “The menorah is a symbol of light spreading forth to the NDG area and the entire world. It is a symbol of our Jewish pride and it feels like this act is challenging that. At a time like this, we rededicate ourselves to spreading the divine light of the menorah and I guarantee you this symbol will rise again in NDG bigger and stronger than ever.” \nRabbi Bernath added: “While we don’t know the cause of the vandalism, I feel it’s important to mention that over the past week, at a time when Israel has been under terror attacks on an almost hourly basis, inflammatory anti-Israel posters have been put up around Montreal and and at Concordia University by BDS-Quebec (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions). The posters depict the body of a Palestinian boy with the caption: ‘Israel is killing Palestinian children.’ I don’t know if there is a connection between the posters and the vandalism, but this type of anti-Israel incitement has been known in the past to lead to anti-Semitism, both locally, and around the world.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:57:08.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
