There earlier been calls on them resign, calls which were ignored. \nThe party’s Council of Elders had to step in asking the NPP’s Disciplinary Committee to suspend Mr. Afoko. That call has been challenged by some party bigwigs. \nNana Akufo-Addo has commented on the rancour in the party, asking supporters to remain calm and allow peace to prevail. \nBut the NDC General Secretary on Saturday question the unity tour embarked upon by the NPP flag-bearer. \nAsiedu Nketia interrogated how Nana Akufo-Addo could possible build the nation without first putting his own house in order. \nHe indicated that the NPP’s flagbearer’s tour to build the party without the party’s General Secretary, who is supposed to be his foreman when building, leaves much to be desired. \nLike the biblical parable of the talent, he noted that Akufo-Addo failed to properly manage the two regions he won in 2012 elections – Ashanti and Eastern -, and therefor it is proper that the two are taken from him by the NDC. \nHe said the NDC has stopped talking about the voters’ register because the Electoral Commission, which is the referee, has asked all parties to present their proposals to be discussed later. \nAsiedu-Nketia also urged the clergy who have been commenting on the voters’ register to also submit their proposals for consideration, hoping that the true state of the country’s electoral roll would prevail at the end. \nHe challenged the NPP to provide evidence that the register is bloated with over 70,000 names of Togolese nationals.
