Text bigger Rep. Kevin McCarthy (Credit: Wikipedia) \nKevin McCarthy, the most talked about candidate to fill speaker John Boehner’s leadership post, dropped out in a shock announcement Thursday mornning. \nAs Bret Baier, Fox News host commented: “This throws complete turmoil into this election.” \nThe statement from McCarthy didn’t give much insight into his reasons. He simply said: “It is not my time.” But many on Capitol Hill said the more conservative wings of the House pressed for him to step down. \nSo far, Rep. Daniel Webster and Rep. Jason Chaffetz are still seeking the speaker slot. \nThe support for a new speaker seems to be tipping toward the more conservative side of the House. Speaker John Boehner stepped away from the role, in part because of all the tea party-type opposition he’s faced in the last couple years. \nDonald Trump tweeted: “Great. Kevin McCarthy’s dropped out of speaker’s race.” Text smaller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:00:57.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
