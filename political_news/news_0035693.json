We did it to ourselves. Help us work to get rid of them. \n“I know you were not in the line to vote for Rawlings in 1992 and 1996, Kufuor in 2000 and 2004, Atta-Mills in 2008, or Mahama in 2012. We the voters, human as we are did the voting. \nMaster, I know you did not bring foreigners to vote in Ghana, nor did you carry minors to go and and vote.” \nBelow is his full unedited post : \nPresident Mahama said at the Grace Pentecostal branch of the Assemblies of God Church at Effiakuma in Takoradi in the Western region: \n“Our politics should never be about life and death because God in his own wisdom will choose a leader for us,” \nAnd so My Prayer to God: \nDear God, \nI know you are a kind God. \nYou love your children so much that you forgive us our sins, again and again. I pray for forgiveness for all of our people, especially those who lead our nation. \nYou give us Grace in abundance daily. It is You who have given us a fertile soil, gold, oil, manganese, bauxite, and other minerals. \nYou have made it possible for cocoa, timber, maize, cassava and others to grow when we do the work. Energize our will to put these to good use. \nMy Lord, I know you did not choose Bokassa, Iddi Amin, Jammeh, and others for Africa or Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and their type for the world. \nYou my Lord God did not rain dumsor, poverty, corruption, HIPC, illiteracy or cholera on us. We did it to ourselves. Help us work to get rid of them. \nI know you were not in the line to vote for Rawlings in 1992 and 1996, Kufuor in 200 and 2004, Atta-Mills in 2008, or Mahama in 2012. We the voters, human as we are did the voting. \nMaster, I know you did not bring foreigners to vote in Ghana, nor did you carry minors to go and and vote. \nYou Lord, did not steal ballot papers or deny candidates votes that belonged to them. \nAs I continue to pray, Master, let not your people use Your name in vain. \nTeach us not to bear false witness. \nTeach us all to pray for humility, incorruptibility, diligence and the courage to take the righteous path. \nTeach our people to know that it is they who vote and that no free manna will fall from the heavens and that whom we give our vote to will determine our well-being on this earth. \nMy Lord God, make our hearts pure and our minds fertile for the truth and help us make wise choices so that we can vote for leaders who will help us make excellent use of natural gifts you have put here on part of the world called Ghana. \nThese and others I ask and pray for in the name of Jesus. \nAmen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:08:51.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
