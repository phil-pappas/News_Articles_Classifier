He said: “I am honoured to have been chosen as the Conservative mayoral candidate and I will work tirelessly to repay that debt.\n“I have campaigned hard as an MP and I will fight just as hard to become mayor so we can build on the progress under Boris in making London work for Londoners.”\nMr Goldsmith, who inherited a fortune from his industrialist father Sir James, is an outspoken critic of expansion at Heathrow, like Mr Johnson, and opposes a third runway at the airport.\nHe has also said he wants to “mend our politics”, boost high streets, improve transport and provide a healthier environment.\nIf elected, the environmentalist is expected to step down from the Commons, triggering a by-election.\nMr Goldsmith said: “In the last seven years London has come a long way. Under Boris, London now leads the world in business, tech, media, art and culture – benefitting from unprecedented investment. It is why so many people want to live, work and do business here, and it is also putting increasing pressures on our city.\nShare article “The biggest challenge of all is the housing crisis. Londoners are being priced out of their city and we will need a step change in the number of homes built, and the manner in which they are built.”\nMr Goldsmith will go up against Labour candidate Sadiq Khan in the vote next year.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-03T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:40:21.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
