JDRF has helped direct more than $2 billion in research funding since its inception.\nDiscoveries and translational research outcomes from JDRF grant awardees have given rise to ground-breaking scientific publications, follow-on funding awards, dozens of clinical studies, patent applications and issued intellectual property; these elements have formed the foundation of licensing activity with public and private companies as well as new startup company creations.\nFor JDRF tracking and comprehensively evaluating these research outcomes has been challenging. Covalent Data's Innovation Intelligence platform is designed to deliver new dashboard views of performance metrics and analytic capabilities that, combined, provide a revolutionary insight into the productivity of each dollar of investment input into the system.\n\"It can be challenging to stitch together all of the outputs of our mission to accelerate life-changing breakthroughs to cure, prevent and treat type 1 diabetes and its complications, and to track the downstream effects of the intellectual property creation and licensing activity that our principal investigators cite as having emerged from their JDRF-funded projects,\" said Jit Patel , Ph.D., Vice President of Research Business Development at JDRF. \"Our partnership with Covalent Data is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of those connections between JDRF investments and improvements in type 1 diabetes treatment and its eventual cure.\"\nThe unique innovation tracking capability of the Covalent Data platform will be integrated with the JDRF grant application review process. By aggregating and organizing this information, Covalent Data offers a powerful platform for researchers to collaborate with colleagues and market their research to industry.\n\"The Covalent Data platform provides researchers with much-needed visibility in an increasingly competitive environment for research dollars,\" said Matt Brewer , CEO, Covalent Data, \"The environment for receiving not-for-profit research funding is exceptionally challenging and we are thrilled to partner with JDRF to execute a plan and platform that will function to increase engagement opportunities that may bring additional private dollars and collaborations into the labs of innovative type 1 diabetes researchers.\"\nAbout Covalent Data\nCovalent Data, a unique global innovation analysis platform, connects research emerging from public and private institutions with commercialization professionals. The Covalent Data platform provides an opportunity for researchers to showcase their innovations and expertise, and for business developers to find opportunities and evaluate technology landscapes. Intuitive, user-friendly, and powered by unrivaled data, Covalent Data empowers all parts of the vast innovation ecosystem - researchers, government, investors, and entrepreneurs - to discover, analyze, and connect.
