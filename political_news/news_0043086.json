Mondale in Washington on Tuesday night. Credit Joshua Roberts/Reuters Former President Jimmy Carter made his first visit to Washington since his cancer diagnosis on Tuesday and appeared in good shape and good humor. At a dinner honoring his vice president, Walter F. Mondale, Mr. Carter smiled, told war stories and cracked jokes as the two former partners recalled how they reinvented the relationship between presidents and vice presidents. “Fritz did most of the talking,” Mr. Carter teased, using Mr. Mondale’s nickname. Mr. Carter recalled their initial meeting to discuss how they would operate together and how they became so close, that Mr. Carter said they never had a fight during their four years together — a better record than he had with his wife. Mr. Carter ribbed Mr. Mondale about his Norwegian roots, complaining that he never got to visit Norway while president because his vice president always reserved those trips for himself. “They don’t know that I was president,” Mr. Carter said. The former president said that since leaving office he had made a point of encouraging dictators around the world to allow elections by convincing them that “the right person” would win. Every candidate, he said, always thinks that’s them. “That’s the principle of politics — self-delusion,” he said. Mr. Carter, 91, announced in August that cancer had spread to his brain. But he wanted to come to the dinner for Mr. Mondale, hosted by the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota . As president, Mr. Carter made Mr. Mondale, who had been a senator from Minnesota, a real partner by giving Mr. Mondale an office in the West Wing and inviting him on every decision. “What Fritz and I did together was historic,” Mr. Carter said. “It changed the basic structure of the executive branch of government to bring in the vice president as a full partner of the president.” Mr. Mondale said Mr. Carter kept his promise to make his time as vice president consequential. “I love the guy,” he said.
