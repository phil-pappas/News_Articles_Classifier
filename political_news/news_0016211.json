(AP) - Democrat John Bel Edwards has secured a spot in the Nov. 21 runoff to decide who will be Louisiana's next governor.\nWith a base of Democratic Party support, Edwards easily advanced in Saturday's voting to the two-man race to decide who will follow term-limited Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal into office.\nEdwards, a state representative, was the lone major Democratic candidate on the ballot.\nNine candidates for governor were on Saturday's ballot, but the race came down to four major contenders: Edwards, Republican Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter.\nWhile his three GOP opponents struck at each other, Edwards saved most of his criticism for Jindal, who Edwards blamed for cratering the state's finances. Edwards said his rivals each represent a Jindal third term.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:58:34.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
