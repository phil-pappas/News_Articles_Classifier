The House and Senate continue to work toward a bipartisan bill addressing how the country will pay for the nation's infrastructure needs.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Oct. 20, 2015 | 3:51 p.m. EDT + More Despite an apparent bipartisan breakthrough, legislation soon to gain congressional approval that will keep the Highway Trust Fund operational into the next decade will fall short of addressing underlying problems in how the nation pays to build and maintain its roads and bridges – weaknesses expected only to grow worse.\nOn Thursday, just days before the Highway Trust Fund's authorization to spend money is set to run into an Oct. 29 deadline, a House committee will consider the chamber's version of a six-year, $325 billion funding bill. Like a similar bill passed in the Senate in July, the bipartisan measure released by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee is expected to identify only where funding will come from for half of the bill's six years. To get there, lawmakers in the House Ways and Means Committee have to find north of $30 billion to make up the trust fund's projected shortfall over the next couple of years.\nBoth versions of the legislation would cut off the fund's authorization after just three years if additional money can't be found for the second half of the period.\nRELATED\nThe Deadline Is Nearing to Fix the Highway Trust Fund Prospects for a bill that can ultimately pass both chambers are good. The House measure – sponsored by transportation committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., and ranking member Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. – is expected to easily pass out of committee and will likely get a positive reception on the floor.\nIn the meantime, Congress almost certainly will pass its 35th short-term patch for the Highway Trust Fund since 2009, to buy time past next week's deadline to bring the two bills into alignment.\n\"We are very pleased that the House is moving forward with a long-term, bipartisan bill. We look forward to getting to conference and resolving the differences in the two bills,\" Sens. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., and Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. – leading members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and sponsors of the chamber's bill – said in a statement Friday.\nStill, both bills are at best Band-Aids for the much larger issues facing the Highway Trust Fund, which between its separate highway and mass transit accounts disburses approximately $50 billion a year. The money goes toward the nation's roads and bridges, ports and waterways and airports and public transportation systems, and pays for highway safety measures.\nThe trust fund relies heavily on the federal fuel tax to fill its coffers. But thanks to a number of factors, including cars' dramatically increased fuel efficiency and Americans' propensity to drive less – coupled with a gas tax that has remained at 18.4 cents for more than two decades – revenues consistently fall short.\n\"It's untenable in the long term and that's become increasingly evident,\" says Jonathan Gifford, an expert in transportation policy at George Mason University. \"On the other hand, we have extreme budget pressures coming from entitlement programs and other areas where the federal government has commitments.\"\nEven with Congress expected to get the money this time, the gap is going to only get bigger, according to a new report from Standard & Poor's analyzing how driving trends have undermined the nation's infrastructure. For one, fuel tax revenues will continue to shrink relative to inflation, while the upkeep of highways and other infrastructure is going to get more expensive.\n[ READ: Senate Passes Patch for Highway Trust Fund ]\n\"Merely maintaining the existing condition and performance of U.S. roads and transit would require a 50 percent increase in current funding,\" says the report, released this week. \"Unfortunately, U.S. government spending on projects, as a percentage of [gross domestic product], has dropped to a two-decade low of about 1.7 percent.\"\nThe report outlines the extent of the problem, homing in on millennials' car ownership and driving habits as the front edge of a major shift in the way Americans get around.\nBetween 1995 and 2009, the average annual vehicle miles traveled for the 16 to 30 age group tumbled 25 percent and dropped below the average for those 56 and older, according to the report and data from the Federal Highway Administration. Those ages 31 to 55 traveled the most at both ends of the time frame, but also saw their average miles drop over the decade and a half.\nAnd while falling gas prices have resulted in a bump in the sale of larger vehicles, the youngest drivers may not be following that trend. Data from J.D. Power showed millennials not only are the sole age group for whom vehicle sales are growing year over year – they now account for about a quarter of all vehicle sales – but they also many times choose smaller and more fuel-efficient cars.\n\"The demographics are what they are,\" says Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at Standard & Poor's. \"Millennials are buying cars, they're just not buying gas guzzlers.\"\nMoreover, thanks to tightened fuel standards, fuel efficiency in light vehicles – cars and small trucks – is rising rapidly, up 25 percent from model year 2004 to 24.1 miles per gallon in 2013.\nBottom line: While the decrease in gas use and a preference for public transportation may be positive news for the environment, it's devastating for the fuel tax and the programs it funds.\n\"How do you pay for this stuff? People are driving less and they're driving more fuel-efficient cars,\" Bovino says. \"And that's a good thing, but at the same time, how you pay for the highways hasn't really caught up.\"\nThat said, it's not all doom and gloom. States are increasingly moving toward finding new ways to pay for necessary infrastructure improvements, and 14 of them – including Idaho, Georgia, Maryland, Rhode Island, Nebraska, Vermont and Washington, whose changes took effect this year – have increased local fuel taxes.\n\"States are changing the gas tax,\" Bovino says. \"And who was pushing it? The people behind it were businesses saying, 'We need to get stuff out. We need to have our roads running and our ports functioning because that's how we make our money.'\"\nOther states are relying more on tolls – though there has been some concern about how both tolls and gas taxes impact the poor, who are likely to live farther from concentrated business areas where rent is cheaper – and moving away from gas taxes toward general sales taxes to raise revenue.\nRELATED\nMcConnell Embraces Short-Term Highway Funding Bill\nGifford, director of George Mason's Center for Transportation Public-Private Partnership Policy, says financing programs that bring in private stakeholders to substantially increase the amount of money available for infrastructure improvements can also help get more bang for each government buck.\nInstead of allowing roads and bridges to fall into disrepair, and ultimately become prohibitively expensive to fix, such partnerships provide incentive for things to be kept in good condition.\n\"We begin to get away from the low-bid environment, where the assets have maintenance deferred and have to be rebuilt sooner and at a higher cost,\" he says.\nBasic economic scarcity also may result in some tough choices being made, as states and localities allow certain assets to crumble in favor of directing funds to where they're more needed, including toward modernizing public transit systems.\nRegardless, current workarounds fall short of solving a fundamentally broken federal funding mechanism. And as long as the government commits to supporting projects, lawmakers will continue to have to \"fiddle at the margins\" to find enough small sources of revenue to make up the shortfall, Gifford says.\n\"We're looking for an 'Uncle Sam' magic bullet to solve this problem for the next six years [and] beyond,\" he says. \"It's better than nothing if they're able to pull it off, but as a country we really haven't figured out how we can make use of the limited resources we have.\"\nTAGS: politics infrastructure DeFazio, Peter Inhofe, James Boxer, Barbara", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedgc8%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Highway%20Bill%20Coming%2C%20But%20Papers%20Over%20Broken%20Fuel%20Tax%20Model", "https://www.globalcreditportal.com/ratingsdirect/renderArticle.do?articleId=1466580&SctArtId=347989&from=CM&nsl_code=LIME&sourceObjectId=9373405&sourceRevId=1&fee_ind=N&exp_date=20251018-18:07:48&sf14335452=1", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedgc8%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Highway%20Bill%20Coming%2C%20But%20Papers%20Over%20Broken%20Fuel%20Tax%20Model&summary=Lawmakers%20will%20fill%20the%20Highway%20Trust%20Fund%20shortfall%20for%20three%20years%2C%20but%20are%20falling%20short%20of%20finding%20a%20true%20long-term%20fix.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedgc8%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedgc8%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedgc8%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedgc8%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Highway%20Bill%20Coming%2C%20But%20Papers%20Over%20Broken%20Fuel%20Tax%20Model"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:26:34.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
