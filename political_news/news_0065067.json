OLSEN, Associated Press\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) â€” A masked man attacked a school in southern Sweden on Thursday, killing one teacher and wounding two students and another teacher before being shot by police, authorities said.\nStudents fled Thursday morning from the Kronan school in Trollhattan, near Goteborg, Sweden's second-largest city. Police in Trollhattan, in a statement, said the attack took place in the school's cafe area.\nPolice spokesman Thomas Fuxborg told The Associated Press the attacker was in his 20s and carried more than one weapon, including \"at least one knife-like object.\" Fuxborg said police fired two shots, one of which hit the attacker.\nPolice did not give any possible reason for the attack.\nFuxborg said when police arrived at the school, one male teacher was already dead and two students and another male teacher were wounded.\nAnother police spokesman, Stefan Gustavsson told the AP the attacker had killed the teacher \"because of the wounds he had.\" He said the attacker had a large knife, possibly two, including what may have been a sword.\nHealth authorities in Trollhattan said the two students, aged 11 and 15, were seriously wounded with cuts. They said the attacker was also in serious condition. There was no immediate information on the condition of the wounded male teacher.\nThe school has 400 students, ranging from pre-school to high school. Fuxborg could not say whether the man had any connection with the school.\nSwedish media say the school held a meeting Thursday morning to discuss teachers' worries that the school was too open, with a cafe for adults that meant the school could not control who comes in.\nThe Dagens Nyheter newspaper said students must go through the cafe to reach the school's own cafeteria and other parts of the building.\nSwedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven cancelled his schedule and was heading to Trollhattan.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
