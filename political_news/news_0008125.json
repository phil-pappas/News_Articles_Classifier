Israeli security forces stand guard as Palestinian Muslim worshipers take part in Friday noon prayers in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Ras al-Amud on Oct. 9, 2015.\nBy Teresa Welsh Oct. 14, 2015 | 6:01 p.m. EDT + More The State Department found Israel frequently engaged in \"governmental and legal discrimination\" against religious minorities last year in its annual report on international religious freedom , a conclusion that comes as Israel struggles to stem a series of religiously motivated violent attacks .\nIn stronger language than its prior report last year, U.S. officials said the Israeli government regularly restricted Palestinian access to holy sites in Israel and the Israeli-occupied territories more frequently in 2014. This comes as Israel is currently taking similar measures to crack down on waves of violence that have rocked Jerusalem in particular in recent weeks and left seven Jews dead .\nRELATED\nViolence in Israel Won't Lead To a Third Intifada The State Department document, which measures the status of religious freedom and examines government policies violating such freedom, said access to religious sites was restricted according to Orthodox Jewish interpretations of religious law. Israelis commonly cite security concerns as the justification for such action.\nBut the report noted that because religion and ethnicity in Israel are often closely linked, \"it is difficult to categorize many incidents as being solely based on religious identity.\"\nIsrael's estimated population is 7.8 million, with approximately 75 percent being Jewish and 17 percent Muslim. Clashes between the groups comprise the majority of religious violence in Israel.\nLast year, a round of killings set off a 50-day war between Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Israel, leaving 2,200 people dead. After the rocket fire ended in August 2014, several one-off attacks took place in the fall sparked by tension around the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a common flashpoint.\nClashes over that holy site have again sparked a series of violent attacks in Jerusalem, the West Bank and around the country. Last week, Israeli authorities restricted access to the religious compound, home to the Al-Aqsa mosque holy to Muslims but also one of Judaism's most revered sites. Currently, the site is administered by a Jordanian trust and only Muslims are allowed to pray there.\n[ READ: Israeli and Palestinian 'Brothers' Push for Dialogue to Solve Conflict ]\nThe Israeli government says it is committed to keeping the status quo at the site despite concerns among Palestinians that the government seeks to open access to Jews who wish to pray there. While criticizing restrictions on access to religious sites in general, the U.S. government frequently asserts its support for maintaining the status quo at the Temple Mount.\nThe report also criticized the lack of prosecution for so-called \"price tag attacks,\" which are revenge attacks frequently – but not always – perpetrated by Jewish settlers against Palestinians or religious sites. Two nongovernmental organizations found that there were 25 such attacks in 2014 but that arrests rarely led to prosecutions due to \"lack of sufficient evidence.\"\nRELATED\n3 Dead in Terror Attacks in Israel While being critical of some of Israel's national policies on religion, the report also found that anti-Semitism continued to be a \"major problem\" in multiple areas of the world, particularly in Europe. The State Department said many anti-Semitic attacks were in the form of hate speech and property desecration, but some resulted in deaths.\nAmbassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom David Saperstein said there was a line between criticism of Israel's public policies, which he deemed legitimate, and questioning Israel's very existence.\n\"Where it has often crossed the line is when groups try to argue that Israel is an inherently illegal state and doesn't have a right to exist as a Jewish state here and takes actions to de-legitimize those fundamental rights,\" Saperstein said. \"It's right on the cusp of that line when it holds one country to different standards than it would hold any other country.\"\nAs a whole, the report found that 2014 included \"some of the world's most egregious abuses of religious freedom and other human rights\" perpetrated by non-state actors. Members of religious minorities were particularly affected by these efforts \"to destroy religious diversity.\"\nTAGS: Israel Palestine", "external_links": ["http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe7b5u%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=State%20Department%20Criticizes%20Israel%20for%20Restricting%20Access%20to%20Holy%20Sites", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe7b5u%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=State%20Department%20Criticizes%20Israel%20for%20Restricting%20Access%20to%20Holy%20Sites", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe7b5u%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe7b5u%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=State%20Department%20Criticizes%20Israel%20for%20Restricting%20Access%20to%20Holy%20Sites&summary=The%20annual%20International%20Religious%20Freedom%20report%20examines%20Israeli%20action%20in%202014.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe7b5u%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe7b5u%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:27:30.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
