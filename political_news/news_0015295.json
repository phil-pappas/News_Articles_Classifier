Tubeless tires have no internal tube that requires to be inflated. They are just a tire attached to the rim, or wheel, and air is filled inside, keeping it inflated. The main and only benefit of a tubeless tire is that when you encounter a puncture, the tire does not deflate immediately and allows you go carry on driving or riding till you get a service center to fix it. On the other hand, a tube-based tire would immediately deflate and you will need to fix the puncture immediately. Fixing a tubeless tire is far easier than a one with a tube. In most cases, you don’t need to remove the wheel to repair the tire and the puncture can be fixed within a few minutes. All you need is a puncture repair kit which costs you just Rs 250 to Rs 500. You can store it in your car boot or under your bike’s seat and use it instantly when you require it. Fixing a tubeless tire is very easy and simple.
