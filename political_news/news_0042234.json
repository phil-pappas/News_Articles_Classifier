(AP) - Two western Colorado regions with close ties to the coal mining industry will work to diversify their economies with the help from a federal program. \nThe Daily Sentinel in Grand Junction reports that on Thursday the Montrose-based Region 10 League of Economics Assistance and Planning received a $1.2 million grant to support its broadband infrastructure efforts. Moffat County also received $50,000 for the study of current commercial and economic needs and assets of the county and surrounding region. \nThe Colorado grants were among 36 issued to the first round of recipients of the Obama administration's Partnership for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization grants. In total, communities received $15 million. \nThe POWER grant program is intended to help mining areas adjust as the country uses less coal. \n(Copyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
