Gen. Hossein Dehqan announced on Sunday the successful test of the newest Iran-made long-range missile, dubbed the \"Emad,\" or Pillar, that could likely reach Turkey. In addition, the Russians are playing a greater role in the Syrian civil war, raging along Turkey's border.\nDespite that, the U.S. is continuing with plans made in August to remove all Patriot missile defense systems from Turkey, a defense official said Monday.\n\"We, Turkey and NATO have more than adequate capabilities to defend Turkey's airspace,\" the official said.\n  Donald Trump, No Labels hero On  \nBy Byron York • 10/12/15 9:49 PM A Turkish diplomat had a different take, however.\n\"We do not think this is the best time to withdraw these batteries,\" the diplomat told Defense News . \"This is a delicate time for our border with Syria.\"\nThe Pentagon said this year that the battery of missile defense systems, originally sent to Turkey in January 2013, would take a one-way trip to the U.S. in October for upgrades. The threats Turkey faces have changed since 2013, the Pentagon said in August, as the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has used up the majority of its missile stores.\nMichael O'Hanlon, a national security analyst at the Brookings Institution, said removing the Patriots presents only a \"modest\" threat increase because of other deterrents.\n\"If Assad started threatening Turkey with missiles, we could bring Patriots back — and if Assad actually attacked, he'd invite NATO retaliation which would be foolish, so I don't expect it,\" O'Hanlon said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Gov.
