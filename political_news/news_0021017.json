Gov. Reeves’ planned visit to Lafayette schools causes stir When Lafayette County School Superintendent Adam Pugh was asked by school board attorney Gray Tollison if Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves could come to the school and speak to teachers today after school let out, Pugh said he was thinking like a school official and not a politician.... ...The email eventually wound up in the inboxes of local Democratic candidates who opposed the visit by Reeves, in fear that Reeves would be pushing a political agenda at the school for himself, fellow Republican candidates running in November and try to convince them not to support Initiative 42, which would require the Legislature to fully fund schools. Alderman and House of Representative Democratic candidate Jay Hughes was disappointed in the school approving the visit by Reeves so close to an election.... ...Reeves’ office called to cancel the visit Tuesday afternoon, according to Pugh.
