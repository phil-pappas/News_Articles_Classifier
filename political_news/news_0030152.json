The campaign will cut payroll costs by 40 percent, downsize its Miami headquarters by more than 50 percent, reduce travel costs by 20 percent and cut 45 percent of spending on things other than media and voter contact.\nThe cuts will begin on Nov. 1.\nAlthough campaign officials insisted they're still in strong shape, the cuts — combined with Bush's stagnant poll numbers — suggest otherwise. According to donors, some of whom called for Bush to rein in its spending, the campaign's assurances about its organizational and financial advantages had worn thin; and the third-quarter financial report, filed last Thursday, gave further definition to their growing concerns about the state of the campaign.\n“These donors are not finding these explanations by the Bush team believable,\" said one bundler, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \"There’s a lot of frustration that a lot of money’s been spent and it hasn’t moved anything.\"\nStaff were informed of the changes on a Friday morning conference call with top officials, who said resources would shift heavily to ballot access and voter contact.\n\"There's going to be some news today,\" campaign manager Danny Diaz told staff as the call began.\nAccording to the campaign, staff cut from Miami will be offered jobs in early-voting states, but at reduced salary.\nStaffers were told that job functions would change for some. Later on Friday, they were told, there would be a staff meeting with division directors, senior adviser Sally Bradshaw, who also spoke, or campaign manager Diaz to get new instructions.\n\"We will use the campaign's biggest asset—Jeb Bush—and put him in front of as many voters as possible,\" the campaign said in a memo sent to reporters.\nOf all the GOP presidential candidates, Bush and the committee backing him have spent the most on early state ads ($9.8 million), consulting services ($2 million), charter-air service ($922,000), and payroll ($1.7 million) on the biggest staff (134) — at least one of whom was on pace to earn about $300,000 annually.\nBush also has the highest burn rate, spending 86 percent of what he raised last quarter.\nTop advisers David Kochel, along with Bradshaw and Diaz, had already taken significant pay cuts earlier this summer; and the campaign has sought to minimize its travel expenses of late. But after last week's FEC report, donors demanded major changes, not just belt-tightening around the margins.\nBut other donors aren't certain that cutting expenses is the main problem at the moment.\n\"They are cognizant of it and they are being diligent about it,” this New York City-based donor said. “But they are not going to cost cut their way to the White House.”\nBush, who is likely to increase his focus on New Hampshire, where many of the Miami-based campaign resources will likely be shifted, has campaigned harder and more often than a number of his rivals yet has struggled to connect with an electorate looking for a more charismatic, inspiring GOP standard-bearer and less than thrilled about the prospect of putting a third Bush in the White House.\nAmong establishment donors, Bush has fought hard to stave off his former understudy, Marco Rubio, whose superior abilities on the stump and comparatively lean campaign operation have impressed kingmakers like Sheldon Adelson and others.\nAnother Bush donor, the CEO of a large financial firm, said the campaign is in fact scared of Rubio and rightly so.\n“Marco is a very real and very dangerous candidate in this race,” the donor said.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:20:41.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
