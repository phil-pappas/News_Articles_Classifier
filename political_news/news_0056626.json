They ran a write-in campaign to do so, meaning the ballots had to be counted by hand. \nAccording to figures from the Westchester County Board of Elections, Fitzgerald, Reyes and Fischer won their endorsements handedly. Fitzgerald and Fischer winning 50 votes each and Reyes winning 46 to 31 for Andre Rainey and 32 each for Kathleen Talbot and Vivian McKenzie, the Democratic choices for Common Council. \nCatalina won 33 votes to Democratic challenger Ken Martin's 29. Catalina had an additional 21 votes thrown out as voters neglected to include Catalina's middle initial on their ballots. \n“The Independence Party is always important,” Catalina said. “My Independence line, I picked up, I think 224 votes (in 2013). I won by 160 votes, 162 votes. I always said without that line I don’t think I could've wont the election. \n“I expect to win by a lot more this year,\" he added. \"I don’t think it would be such a close race.” 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1Lqt788 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:01:07.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
