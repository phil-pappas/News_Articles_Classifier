He doesn’t appear to see the link between failing infrastructure, and forcing companies to use road cartage for their freight. \n\"He also failed to directly address reports that metal will be laid on the Portland railway shunting line, and that a private alternative feeder road will be tarsealed. His response was that there is a lack of a demand for rail. \n\"The Minister appeared to have no knowledge of alarming developments. \n\"While the Minister reiterates the same phrase, that there are no plans to close any rail lines in Northland, National has already shut down the Dargaville line. We are suspicious that the government is simply letting rail fail. The end result will be mothballing and final closure. \n\"New Zealand First calls for an upgrade of the line in Northland and the rail link to Marsden Point to support long term development of Northport. Efficient and well maintained rail infrastructure is one of the solutions to building Northland’s economy. \n\"This would be the first country in the world to abandon rail infrastructure,\" says Mr Peters. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:02:11.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
