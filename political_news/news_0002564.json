Since Relativity's suit, VII Peaks has as much as admitted that they lacked the necessary funding, instead trying to broker third-party capital to cover their own shortcomings. Indeed, they have requested two months to close on a transaction that they understood needed to close by October 20 .\nWe fully expect that their next move will be to concoct some claim of fraud in an effort to disguise the simple fact that they could not close. We have also learned this is not the first time they have misrepresented their capital capabilities and oversight. The good news is that Relativity, with the support of its stakeholders, was able to preserve the enterprise as a going concern, yet again, notwithstanding these distractions. Of course, VII Peaks' maneuvers were not without a cost, and the company and its stakeholders will continue to seek redress for the resulting harm in the courts.\"\nMedia Contact:\nRachel Hunter\n212-333-3810\nrhunter@brunswickgroup.com\n releases/statement-from-relativity-media-llc-regarding-vii-peaks-capital-300166011.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY38174&Transmission_Id=201510261136PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY38174&DateId=20151026", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-from-relativity-media-llc-regarding-vii-peaks-capital-300166011.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:57:15.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
