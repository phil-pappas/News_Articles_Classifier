He said the only way to deal with incidents like it is to fight terrorism and called on the international community to press Abbas and the Palestinian Authority to act.\nNetanyahu and Kerry both also noted the mass shooting at a college in Oregon on Thursday that left nine people and the gunman dead. They said Israel and the U.S. were united in grief over the two incidents.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
