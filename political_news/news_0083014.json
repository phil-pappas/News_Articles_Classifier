(AP) â€” Alpha Tau Omega revoked the charter and closed its Indiana University chapter Thursday following the release of a video purportedly showing a fraternity member performing a sex act on a woman.\nThe national fraternity's action came just hours after the university announced it had suspended the campus chapter while it investigated the recording that surfaced on social media.\nAlpha Tau Omega's Indianapolis-based national office said the \"highly inappropriate and vulgar video\" from a smartphone shows an event last week involving a 21-year-old member of the chapter and two female exotic dancers hired by one of the members.\nIt said the event involved about half the chapter and no pledge was compelled to participate.\n\"Regardless, the actions are contrary to the ideals and principles of Alpha Tau Omega and are highly offensive,\" Alpha Tau Omega's national CEO Wynn Smiley said.\nIn the video, the man in his underwear is surrounded by a crowd of shouting onlookers, some of them partially dressed. It was not clear whether any of what occurred was coerced or whether any criminal charges might be pursued.\nIU issued a statement praising the national office's action.\nUniversity spokesman Mark Land said school officials didn't know whether the women in the video were forced to do anything against their wills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:28:06.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
