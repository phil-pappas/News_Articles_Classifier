More Pension lock costs an extra £6bn a year \nThe Security Service (MI5), the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and GCHQ were accused of violating the stipulation laid down by prime minister Harold Wilson in 1966 that “no tapping of the phones of members of parliament” should take place, by MP Caroline Lucas, former MP George Galloway and Baroness Jenny Jones of Moulsecoomb. \nThe Wilson doctrine is still regarded by many lawmakers and legal experts as one of the guiding principles of the UK’s unwritten constitution and a crucial check on the power of the establishment in its ability to control the democratic process. \nIt came into being amid great controversy — much of it unfounded — over the work of Britain’s spies in the 1960s in investigating leftwing politicians over alleged communist sympathies. \nPrime minister Tony Blair extended the doctrine to cover electronic communications in 1997. \nThe IPT said that while the Wilson doctrine had “no basis in law”, it still formed the basis of rigorous internal guidelines for the agencies that in effect controlled their powers. The doctrine was first articulated at a time when there was no statutory legislation governing the work of the UK’s spies, as there is now, the judges pointed out. \n“MPs’ communications with their constituents and others are protected, like those of every other person, by the statutory regime established by Part 1 of RIPA 2000,” the IPT said. “The critical control is the requirement for a secretary of state’s warrant.” \n“That regime is sufficient to protect such communications and nothing further is required by the ECHR,” the IPT adds, referring to the compliance of the existing practices with European human rights law. \nThe IPT ruling quoted existing internal guidelines at all three intelligence agencies at length to indicate the degree to which the Wilson doctrine still informs decision making, in spite of its lack of a statutory basis. The doctrine was enforced by executive authority by the prime minister, it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:06:59.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
