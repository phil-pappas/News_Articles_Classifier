Attorneys for Tyler have sent a cease-and-desist letter to the real estate mogul and Republican presidential contender, stating that Trump was not granted authority to use the lyrics for political promotion, according to The Associated Press.\nTrump does \"not have our client's permission to use 'Dream On'\" or any of Tyler's other songs, and the song's use \"gives the false impression that he is connected with or endorses Mr. Trump's presidential bid,” the letter states.\nTyler's request is just another in a long series of such requests made by aggrieved musicians over the years. Last month, Michael Stipe, longtime lead singer of the band R.E.M., asked Trump's campaign to stop using its 1987 hit \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\" at his events. Most of the time — as with Stipe's request — the request seems to be ideological; in this case, it appears to have been more of a business decision.\n15 campaign song spats By Kevin Cirilli and Bridget Mulcahy\nThe AP reported that Tyler’s attorney, Dina LaPolt, remarked that the legal notice is not intended to advance a “political” or “personal issue with Mr. Trump” but rather expressed concern about issues of permission and copyright infringement.\nTyler, a registered Republican who appeared at the GOP debate Aug. 6 at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, reportedly attended the event as a guest of Trump himself, according to The Washington Post. (The band was in town to perform the next day at a nearby venue.)\nTrump is a longtime admirer of Tyler's and the band. When he first announced his bid for presidency, \"Dream On\" was played loudly among Broadway show tunes and opera. In September 2014, Trump tweeted about his positive experience at an Aerosmith concert.\nI attended @Aerosmith concert last night in Newark, NJ. Doesn’t get any better than that. @IamStevenT was fantastic, great energy!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2014\n“Dream On,” which appeared on the Boston rock band’s self-titled debut album in 1973, soon became the band’s signature song. After being reissued in 1976, it climbed to No. 6 on the singles charts. Presumably Trump's campaign has been using the studio recording, as opposed to the concert version that appears on the album \"Live Bootleg,\" on which Tyler shouts out \"motherf", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/problem-with-the-first-8-words-of-donald-trumps-speech-2015-6", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2015/08/06/aerosmith-scored-tickets-to-gop-presidential-debate/", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/507548562763571200", "http://www.people.com/article/steven-tyler-attended-republican-debate", "https://twitter.com/Aerosmith", "https://twitter.com/IamStevenT"], "published": "2015-10-11T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:02:26.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
