Two plays later, Fox accepted a 10-second runoff following Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford’s intentional-grounding penalty.\nThe Lions took a 34-31 lead on Stafford’s touchdown pass to receiver Calvin Johnson, which came one play after outside linebacker Pernell McPhee was penalized for roughing the passer.\nThe wild sequence left the Bears with 21 seconds to tie the game, which they did behind big plays by quarterback Jay Cutler and receiver Alshon Jeffery.\nBut some extra time could have given the Bears a chance or two at the end zone in those final moments, too.\nFox said he could have declined the 10-second runoff, but chose not to. Why?\n“It was 10 seconds that they backed it up,” Fox said. “I guess in hindsight, which we all get to do, we wish we probably would’ve had 10 more seconds.”\nWhat about not using timeouts?\n“As it worked out, we had enough time to go down and tie the game,” Fox said, “so it really doesn’t matter.”\nMissing McClellin\nA forthright assessment of linebacker Christian Jones’ ability to handle the calls in place of an injured Shea McClellin won’t come until coordinator Vic Fangio meets the media. But Jones said he felt good with the operation, even though the Lions piled up 546 net yards of offense.\n“It went smooth,” Jones said. “We just got to finish plays. I thought we gave up some big plays, but for the most part I think [the play-calling] went smooth.”\nThe Bears rotated linebackers next to Jones. LaRoy Reynolds played in the base defense and Jonathan Anderson took the field in nickel situations.\n“They’re two smart players and they pick up things fast,” Jones said. “They played pretty well for the most part. It wasn’t perfect by they played their asses off and they’re flying around.”\nA missed hold?\nOutside linebacker Willie Young appeared to be held by tight end Tim Wright on Stafford’s 57-yard completion to Johnson in overtime. But a penalty was not called.\n“I don’t know, man,” Young said. “No flag came out, so I guess not. If it wasn’t holding in the refs’ eyes, it wasn’t holding in his eyes.”\nFollow me on Twitter @adamjahns\nTwitter @adamjahns", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:06:54.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
