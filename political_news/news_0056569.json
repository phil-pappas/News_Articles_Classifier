A new Bloomberg/Des Moines Register pol l of likely Iowa caucusgoers out Thursday has 48 percent of Democrats for the former secretary of state and 41 percent for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. When the vice president was included in the poll, Clinton was at 42 to Sanders' 37.\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley has the support of just 2 percent of Democrats, while former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb — who exited the race this week — was at 1 percent, along with former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee.\nThe poll also looked at the congressional inquiries in the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya — ahead of Clinton's marathon testimony before a House investigative panel Thursday.\n2016\nHow Hillary Testifies By Gil Troy\nSupport for the investigations falls mostly on party lines, with 75 percent of Republicans saying they are worth the time and money, while 19 percent say it isn’t worth it. Democrats feel generally the opposite: 79 percent say it is not worth the resources while 14 percent believe it is.\nThe poll run by Selzer & Co. was of 402 likely Democratic and 401 likely Republican caucus goers and was conducted Oct. 16-19. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.scribd.com/doc/286419696/Bloomberg-Politics-Des-Moines-Register-Iowa-Poll-Oct-22-2015-release"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:02:03.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
