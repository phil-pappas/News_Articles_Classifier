(OTCQB: PBIO) (\"PBI\" and the \"Company\"), a leader in the development and sale of broadly enabling, pressure cycling technology (\"PCT\")-based sample preparation solutions to the worldwide life sciences industry, today announced a collaborative research and development agreement with Florida International University (\"FIU\"). The major goal of the agreement is to develop a rape kit test method based on PBI's PCT Platform, and to have it commercially available within the next 18 months. With a current estimated backlog of 400,000 untested rape kits in the U.S., plus an estimated 180,000 new sexual assault cases annually, there is a significant and immediate need for better test methods to address this national issue. Scientists at PBI and FIU believe that a test method focused on the key intrinsic advantages of PCT can result in an improved rape kit test method with great potential to help reduce this backlog.\nThe collection of biological samples on cotton swabs for forensic analysis has been standard practice for many years. Unfortunately, the recovery of high quality DNA from these swabs is very difficult, as the biological sample is often trapped in the swab's cotton fibers, resulting in a loss of precious evidence. This is a particular problem with rape kits in which the male suspect's DNA must be isolated from a complex mixture of male and female cells. Many attempts have been made to develop new methods to improve the efficiency and quality of recovery of this evidence, which currently requires an extensive isolation procedure. A recent publication by Drs. McCord and Nori of FIU discussed a novel, PCT-based technique that showed decreased processing times and higher yields while using inexpensive reagents on a semi-automated platform.\nDr. Bruce McCord , Associate Director of FIU's International Forensic Research Institute (\"IFRI\"), said: \"We are excited by this opportunity to expand the range of applications of PCT in forensic analysis, specifically to assist in the development of a rapid and direct alternative to current methods for the analysis of rape kits. In this project, we will further improve and validate this new PCT-based method. We believe this method will be able to isolate male and female DNA, even in situations where trace amounts of male DNA remain. We also believe that this PCT-based method could be significantly faster and provide improved sample recovery when compared to current methods. These advantages should be well received by the forensic community.\"\nThe enormous backlog of untested rape kits has been the focus of many media stories over the past several years. Consequently, the rape kit testing policies of many cities and states have recently come under review. Listed below is a sampling of several such stories that were published in 2015.\nThe U.S. Dept. of Justice (DOJ) and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance recently announced nearly $80 million in grants to law enforcement agencies across the country to test rape kits, prosecute cases, and support victims of sexual assault. USA Today ran a front page story entitled \"Rape Kit Policies Under Review\". U.S. Senator Ron Johnson sent a letter to Assistant U.S. Attorney General Karol Mason asking for an explanation on why a national protocol for testing rape kits has not been established by the DOJ. In Houston , testing of 6,600 backlogged rape kits resulted in 850 hits (nearly 13%). In Detroit, testing of 10,000 backlogged rape kits resulted in 2,478 hits (nearly 25%). In Ohio , testing of 8,115 backlogged rape kits resulted in 3,030 hits (nearly 40%). Vice President Biden announced $41 million to help reduce the backlog of untested rape kits that White House officials estimate at 400,000 nationwide. Dr. Nate Lawrence , Vice President of Marketing and Sales for PBI, commented: \"Something significant must be done to address the enormous number of untested rape kits in the U.S. Each rape kit that sits untested on a shelf represents an injustice to the victim of the sexual assault, as well as the potential that the perpetrator of the crime will remain at-large. With a backlog of approximately 400,000 kits, and with roughly 180,000 new sexual assaults each year, it is clear that there is a need for faster, more efficient testing methods. This is a major reason we are so excited and proud to collaborate on the development of such a new method with Dr. McCord and his team at FIU.\"\nMr. Richard T. Schumacher , President and CEO of PBI, said: \"The progress that Dr. McCord and his team have recently made is very impressive: we believe they are now very close to the development of a \"next generation\" PCT-based rape kit. Because of this progress, and because their future success requires immediate financial and scientific support, FIU and PBI have agreed to enter into a 16-month collaboration. During this time, PBI will offer FIU scientific and engineering support, to help optimize and streamline the method. PBI will also grant $70,000 to FIU over the term of the collaboration to help cover the costs of personnel and lab supplies.\"\nMr. Schumacher concluded: \"We are excited to be working with our colleagues at FIU in the development of a \"next generation\" PCT-based rape kit test method. We believe this new method offers an important potential breakthrough in the recovery of high quality DNA from cotton swabs. We further believe that combining the capabilities, knowledge, and our shared interest in an effective outcome, we can more effectively move this innovative method down the path to successful commercialization.\"\nAbout the Touch DNA and Rape Kit Testing Market\nFuture commercialization of this novel, PCT-based method could potentially provide significant new business channels for PBI in important forensic applications, such as touch DNA and rape kit testing. PBI estimates a forensics market that consists of hundreds of labs in the U.S. performing thousands of tests on a routine basis. Thus, in addition to instrument sales, we also envision the potential for single-use consumables and other reagents that are proprietary to the Company's PCT platform.\nAbout Florida International University\nFlorida International University (\"FIU\") is recognized as a Carnegie engaged university. It is a public research university with colleges and schools that offer more than 180 bachelor's, master's and doctoral programs in fields such as engineering, international relations, architecture, law and medicine.
