Political parties should field women in two thirds of seats, including two thirds of safe seats. We can have a 50:50 Parliament in a decade.\"\nShe also called for 75% of new peers to be women and for all publicly listed companies to have a 50:50 gender ratio on their boards and executive committees by 2025.\n'Realising potential' The party has called for action to tackle the \"exorbitant\" cost of childcare, which it says is stopping at least 600,000 women from either returning to the workplace or working the full hours they want to.\nIt has called for government-subsidised childcare to be available to all parents at the end of their parental leave, a £6.5bn commitment it says could be paid for by introducing a single rate of tax relief on pensions.\n\"We want women to realise their potential and we want to do that by providing a system of childcare that does not cost the earth and does not have to be waited for,\" Ms Walker told party supporters.\nAmong its other priorities are to challenge gender stereotyping in schools, to tackle discrimination against older women, to increase the rate of prosecutions for domestic violence and to make the purchase of sex a criminal offence.\n\"Our country has a gendered culture where men are seen as entitled to dominate and the media portrays women as sex objects,\" she said. \"The acts of everyday sexism that permeate our culture must not be trivialised, they must be challenged and they must be defeated.\"\nAhead of Tuesday's launch, the party released a report suggesting women earned £245bn less than men each year in the UK.\nMs Walker accused the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems of treating equality as a political football, saying it \"seems to me that they are more interested in claiming the right to deliver equality than actually deliver it\".", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1858/production/_86223260_86223259.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:21:18.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
