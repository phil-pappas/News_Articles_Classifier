Prominent among those given ticket were JD(U) MLAs Rajesh Singh from Valmikinagar in West Champaran district and Guddi Chaudhary from Runnisaidpur in Sitamarhi. The party has now decided to contest 121 seats instead of 85 as announced earlier by the six-party alliance.\nSP's in charge of Bihar Kiranmoy Nanda said the allies have unanimously agreed that his party should contest 121 seats in the 243-member state assembly. He released the second list of 30 candidates, mainly rebels from RJD, JD(U) and Congress. Nanda said since the decision to form the six-party front was taken very late and some of the allies had even announced their candidates for many seats, friendly contest in a few constituencies is not ruled out. The SP-led front was formed after the Election Commission announced the five-phase election early this month.\n\"All the allies have agreed that SP being the largest partner should contest maximum number of seats,\" said Nanda, adding that \"any decision is taken only after discussion with all alliances partners and our CM candidate Tariq Anwar\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:44:01.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
