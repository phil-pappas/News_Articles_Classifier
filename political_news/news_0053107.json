A burnt-out police truck sits in the street on Saturday after Afghan security forces retook control of Kunduz city from Taliban militants.\nBy Paul D. Shinkman Oct. 5, 2015 | 11:13 a.m. EDT + More America's top general for the war in Afghanistan changed the official U.S. account of an airstrike in Kunduz over the weekend that struck a Doctors Without Borders facility and reportedly killed more than 20 people, including a dozen medical staff members and 10 patients.\nRELATED\nU.S. Airstrikes Aim to Retake Kunduz From Taliban The Pentagon had previously claimed U.S. forces conducted the airstrike to protect Americans on the ground who had come under fire from the Taliban, which unexpectedly seized large swathes of the key crossroads city last week. The strikes on the hospital were the result of collateral damage, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan said over the weekend. Top officials in the Afghan government, however, have indicated Taliban fighters may have been using the hospital as a fighting position, meaning the strike may have been intentional.\nBut Army Gen. John Campbell, commander of the war that NATO now calls Operation Resolute Support, told reporters on Monday he has subsequently learned a different story.\n\"The Afghan forces called in for fire support because they were under direct fire,\" he said in the Pentagon briefing room, discounting an initial impression the Department of Defense offered that enemy fighters were firing directly on U.S. forces. \"That was not the case.\"\nThere were Americans nearby who were providing assistance to the Afghan forces as part of the new central mission of the U.S. to train, advise and assist the local military but not to engage in direct fighting themselves. The Afghans asked the Americans for support, but it remains unclear specifically who authorized the strike.\nCampbell refused to comment further on that Monday, nor would he offer any details on whether the U.S. changed the way it conducts airstrikes in Kunduz or its larger campaign in the wake of the incident. He deferred such questions to the outcome of the ongoing U.S. and NATO investigation.\nThe Doctors Without Borders hospital is seen in flames following an airstrike in the northern Afghan city of Kunduz on Saturday.\nThe general also would not comment on assertions from Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French alternative name Medecins Sans Frontieres, that the strike and its deadly effects were tantamount to a war crime and should be investigated by an impartial international organization.\n\"We're going to do everything we can for this investigation to be open and transparent,\" said Campbell. If other investigations are necessary, he said, the military will cooperate.\nThe Kabul Times reports Gen. Qadam Shah Shaheem, the Afghan National Army's chief of general staff, visited Kunduz recently along with the country's interior minister. An Interior Ministry spokesman said Taliban insurgents had positioned themselves inside the hospital, and the fighters were likely going to use the facility as a stronghold, or evacuate their wounded fighters being treated there in case of an attack. American officials up to Defense Secretary Ash Carter and President Barack Obama have offered their sympathies following the strike but no details on whether Taliban fighters were present in the compound.\nMSF has offered harsh rebukes of the strike, saying its staff at the facility in Kunduz reported no direct fighting near their compound. The organization has said it followed its established procedures for operating in a war zone, including providing GPS coordinates of the facility to both the U.S.-led coalition and the Taliban to ensure no errant attacks. The group also has indicated that the perception there were fighters in the medical compound prompted war planners to authorize the strike knowingly.\n\"Under the clear presumption that a war crime has been committed, MSF demands that a full and transparent investigation into the event be conducted by an independent international body,\" MSF General Director Christopher Stokes said in a statement Sunday.\nTwelve MSF staffers and 10 patients, including three children, died in the attack, he said. The main hospital building was reportedly targeted \"repeatedly and very precisely\" while the rest of the compound was left unscathed.\n\"We condemn this attack, which constitutes a grave violation of International Humanitarian Law,\" Stokes said.\nSaturday's strike serves as yet another setback for progress in Afghanistan, following a Taliban offensive on Kunduz last week that apparently neither the local government nor its American patrons anticipated. The stated central focus of the American-led mission in the country – ahead of U.S. forces' planned full withdrawal by the end of next year – is helping the Afghan military improve its own capabilities, not waging active warfare against an encroaching enemy.\nRELATED\nU.S. Commander Says Afghans Requested U.S. Airstrike in Kunduz Pilots operating over Afghanistan have previously told U.S. News about their frustrations whenever they have to engage enemy targets there, since the parameters of the current mission should technically have Afghans conducting the fighting with the U.S. limited to providing support.\n\"If you're going kinetic there, it's because U.S. or coalition forces are under attack, which is not good,\" says Air Force Lt. Col. Joseph Kramer, a B-1 bomber pilot and commander of the 34th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron, who sat down with U.S. news for an extensive interview late last month at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. \"We've flown some of those sorties in the past, and it's frustrating -- U.S. forces getting shot at, largely in a defensive position.\"\nHis squadron just returned from a six-month tour to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. His pilots stopped flying regular missions over Afghanistan toward the end of the deployment in July, he said, to prioritize the U.S.-led anti-Islamic State group air war in Iraq and Syria.\nIn previous testimony before Congress, Campbell has indicated he has advised the White House to reconsider its plan for a full withdrawal by the end of 2016, leaving only a few hundred forces based at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.\n\"The next two years of the ... campaign will play a crucial role in cementing our gains,\" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February . \"As in the past, our drawdown will occur under enemy pressure. We will need to manage to our efforts to maximize the effects of our [tactical air controllers] and our continued consolidation toward a Kabul-centric posture in 2016.\"\nWhen asked Monday whether this latest string of incidents could provoke an actual change in the strategy, Campbell deferred to his next appointment before Congress Tuesday morning.\n\"I will testify before Congress about that,\" he said.\nTAGS: national security Afghanistan Taliban world news", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwsx2%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=U.S.%20Changes%20Story%20on%20Deadly%20Doctors%20Without%20Borders%20Strike%20in%20Kunduz", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwsx2%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwsx2%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=U.S.%20Changes%20Story%20on%20Deadly%20Doctors%20Without%20Borders%20Strike%20in%20Kunduz&summary=An%20attack%20on%20a%20Doctors%20Without%20Borders%20facility%20in%20Afghanistan%20has%20led%20to%20war%20crime%20allegations%2C%20but%20U.S.%20officials%20are%20urging%20patience.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwsx2%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwsx2%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://thekabultimes.gov.af/index.php/newsnational/8236-mop-up-operation-underway-in-kunduz-city-moi.html", "http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/congress/2015/02/12/afghanistan-us-troops-drawdown/23287489/", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwsx2%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=U.S.%20Changes%20Story%20on%20Deadly%20Doctors%20Without%20Borders%20Strike%20in%20Kunduz"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:31:56.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
