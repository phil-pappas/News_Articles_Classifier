But I also know that working in union - union members their unions and the CTU is a force to be reckoned with. I will work with you all to make a difference in our battle for a better deal for working people. \nHelen Kelly is a hard act to follow that’s for sure! She has given the CTU Presidency an amazing profile. Helen – thank you for your hard work, determination and passion. \nWe must maintain this momentum and together we will bring a stronger voice and a stronger presence for working people in their workplace, their industry and within NZ society. There is so much change occurring – it’s vital that the voice of working people is heard and listened to in the change process. \nIt is only through the union movement that worker people will have the power and influence to create positive inclusive change. \nWe have to organise and build our movement, and that will always be the highest priority. \nI look forward to working with you all to make this a reality. \nENDS New Zealand Council of Trade Unions \nTe Kauae Kaimahi \nThe New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi brings together over 350,000 New Zealand union members in 40 affiliated unions.
