Ginther and Zach Scott at the Northland Performing Arts Center. He told organizers he is a write-in candidate and they allowed him to take the stage. \n\nThe Franklin County Consortium for Good Government and WSYX ABC 6 sponsored the debate. \n\nThe man’s actual name is Emanuel Giles Jr., 59, of Lilley Ave. on the South Side. In his filing to run as a write-in candidate for mayor, he requested that the Franklin County Board of Elections use the name Emmanuel Golden Valentine Giles, but he signed it Emanuel Giles Jr. \n\nElections officials said Giles was certified as a write-in at an elections board meeting on Aug. 14. His name will not appear on the ballot. \n\nGiles pleaded guilty to assault and domestic violence charges in 2001, according to Franklin County Common Pleas court records. \n\nHe was also indicted for murder in Franklin County in 1983, but no further details of that case were available today. \n\nGiles was also incarcerated in Custer County, Okla., from 2003 to 2010 for trafficking in drugs. \n\n“They keep shortening my name so that’s why it was wrong at the debate,” Giles said Thursday. “My mother’s name is Golden and my father’s name is Valentine and I am in the process of changing my name, but I haven’t completed it yet.” \n\nGiles said he was arrested in 1983 on “fictitious” charges related to a shooting after then President Ronald Reagan “put pressure on them to put me away.” \n\nGiles said he took himself off of psychiatric medication in 2011. \n\nWednesday night was the first time Giles appeared on the campaign trail with the candidates. Giles told Scott before the start of the debate that he remembered the sheriff from his time in jail in the early 1980s. \n\nGiles said he filed paperwork with the Franklin County Board of Elections to run as a write-in candidate for mayor to carry on “Coleman’s legacy.” \n\nThe Ginther and Scott campaigns declined comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:41:04.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
