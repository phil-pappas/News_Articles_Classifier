(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\nAssociated Press Oct. 8, 2015 | 10:02 a.m. EDT + More By KEN SWEET, AP Business Writer\nNEW YORK (AP) â€” U.S. stock are slightly lower in early trading Thursday as investors wait for the release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average lost 32 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,880 as of 9:55 a.m. Eastern.

GoPro's stock has been in free-fall for weeks and is coming close to falling below its IPO price it set two years ago.\nWRITEDOWNS: Deutsche Bank fell 30 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $28.49 after the bank said it would take $6.5 billion in writedowns in its corporate and investment banking divisions.\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 72 cents to $48.52 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
