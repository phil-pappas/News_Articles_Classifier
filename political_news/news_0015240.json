Ted Cruz asserted Wednesday that Hillary Clinton would face criminal charges over her use of a private email server if not for interference from the White House.\nAnd he went further, saying the former secretary of state’s fate hinges on whether she or the vice president emerges as the administration favorite to succeed President Barack Obama.\n“It is almost accepted wisdom in Washington that Hillary’s indictment will just depend on some political hack in the bowels of the White House deciding Hillary up or Hillary down. That’s not how criminal justice is meant to operate,” Cruz said at a coffee shop in Oskaloosa, an hour southeast of Des Moines, after pitching his campaign to 200 Iowans.\nClinton is scheduled to testify next week before the House Select Committee on Benghazi to address lingering questions about her handling of email during her time as the nation’s top diplomat.\nNeither her campaign nor the White House would comment on Cruz’s assertions. But Clinton has said, as recently as Tuesday night’s Democratic presidential debate, that politics are driving the investigation of her. The topic prompted rival Bernie Sanders to declare, in one of the debate’s top moments: “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.”\nCruz called Sanders’ comment “a smart political move” sure to appeal to Democratic partisans. “But the question here is the rule of law,” he said. “The administration of justice should be blind to party or ideology.”\nWith the Obama Justice Department, however, that is not the case, he charged.\n“One of the saddest testaments to how politicized this Obama administration has become,” the Texas Republican said, “is that virtually every observer in Washington views the question of whether or not Hillary will be indicted for violating the law as a simple political question: Will the Obama White House decide they prefer her or Joe Biden.”\nObama and aides have called the House inquiry politically motivated. And on Wednesday, spokesman Josh Earnest echoed Sanders’ stance.\n“Given the unique responsibilities of my job, I can relate,” he said at his daily White House briefing.\nOverall, Cruz panned the Democratic debate.\n“It was more socialism, more pacifism, more weakness and less Constitution,” he told about 100 people crammed into a motel lobby in Kalona, a small town in southeastern Iowa. “It was a recipe to destroy a country.”\nSpeaking after the campaign event outside the Dutch Country Inn, Cruz acknowledged that he hadn’t watched the debate live. During much of it, he was stumping at a Pizza Hut a half-hour away.\nBut he had firm views on what viewers saw.\n“We’re seeing our freedoms taken away every day, and last night was an audition for who would wear the jackboot most vigorously,” he told reporters. “Last night was an audition for who would embrace government power, for who would strip your and my individual liberties.”\nThe other Democratic hopefuls tried to “explain how they’re every bit as socialist as Bernie Sanders is,” he said. “It was interesting for America to see each and every Democratic candidate explain how what we need is an even weaker America.”\nOn Twitter:\n @toddgillman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/toddgillman"], "published": "2015-10-15T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:50:11.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
