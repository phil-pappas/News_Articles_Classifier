We need a new one,' he stressed. \nMr Mac Manu said the bloated Ghanaian register contains names of nationals of various countries in the ECOWAS sub-region, stating, 'We will not sit down for ECOWAS to determine who will be Ghana's president.' \nHe said the Electoral Commission (EC) has no other choice than to change the voter register because the evidence the party has provided is overwhelming. \nAccording to Mr Mac Manu, the new register would ensure that only Ghanaians would vote come 2016, underscoring the party’s resolve to ensure a new register is used for the 2016 general elections. \nThe NPP, after painstaking investigations, revealed that more than 76,000 names of Togolese nationals who are registered to vote in their country are in the Ghanaian electoral roll. \nThe Togolese nationals, according to the opposition party, crossed the Ghanaian border and registered to enable them exercise their franchise in the nation’s elections. \nThis exposÃ© is meant to make a strong case for the EC to compile a new register to avoid problems in 2016. \nOccupyGhana Wants Observer Status Meanwhile pressure group, OccupyGhana, has applied to the Electoral Commission to be given an observer status to enable its members monitor the 2016 general elections. \nThe group which has been at the forefront of political activism, particularly against corruption in the country, says it is keen to ensure that next year's elections are free and fair and results declared accepted. \nSydney Casley Hayford, a leading member of the pressure group, announced this at the forum and revealed that the group would set up “machines” at polling stations across the country. \nHe said 'Every activity at the polling stations would be monitored to ensure that we are going to get free and open elections.' \nCasley Hayford disclosed that some people have been distributing fake birth certificates to Ghanaians to allow them to register as voters. \n'There are rumours that fake birth certificates are being distributed to people so they can register and vote in 2016. We are cautioning Ghanaians to beware,' he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:02:25.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
