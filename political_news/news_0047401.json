Joe Lieberman of Connecticut has been out of office for almost three years, but the 2000 Democratic vice presidential nominee and 2004 presidential candidate is making a return to the early-primary state of New Hampshire.\nMr. Lieberman will co-lead a forum Monday for presidential candidates in Manchester. Five Republicans—including front-runner Donald Trump —and three Democrats will be on hand for a rare joint appearance by candidates of both major parties in New Hampshire.\n“That just doesn’t happen up there,” said Mr. Lieberman, co-chair of No Labels, a nonpartisan political organization that is hosting the forum.\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is proving to be a formidable contender on the Democratic side, and Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are also registered to speak. Former Republican Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., the other co-chair of No Labels, will host the discussion along with Mr. Lieberman.\nNearly 2,000 New Hampshire voters registered to attend the event, and every candidate who has declared they are running for president was invited to attend, a No Labels spokesman said.\nThe group hopes to get pledges from the candidates to adopt some of the goals of No Labels, including balancing the federal budget by 2030, ensuring the survival of Social Security and Medicare for another 75 years and creating 25 million jobs over the next decade.\nNo Labels was founded in 2010 by independent-minded politicians seeking to fight partisan gridlock in Washington. Among its most visible early supporters was former New York City Republican-turned-independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg .\nMr. Lieberman’s new role at No Labels seems a natural fit for the man who routinely worked with Republicans and who infuriated liberals when he lost the Democratic primary for the Senate in Connecticut in 2006, then went on to run and win as an independent.\n“I always wanted to leave public office on my own and sort of have another chapter in my professional life where I could get some other things done,” Mr. Lieberman said in an interview.\nSince leaving office in January 2013, Mr. Lieberman has been working in New York City part time at the law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman. He is also working on projects related to foreign policy and defense for such conservative think tanks as the American Enterprise Institute and the Hudson Institute.\nMr. Lieberman was named chairman of United Against Nuclear Iran in August and led an unsuccessful campaign to block President Barack Obama ’s nuclear deal with Iran. He said the group will continue pressuring companies in the U.S. and abroad to not conduct business in Iran to prevent it from gaining economic strength.\n“We think the fight is not over,” Mr. Lieberman said.\nMr. Lieberman stepped in as co-chair of No Labels in 2014 after West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, resigned as co-chair following the group’s role in the Colorado Senate race that year. Democrats bristled after No Labels supported the successful candidacy of Republican Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner over Mark Udall, the Democratic senator at the time.\nMr. Lieberman acknowledged the episode upset many Democrats who said that No Labels overstepped its role as a nonpartisan group. Mr. Lieberman responded that Mr. Udall also had the opportunity to seek support from No Labels.\nThe group’s emphasis on bipartisanship in politics has also come under criticism. Such appeals advocated by former elected officials such as Mr. Lieberman may be well-intentioned, but fighting in Washington over issues of importance is a healthy part of the political process, said Ross Baker, a professor of politics at Rutgers University.\n“Bipartisanship is one of the things that everybody seems to give lip service to. Just because a piece of legislation is bipartisan, doesn’t mean it’s good,” said Mr. Baker, who has consulted for members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. “There are genuine divisions of opinion in the United States on a number of issues. This is not deviant, this is politics.”\nMr. Lieberman said he and No Labels recognize there are strong opposing view points on U.S. policy. “We are not going to solve any of those problems unless we get people across their several opinions to sit down and agree on some goals and try to negotiate some progress,” Mr. Lieberman said.\nHe said he has hoped that even hard-charging Mr. Trump would be persuaded to work with members of the opposite political party.\n“He’s the author of the book ‘The Art of the Deal,’ ” Mr. Lieberman said. “A big part of one sense that has been missing in Washington is the ability of people to sit down and negotiate compromises that lead to agreements that get something down. I think it will be interesting to see how he relates that part of his background to what No Labels stands for.”\nWrite to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com and Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:25:36.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
