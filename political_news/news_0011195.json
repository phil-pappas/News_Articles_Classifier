(Gary Cameron/Reuters) October 15 at 5:14 PM The Oct.13 Metro article “ Montgomery may revise early-voting switch ” missed the point of the disagreement between the Republican and Democratic perspectives. I agree with the general points made in the article, but the issue is not whether one building is better than another for access to early voting — it is that early voting as prescribed by Maryland law is required to be in locations where the maximum number of registered voters can vote early, whether they live near that location or not. The choice by the Republican majority on the Montgomery County Board of Elections to move early-voting centers from very dense population and business centers to rural and sparsely populated suburban locations violates that requirement.\nThe two locations being closed include the center with the second-highest number of early voters in Montgomery County and with the highest number of minority early voters, and a center situated in one of the busiest business districts, a location with high-density housing and one of the highest percentages of early voters from other districts.\nThis is about access to early voting by people, not access to buildings.\nDarrell Anderson , Washington Grove\nThe writer is chairman of the Montgomery County Democratic Central Committee.
