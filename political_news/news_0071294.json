They were later freed and told it was a “misunderstanding.” (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post) October 18 at 7:50 PM Regarding the Oct. 16 Metro article “ Tackled by police as potential robber, teen says he ran in fear of death ”:\nI hope the white woman pushing a baby stroller who called 911 after a young black man held a door for her will look into the eyes of her baby and imagine what it feels like to raise a child who will be feared because of the color of his or her skin.\nI implore her to reach out to Jason Goolsby, the teenager of whom she was afraid and who was tackled and detained by police, and apologize for acting on her fears. She should get to know her neighbors and the young people in the city where she lives. I guarantee that she will be better off, and more important, our youth will be protected from white fear.\nKeri-Ann Henson , Frederick", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:35:33.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
