One of the officials says the number of missiles that went off course was four. The officials were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. \nThe Russian government said Wednesday it launched 26 cruise missiles, hitting targets in the Syrian provinces in the north and northwest. It made no mention of any missiles going astray. The missiles were launched from Russian ships in the Caspian Sea. \nThink your friends should see this?
