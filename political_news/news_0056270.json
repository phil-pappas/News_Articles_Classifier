The complete, corrected release follows:\nCandy Giving Expected To Be Up This Halloween New Delta Dental Analysis Breaks Down Halloween Candy Giving Trends by the Numbers OAK BROOK, Ill. , Oct. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- If current trends hold, kids across the nation can expect a good Halloween . Households giving out candy will be up this year, while parents eating their kids' Halloween candy will take a steep nosedive. All according to a new nationwide analysis by Delta Dental Plans Association (DDPA) , a group that pays keen attention to details and trends around candy consumption.\nCandy giving increase:\nAccording to the analysis, candy giving will be up 5% this year. In 2013, 73% of parents gave out candy, based on a new 2015 Delta Dental survey, 78% of parents say they'll hand out candy this year.\nLess parental looting:\nIn 2013, nearly 80% of parents admitted to eating some of their kids' Halloween candy, this year marks a sharp decrease, with only 66% of parents saying they'll pilfer from the Halloween haul. Moms are more likely than dads (71% v 61%) to raid their child's Halloween candy.\nBad news for chocolate lovers:\nWhile chocolate continues to top the charts this year as the most handed out Halloween candy, 14% fewer parents say they'll be giving it to trick-or-treaters. In 2013, 73% of parents gave out chocolate on Halloween , this year that number has dropped to 59% .\nFewer household rules on candy consumption:\nThe number of parents limiting the amount of Halloween candy their child can eat at a time has decreased by 28%, from 89% in 2013, to 61% this year, according to the analysis.\nOn the heels of the analysis, DDPA is also releasing some quick tips to combatting all that sugar consumption:\nEat dinner before trick-or-treating. If your children have full bellies, they may be less likely to overindulge in candy when they get home. Enjoy Halloween candy after a meal to take advantage of increased saliva production and help wash away sugar and bacteria left by candy. Make sure your children drink extra water to stay hydrated during trick-or-treating and to help wash away sugar that may otherwise cause tooth decay. Remind children to brush for two minutes and floss after they dig into their trick-or-treat bags. Practicing good oral hygiene will help keep their mouths clean and their teeth free of decay.
