He also argued that his wife was the most electable and qualified person in the race to actually serve as president -- perhaps in a veiled swipe at the self-declared \"democratic socialist\" Sanders. \n\"When you elect a president you have got to say, 'Who is the person I think is most likely to keep big, bad things from happening and to make more good things happen?'\" Clinton said. \"I don't think it is a terribly close question.\" \nIt was the kind of reasoned argument that Clinton had deployed to help give definition to Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, when he was credited with laying out the stakes in a more methodical way than the President himself. Grateful for Clinton's performances at the Democratic National Convention and on the campaign trail, Obama dubbed the 42nd president the \"explainer-in-chief,\" or the \"Secretary of Explaining Stuff.\" \nClinton, who served as president from 1993 to 2001, also ended with a tongue-in-cheek reference to his wife's historic potential as the first woman president. \n\"There has been a lot of talk about breaking the glass ceiling,\" Clinton said. \"I am tired of the stranglehold that women have had on the job of presidential spouse.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:37:11.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
