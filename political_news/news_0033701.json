Clinton learned about the change through a January 7, 2011 article in The Washington Post. But the policy shift was first announced in a December 2010 press release from the State Department. “These improvements are being made to provide a gender-neutral description of a child’s parents and in recognition of different types of families,” the statement read. The next day, Clinton sent an early-morning e-mail excoriating top aides Cheryl Mills and Jake Sullivan for the secretive policy shift. “I’m not defending that decision, which I disagree w and knew nothing about, in front of this Congress,” she wrote. “I could live w letting people in nontraditional families choose another descriptor so long as we retained the presumption of mother and father. We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by [Sarah] Palin et al.” \nSo are we supposed to believe that Hillary Clinton was unaware of the culture in 2011? Or are we supposed to believe that the culture has shifted so much since that recent time? \nNeither of those possibilities seem all that plausible to me. Maybe the truth is that the sudden pro-homosexual push is a temporary bit of madness and that the culture is going to react against the resulting legal revolution. We see evidence of buyer’s remorse in the polling data about morality in our nation. If even Hillary Clinton was afraid of the issue as recently as 2011, maybe “family values” have more popularity among voters than the media wants us to realize.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:24:45.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
