David Schweikert, R-Arizona, about the underlying issue that is splitting House Republicans in their struggle to choose a new speaker to succeed U.S. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio. Schweikert is a co-founder of the Freedom Caucus, a group of House Republicans who refused to support U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-California. That group instead wanted U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Florida. But as Schweikert explains to NPR’s Renee Montagne this morning, the Freedom Caucus is after a rule change that would make the amendment process easier and more open. Schweikert said it’s not so much a matter of the person as it is the issue.
