That number has been cut nearly in half from those crisis levels, and in fiscal year 2015, which just ended, 35,000 UACs were caught.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ But Cabrera said those numbers are still too high, and said thousands of children and families continue to brave the journey because of the low chances of being caught. He said it's well known by these immigrants that the U.S. is not detaining and deporting people, but is instead catching and releasing them.\n  Treasury, IRS lay out tax rules for same-sex couples following court ruling With the rules, a marriage of two people of the same sex will also be recognized for federal tax purposes.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/21/15 5:22 PM \"They know that they will be released and issued a Notice to Appear (NTA),\" Cabrera said. \"What we have right now is essentially a catch-and-release policy. This coupled with violence and instability in their home country is driving the continued flow of UACs and family groups.\"\n\"Until we hold them until we adjudicate their cases they will continue to come,\" he said.\nCabrera also noted that the ongoing flow of UACs into the U.S. can have other disastrous impacts on border security. For example, he said that when child immigrants come across a certain area, it's hard for the U.S. Border Patrol to focus on other priorities.\n\"The cartels knew that a group of 30 UACs can literally tie up an entire shift of agents in my area,\" he said. \"All we were doing was tending to the children and the entire border in our area was completely unguarded.\"\nCabrera, who is also a member of the National Border Patrol Council, said the solution for ending the problem is to ensure all illegal immigrants are detained and deported.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Biden decision leaves both parties in disarray The voters this year don't seem to be putting a high value on Biden's greatest strength: experience.\nBy Michael Barone • 10/21/15 5:21 PM \"If they knew that if they were caught they would be detained, adjudicated and repatriated to their home country, the calculus changes dramatically,\" he said. \"I guarantee that if this was the case, the numbers would fall dramatically.\"\nHe also said his sector is only catching 40 percent of all illegal immigrants, and said more agents are needed.\n\"I am happy to discuss this in greater detail during the question and answer period, but I believe we are at least 5,000 agents below where we need to be to effectively secure the southern border.\"\nRead his testimony here:\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Sanders praises, echoes Biden \"Sure we have differences of opinion with opponents but I wouldn't use the word enemies,\" Sanders said.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/21/15 5:09 PM Top Story GOP lawmakers: Has EPA fired anyone for toxic mine spill?
