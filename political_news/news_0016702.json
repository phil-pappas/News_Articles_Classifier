Not everyone wants to live in a mansion with a three car garage and a massive back yard that’s an hour’s drive from where they work. \n\"It’s important that the report’s recommendations around streamlining consultation processes don’t come at the expense of the rights and interests of tangata whenua, because hapu and iwi want to be part of the housing solution and have a key role to play. \n\"No package of solutions to the housing crisis is complete without a comprehensive capital gains tax (excluding the family home) to curb speculation, and a housing warrant of fitness to ensure renters live in healthy homes,\" said Ms Genter. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:24:53.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
