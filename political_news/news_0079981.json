He had stated that people of north India enjoy breaking the rules and by evening he was forced to apologise. “But I believe what he said was right,” Rijiju said on the sidelines of a function for inauguration of a think tank on police-related subjects.\nThough he did not name the Lt Governor, records show the comments were made by the then Delhi LG Tejinder Khanna who had said in February 2008 that ‘it is a speciality of north and west India that the people feel a sense of honour and pride in violating law and boasting that no action has been taken against them.’\nHowever, he had later retracted his statement after Congress and BJP protested. Rijiju went on to say people here love to brag about having threatened a police official. “That means the society as a whole needs to change.”\nThe junior Home Minister said it was not right to blame police for everything. “Many people say police has become very rude. Police will be rude only if citizens are indisciplined. If people are disciplined, then police will not be rude. But there is a general saying here that until you beat them with a stick, people don’t listen. “So if people are not showing the right conduct and they are indisciplined and they don’t listen even when told once, twice or ten times, police will have to use stick to make them listen,” he said. (Yahan toh boltey hain ki danda jab tak nahi dega toh log sudhartey nahi hain. But if citizens theek nahi hai …indisciplined hai…dus baar bolney ke baad nahi mantey hai toh phir toh danda toh chalana padega).\nThe Minister’s comments came against the backdrop of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s allegation that Delhi Police was the “most corrupt”. “Kejriwal keeps on saying that Delhi police did not do something or the other but if he, himself, will not not correct his approach what could the police do?” (aap (Delhi CM) khud nahi sudhrogey toh police kya karega),” he said.\n Kiren Rijiju North Indians Delhi nation news Also Read DDA Housing Scheme 2014 to be rolled out from September 1 Delhi government accountable to people, not MHA, Manish Sisodia tells Lt Governor Vehicles entering Delhi to pay environment charge from November: SC Kiren Rijiju bats for special focus on safety of people from Northeast", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/nation-current-affairs/article/‘north-indians-enjoy-breaking-rules’-kiren-rijiju-agrees", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/kiren%20rijiju_1_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/kiren%20rijiju_1_0_0_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:30:59.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
