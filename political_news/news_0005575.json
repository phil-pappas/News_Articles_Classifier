Construction, accounting and IT are areas where job-specific training will be offered to 1,700 people under the Working Skills for Adults 2 scheme. Training at community venues in Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Merthyr Tydfil will be arranged to fit around people's working hours. Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the aim was to increase workers' productivity. The three-year project follows a six-year, £10m first phase which covered the same four counties plus Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taff.
