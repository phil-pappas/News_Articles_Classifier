Hero, traitor, geek - no matter what you think of Edward Snowden there is no doubt that he has impacted the world a great deal.\nIn June 2013, the globe-shaking document leaks from Snowden put a spotlight on the National Security Agency's domestic spying.\nThe revelations Snowden presented to journalist Glenn Greenwald — who worked at the Guardian at the time of the disclosures — have made people question the Obama administration's mass surveillance practices.\nThe U.S. government also considered making changes to its surveillance programs such as Prism.\nTwo years later, here's how the world has changed since the shocking evidence were revealed:\n1. Questioning security practices and \"intelligence failures,\" MI5, MI6 and Britain's Government Communications Headquarters publicly testified in front of Parliament for the first time ever.\nTopics covered by the Parliament Intelligence and Security Committee include security services oversight and global newspapers' involvement in the Snowden leak.\n2. The German government ends its ties with wireless company Verizon after Snowden claimed that the U.S. had conducted mass surveillance in Germany, including tapping on Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.\nOther American companies soon followed in Verizon's footsteps with Boeing and Brazil ending its $4 billion-plus defense contract in 2013.\n3. There was a rise in encryption and user privacy startup companies who have developed apps and hardware with higher security — from Wickr messaging, Silent Circle's Blackphone and more.\nTech giants like Google and Yahoo stepped up their security following the disclosures by adding encryption to users' emails.\n4. A redacted 39-page Pentagon report — \"DoD Information Review Task Force-2: Initial Assessment, Impacts Resulting from the Compromise of Classified Material by a Former NSA Contractor\" — was released in 2014.\nTwelve of the 39 pages from the report were made public — saying that the NSA documents leaked by Snowden were \"the scope of the compromised knowledge related to US intelligence capabilities is staggering.\"\nThere is no known evidence that Snowden has provided any NSA documents to a \"foreign adversary,\" according to The Guardian .\n5. Most cybersecurity experts agree that Snowden has had a magnanimous impact in the community.\n\"Snowden has managed to rack up 1.18 million followers within a short period of time,\" Dodi Glenn, vice president of cyber security at PC Pitstop, LLC, told the Daily News in an email. \"Several polls show some view Snowden as a traitor, while others view him as a hero or whistle-blower.\"\n\"To some degree, he has caused people around the world to further question their government,\" Glenn continued. \"He has certainly caused many to lose trust in the government. The trend in reporting government leaks may have already started as sites like Wikileaks get more content.\"\nMaybe not turn into hacktivists overnight, but people in the tech industry sympathize with him.\n\"The fact Edward Snowden has revealed the incredible level of monitoring that is going on has made Netizens more wary, cautious and outright suspicious about what they receive and send on the Net,\" Stu Sjouwerman, founder and CEO of software company KnowBe4, said in an email to the Daily News.\n\"As the Net really still is in Beta, and the NSA in 1978 voted against encryption of Internet data, we are dealing with an infrastructure that is at the very same time exciting and scary,” said in the email. “Snowden has shed some light on the dark side and we should all be thankful to him.\"\nMarco Garcia/AP Former NSA contractor — who leaked classified documents about the U.S. government's mass surveillance — sent out his first tweet on Twitter on Tuesday. Snowden has also recently opened a Twitter account .\n\"Can you hear me now?\" the NSA whistleblower tweeted for the first time on Tuesday.\nSnowden has been actively using the online social networking site this week, even tweeting back and forth with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson - who interviewed the former NSA contractor on his podcast, Star Talk Radio.\nPoliticians - like former New York governor George Pataki - have already called for Snowden's account to be shut down by tweeting at Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/20/us-boeing-brazil-insight-idUSBRE9BJ10P20131220", "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c1553a6-6429-11e4-bac8-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3nLOUzz63", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/pentagon-report-snowden-leaks-national-security", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/07/heads-of-gchq-mi5-and-mi6-appear-before-intelligence-committee-live", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/26/us-germany-security-verizon-idUSKBN0F11WJ20140626"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:37:26.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
