S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for $70.4 million for projects that include reworking a floodway in Millington and the buyout and relocation of homeowners in the Weaver Road area.\nThe request is an attempt to secure some portion of $1 billion in federal funds that allow competing communities to receive grants ranging from $1 million to $500 million.\nShelby County was one of 57 communities to apply for the first phase and one of 40 asked to continue to the second phase.\n\"This is one of the first really significant investments that the federal government has made in resilience. Most of the dollars go to recovery efforts,\" said John Zeanah , administrator of the Memphis-Shelby County Office of Sustainability.\nThe competition required applicants to detail what has been done since the disaster and the work that could be done with the federal dollars. The 100-plus page document detailing the county's plan is available on the county's website .\nThese targeted areas were flooded after high winds and storms on April 4, 25 and 27 sent water from the Wolf and Loosahatchie rivers, as well as from the Nonconnah and South Cypress creeks, into communities, with some areas reaching 100-year flood levels, Zeanah said.\nThe money will help these areas recover and put in place flood resilience infrastructures to prepare for future disasters.\n\"You're competing based on the quality of what you're trying to get accomplished,\" said Tom Needham , the county's public works director.\nIn Millington that means redeveloping the flood-prone area with softball fields, fishing lakes, camp grounds, boardwalks and other amenities that won't be harmed by flooding every eight or nine years, Needham said.\nAnd in Southwest Memphis, in an area where two-thirds of the community is made up of empty lots or empty buildings, the plan would relocate residents and create other uses for the vacant land, including community gardens and new trails to connect the area to T.O. Fuller State Park.\nThe residents would be relocated outside the flood zone, but within the community, Needham said.\n\"We're looking at trying to team up with some folks locally to help develop housing in the area so people don't leave,\" he said.\nThe plan includes the use of software that will hope the county predict future flooding events, Needham said.\nAnd it is all tied to the Mid-South Regional Greenprint and Sustainability Plan, a long-term project that connects the region's green space, walking and biking trails over four counties and three states.\nIt's unlikely that Shelby County will get all of the money requested, so the county has also submitted ideas on how lesser amounts will be used, Zeanah said.\nThey expect to hear back from HUD in late January, Needham said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/informemphis", "http://www.twitter.com/informemphis"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:32:19.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
