The Republican-led panel took to Twitter to vent about the seemingly late-in-the-game document dump of messages from Christopher Stevens, the ambassador to Libya who died in the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the consulate, along with three other Americans.\n\" # BREAKING : The State Dept *just* delivered nearly 1,300 printed pages of new emails from Ambassador Chris Stevens. # Benghazi ,\" the committee tweeted on Tuesday afternoon.\nFor months, the State Department has been releasing tens of thousands of pages of emails to the committee, but the GOP has consistently complained that the agency has dragged its feet in handing over all the relevant documents. State, for example, only a few weeks ago gave the committee about 900 Libya-related emails from Clinton, which the committee says it asked for at the start of its investigation well over a year ago.\nState Department spokesman Alec Gerlach said in a statement that the panel has long had messages from Stevens and that this latest release is part of an ongoing process.\nCongress\nBenghazi GOP preps for battle with Clinton By Rachael Bade\n\"In response to a recently prioritized request from the Committee, the Department has provided additional emails from Ambassador Stevens’ account,\" Gerlach said. \"The Benghazi Committee’s requests are broader than previous Committees’ requests. These emails do not change the essential facts that have been known since the independent Accountability Review Board report came out in December 2012. They do not change our understanding of what happened before, during or after the attacks.\nThe committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/Benghazi?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-20T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:33:25.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
