Advocates of conversion therapy argue that gay people can change their sexual orientation with help, which often includes religious efforts. The therapy stems from the once accepted -- but now discredited -- belief that homosexuality is a mental disorder that can be cured. SAMHSA's report concludes that \"none of the existing research\" supports that premise. This is the most religious connected faith based funds EVER. We need to demand that the churches return all the money, too, as this practice was denounced as a hoax two years back from the guy who invented it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:44:06.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
