Thomas Morgan (D-Pa.), who would go on to become the longest-serving chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. In the portrait, Morgan stands before a U.S. flag wearing a black suit. The visage belies his imposing frame: He was 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 240 pounds. Morgan’s portrait, which hangs in the committee’s hearing room, was painted by Victor Lallier, who had already completed eight portraits commissioned by the House. He finished it when Morgan was six years into what would become a 16-year chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1975, during Morgan’s final term as chairman, the committee was renamed International Relations; in 2007, it reverted back to its previous name.\nDuring most of his long tenure as chairman, Morgan, a physician, tended to support the foreign policy goals of both Democratic and Republican presidents. His stance changed, however, in his last years on the committee, when he took issue with President Richard Nixon’s approach to the Vietnam War and opposed President Gerald Ford’s policy toward Angola.\nThe committee traces its origins to 1775, when the Continental Congress created a panel “for the sole purposes of corresponding with our friends of Great Britain, Ireland, and other parts of the world.” It was originally known as the Committee of Correspondence, then as the Committee of Secret Correspondence. Benjamin Franklin, who taught himself five languages, served as its first chairman.\nBefore World War II, congressional foreign affairs were dominated by the Senate. The Constitution stipulates Congress should offer presidents its “advice and consent” on foreign policy issues. However, it gives the Senate sole authority in maintaining oversight of treaty-making by the executive branch, in an effort, the Founders said, to preserve “secrecy and dispatch.”\nSOURCE: OFFICE OF THE HOUSE HISTORIAN AND CLERK OF THE HOUSE OFFICE OF ART AND ARCHIVES\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:42:25.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
