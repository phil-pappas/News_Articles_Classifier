Igor Bobic Associate Politics Editor, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/08/2015 09:22 AM EDT Bloomberg via Getty Images \nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) claims that his populist message is resonating across party lines. \n\"There are more than a few Republicans for Bernie Sanders out there. Don't be surprised if we do well with a number of Republicans,\" the senator said Thursday in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \n\"So I think the message that we are bringing forth, that we have got to come together to say that Wall Street and corporate America cannot continue to dominate our political and economic life, that we need an economy that works for working families and not just the 1 percent,\" he added. \"A lot of Republicans will respond to that, as well.\" \nSanders self-identifies as a democratic socialist, and his positions on campaign finance, climate change, and income inequality are broadly popular with Democratic faithful. But his other stances, such as redistributing wealth and instituting universal health care, give many Republicans pause. \nAnother presidential contender to dabble in populism is real estate mogul Donald Trump, who has bashed hedge fund managers and spoken out against the influence of wealthy donors. \nAlso on HuffPost: Bernie Sanders' Most Interesting Quotes of", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:47:27.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
