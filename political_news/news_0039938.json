Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, center, accompanied by the committee's ranking member Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., left, greets Secret Service Director Joseph Clancy on Capitol Hill in Washington, before the start of the committee's hearing on how a small gyrocopter entered restricted airspace and landed on the West Lawn of the Capitol. A new government report concludes that scores of Secret Service employees improperly accessed the decade-old job application of Chaffetz, who was investigating scandals inside the agency. A deputy director was caught suggesting officials leak embarrassing information to retaliate against Chaffetz. The report said the actions could represent criminal violations under the U.S. Privacy Act.
