A century marked by terrible events like the World Wars, the Hawke’s Bay and Christchurch earthquakes, cyclones in the Pacific and conflict across the globe, but a century in which we have seen the power of humanity shine through. \n“As we celebrate our first 100 years, we celebrate the efforts of thousands of Kiwis who have helped their neighbours near and far in times of trouble or disaster.” \nMore than 11,000 people, most of whom are volunteers, help Red Cross provide a range of community services in New Zealand, including meals on wheels, first aid education, disaster relief, refugee resettlement and reuniting separated families. Internationally, Red Cross aid workers and aid programmes support people affected by conflict and disaster. \nThis support will ensure Red Cross continues to make a difference in the future, she says. \n“I look forward to starting the next 100 years with such a broad and inspiring network of support, enabling Red Cross to continue its work here in New Zealand and around the world.” \n“Across the Street, Across the World: A History of the Red Cross in New Zealand 1915-2015\", by Margaret Tennant, can be ordered at redcross.org.nz . \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:21:02.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
