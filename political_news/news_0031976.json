The kiwi programme is specifically targeted at achieving a 2 per cent per year increase in wild populations.\" \nOngoing work to encourage and support partnerships has also helped to increase the population of vulnerable species and extend pest control. \n\"The $25 million partnership with Project Janszoon in the Abel Tasman National Park is now in its fourth year and has established one of the largest stoat trapping networks in the country, covering 70 per cent of the park.\" \n\"Another key area of concern confirmed by the report is the impact of introduced weeds and wilding pines. DOC spends around $10 million a year on weed control and we are giving a substantial lift to efforts through the War on Weeds programme.\" \n\"DOC now manages more than 500 different types of ecosystems, more than ever before, and works with more than 400 threatened species, more than at any time previously. This Government remains committed to supporting its work and securing a future for New Zealand’s natural treasures.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:25:32.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
