Multiple criminal acts took place that day which resulted in a massive increase in Defense spending, a costly global war on terrorism, the creation of a new federal agencies like the Dept of Homeland Security and TSA, and the quick passage of the Patriot act which gave law enforcement agencies sweeping search and surveillance powers over US citizens without a warrant.\nThis video was produced in honor of those whose lives were taken and whose loved ones have had to live with the sad devastation of losing friends and family – and to the thousand more who, to this day, have had the quality of their lives diminished because of the conditions they were subjected to that day as they attempted to rescue those in trouble.\nAs difficult as it may be for some of you to believe the facts stated in this video, each statement is supported in the source links are listed in the description below. Please take the time to do your own research and draw your own conclusions.\nOn 9/11, after the first plane hit the North Tower of the WTC, people in the South Tower wanted to leave but were advised by Port Authority announcements to stay at their desks. Some of those who tried to leave anyway were turned back by security just before exiting the building. 1,120 died in that Tower. While looking for survivors at Ground Zero, rescue workers and their dogs searched through the wreckage tirelessly for weeks. Every now and then firefighters would hide in the rubble so that dogs could finally find “survivors.” Constantly finding bodies was noticeably leading to high stress in the dogs and it appeared that they thought they were failing in their mission. Jamaican American-born artist, Michael Richards cast his body and depicted it as being pierced by airplanes, as a tribute to the Tuskegee Airmen. The planes, he said, represent arrows that were shot at St. Sebastian, an early Christian martyr. Ironically, Richards died in his studio which was on the 92nd floor of Tower One on September 11 th . The Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ), formed in 1997, was a neoconservative think tank based in Washington, D.C. that focused on United States foreign policy . PNAC’s stated goal was “to promote American global leadership.” Of the twenty-five people who signed PNAC’s founding statement of principles, ten went on to serve in George W. Bush ’s administration. In September of 2000, exactly one year BEFORE the 9/11 catastrophe, PNAC launched its most influential publication: a 90-page report entitled Rebuilding America’s Defenses, which asserts that the United States should “seek to preserve and extend its position of global leadership” by “maintaining the preeminence of U.S. military forces.” They state that they need to exploit the revolution that is transforming technology and bring it into the military in order to “preserve American military preeminence in the coming decades.” In their minds, what will speed such a transformation? Their answer: “some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor”. One year later such a Catalyzing event presented itself with 9/11, later referred to by Bush and his cabinet as a modern day Pear Harbor. A small group of women called, the Jersey Girls, who lost their husbands in the 9/11 attack, basically forced the Bush Administration through public pressure, to form a 9/11 Commission which was reluctantly charged with preparing “a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks “ Their account turned out not to be so full and complete. The commission (now known to many as the 9/11 Omission Report), left out many OBVIOUS facts including the fact that a third building in the World Trade Center complex completely collapsed that day. And it wasn’t even struck by an airplane. Described as being damaged in the attack which started fires on several floors, the 47 story, steel-framed federal office building, known as World Trade Center 7, collapsed in 6.5 seconds at 5:20 pm (more than 7 hours after the second trade center tower fell). And speaking of Building 7, the BBC conducted a LIVE REPORT in which reporter Jane Standley announced that WTC 7, had collapsed. There was one small problem with the report: building 7 was still standing in the background as Standley was reporting that it wasn’t standing. Matter of fact, building 7 wouldn’t collapse until twenty minutes AFTER the report of its collapse. This is the Windsor Hotel in Madrid Spain. On February 12, 2005, a fire broke out on the 21 st floor of this steel framed, 32 story building. The fire blazed for 23 hours, gutting large portions of the building. And, while some of the floors crumbled away in the flames, the steel structure’s skeleton remained standing. In comparison, the south tower burned for a mere 56 minutes on far fewer floors before it completely collapsed and the north tower burned on relatively few floors for only 102 minutes before it experienced complete structural failure. Building 7 which wasn’t even hit by a plane, only burned for 6 or 7 hours. To recap. The Windsor hotel burns for 23 hours on many floors and remains standing. World trades one and two burn for less than 2 hours and yet, experience global, symmetric free fall collapse. World trade center 7, by the way, was the largest CIA headquarters outside of Langley Virginia and housed offices involved in several large scale federal investigations into massive stock market and accounting fraud. WTC 7 was the first to be cleaned up and the evidence destroyed at Groud Zero On July 24, 2001, just 49 days before the 9/11 attack, a guy named Larry Silverstein from Silverstein Properties put up 14 MILLION of his own money to secure a 3.1 BILLION bid and acquired a 99 year lease on the World Trade Center from the Port Authority of New York. Despite not being the owner of the buildings, Larry, was the sole beneficiary of the insurance indemnity payments of more than 7 billion Dollars for acts of terrorism. After a long legal battle with the insurance companies who covered the policy on the trade center complex, the court awarded, Silverstein 4.55 BILLION dollars. The Freedom Tower or One World Trade Center, currently the 3 rd tallest man made structure in the world, is the main building in the new WTC complex. Standing 1776 feet tall or (541m), the skyscraper cost 3.9 BILLION dollars to construct. Silverstein’s insurance settlement contributed 1 BILLION dollars to the project, the State of New York provided an additional $250 million, and the Port Authority agreed to give $1 billion, which would be obtained through the sale of bonds . The rest, as was suggested, could be collected through increasing New York City tolls. At 9:03 am its alleged that flight 175 crashes into the south tower of the WTC. At 9:06 chief of staff Andrew Card informs the president, “A second plane hit the other tower, and America’s under attack.” At that same time, in other parts of the country Vice President Dick Cheney, Condolessa Rice and several Congressional leaders were rushed to secure locations. But not the President. The President’s secret service detail, whose protocol it is in this situation to see the President as a high value target with a well-publicized location that MUST BE MOVED, in unprecedented fashion did nothing to whisk the President of the United States away from that school and to a secure location. The official report records that Bush remained at that school for another 20 minutes after learning about the attack on America. Number one is coming up; If you enjoy this content click that red subscribe button for more interesting videos.\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting in Orlando Florida, President Bush, was asked by a child how he felt when he heard about the terrorist attack. Bush responded with something extremely interesting. Recounting the events of that day from his perspective, he said that he saw the First plane hit the tower on a television that was “obviously on” as he sat outside a classroom at Booker Elementary School in Sarasota , Fla. Play video… Then he says…[ … ] the problem is that no one could have seen the footage of the first plane hitting the tower since there was no known live coverage of the first plane. There was no live coverage of the event, because nobody expected an attack. The footage that was taken, allegedly of Flight 11 striking the North Tower, was captured by Jules Naudet and his French film crew at 8:46 that morning and would not be released to news outlets until a day AFTER the attacks. The President’s incredible statement that he saw this first aerial assault was another important item that was Omitted by the 9/11 Commission Report .
