There are no intellectual standards. None. This is Cambridge, home of Harvard, which lost its soul when they accepted tens of millions of dollars from the Saudis.\nAhmed didn’t build anything. He took the insides of a digital clock and put it inside a box — making it look like the bombs you see in Hollywood movies.\n“Cambridge Public Library hosts ‘Stand With Ahmed and Build Your Own Clock’ day,” thanks to Robert Spencer, October 19, 2015\nThe fact that Ahmed Mohamed didn’t build anything, but just fit existing clockworks into a pencil box , has been ignored by everyone, including the President of the United States. No one cares that school officials nationwide have acted in similar ways with non-Muslim students, because of the zero tolerance policy on weaponry. The Cambridge Public Library doesn’t care about the ominous implications of this entire episode, with the inevitable effect that school officials will be wary of stopping Muslim students with suspicious objects. None of these facts matter in the unseemly rush to anoint Ahmed Mohamed as a new folk hero and the Rosa Parks of “Islamophobia.”\n“Cambridge teens can build their own clocks, just like Ahmed,” by Dialynn Dwyer, Boston Globe , October 17, 2015 (thanks to Mark):\nLast month Ahmed, the teen who was arrested after teachers mistook a clock he built for a bomb, was invited to visit NASA, MIT, and the White House.\nNow the Cambridge Public Library is inviting the city’s teens to “Stand with Ahmed” by learning to build their own clocks.\nThe main library location will host two sessions on October 24 where kids aged 10-18 can learn what goes on inside a clock and how to build their own clock circuit.", "external_links": ["http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/260158/clock-ticking-islamophobia-robert-spencer", "http://pamelageller.com//https://www.boston.com/news/2015/10/17/cambridge-teens-can-build-their-own-clocks-just-like-ahmed/3AAnSK3mhZW6pF2JdHrV4O/story.html", "http://www.jihadwatch.org/2015/09/hoax-muslim-clockmaker-didnt-build-clock-just-put-existing-one-into-pencil-box", "http://www.jihadwatch.org/2015/10/cambridge-public-library-hosts-stand-with-ahmed-and-build-your-own-clock-day", "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/260303/ahmed-day-and-end-if-you-see-something-say-robert-spencer", "http://www.memritv.org/embedded_player/index.php?clip_id=5118"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:18:23.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
