But he's also departed from business orthodoxy in opposing many trade deals, seeking to raise some taxes on investment income, and proposing to tax companies that seek to move their headquarters outside of the U.S.\nDespite the rise of Trump, Donohue suggested that the country is moving closer to addressing its immigration policy problems, in part because the economic need for workers is becoming more pressing.\n\"We're much closer than we were,\" he said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner McCarthy fired up, wants cuts in debt ceiling deal McCarthy said a \"clean\" debt ceiling increase makes no sense as it would just allow the debt to soar higher.\n  1:32 PM Top Story House Republicans vote to repeal key pieces of Obama's health law House GOP   Obamacare.\n  11:59 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:42:32.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
