It's been a remarkable surge: Just a few weeks ago, the parties were tied, and over much of the summer, the Liberals were actually in third place as the left-wing New Democratic Party led the pack. Location: Canuckistan Posts: 15,553 Most pundits are saying that it will probably be a minority government so all bets are off at that point. If the Liberal Party doesn't have a majority, they don't automatically become the government. In fact, if a coalition can't be formed, another election will be called. The Conservative Party has categorically stated it will not form a coalition with either party. And the NDP have stated they will not form a coalition with the Liberals. The other interesting dynamic is that in a whole bunch of ridings that appear to have a Liberal lead, the Conservatives are a strong second so there is speculation that once the voters get into the privacy of the voting booth, fear of an untested young leader and comfort in the same-old may have an effect. The odds are quite even as a matter of fact. I'm watching with great interest.

Again. It looks like the Liberal Party will win a slim majority. I think everyone, including the Liberals are surprised. I am also sure it wasn't so much a pro-Liberal vote as an anti-Harper vote. I'm just glad the populous didn't go NDP as the alternate. Location: The Milky Way Posts: 18,006 If the Liberals do get a slim majority, coupled with their \"surprised\" outcome, how well will they be able to govern? Are they ready to govern?  Quote: Originally Posted by RNG The pundits were wrong. Again. It looks like the Liberal Party will win a slim majority.

I'm just glad the populous didn't go NDP as the alternate. from here it looks like a fairly solid majority but i suspect australias experience is different. in our 150 seat parliament, if we had an election result of 78- 72 it would be considered a convincing win. has anyone claimed victory or conceeded defeat yet? in australia the general opinion is opposition doesnt win elections, governments lose them. and there is often an \"its time\" factor, after 10 years its fair to give the other side a go. will it make much difference, practically, to canada?

Location: The Milky Way Posts: 18,006 As of a minute ago they needed 27 out of 100 remaining seats for the bare majority. Location: Canuckistan Posts: 15,553 The Liberals ended up with a fairly strong majority, about 40 seats in a 338 seat house. If the PM-elect does all the things he claimed during the campaign it will be quite a change. Historically, the Liberals have been mostly conservative light. Trudeau has sounded the same other than his stated willingness to run deficits for a few years to stimulate the economy. But it has been short of details. He has also promised to increase taxes on the upper earners to lower them for the middle class, but again, no details. I will say a Liberal government gave us great times under a Liberal Finance Minister, Paul Martin. With strong regulation of our financial markets. It saved Canada from the worst of the toxic asset meltdown. And the Conservatives have systematically eroded those regs. So it is hard to say where it will shake out at this time. The Liberals have been out of it for so long I have no idea who the players are that will act as Ministers of this government. (Or Ministers are sort of like your Secretaries, but they must be elected members.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:41:23.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
