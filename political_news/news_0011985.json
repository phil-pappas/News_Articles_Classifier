None of the other five candidates managed to top 1 percent. \nThe business mogul is rarely at a loss of words, but admitted “I don’t know what’s going on” when confronted about Ben Carson’s surge to the top of the Iowa polls last week. \nIn comparison to two months ago, both Carson and Rubio are up by 9 and 6 points, respectively. Trump has dropped by 5 points, with Fiorina’s share of the vote also plummeting by 5 points. \nCarson’s support continues to climb among all ideological groups. He now leads Trump by 9 points among very conservative voters compared to a single point two months ago, and by 21 points among somewhat conservative voters compared to 2 points in August. He also has a 17-point lead among moderate to liberal voters, which is a reversal since the prior poll when he trailed Trump by 9 points among this group.
