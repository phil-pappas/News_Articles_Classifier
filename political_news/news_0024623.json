Why don't we change it since we are look­ing for peace?\" he quizzed. \nThe Ghana Catholic Bishops' Conference also believes that the EC should take urgent steps to investi­gate the allegations that about 76,000 persons from neighbouring countries have their names in the biometric voter register. \n\"The allegations of over 76,000 names of persons from neighbouring coun­tries discovered in the cur­rent register must be inves­tigated and the proper process be conducted if the allegations are found to be true. If this and other alle­gations are found to be true, it will be necessary to have a new voter register to enable people to have confidence in the electoral process,\" the Bishops implored. \nDr. Joyce Aryee, former minister and stateswoman, also believes that the way forward is a fresh register. \nThe Executive Director of Salt and Light Ministries said on Multi TV's 'My own personal feeling' that \"You don't want to work with a document that is so controversial.... I think the best thing to do is to stop all the controversy and get a new one.\" \nShe added that a \"clean slate\" will \"shut everybody up so when you lose, you lose; when you win, you win.\" \nThe Ashanti Regional Chief Imam, Alhaji Abdul Mumin Haroon, has also observed that the replace­ment of the register is the way to go, in view of calls from several groups. \nAlhaji Haroon said Muslims should not be left out in the call for a fresh register in the interest of the nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:56:20.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
