The 'forgotten' army of 400,000 Muslim soldiers who fought in Great War trenches for Britain - Birmingham Mail I read this article with very mixed emotions. While I can accept that the numbers are right and some credit is due to those who travelled all the way from India to be slaughtered by industrial warfare, I ask myself why should Muslims have to reach back in time like this to justify their existence any more than any other religion? At the same time, why should any religion or lack of have to do so? What I mean by that is why is having fought in a war any more worthy of remark than any other deed or am I attaching more political and cultural significance to this than exists? Anyone have any views on whether there is a moral high ground for any religion in warfare? Of some interest are the comments at the end of it.
