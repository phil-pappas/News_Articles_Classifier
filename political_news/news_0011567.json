(AP) - At least two students at a Maryland high school were asked to change out of clothes displaying the Confederate symbol.\nSchool district spokesman Michael Doerrer says the students at Brunswick High School wore the Confederate symbol Tuesday. The Frederick News-Post reports ( http://bit.ly/1LtPU34 ) Tuesday also marked USA Day. During the event, the school encourages students to wear patriotic colors in honor of Spirit Week.\nDoerrer says the school doesn't ban Confederate symbols, but administrators can ask a symbol to be removed on a case-by-case basis if it proves disruptive.\nBrunswick High Principal Nancy Doll says administrators spoke with three students who \"cooperatively and respectfully\" changed their clothing.\nLast month, about 20 students at Christiansburg High School in Virginia were sent home for refusing to shed their Confederate flag gear.\n___\nInformation from: The Frederick (Md.)
