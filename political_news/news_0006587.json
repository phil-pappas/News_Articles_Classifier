The fact that there is a little bit of confusion is not surprising to me.”\nEarnest adds:\n“It’s irresponsible that we continue to see Republicans spend so much time and energy lying about the Affordable Care Act,” Earnest said. “It doesn’t just have political consequences, it has potentially real life consequences.”\nEarnest on those ‘rigged’ and deceptive poll numbers that clearly show how Americans really feel about Obamacare:\n“In terms of the success of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, I wouldn’t consult poll numbers, I would actually consult the 17.6 million Americans who have gained coverage since the law went into effect.”\nAsked about double-digit premium hikes, Earnest said, “Double-digit increases were quite common prior to the Affordable Care Act going into effect.” He added, “Eighty-four percent of the people who received plans through the marketplace received financial assistance to make it affordable to them. “\nWell at least he is honest about how Americans really can’t afford the “Affordable Care Act” unless the government subsidizes their healthcare coverage.\nOver the 5 months, my monthly healthcare premium under Blue Cross & Blue Shield’s Obamacare plans in Florida went from $214 to $532.\nYeah, real affordable.
