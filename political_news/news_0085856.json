The request was approved on Monday night by the UN before an anti-IS debate on Tuesday at the UN General Assembly in New York, which will be attended by the British Prime Minister David Cameron and US President Barack Obama.\nThe UN updated list named four as Sally-Anne Jones, 46 year-old convert from Kent, Glaswegian Aqsa Mahmood, 21, Nasser Muthana, also 21, from Cardiff, and Omar Hussain, 28, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. All four are thought to be based in IS-held city Raqqa, in Iraq.\nThe UK’s government requested that the two men and two women be added to a list of foreign fighters subject to international sanctions, meaning that they cannot travel to any UN member country nor keep their money in any UN nation. The last time such a request was made was in 2006 when an Al-Qaeda operative was added to the list.\nAccording to the UK, the four are included on the list for their active attempts to recruit UK citizens to join IS, as well as using social media to encourage terrorist activities, including providing guidelines for homemade bombs.\n“The move underlines the government’s determination that those who go and fight for Isil and threaten Britain will face consequences for their actions,” Downing Street said.\nWho are they?\nFour British jihadists – including Aqsa Mahmood from Glasgow – face UN sanctions http://t.co/T2g7JJvWHv pic.twitter.com/LxDOPDuifL\n— BBC Scotland News (@BBCScotlandNews) September 29, 2015\nSally-Anne Jones\nJones – reportedly a former rock musician – traveled from Chatham, Kent to Syria in 2013 to join her 21-year-old husband Junaid Hussain – a British-born hacker for IS – who was killed by the US airstrike in August. Jones and her husband were understood to be plotting attacks on the UK soil and attempted to recruit in the UK.\nJust found out from a article that David Cameron has put me on a UN Sanctions list as i lol @ England for giving me a travel ban — UmmHussainBritāniya (@UmmHuSSain31337) September 28, 2015\nThe mother of two from Chatham left one of her sons in the UK, travelling to Islamic State-held territory with her youngest child. Jones is understood to be on the list due to her active presence on social media, where she encourages girls and women to join IS. Also, she uses her Twitter account, which has been repeatedly suspended, to declare her hostility to the west.\nAqsa Mahmood\nMahmood, 21, from Glasgow was just 19 when she traveled to Syria in 2013 to marry an IS fighter. She is one of the first female UK citizens who traveled to the country. As she crossed the Turkish border, she told her parents that she wanted to become a martyr.\nThe UK government believes that Mahmood is a member of the al-Khassan brigade, which controls and disciplines women within the self-titled caliphate. Mahmood uses her Twitter account as Umm Layth, to express her radical views, encourage attacks and recruit. Although her parents have asked the former private schoolgirl to return home, Mahmood has claimed she would rather die in Syria.\nNasser Muthana\nA Cardiff-born and former medical student, Nasser Muthana, traveled to Syria in 2013 with his younger brother Aseel Muthana. He was placed on the UK treasury’s sanctions list in 2014, after appearing on IS propaganda videos aimed at recruitment, including the video titled ‘There is No Life without Jihad’ showing beheadings.\nOmar Hussain\nHussain, a former supermarket security guard, has been in Syria since early 2014. Ever since, he has been an active propagandist for IS. He initially joined Al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, but later defected to join IS, like many other foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Active on social media networks and extremist websites, Hussain has encouraged women and children to travel to Syria and declared that he will only return to the UK to “plant a bomb”. He has an active blog on Tumblr and earlier this month described Arabs as “quite peculiar, annoying, and at times somewhat stressful to interact and associate with” .\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/06/scottish-woman-married-isis-fighter-martyr-aqsa-mahmood", "http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/1267.pdf", "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/28/four-britons-fighting-isis-put-on-un-sanctions-list?CMP=twt_gu", "http://t.co/LxDOPDuifL", "https://twitter.com/BBCScotlandNews/status/648753816792399872", "https://twitter.com/UmmHuSSain31337/status/648620551599206401", "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/23/cardiff-men-isis-recruitment-video-return", "http://t.co/T2g7JJvWHv"], "published": "2015-09-29T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:49:47.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
