While both of them maintained a stern silence on the reasons behind it, Ranvir and Konkona made their split official.\nWhile we recently met Konkona who's busy promoting her next flick Talvar , she didn't want to comment on the topic. But Ranvir who attended the trailer launch of his next film Titli immediately responded when asked about the same. \"Yes, I do believe in the institution of marriage. I don't blame anything but myself for my separation.\"\nAlthough still the reasons aren't too clear, most gossip columns suggest that it was long time coming. Anyway, we hope the two have a happy life here onwards.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:19:51.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
