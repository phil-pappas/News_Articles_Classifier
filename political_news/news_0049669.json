I wish someone had bothered to explain that to Isaac Newton. I don't think he was aware of it. Neither was Galileo... or Copernicus... or... somebody of the 21 century? Francis Collins, MD, PhD from UNC, for starters. Here's a little blurb on his credentials. Before being appointed Director of the National Institute of Health , Collins led the Human Genome Project as director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), one of the 27 institutes and centers at NIH. He is elected to the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences , and has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Science . But I'm sure since he is a man of faith who believes \"religion\" is compatible with science, he must be complete idiot... like the other guys I mentioned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:06:07.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
