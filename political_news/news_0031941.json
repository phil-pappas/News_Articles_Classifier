In the last 48 hours, Mr. Biden wore his growing frustration on his sleeve, offering a thinly veiled warning to Mrs. Clinton that Democrats would be “making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy.” In recent days, Mrs. Clinton has announced her opposition to the president’s trade deal with Asia, among other policies. As colleagues in the Senate, Mr. Biden and Mrs. Clinton were friendly. He was one of the first people Mrs. Clinton met with after her June concession speech when she dropped out of the 2008 primary. After Mr. Obama made his vice-presidential choice known, Mr. Biden told a crowd in Nashua, N.H., that Mrs. Clinton “is as qualified or more qualified than I am.” He added, “And, quite frankly, she may have been a better pick than me.” But Mrs. Clinton’s outsize celebrity as the secretary of state began to grate on Mr. Biden. With the news media noting Mrs. Clinton’s heavy travel schedule, aides to Mr. Biden often said that while miles traveled were irrelevant, the vice president in his first term had traveled nearly 700,000 miles, compared with Mrs. Clinton’s 956,733 miles.

He recalled watching the two of them circle each other warily before debates that year: “Yeah, we’re friends. But we’re watching-over-our-shoulder friends.” In public remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Biden noted the 1.1 million miles he had traveled — more than Mrs. Clinton. And he said that — unlike a secretary of state — when he speaks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia or other world leaders, “they know that I’m speaking for the president.” Mr. Biden’s resentment about Mrs. Clinton has ebbed and flowed. In 2011, pollsters working for Mr. Obama’s re-election campaign asked voters in battleground states a question: Would you be more likely to vote for Mr. Obama if Mrs. Clinton were to campaign for him? The poll intensified speculation that Mr. Obama was considering replacing Mr. Biden with Mrs. Clinton on the ticket, angering the vice president. The next year, Mr. Obama, aware of how sensitive his vice president was when it came to Mrs. Clinton, edited out a joke about dropping Mr. Biden from the ticket from a draft of his speech for the White House Correspondents’ Association’s annual dinner. With Mrs. Clinton tucked away from politics and above the fray at the State Department in 2012, Mr. Biden barnstormed the country to sell the Obama presidency, sometimes at the expense of his own approval ratings in the polls. But shortly after she left the State Department the next year, presidential speculation began to surround Mrs. Clinton again. Several Democrats said Wednesday that they hoped any bitter feelings about the rivalry could be put aside, and the party could move forward. “It just settles an issue that, while it was outstanding and ambiguous, created a cloud of uncertainty,” said Alan Patricof, a venture capitalist who is a donor to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. “I think now that it is clarified, it makes everything that much more clear.” \nMaggie Haberman and Michael D.
