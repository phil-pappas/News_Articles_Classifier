(Photo: Jennifer Jacobs/The Register) Buy Photo \nLAS VEGAS – Harry Reid has knives out for Iowa and New Hampshire – he doesn't like that they're the states that take the lead the hunt to choose the next president. \nAt a news conference before the first Democratic debate Tuesday night, the U.S. Senate Democratic Leader sarcastically apologized for disparaging New Hampshire in an interview Monday night. \n\"New Hampshire is heavily populated and loaded with a lot of minorities, my apologies,\" he said in a meeting room at the Wynn hotel-casino in Las Vegas. \nThat \"sorry, not sorry\" answer got laughs from the political reporters gathered around him. \nThe Des Moines Register cornered him after the news conference and asked him to explain what his feelings are about Iowa, which holds the first-in-the-nation vote in the presidential nominating contests, just before New Hampshire's lead-off primary. \n\"I just said there aren't many minorities in Iowa,\" he told the Register. \nThe backstory is that on Monday, at a Q&A event organized by the Washington Post, Reid said he's \"terribly upset about how we were choosing our presidents. You go to New Hampshire. There are not any minorities there. Nobody lives there. You go to Iowa. There are a few people there, but again it's a place that does not demonstrate what America is all about, for a lot of different reasons.\" \nReid said his own state is \"representative of what America is all about.\" The New Hampshire Union Leader pointed out Nevada is the \"land of casinos and legal prostitution.\" \nOn Tuesday, the Register asked Reid if he feels Nevada should vote before Iowa in the presidential contests. \n\"I'm satisfied with it,\" he answered. Nevada is third on the presidential voting calendar; it's caucuses are Feb. 20. \nWhen pressed, he added: \"I said last night that the same person that drew up the caucus rules in Iowa did it in Nevada – Richard Bender, an aide to Iowa U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin, who is now retired.\" \nSo you're cool with Iowa going first? \n\"We can't change that. I just think it's important that there be four involved – not just Iowa and New Hampshire because I don't think New Hampshire and Iowa are representative of America,\" Reid said. \nAt the press conference, Reid, who isn't seeking re-election in 2016, also had this to say: \nDEBATE PREVIEW: \"It's going to be a substantive debate. It won't be a debate of attacks on each other on personality.\" He said the arguments will be based on who is most competent, not on who they can berate the most. \nTULSI GABBARD: Asked about the kerfuffle over Hawaii U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard being disinvited from the debate audience because she criticized national Democratic leaders for not holding more debates, Reid said: \"I didn't think the congresswoman from Hawaii is running for president. What's she concerned about?\" \nJOE BIDEN: Asked if the vice president would make a surprise appearance in the debate in just a few hours – he'd have to declare an official 2016 candidacy to get on stage – Reid said: \"No, Joe won't be here.\" CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1RFO0NA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:57:56.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
