Mary Fallin and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott are waging charity \"bets\" on the Red River Rivalry game between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Texas Longhorns. \nFallin says she's challenging Abbott to a Charity Showdown. Fallin has wagered that the loser of the bet on Saturday's football game must donate food to a charity in the opposing governor's state. \nIf OU wins, Abbott will donate a shipment of Austin's Railhead Barbecue to the City Rescue Mission. The mission is an Oklahoma City nonprofit that partners with the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma to provide meals for the homeless to support Fallin's ongoing Feeding Oklahoma Food Drive. \nIf UT wins, Fallin and Head Country Bar-B-Q will sponsor 600 meals to be served at the Capital Area Food Bank in Austin.
