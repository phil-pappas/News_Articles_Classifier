Buy Photo 31 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nA top official from Gov. Mike Pence’s re-election campaign is moving to a new role at the Indiana Republican Party. \nThe state GOP announced Monday its selection of Robert Vane as its new spokesman and media consultant. Vane’s appointment comes at a critical time for the party as campaign activity ramps up ahead of the 2016 election. \nVane had been serving as communications director for Pence’s re-election campaign. He now will coordinate the state party’s communications for Republican candidates running for office in 2016. That includes the governor’s race, which likely will feature a rematch between Pence and Democrat John Gregg. Tully: Pence V. Gregg, Part 2. It should be a doozy \n“Robert is a trusted and valuable adviser to our effort,” Pence said in a statement. “I look forward to continuing our work together as he expands his role throughout the coming months.” \nVane will work with the state party on a contractual basis through his public relations firm, Veteran Strategies. Vane said a replacement communications director for Pence’s re-election campaign will be determined in the future. \nFor the state party, Vane will serve as primary media contact and handle “direct rapid response efforts” for Republican candidates, according to a statement released Monday. \nThe move by state party officials comes amid a noticeable increase in communication efforts by the Indiana Democratic Party. \n“(Vane) will be a valuable ally to promote the GOP brand and defend Governor Pence, our Senate nominee and our entire slate of candidates from misleading Democratic attacks,” state GOP Chairman Jeff Cardwell said in a statement. “Robert and his ability to correct the record and promote Governor Pence and the Republican team’s pro-growth agenda will be a welcome addition to the team.” \nDrew Anderson, communications director for the Indiana Democratic Party, countered in an email that \"Vane's move highlights how vulnerable Governor Pence and the entire Republican Party feel with the upcoming races next year. Simply put, Hoosiers know they can do better than having Republicans in office who will side with their ideology ahead of the overall well-being of the state 100 percent of the time.\" \nVane previously served as communications director for the Indiana Republican Party and as deputy chief of staff and communications director for Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard. \nVane is a native of Irvington on Indianapolis’ Eastside and is a U.S. Army veteran. His public relations firm is a veteran-owned business enterprise. \nCall Star reporter Chelsea Schneider at (317) 444-6077.
