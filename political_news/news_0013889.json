Rama Rao Hyderabad: Panchayat Raj and IT minister K.T. Rama Rao on Wednesday said that the state government has earmarked Rs 2,618 crore to spruce up the roads in Hyderabad city. “You will see good roads in the next three months, besides work on new skyways to ensure faster traffic movement. We have proposed a massive Rs 20,000 crore development plan for Hyderabad city, which will include several skyways, including one from Paradise to Bowenpally, Rajiv Rahadari, and Uppal to Ghatkesar among others,” he said. Speaking at a function to welcome Congress leader Narasimha Yadav into TRS fold, Mr Rama Rao said bifurcation has ensured faster development and healthy competition between TS and AP, helping both the states and proving certain notions false Wishing AP all success, he said he would attend the foundation stone laying ceremony for its capital Amaravati if invited. “Despite provocative acts by some and false propaganda, there hasn’t been a single incident against Seemandhra people living in Hyderabad in the past 16 months. TS has proved to be a peaceful home for people who have settled here from various parts of the country,” Mr Rama Rao said. He said that there were doubts and unfounded fears at the time of bifurcation. Taking a dig at Congress and BJP and admitting that Hyderabad city roads were in a bad shape, Mr Rama Rao said the repair works could not be taken up due to monsoon, Metro works, laying of pipelines for Krishna and Godavari waters, drainage works and other projects.
