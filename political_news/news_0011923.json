What everyone's saying about Kevin McCarthy's remark on Benghazi and Hillary Clinton. Did he slip up?\nBy Rachel Brody Oct. 1, 2015 | 1:25 p.m. EDT + More Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader and near shoo-in to succeed John Boehner as speaker, made a whoopsie. Or maybe not.\nMcCarthy, speaking Tuesday night on Fox News, suggested the Select Committee on Benghazi, created to investigate the 2012 attack that killed four Americans, was a strategic move by Republicans to target 2016 Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. \"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\" he told host Sean Hannity. \"But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened, had we not fought.\"\n\"Thanks you, Kevin McCarthy for stating the obvious,\" writes John Marshall at Talking Points Memo. McCarthy's \"candid admission,\" he writes, exposes the true aim of the Benghazi committee – \"exploiting the death of four Americans for partisan political gain. Always. From day one. Full stop.\" When the attack happened in 2012, Mitt Romney was among the first to charge that President Barack Obama had mishandled the Benghazi situation, before it was even over, Marshall notes. McCarthy and the Republicans may be targeting Clinton now, Marshall argues, but it's the same story, just with different characters. \"The exploitation and conspiracy derp predated having any idea what happened because that was what it was about,\" he wrote, \"working a political angle.\"\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Benghazi ]\nMcCarthy's words may have the left shouting \"gotcha,\" writes The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne, but he says the majority leader wanted to placate his wing, too . \"Democrats got what they long sought,\" he writes – an admission the investigation was a political witch-hunt – but McCarthy \"wants to mollify the right end of his caucus\" (the ones Boehner was unable to appease). By emphasizing the fight to bring Clinton down, reasons Dionne, \"McCarthy was telling his party's ultras, we've been really, really partisan – and effective, too.\"\nBut others in the Republican party aren't too pleased. Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie said McCarthy's statement \"diminishes [Benghazi committee] chairman [Rep. Trey] Gowdy's work,\" and Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, noted he \"might have said it differently.\" Said Issa, \"Any ancillary political activity that comes out of it is, in fact, not the goal of the committee and is not what the committee is seeking to do.\"\nBut Jazz Shaw at Hot Air defends McCarthy and denies his words were at all partisan. \"Let's be clear … this wasn't a 'stunning concession' in any way shape or form,\" he writes, referencing a condemnation of the remarks by top committee Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland. McCarthy was simply stating how valuable the investigation had been in revealing the details of an otherwise \"whitewashed story.\" Sure, Republicans aren't \"exactly sad\" about the damage the committee may have done to Clinton's campaign, admits Shaw, but Democrats are mistakenly conflating cause and effect – and that's a shame. \"[T]his is the reality of American politics,\" he writes. \"You can't afford to let your concentration slip for even a moment when there's a camera pointed at you … and it doesn't take more than a minor slip of the lip to bring on the crows.\"\nTAGS: politics McCarthy, Kevin Clinton, Hillary Republican Party", "external_links": ["http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/01/republicans-criticize-mccarthy-over-benghazi-remarks/", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-mccarthy-puts-political-spin-on-benghazi-and-hillary-clinton/", "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/01/on-mccarthys-benghazi-gaffe/", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdsn9f%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/kevin-mccarthys-truthful-gaffe/2015/09/30/f12a9fac-67a8-11e5-8325-a42b5a459b1e_story.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdsn9f%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/30/politics/kevin-mccarthy-benghazi-committee-speaker/", "http://democrats.benghazi.house.gov/news/press-releases/cummings-responds-to-gop-leader-s-admission-about-the-benghazi-committee", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdsn9f%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/lol--4", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdsn9f%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Pundits%20React%20to%20Kevin%20McCarthy%2C%20Hillary%20Clinton%20and%20Benghazi", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdsn9f%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Pundits%20React%20to%20Kevin%20McCarthy%2C%20Hillary%20Clinton%20and%20Benghazi", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdsn9f%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Pundits%20React%20to%20Kevin%20McCarthy%2C%20Hillary%20Clinton%20and%20Benghazi&summary=What%20everyone%27s%20saying%20about%20Kevin%20McCarthy%27s%20remark%20on%20Benghazi%20and%20Hillary%20Clinton.&source=U.%20S.%20News"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:17:58.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
