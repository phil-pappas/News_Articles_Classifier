Bowe Bergdahl should have been executed for abandoning his post in Afghanistan. (Video via Donald Trump ) \n\"We're tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who's a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,\" Trump said at a campaign rally in Las Vegas. (Video via MSNBC ) \nBergdahl, who was captured by the Taliban in 2009 after leaving his post, was returned to U.S. custody in 2014 in a prisoner exchange . \nEarlier this year, Bergdahl was charged with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. Now, investigating officers are drawing up recommendations as to what his punishment should be. (Video via WRAL ) \nThis isn't the first time Trump has spoken out against Bergdahl . Following a campaign event in New Hampshire in August, Bergdahl's lawyer called Trump's comments \"contemptible and un-American.\" \nHe also says Bergdahl left the base to bring \"disturbing circumstances to the attention of the nearest general officer.\" The army has yet to decide whether Bergdahl will be court-martialed.
