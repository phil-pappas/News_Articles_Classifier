Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and three other White House hopefuls will take the stage Tuesday in Las Vegas for the Democratic Party's inaugural debate of the 2016 cycle, hosted by CNN and Facebook. But Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner who's already participated in two GOP debates, wants a piece of the action. \"At the request of many, and even though I expect it to be a very boring two hours, I will be covering the Democrat Debate live on twitter!\" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. His move could distract from the Democrats who are hoping the debate will give them an opportunity to present their views to a national television audience during a campaign season in which the GOP contest has been in the spotlight. Trump is a powerhouse on Twitter with more than 4 million followers.
