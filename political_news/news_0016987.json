After being asked by an activist with the pro-family leave group Make It Work about his stance on mandating paid maternity leave, he first replied, Thats a state decision. When pressed, he added, I dont think we need more federal rules. Of course he'd be against making it a federal law applicable to every woman. He's no more family values than he is moral and ethical.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:40:36.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
