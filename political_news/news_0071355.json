(AP) — Even state Republican Party Chairman Rob Gleason acknowledges being \"alarmed\" by the lopsided fundraising advantage that Democratic candidates for three open seats on Pennsylvania's highest court enjoy less than a month before Election Day. The Democratic nominees raised $2.4 million collectively just in the reporting period between early June and mid-September — seven times more than their Republican foes — with the lion's share coming from the deep pockets of organized labor and Philadelphia trial lawyers. Of the $8.2 million contributed to all Supreme Court candidates since the beginning of the year, including the six who were eliminated in the May primary, the Democrats took in $6.4 million, contrasted with $1.6 million for Republicans. Two of the Democrats, Superior Court Judge David Wecht of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia Judge Kevin Dougherty, had each raised more than $2 million as the expensive TV air wars are about to begin. Superior Court Judge Christine Donohue, also based in Pittsburgh, had raised nearly $1 million. \"We're not asleep, obviously, and we're working very hard to be competitive,\" Gleason said last week. \"At the end of the day, we will be very competitive on television.\" Gleason said the party is stepping up its fundraising, sending out mailings and producing TV spots touting the GOP ticket to augment the efforts of the individual nominees: Superior Court Judge Judy Olson, Commonwealth Court Judge Anne Covey and Adams County Judge Mike George. He said he expects the national GOP will provide financial support and hopes for indirect assistance from national, conservative-leaning political groups, including billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch's Americans for Prosperity, because of the political implications in a battleground state. Republicans have controlled the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for six years, and the GOP hopes to fend off a Democratic takeover that would have serious implications for legislative redistricting battles following the 2020 census. Republicans hold commanding majorities in both houses of the General Assembly. A Democratic sweep of the unprecedented three open seats would not only flip the partisan balance on the seven-member court, but almost certainly lock in a Democratic majority for at least 10 years. In addition to monetary support, the three Democratic candidates received about $150,000 in research provided by three out-of-state political consultants hired by Rebuild Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf's political committee. The Supreme Court race is the first big test for the 4-month-old committee. Mike Mikus, a Pittsburgh political consultant who heads the committee, declined to elaborate on the nature of the research but said it was \"something that we felt we could help them with.\" Besides the six party nominees, an independent candidate is on the Nov. 3 statewide ballot. Philadelphia Judge Paul Panepinto put up $200,000 of his own money for the campaign he launched in July.
