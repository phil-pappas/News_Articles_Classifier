After nearly six years of grueling negotiations, an agreement in principle on the Trans-Pacific Partnership hammered out behind closed doors will soon be released to the world — straight into the neon glare of a presidential election campaign and a bitterly divided Congress.\nPresident Barack Obama wants the 12-nation deal to cement his economic legacy. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders opposes it as a sellout of American workers. Hillary Clinton, who once pushed it as secretary of State, is now noncommittal. The Republican presidential field is all over the place: Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina are critics, while Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush have spoken favorably of it.\nMeanwhile, Speaker-in-waiting Kevin McCarthy will have to tame an unruly tea party caucus to push the agreement through the House. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a staunch supporter of free trade, is angry over a provision that would prevent tobacco companies from suing governments over anti-tobacco laws.\n\"It’s going to be a huge fight,\" said Larry Cohen, former president of the Communications Workers of America, which led labor opposition to fast-track authority this spring.\nSo while the trade ministers of a dozen nations celebrate a historic breakthrough Monday after hundreds of hours spent hashing out detailed agreements on intellectual property rights, labor standards and Japanese rice, the dysfunction and unpredictable nature of the U.S. political system could still conceivably unravel the whole delicately negotiated pact. A vote is likely months away — perhaps even longer than that if Obama waits for the final details to be ironed out before he gives Congress the legally mandated 90-days notice that he intends to sign it.\nAnd the political ride is only expected to get wilder. With populism animating the base of both parties, a trade pact is bound to be unpopular with many early primary voters who already feel disconnected from government, insecure about their jobs and distrustful of anything Washington does.\n“Many Americans are suspicious of a deal hatched by big corporations with little or any public input,” said Robert Reich, former Labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. “And the bad jobs situation cause lots of people to worry about more outsourcing abroad.”\nRep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who was prominent in the fight against the fast-track bill, said this deal will be “an equally hard sell — and you don’t have John Boehner there.”\nTo be sure, the betting money is on passage — albeit after long and loud debate. A vote to give the president fast-track authority to conclude the agreement passed the House in June with the slimmest of margins — 218-210. But as many as half the Republicans who voted against it several months ago will probably vote for the pact, Cohen believes.\nDingell isn’t so sure, arguing some Republicans may be alienated by the provision barring Big Tobacco from seeking damages over anti-smoking laws, as well as by weaker-than-expected language on intellectual property protections and currency manipulation.\n“Currency manipulation is the mother of all trade barriers,” Dingell said.\nOnly 28 of the chamber's 188 Democrats supported giving Obama fast-track authority, but Wisconsin Democrat Ron Kind, chairman of the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, believes more will vote for the deal itself.\n“There were a number of members who said, 'I probably can’t be there for TPA, but I’m keeping my powder dry and my mind open when it comes to TPP,'\" Kind said.\nIn the Senate, the fast-track vote was 60-38, a squeaker by filibuster standards but comfortable territory going into the TPP vote, which needs to pass by simple majority thanks to fast-track authority. But McConnell signaled moments after the deal was announced that \"serious concerns have been raised on a number of key issues,\" while Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah said the pact \"appears to fall woefully short.\"\nSupporters think the pact's sheer economic heft will help sell it. It would reduce trade barriers, set rules for the Internet and establish labor and environmental standards for countries that produce 40 percent of the world’s economic output, from giants like Japan and the U.S. to developing nations like Peru, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nBut the provisions go beyond what past trade deals have sought to accomplish, potentially costing critical support from powerful pro-trade Republicans — while possibly not going far enough to win over skeptical liberals.\nMcConnell, for instance, is opposed to language that would bar tobacco companies from seeking damages from foreign governments over anti-tobacco laws, while Hatch is furious he did not get 12 years of monopoly protections for a new class of cutting-edge drugs called biologics.\nHouse Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin has criticized the lack of access to Canada’s dairy market for milk and cheese producers in his state, a negotiating impasse that nearly killed the deal. “I am reserving judgment until I am able to review the final text and consult with my colleagues and my constituents,\" Ryan said in a statement.\nAnd the panel’s ranking member, Sander Levin of Michigan, has sought strict rules to guarantee that benefits for automakers and their suppliers are shared only among the countries in the deal. Levin warned Monday that Congress might demand additional changes before the president signs the deal. “We have to get this agreement right, which is why no one should be surprised if the 90-day period results in additional changes,\" he said in a statement.\nOther factions, including liberal Democrats like Sanders and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, have demanded labor and environmental standards to level the playing field and prevent U.S. companies from moving jobs overseas. Sanders blasted the deal Monday as a give away to Wall Street and big corporations. “It is time for the rest of us to stop letting multi-national corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense,” he said in a statement.\nAnd Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has criticized provisions allowing corporations to seek damages from foreign governments over lost profits from health and environmental laws and regulations. Those were modified in the last few days to place a greater burden on companies to prove their cases and dismiss frivolous claims. But Warren has not indicated whether those satisfy her concerns.\nNational Foreign Trade Council President Bill Reinsch notes the idea of a non-controversial trade pact is a fantasy — and most House lawmakers will vote the interests of their home-state agricultural and business interests.\n“If you’re from North Carolina, you’re going to look at tobacco because that’s a big issue, and it’ll be very hard to vote for an agreement that has a tobacco carve-out,” Reinsch said. “Likewise if you’re from a state with a lot of pharma companies and a lot of pharma employment, you might not have much choice.\n“The danger is if you put together a whole bunch of these people who will vote on the basis of one thing, and they’re all unhappy with their one thing, then you don’t have the votes to pass it.\"\nExperts say the most compelling arguments for the deal are strategic and geopolitical — but those may be a hard sell to politicians focused on their next elections.\n“There’s no question about the fact that I think the Chinese would be thrilled if TPP collapsed because of domestic political pressures in the United States,” said William Galston, a former policy adviser to Bill Clinton. “The very strongest argument I believe President Obama has made is that there will be rules for the world economy. And the question is, who will write those rules? His argument is that others will [do it] in ways that are even less favorable to our interests.”\nIt doesn’t help that the debate in Congress will be happening at a time in the political cycle when domestic issues are usually uppermost in voters’ minds, with Clinton coming under intense pressure from progressives to reject the deal she promoted as secretary of State.\n“We do need to set a high bar for trade agreements,” Clinton said in July. “We should support them if they create jobs, raise wages — and advance our national security. And we should be prepared to walk away if they don’t.”\nIf Clinton disavows the deal to shore up her chances of winning primaries in union-heavy states like Ohio in March and Pennsylvania in April, it could make it harder for Obama to get Democratic votes in the House.\nIn that case, Obama would have to rely even more heavily on Republican support. Some see potential vulnerability in the GOP vote count, especially if Republican front-runner Donald Trump remains atop the GOP presidential polls.\nTrump has called the pact \"an attack on America's business\" and criticized U.S. officials negotiating the deal as \"weak and pathetic.\" Carly Fiorina, meanwhile, says she’s “very uncomfortable” with it. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and the state’s former governor, Jeb Bush, have spoken favorably about a deal. But the agreement has yet to figure in any Republican debates.\nReinsch, of the National Foreign Trade Council, is skeptical how much lawmakers will be affected by what candidates say on the campaign trail.\n“If you’ve got cattle farmers in your district or rice farmers who are happy or unhappy … that’s a lot more important than what your presidential candidate is saying because the cattle farmers vote,\" he said.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:39:47.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
