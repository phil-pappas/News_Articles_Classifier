Afterwards, she accused him of seeing another woman and demanded to see the texts on his cellphones. When he refused, Singletary reached into her boyfriend’s bag, according to the arresting documents, and pulled out the two cellphones and his service weapon, a .40 caliber Glock 23. She demanded he tell her the passwords to the phones. He refused. “Your phone is more important than me holding the gun on you,” she said, shooting the couch where he was sitting. Was arrested Friday after she allegedly fired a pistol at her boyfriend during a domestic dispute. Singletary is the Obama administration’s House legislative affairs liaison and was paid $125,000 a year . Let’s just say she wasn’t a low-level staffer.\nHer purposeful gun crime while working for this gun-hostile administration is more important than the time Dick Cheney accidentally shot a friend while Dove hunting.
