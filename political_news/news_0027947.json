Promoted stories \nand that with a growing demand for purpose-built student accommodation in the city it would free up homes elsewhere in the city for families. \nHowever, residents and local community groups have raised concerns about the proposals, with 33 representations made to the city council about the plans. \nThe Highfield Residents Association, Portswood Residents’ Gardens Trust and Portswood Central Residents Association have all contacted the council about the proposals, as well as one of the area’s ward councillors Matthew Claisse. \nOne objection says that: “Portswood already has an excessive student population, which has an impact on existing residents in terms of noise and disturbance as well as the mix and balance of the character of the area. \n“The proposal will exacerbate these impacts significantly. New student accommodation should be dispersed more widely throughout the city and not concentrated within the Portswood and Highfield areas.”Other concerns include fears over insufficient parking. Share article \nwill lead to issues when parents are dropping off and picking up their children, while the amount of accommodation has been described as “excessive”. \nHowever, city council planning officers have recommended that the council’s planning and rights of way panel grant permission, subject to conditions on hours for construction work, replacing trees and other factors being met.

Residents only agreed to the overbearing supermarket on the grounds the remainder of the site would be more suitable homes not Student BATTERRY STYLE ACCOMODATION! This is yet again encroachment on an established residential area with oversized, overcrowded, excessive structures. We have plenty of student accommodation in existence. There's already plans to convert the old B&Q site up the road. Let's hope for the residents that this too isn't another monster structure. The depot site should have homes, with drives and gardens which would be more suitable to the area. These Battery blocks will not stand the test of time and will be eye sores in the future. Proper homes are what we need!! SCC planning, we are watching you closely on this one!! Outrageous and scandalous proposal being submitted!
