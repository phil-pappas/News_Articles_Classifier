The NZFS operates approximately 440 fire stations across New Zealand , with more than 10,000 personnel, including 8,000 volunteers.\nUnder the five-year contract, Unisys is delivering the alarm system via an as-a-service model run on Unisys-owned hardware and central computing infrastructure in its Kapiti and Auckland data centers through a high-availability, distributed operations model. Unisys will have full responsibility for managing and maintaining the system, allowing the NZFS to focus on its life-critical business of responding to fires and other emergencies.\n\"Moving to a hosted-IaaS model allows the Fire Service to focus our people and resources on being first responders to emergencies, rather than managing the overhead of the infrastructure core of the national automatic fire alarm system,\" said Stuart Waring , information and communications technology manager - data and intelligence, NZFS. \"The end-to-end national fire alarm system will continue to be managed and supported by NZFS, which includes AFASPs, Fire Alarm Service Agents, building owners, and the NZFS Communications Centers. We have worked with Unisys since 1996, so they understand the life criticality of the system.\"\nSteve Griffin , country manager, Unisys New Zealand, said: \"The new infrastructure-as-a-service IT model frees the NZFS from IT responsibility for the infrastructure core of the fire alarm system. Unisys has a strong heritage in supporting mission-critical systems and operations. We have a dedicated 24-hour data center team focused on the provision and support of the alarm system to deliver fire alarm messages quickly and reliably.\"\nAbout Unisys\nUnisys is a global information technology company that works with many of the world's largest companies and government organizations to solve their most pressing IT and business challenges.
