What do they taste like? The ChiComs have initiated a pogrom against these pastries. Are they that tasty? Story here .\nThe Chinese Communist Party has tightened up discipline on its 88 million members by banning several sinful activities, including extravagant eating and drinking, abuse of power, nepotism, adultery, and golf.\nThe report comes from the state-run Xinhua news agency, as translated by the BBC, which notes that the Communist Party “has in the past warned its officials to refrain from extravagant dinners and purchasing moon cakes using public funds.”\nMoon cakes are a Chinese pastry, filled with salted egg yolk and sweet lotus paste, traditionally consumed during the Mid-Autumn Festival. As the BBC previously reported, the Communist Party believed corrupt officials were using public money to splurge on moon cakes and other entertainments during the festival. The prohibition against excessive drinking and eating is apparently another reaction to the abuse of public funds to pay for such indulgences.\nGolf? I could care less. I have two sets of clubs gathering dust in my house and I still smile at the way they scream when I hold one in my hand.\nThe cultural significance of moon cakes explained here .\nNow in America, we have moon pies.\nHmmmm, moon pies. I haven’t had one of these in about a hundred years.", "external_links": ["http://www.chinahighlights.com/festivals/mooncake.htm", "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2015/10/22/chinese-communists-ban-gluttony-adultery-moon-cakes-golf/"], "published": "2015-10-24T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:02:24.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
