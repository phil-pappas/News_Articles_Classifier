Can anyone possibly be blamed for such a view? \nWe have seen the evils perpetuated by these ‘politicians’ and we have watched on like helpless beings unable to influence a change. They have turned the country on her head. Nothing seems to be working; from education to infrastructure, transportation, security, employment etc. Who are those to be blamed? Well, I suppose your guess is as good as mine. But wait! Is this the same across the globe? Are politicians the same across the universe and is the game being played the same way it’s played in developed countries? The rhetorics will never end! \nThe truth of the matter is that politics in every country is a product of the prevalent thought of an average citizen of that country. The politicians in the United States have the American mentality and that is peculiar to their country. The same can be said of other countries. This brings to mind the question, what is the ‘Nigerian mindset’? \nI dare say its a mindset not worth emulating, a mentality built over the years on falsehood, deceit and above all a lack of value for human lives. A mentality that never allows the carrier see any good in themselves neither do they appreciate anything that stems from within them, always tilting towards anything that has the slightest atom of ‘foreignness’. Little wonder our politicians act the way they do. They never think human life is important aside from theirs and those of their loved ones. They are mostly a committee of tyrants. A body of persons with a predominant aim of doing disservice to the country they ‘represent’. I dare say our politicians are a reflection of who we are as a nation. Take for instance, what legislation do we have that favours the physically challenged in our midst? I bet we don’t think that’s important! Who litters our drainages? Who demands kickbacks from politicians aspiring for elective positions? Who celebrates a bigger thief and lambasts the one who stole ‘little’? \nI can go on and on. Our ecosystem is replete with these examples. An average Nigerian only sees the man that is caught stealing as a thief. How about the ones covering their tracks even though it’san open secret that they’re as well, we celebrate them. One is only regarded a thief once he doesn’t belong to our family, political party or isn’t our friend. What a country! \nA country of pretenders. People who only pay lip service to things. A country filled with people who desire a ‘change’ but are never willing to bring about the change, rather they erroneously hope someone will appear out of space to bring about that ‘ change’. We are victims of our collective resolve. \nIts high time we woke up to our responsibilities. What I think in my opinion that we require is a shift in our Gross Mental Attitude. We need to have a re-orientation that starts with a strong desire for development. Let’s think differently, talk differently and therefore act differently. When do we start saying ‘God bless Nigeria’?.just Those three words can only come out of a mind full of passion and desire for true change, not cosmetic changes that we are now known for.let’s put ingenuity to work. \nLet our young people think value and not just a job. Let them know that any economic activity resolves around People, Service and Profit and not otherwise. Let’s hold our politicians accountable by first holding ourselves responsible for the environment we live in. Ensure neither you or nor anyone litters the environment. Think, give and demand for excellence. Perhaps we might salvage the few opportunities left to rebuild our country. \nGod bless Nigeria!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:44:47.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
