She was \"in her car seat\" while Martinez fired a Glock at a target he had placed on a nearby park sign, according to an arrest affidavit in the case.\nMartinez told the park ranger he was testing the laser on the gun, the affidavit said. He surrendered the weapon to the ranger without incident.\nAlso at the park with Martinez was 54-year-old Carl Joe Saiz.\nSaiz said he had not fired the weapon.\nIt is illegal to shoot a firearm in a Denver Mountain Park.\nBoth men admitted to drinking that day and both consented to taking a preliminary breath test, given by Jefferson County Sheriff's deputies who were called to the scene by the ranger, to check blood alcohol levels. Martinez registered a .187 and Saiz a .189, numbers which indicate both men had consumed several drinks over the course of the day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:16:20.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
