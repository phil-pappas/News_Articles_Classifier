The investigation confirmed that one of the coaches had paddled the child and was expelled from the program, the others were cleared, the office said.\n\"NORDC has a strict no paddling policy, and violating this policy is unacceptable. All volunteer coaches are informed of this policy at orientation and are required to sign a document providing written acknowledgment of this policy,\" said NORDC's chief executive, Vic Richard. \"After immediately investigating the allegation, the coach's suspension was found valid and his volunteer privileges were revoked on Oct. 2.\"\nThe city said that the St. Roch case was the second reported case of paddling this year. Asked to provide documentation of any complaints against NORDC coaches, the Landrieu administration referred the request to its legal department.\nThe injuries to the child at St. Roch Park did not appear to be serious, but sources said they are indicative of a larger problem. They described coaches cursing at children and administering physical discipline that, while perhaps falling short of clear-cut child abuse, was obviously inappropriate and against NORDC's conduct policy for volunteers.\nParents accused one coach of going to his car to retrieve a pistol following an argument he had with them, the sources said, though it was unclear whether he actually produced the weapon. The coach remains in place.\nDionnica Reed, who said she is the cousin of the boy who was paddled at St. Roch Park, made reference in her email to the alleged gun threat and a separate paddling at Taylor Park in Hoffman Triangle.\nIn that instance, a coach was accused of paddling multiple players and expelled from the NORDC program. One of the sources, who regularly visits the park in an unofficial capacity, said the coach continued to show up at practices because NORDC staff did not enforce a policy requiring coaches to carry city-issued identification badges that identify sanctioned volunteers.\nIn still another case, a coach tackled a player on his team of 9 and 10 year olds and later berated a child on the field during a game. He was initially suspended for multiple games, but later reinstated after missing just one contest, a source said.\nAnother coach accused of similar behavior was suspended for three games, according to sources.\nThere is a general sense among coaches that enforcement of conduct violations is unfair, the sources said.\nCoaches, parents, volunteers and former employees who say the park system is poorly managed and a toxic work environment have been pushing, publically and privately, for Richard's ouster.\nCouncilwoman LaToya Cantrell is sponsoring legislation that would restructure the commission and provide the City Council with more control over its membership. Under the current setup, the commission is largely under the mayor's control.\nThe Landrieu administration has remained steadfast in defense of Richard, saying criticism of his leadership stems from backlash against his efforts to professionalize the park system and impose order on what had been a laissez-faire operation.\nUpdated at 5:32 p.m. to include a response from NORDC and the Landrieu administration.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:55:08.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
