Consult often, negotiate slowly. \n\"Bit by bit by bit,\" she told a parliamentary committee last year. \n\"If you've devoted years to doing this and been very careful along the way, chances are hopefully everybody's going to say this is the deal, they're happy with this deal... \n\"That's the sort of blood, sweat, and tears that has to go into getting there.\" \nThe Americans pressed her to pick up the pace. In Washington, they fumed for months that they hadn't had one decent conversation about access for their dairy farmers to Canada's grocery shelves. Canada a 'shock absorber' on dairy \nThe numbers only took shape recently. Finally, just before midnight Sunday night, dairy lobbyists went rushing up the hotel staircase to hear the final details. It wound up being 3.25 per cent market access — less than one-third of the original American request. \nAn official in the Bush administration explained the American strategy going in. \nTimothy Keeler was the top staffer in the U.S. trade office in 2008, when it first explored joining the TPP process. Canada wasn't involved yet. But a potential role for Canadian dairy was already envisioned: that of shock-absorber. TPP: The disaster that didn't happen for dairy and auto sectors \nHe said the U.S. needed Canada and Japan to take in a bit more dairy, so that when U.S. producers lost some domestic market share to New Zealanders they might recover some sales abroad. \n\"We weren't sitting there saying, 'OK, if we get Canada in we need to get X percentage of market opening,\"' Keeler said. \n\"We were thinking, at the time, eventually you could get Canada and Japan in there — and that should provide the opportunity to get some 'gets' for the U.S. dairy industry.\" Provincial pressure strategic \nThe world of Canadian dairy went to Atlanta to limit those \"gets.\" \nOne Quebec industry representative sitting by the lobby Starbucks summarized his zero-tolerance approach to negotiation. When asked what percentage might be acceptable, he said: \"We're sure it'll be too much.\" \nMedia coverage back home presented the travel of provincial delegations to Atlanta as a confrontation with the feds, and some politicians eagerly fed that impression. \nBut the relationship was more complex. \nProvincial cabinet ministers met regularly with Fast. The provincial and federal teams ate together. One provincial official said someone from the federal side even printed up a news story illustrating how miffed the provinces were — to distribute it in Atlanta. \n\"They used it, for sure (in the negotiations on dairy),\" he said. \nFor all the long-distance federal-provincial shouting they were, mostly — as one provincial politician said with a wink — on the same team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:47:25.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
