Thatâ€™s just window dressing. \n\"The Office is certainly understaffed to carry out a complex job under a strong interpretation of the Overseas Investment Act, but that is not happening at present. The lack of benefits from all these approved purchases is the evidence. \n\"Where is all the job creation from foreign buyers? Where are the innovations that could not be achieved under Kiwi ownership? \n\"New Zealand First wants the Act amended to stop the creeping foreign buy-up of our land and an end to rubber stamping applications,\" says Mr Peters. \nThe OIO has 15 staff, and assessed 151 applications in the 2014-15 financial year.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:27:59.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
