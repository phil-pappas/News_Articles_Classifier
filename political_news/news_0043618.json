Other high-profile personalities have gone farther, using social media to plead for action on gun control and to do political combat with those who disagree. \nThe most active is British journalist Piers Morgan, a Daily Mail columnist and former CNN host. The conservative website Breitbart News quickly condemned his tweets , saying the long-time gun-control advocate began \"exploiting the tragic shootings at an Oregon community college before authorities knew how many victims existed.\" Here are some of Morgan's tweets on the subject: 137 school shootings in America since Sandy Hook. ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVEN. #oregon — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 1, 2015 It's not dust, it's blood. > RT @Fpsoxfan @piersmorgan the dust hasn't even settled and you are politicizing this. Have you no shame? — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 1, 2015 You gun nuts disgust me. https://t.co/ldz1vwOuIw — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 1, 2015 Shame on you, Mr President @BarackObama - in 6yrs, you've done absolutely nothing to stop these gun massacres happening. NOTHING. #oregon — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 1, 2015 This will keep happening until enough decent Americans rise up and say enough. Where are you, and what exactly are you waiting for? #guns — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 1, 2015 \nFormer U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, now in private practice with the law firm Covington & Burling, also has sent out a series of emotional tweets about America's ongoing problem with mass shootings. He tells his Twitter followers that now is the time to do something about our gun culture. Now Oregon. We weep again as a nation. Is the answer to our gun violence epidemic to do nothing? Again? Come on America! We solve problems — Eric Holder (@EricHolder) October 1, 2015 Enough! Now Oregon. What reason now to oppose safety measures? Other nations have not had these mass shootings after implementing reforms — Eric Holder (@EricHolder) October 1, 2015 Gun safety measures will not - by themselves - stop violence. But as part of a comprehensive effort this great Nation can be made more safe — Eric Holder (@EricHolder) October 1, 2015 \nMorgan and Holder are only two of the more high-profile people taking a position on social media in the wake of the shootings. Many are using the hashtag #oregon. Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, an Oregonian, has weighed in as well with a pertinent factoid. More Americans have died from guns since 1968 than in all the wars in American history https://t.co/eIOUHZwP4w — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) October 1, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:33:03.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
