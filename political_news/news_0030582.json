He'd look like Ibn Hunter. Quote: Hunter, 25, was arrested Monday after an unprovoked attack on a homeless woman in Atlantic Citys Brown Park over the weekend that was recorded and posted to Facebook, the Press of Atlantic City reports. Police identified Hunter from the video after someone shared a link with the Press of Atlantic City, which passed it on to authorities. In the video, posted Saturday by user Bdsb BroadDay, Hunter in standing in front of the 45-year-old victim and asks her: I aint gonna do what? I aint gonna grab you? I aint gonna do what? A voice off camera chimes in: She said you aint gonna smack her, dog. Hunter then stares into the camera, cocks back his right fist, and decks the unidentified, seated woman with a haymaker to her face. Bing! the cameraman yells as the woman falls backward onto the pavement, unconscious. Its over, he continues, laughing along with the attacker. Hunter then looks into the camera and issues a statement: This (expletive) got (expletive) up saying Im not going to smack her. The cameraman zooms in on the victim, a large bruise forming over her right eye. So any of you (expletives) talking that stupid shit is getting smacked and knocked the (expletive) out like that, Hunter said. I aint playing. None of the other people in the park, who also appear to be homeless, seem the least bit startled by the attack, and neither try to intervene or come to the womans aid afterward. StopHateCrimes.com reports the woman was admitted to an Atlantic City hospital in critical condition. Police did not release the victims name or other information. A police spokesman said the woman suffered severe head trauma and was eventually upgraded to serious but stable condition, according to the news site. Bdsb BroadDay posted the video to Facebook at 1:14 p.m. Saturday and continued to share the video online until Monday. Atlantic City detective Neil Kane used a still photo from the video to track down the victim, as well as Hunter, from people at the Atlantic City Rescue Mission. Hunter was eventually arrested Monday on a warrant for aggravated assault and booked into the Atlantic County Justice Facility, the Press reports. Hunter has previous convictions for drugs and theft, the first for cocaine possession when he was 16 years old. He also has five adult convictions for burglary, robbery and drug possession, the Press and NJ.com report. ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:28:24.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
