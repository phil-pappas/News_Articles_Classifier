President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin toast at a luncheon during the U.N. General Assembly on Monday.\nBy Paul D. Shinkman Sept. 30, 2015 | 4:50 p.m. EDT + More Top officials within the Obama administration offered muddled, vague and at times contradictory responses Wednesday to confirmation that Russia has begun bombing Syria without coordinating its efforts with the U.S. and trampling over concerns from the same officials that a lack of unity could make an already bloody conflict even more violent.\nFor a conflict Obama has kept at arm's length since it began in 2011, the fumbled U.S. response appeared to represent the White House's larger problem of determining a new course for its broad strategy of defeating the Islamic State group and securing political transition in Syria, while also assuring its 60-member international coalition that the U.S. remains the country that should lead it.\nRELATED\nRussia Begins Airstrikes in Syria At a press conference hours after the strikes began, White House spokesman Josh Earnest dismissed Russia's military actions and rhetoric in support of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad as something officials had observed for \"quite some time, and it's clear they've made significant military investments now in propping him up.\"\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense says it conducted 20 combat missions Wednesday, striking at least eight Islamic State group targets and destroying ammunition and fuel depots, command posts and other heavy military hardware. Syrian activist groups claimed at least some of the strikes did not target the extremist network and instead killed women and children .\nEarnest downplayed the strikes as an indication that Russia is concerned about losing \"the one client state they have in the Middle East.\"\n\"This is in contrast to, or at least calls into question their strategy because when President Putin and President Obama met,\" Earnest said, \"much of their discussion was focused on the need for a political transition inside Syria.\"\nLittle was previously known about the sideline meetings between the two leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, which the Russian side reportedly requested after bolstering its military presence in Syria last week. Both sides said the discussions were productive and that they would continue through a yet-to-be determined military channel to deconflict their respective military operations inside Syria.\nBut instead of proper diplomatic or military channels, the Russians instead dispatched a general to knock on the American Embassy door in Baghdad roughly an hour before strikes began to send the message. The Russian parliament passed hasty legislation authorizing the strikes, and called on the U.S. to vacate Syrian airspace. The communist wing of the parliament also said the strikes and their likely effectiveness should prompt the U.S. to lift sanctions against the Russian economy.\nBoth the White House and the Defense Department remained optimistic as of Wednesday afternoon that the new inter-military meetings – which have not yet taken place – will provide more clarity.\nRELATED\nHow Putin Outmaneuvered Obama in Syria \"The priority we have right now is to try to get those tactical conversations,\" said Earnest, who would not specify whether Putin provided any forewarning of his intentions to begin strikes so soon. He deferred any additional questions until​ the militaries can begin those communications.\nWhen asked for specifics on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Russia's actions represent a \"logical contradiction\" as they appear to have targeted areas without Islamic State group populations, while claiming they are operating in support of the Assad regime. He deferred any further details on a U.S. response, citing ​the to-be-determined military communications with the Russians.\n\"Let's see what eventuates from these conversations,\" Carter said. \"That's the purpose of these talks.\"\nHe repeated concerns that Russia's unilateral approach risks making problems in Syria worse, and that \" fighting [the Islamic State group] without pursuing a parallel political transition only risks escalating the civil war in Syria and with it the very extremism and instability that Moscow claims to be concerned about.\"\nCarter said he was \"always concerned\" about the possibility that Russia's stepped-up military response without U.S. coordination could endanger American pilots operating over Syria, or forces on the ground allied with the coalition, but added \"that's the reason for the talks.\"\nThe Pentagon chief then seemed to reverse his thoughts, saying Russia's actions seem to reflect its longstanding goals.\n\"I take the Russians at their word,\" he said. \"They've been exceptionally clear in what they're saying.\"\nRELATED\nCongress Hesitant to Share ISIS Intelligence With Putin, Assad \"I don't have a problem understanding what they're doing,\" Carter added. \"That's abundantly clear.\"\nAmerica's goals in the operation are to facilitate the flow of information between coalition forces and the Russians, Carter said, to ensure any additional Russian actions do not interfere with U.S. efforts to defeat the Islamic State group, and that broader U.S. security agreements in the region remain unchanged.\nSecretary of State John Kerry met with his Russian counterpart on Wednesday afternoon. He reiterated earlier in the day the administration's policy of welcoming Russian involvement if they align with the goals of the U.S.-led coalition.\n\"If Russia's recent actions and those now ongoing reflect a genuine commitment to defeat that organization then we are prepared to welcome those efforts,\" he said.\nThe overall response from the Obama administration, particularly so close to dealing face-to-face with the Russian president at the U.N., has left many critics baffled to the point of anger.\n\"It is tragic that we have reached this point,\" said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in extensive remarks on the Senate floor Wednesday. \"A Syrian conflict that has killed more than 200,000 people created the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, spawned a terrorist army of tens of thousands, and now created a platform for a Russian autocrat to join with an Iranian theocrat to prop up a Syrian dictator.\"\n\"This is the inevitable consequence of hollow words, red lines crossed, tarnished moral influence, leading from behind and a total lack of American leadership,\" he said.\nTAGS: Russia Syria Islamic State", "external_links": ["http://news.yahoo.com/russian-strikes-killed-civilians-syrian-opposition-leader-143923825.html", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrnnz%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrnnz%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Russian%20Aggression%20in%20Syria%20Leaves%20U.S.%20Officials%20Struggling%20to%20Respond", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrnnz%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://sputniknews.com/politics/20150930/1027793619/russia-us-sanctions-isil-war.html", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrnnz%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Russian%20Aggression%20in%20Syria%20Leaves%20U.S.%20Officials%20Struggling%20to%20Respond&summary=Russia%27s%20sudden%20entry%20into%20Syria%27s%20civil%20air%20war%20leaves%20the%20White%20House%20and%20the%20Pentagon%20with%20few%20options.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20150930/1027808602/russian-jets-isil-syria.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrnnz%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrnnz%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Russian%20Aggression%20in%20Syria%20Leaves%20U.S.%20Officials%20Struggling%20to%20Respond"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:03:19.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
