John Kasich’s line-item vetoes of the new two year budget could soon see some relief. \n\nIf things go as planned, the Senate will vote today on a bill that makes a few changes to the two-year budget, including additional money for schools hit when Kasich vetoed about $80 million in funds for the 2016-17 school year. \n\nSenate leaders also hope to clarify a commercial activities tax exemption passed in the two-year budget that was aimed at light manufacturing companies operating as part of the same supply chain in New Albany’s Personal Care, Health and Beauty Park. \n\nFor schools, the plan is to add an amendment this afternoon to Senate Bill 208 that will at least partially restore funding that was designed to ease the blow of reduced tangible personal property tax reimbursements. Sen. Bob Peterson, R-Sabina, chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, recessed the committee this morning without a vote and said closed-door discussions on the issue were continuing.\n>> Keep up on political news and insights with our Dispatch Politics newsletter.

The intention was for a 75 percent income tax deduction on up to $250,000 in pass-through business income, and then a reduced 3 percent tax rate on income over $250,000. \n\nBut the budget language actually applied the 3 percent rate to all taxable income, which would mean an income tax hike on up to $40,000 in taxable business income. Some raised concern that the original language in Senate Bill 208 ended up creating additional tax problems, so lawmakers have worked to address that as well. \n\nA number of lawmakers in both political parties have expressed concern about Kasich’s school funding veto. Though a veto override has been discussed, most of the action has been aimed at finding a compromise funding solution. \n\n“We’ve worked with the House and the administration to see what portion of those dollars that were vetoed for fiscal year ’17 can be restored,” said Sen. Chris Widener, R-Springfield. “ Hopefully we can use something simple that everyone can easily understand.” \n\nWidener said House leaders also have some ideas on long-term structure of tangible personal property tax reimbursements that should be included in the bill. \n\nThe bill is not going to address Kasich’s other school-funding veto, which took nearly $20 million from wealthier districts that was added in an effort to get per pupil funding in those schools closer to what Ohio spends on private schools. \n\nThe New Albany Beauty Park has about eight such companies producing fragrance, beauty and health-care products and a variety of packaging. L Brands, the parent company of Bath & Body Works, would like to attract at least 10 more companies to the park from outside Ohio. \n\nBut the company and state have reportedly had a dispute over whether the state’s commercial activities tax, a gross receipts tax paid by businesses, should apply to the products as the move from the production of a bottle, to the filling of that bottle at the next company, to the packaging at another company. \n\nPeterson said there are about 1,000 jobs there now and there is potential to add another 1,000. \n\n“Most of those jobs aren’t even coming from the United States,” he said. “They’re coming from China, Mexico and the Philippines. It’s an important economic development tool.” \n\nIf Ohio collects the commercial activities tax at each step of the manufacturing process, Peterson said, those jobs could move to a bordering state. The exemption would cost about $800,000 a year. \n\nThe two-year budget included language that attempted to provide companies in the New Albany park a commercial activities tax exemption. But a late amendment added at the request of the Kasich administration, narrowed it too much and made the exemption ineffective, Peterson said. \n\n“At the end of the day, it didn’t accomplish the goal of bringing those companies back,” he said. \n\njsiegel@dispatch.com \n\n@phrontpage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:31:48.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
