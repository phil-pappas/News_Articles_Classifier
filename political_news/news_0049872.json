Watch it: Hillary Rodham Clinton testifies before Congress on 2012 Benghazi attack \n*** \nHillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate and former secretary of state, will appear before the U.S. House Select Committee on Benghazi in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, Oct. 22, at 7 a.m. Pacific time (10 a.m. Eastern). \nThe hearing will be aired live on cable television and on the Internet on C-SPAN 3. On cable, find C-SPAN 3 in the Portland, Oregon, area on Xfinity Channel 106. Other local providers don't carry a listing for C-SPAN 3. \nYou can watch online on C-SPAN 3 , but you'll need to log in using your cable account. In other words, if you don't have cable TV, it doesn't look like you'll be able to watch live. \nYou can also follow coverage on the Twitter feed below using #BenghaziCommittee. Scroll past the feed for background on the committee and the swirl of politics surrounding the hearing. \nThe hearing will be re-aired on more widely accessible channels: \n• Thursday, 5 p.m. Pacific time, on C-SPAN 2 (Xfinity Channel 25, Dish Network Channel 211, DIRECTV Channel 351). \n• Saturday, 9 a.m. Pacific time, on C-SPAN (Xfinity Channel 24, Dish Network Channel 210, DIRECTV Channel 350). #BenghaziCommittee Tweets \nClinton's appearance before the House committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya -- in which Islamist militants killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens -- has been widely anticipated. \nClinton was secretary of state at the time of the attacks, and questions have zeroed in on whether her department failed to provide appropriate security for the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi amid the turmoil that followed the assassination of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. \nInvestigators have also focused on Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state, raising questions about whether all Benghazi-related emails have been disclosed. \nThe investigation has reverberated through the political sphere. \nClinton has repeatedly apologized for the \"mistake\" of using a private email server . The topic came up at last week's Democratic presidential debate , with rival candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., declaring that Americans are \"sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.\" \nThe Benghazi committee's work also played a role in House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's decision this month to withdraw from the race to replace John Boehner as House speaker. \nMcCarthy, R-Calif., was heavily criticized in the days leading up to his withdrawal for suggesting that the committee was designed not to dispassionately collect facts but to hurt Clinton's campaign. \nThe panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C. , has been on the defensive amid additional accusations that the committee's work is politically motivated. \nClinton, for her part, has testified on Benghazi before, defiantly defending her department in hours-long appearances before House and Senate panels in 2013 when she was secretary of state. \nThe political stakes are higher now, with Clinton leading in polls for the Democratic nomination for president. She also faces a clearer field in light of Vice President Joe Biden's announcement Wednesday that he won't run. \n-- Michelle Brence", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:06:29.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
