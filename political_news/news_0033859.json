Clinton is expected to say that as President she would take executive action to tighten the “gun show loophole,” as well as a loophole on Internet gun sales, which allow buyers to purchase guns without background checks from unlicensed dealers.\nShe will say that anyone who sells “a significant number” of guns should be deemed “in the business,” an official classification that requires sellers to conduct background checks, keep paper records of sales and allow periodic inspections by law officers. Private sellers are not currently required to have a license or comply with other regulations.\nShe will also call on Congress to close the “Charleston Loophole,” which allowed the Charleston shooter to purchase a gun without a completed background check. Despite possessing a federal criminal record, Dylann Roof was able to purchase a gun because a sale in South Carolina is allowed proceed if the background check is not completed within 72 hours. More than 2,500 prohibited gun purchasers were able to buy a gun in 2014 because of the loophole, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\nClinton is not the first Democrat to propose closing the “default to proceed” loophole. Connecticut Sens. Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy announced Friday they were sponsoring legislation to do the same thing. Some states already have a ban in place, but there is no federal law requiring it. Last week in an interview, Clinton said she supported “universal background checks, a long-enough waiting period so that people can’t sneak in under the deadline because the full investigation wasn’t completed.”\nShe will also call for repealing the controversial “Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act,” which prevents the manufacturers and dealers of firearms from being held liable for crimes committed with their weapons by victims or their families. As Senator, Clinton voted against the Bush-era law in 2005 and is expected to say she would repeal it as President.\nLast, she will speak in support of legislation prohibiting domestic abusers and stalkers from buying and possessing guns.\nClinton’s campaign has been in conversation with Everytown for Gun Safety, a group that advocates to prevent gun violence, as it has drafted its gun control policies, and even hired at least one former intern from the group to work on the campaign.\nGun control is also a fertile political territory for Clinton as she gets ready to confront her main opponent in the Democratic primary, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in the first Democratic presidential debate next week. As Senator, Sanders voted against the Brady Bill in 1993, which established mandatory background checks on gun sales, and voted for the 2005 law that gave protection to firearm manufacturers from lawsuits filed by victims and their families.\nLast week after the Oregon shooting, Sanders said in an appearance on MSNBC that he supports banning assault weapons and closing the “gun show loophole” as well.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:21:58.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
