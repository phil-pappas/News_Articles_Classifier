Any emitter that wants to exceed those levels must find an offsetting source. \n\"We know that this regulation could have been worse, but it still feels like a punch in the gut,\" said NAM's Tom Riordan. \"Now manufacturers across this country, especially smaller companies, will be forced to choose between navigating this rule and hiring new workers, between complying with Washington's mandates and giving raises to their employees.\" Tougher ozone rules stir supporters, critics \nEnvironmental groups and health advocates said limits should have been lowered further. \n\"When you have ridden in an ambulance with a child suffering through an asthma attack, the numbers take on a different meaning,\" Jessica Ulery, a mother and grandmother from Royal Center, said in a release put out by the Sierra Club. \"I have witnessed this family having to plan trips within our state around air quality. We have a moral obligation to protect our children and all vulnerable to the hazardous effects of smog pollution.\" \nOzone has been linked to premature deaths from respiratory and cardiovascular problems and can cause or aggravate asthma and other lung diseases. \nGround-level ozone forms when sunlight interacts with pollutants from tailpipes, power plants, factories and other sources. \nThe EPA is required by the Clean Air Act to review ozone standards every five years. It also must set rules based on health standards, not compliance costs. \nThe agency's independent scientific advisory panel had recommended the level be set within a range of 60 to 70 parts per billion. \nThe Obama administration chose 70 parts per billion, a tightening of the 75 parts-per-billion rule set in 2008. \nMcCarthy said 72 parts per billion is the lowest exposure that causes problems for healthy adults, and the law requires a margin of safety, including for at-risk groups. EPA's new power plant rules tougher on Indiana \nFourteen Indiana counties had ozone levels above 70 parts per billion in 2011 through 2013, the most recent three-year average figures available. Marion County's level was 74 parts per billion and is projected to fall to 60 parts per billion by 2025. \nMcCarthy said the EPA most likely would apply the new rules in 2017, based on three-year average figures from 2014 through 2016. The length of time counties will have to comply will depend on \"where you are now and how healthy your air is.\" The years that counties could be designated as not meeting the standards likely will range from 2020 to 2037, she said. \n\"While the days are gone when cities like Los Angeles were so smoggy people had trouble seeing across the street, science tells us that ozone is still making people sick and we still have a lot of work to do,\" she said. \nGov. Mike Pence had urged the EPA not to tighten the pollution limit. Pence encourages states to fight greenhouse gas rules \nManufacturers and other business groups also lobbied heavily against the change. Indiana was among the states targeted in NAM's multimillion-dollar ad campaign. \nSen. Dan Coats, R-Ind., is backing legislation that would block new standards until most areas meet current limits. \n\"States and counties across the nation are still working to meet the current standard, and the administration should focus on helping states and communities achieve these existing standards before changing the rules,\" Coats said in a statement. \nAlthough opponents hope the GOP-controlled Congress can stop the new rules, Republicans don't have enough seats to override a veto by President Barack Obama. \nEmail Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.
