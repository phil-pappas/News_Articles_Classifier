So the party has not yet settled on a running mate,' the president added. \nThere have been widespread rumours of a deep-seated rift between the president and his vice and reports claim the relationship is so bad that the latter once contemplated resigning and leaving the Flagstaff House in protest. \nPresident Mahama strongly denied having a frosty relationship with his vice and indicated that his relationship with the vice president has been perfect, describing the rumours as 'absolutely false'. \nOn Thursday, September 3, 2015 when Vice President Amissah-Arthur picked the NDC presidential nomination forms at the party's headquarters at Adabraka in Accra on behalf of the president, many were those who thought that the move was an indication that the president had retained the vice as his running mate for 2016. \nHowever, speaking on Sekondi-based Twin-City Radio , President Mahama told listeners that the NDC had not yet settled on any one as the running mate for the 2016 elections. \nMahama pointed out that he could not reveal his running mate when he was not yet a candidate. \nHe stated: 'the party has procedures for choosing a running mate and that will be done after my endorsement. So I am moving from region to region to appeal to party supporters for their massive endorsementâ€¦' \n'I have to be endorsed first then I can announce who my running mate should be. There is a procedure for naming a running mate in the party,' he added. \nThe president was optimistic he would have a one-touch victory in his bid to retain power in 2016. \nHe indicated: 'I'm confident that God is on our side. The NDC will go to the polls on November 7 and come out stronger.' \nPresident Mahama was in the Western Region for a two-day visit during which he inaugurated one of the government's 200 community day senior high schools at Bamiankor in the Nzema East municipality. \nHe also met with the executives of the NDC in the region at the various levels to seek their massive endorsement in the November 7 presidential primaries. \nFrom Emmanuel Opoku, Takoradi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:04:48.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
