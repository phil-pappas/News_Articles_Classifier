We also believe it is the wrong priority for Council to spend its stretched budget on the unpopular demolition plan\", says Roskill Community Voice member of the Puketapapa Local Board Michael Wood. \n\"Multiple industry sources have indicated that demolition of the twenty five units could cost up to one million dollars, based on broad standard costings. Any plans to develop the space as parkland over and above grass would require additional funding\" \n\"We all know that Council budgets are under enormous pressure. Why would such a large sum be spent on a project that removes desperately needed social housing for Seniors when there are other pressing needs in our city? This is not a project that the local community wants\" \n\"The plan to demolish Liston was agreed by the old Auckland City Council just before it was amalgamated. Our campaign will call on the new Auckland Council to re-visit that decision. We believe that a strong community campaign can convince Council to move away from the wasteful demolition plan it has inherited\" \n\"The campaign to save the village will be formally launched at a public meeting on Sunday 11 October from 2pm at the Fickling Centre, Three Kings. Phil Goff MP, Councillor Cathy Casey, Local Board member Michael Wood, and Anne-Marie Coury from Grey Power will all be speaking in support of the campaign. All are welcome\", says Michael Wood. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:14:37.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
