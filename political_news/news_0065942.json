Just hours later, a Downstate pro-gun group promised to exploit the program by driving up to Chicago with their oldest, cheapest and most worthless guns and turning them in for gift cards. The group, Guns Save Life, did the same thing during a 2012 gun buyback program.\nThe group’s indifference to the suffering in gun-plagued Chicago neighborhoods is stunning.\nEDITORIAL\nFollow @csteditorials\nUnder a gun buyback program, police buy guns from people who bring them in, no questions asked. The hope is that a gun that otherwise might be used in a future crime is taken out of circulation.\nUnlike other measures designed to reduce gun violence, buyback programs ask nothing of gun owners who choose not to participate. No one has to fill out a form. No one’s name goes on a registry. No one has to wait an extra day to buy a gun.\nBut apparently even this modest stab at gun sanity goes too far for the gun lobby, so the folks from Guns Save Life hope to make a joke of it. They will turn in their guns for gift certificates, leaving the Chicago Police with fewer gift certificates to give out for more dangerous guns — the ones that might, more conceivably, be used in a crime.\nVoluntary gun buyback programs, such as Chicago’s, have been criticized as ineffective. The police tend to recover old, malfunctioning firearms or weapons from people who didn’t want them and were unlikely ever to use them. And the number of guns collected is just a drop in the bucket compared with the numbers of guns out there. A handful of studies have not found a direct correlation between gun buyback programs and reduced rates of gun crimes.\nThere is, nonetheless, great value in such programs. They are part of a larger effort to reset society’s thinking about guns, to spread the message that we are awash in guns — so many of them illegal — and we must do more to combat gun violence. If buyback programs also directly reduce the number of gun crimes, so much the better.\nThe more pro-gun groups balk at even the most modest gun control efforts, the more their credibility shrinks in this crucial national debate.\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: Follow @csteditorials\nTweets by @CSTeditorials", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/csteditorials", "https://twitter.com/CSTeditorials"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:07:41.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
