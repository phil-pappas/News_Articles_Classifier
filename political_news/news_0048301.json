To her own \"blackness,\" she says, but also to humanity as a whole.\n\"When the human family becomes more important than just myself and my needs, nothing can get in the way of building relationships,\" she told The Associated Press in Mecca. \"It doesn't matter if we have different faiths, different races, different nationalities, I can find something in common with you.\"\nFor American black Muslims, this year brought a significant landmark, the 50th anniversary of Malcolm X's death. A year before his assassination, Malcolm X underwent a transformative experience on the hajj, seeing the potential for racial co-existence after witnessing, as he wrote, pilgrims \"of all colors displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe could never exist between a white and a non-white.\"\nThis year's hajj, which ended Saturday, came at a time when the debate over race in the United States is at its most heated in decades, with the Black Lives Matters movement arising after the deaths of a number of black men at the hands of police were captured on camera and seen widely by the public.\nThe AP spoke with a number of African-Americans about their hajj experience. For Muslims, the pilgrimage is not just a duty, it's a moment to reflect on oneself and on community. It's an intensely personal experience. In Islam, each pilgrim presents him or herself directly to God, seeking forgiveness of sin, while performing rituals that include circling the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure in Mecca. At the same time, it's communal: more than 2 million pilgrims performing the same rites, underscoring unity and equality.\nThe scale is exhausting. The population of a city packs into tents, walks simultaneously from site to site in the desert in broiling heat for five days. A stampede this year that killed at least 769 pilgrims underscored the dangers of the crowds.\nFor the African-Americans who spoke to the AP, all those factors weighed on how hajj affected their faith and their sense of community back home in America.\n___\nSharif draws inspiration from Hagar, the wife of the prophet Ibrahim — Abraham, as he's known in the Bible. In Islamic tradition, Hagar and her son Ismail — the Bible's Ishmael — were left in the desert at what is now Mecca, and Hagar ran through the hills searching for water for her thirsty child until God opened the spring of Zamzam. Pilgrims re-create her search in a hajj rite.\nFor Sharif, the mother of two young children, it's a lesson in sacrifice. \"Who am I in this scheme of history that I can't make a sacrifice for the greater good, in particular for our community?\" she said. The hajj helps make her a better American, she said, by instilling her with compassion.\nThe 38-year-old Sharif and her husband, Suleimaan Hamed, run Hajj Pros, a company based in Atlanta, Georgia, organizing hajj trips. This year they came with more than 30 African-Americans. Her parents were members of the Nation of Islam, but like Malcolm X, they moved to more mainstream Sunni Islam. Still, she says current activists can learn from the Nation of Islam of the 1960s.\n\"We need to remove the idea of seeking permission from someone to give us what's inherently ours,\" she said. \"No one needs to validate who we are. We know who we are, and we're inherently created by God.\"\n___\n\"Pack your patience, and wear it,\" Sharif's husband Hamed always tells the American pilgrims he guides. Patience is key to dealing with the crowds. Another piece of advice: \"Take off your American glasses.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:36:17.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
