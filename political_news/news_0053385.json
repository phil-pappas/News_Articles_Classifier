WASHINGTON — Vice President Biden will likely announce his decision on whether to run for president in the next 48 hours, according to NBC.\nSources tell the network that Biden is moving fast towards a decision.\nThe potential presidential candidate has blown through self-imposed deadlines before — he’s well past his initial plan to decide by the end of summer — but pressure is mounting from all sides for him to make an ultimate decision, with both supporters and neutral Democrats arguing he needs to pull the trigger if he is to run.\nBiden’s team has been increasingly ramping up towards a possible bid in the last week, suggesting to many that he’s leaning towards a campaign.\nDraft Joe Biden/via YouTube A grab from an advertisment imploring Joe Biden to run for the 2016 presidency aired on the same day the CNN democratic debate.
