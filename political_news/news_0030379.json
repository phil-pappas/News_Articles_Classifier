Negotiations are always preferable to legal action, as E tū members will get a say on whether the Joint Working Group’s recommendations are good enough,” Mr Ryall said. \n“We’ve won this all the way through the courts – it’s clear that the law is on our side, and we’re in a good position to win decent pay rises across the sector. \n“This is exciting news for our new union and for working women in all industries. \n“Should there not be a favourable outcome from these negotiations, the union will go back to the Employment Court in March,” he said. \nCaregiver and E tū member Marianne Bishop was thrilled with the news. \n“We’ve been in this fight for years, it’s so good to see the government finally willing to come to the table,” Ms Bishop said. \n“We do important work helping other people, for a pittance. It’s not fair. Now we know we can get fair pay for our work,” she said. \nENDS E tu \nE tū: the new union for New Zealanders \nE tū has been created by the merger of the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union and Service and Food Workers' Union.
