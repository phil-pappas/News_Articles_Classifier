Darren Soto pulling early money from Winter Park, downtown Orlando, Tallahassee and South Florida, and Dr. Dena Minning hunting out of state for donations. \nIn the hunt for early money to define early contenders, those three, who all joined the race in July, have quickly left behind two other Democrats who had filed earlier, Valleri Crabtree and Ricardo Rangel, as well as Republican Wayne Liebnitzki, according to campaign finance details posted by the Federal Election Commission, covering activity through Sept. 30. \nThe district, which covers much of central, south and east Orlando and Orange County, all of Osceola County and a corner of Polk County, has become one of the hottest-watched in Florida, particularly from the Democratic side. That’s because incumbent U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, is not seeking re-election, and the district is heavy with Democratic voters. \nAt quarter’s end, Soto reported having $147,000 in the bank, Randolph $143,000, and Minning, the latest starter, $77,000. Rangel, a former state representative, had $3,000, and businessman Liebnitzki and college instructor Crabtree each had $1,000. \nAnother candidate, Republican Kissimmee Commissioner Wanda Rentas, has filed federal paperwork making her eligible to run in District 9. Yet she has not announced a candidacy and had not raised any money by the end of the latest campaign finance reporting period. \nMinning, a biochemist who is Grayson’s significant other, put together the most unusual early campaign fund in the race, as she raised $86,000 and spent a little more than $8,000. \nShe and Grayson each donated $5,400 to her campaign. Aside from that, little identifiable cash came from Florida. Two of every three dollars she raised came from California, Massachusetts, Washington D.C., New York or Missouri. At least $64,000 overall came from out-of-state. (Federal reports do not identify all donors.) \nSoto, who raised $184,000 and spent $37,000 (including $8,900 in improper corporate donations that he gave back,) drew more than $31,000 from neighborhoods in and around downtown Orlando, and about $12,500 from Winter Park and Maitland, which are not in the district. He also raised at least $8,000 from out of state, principally California and Maryland. \nRandolph, who raised $170,000 and spent $27,000, received more than $34,000 in neighborhoods in and around downtown Orlando, and another $20,000 from Winter Park. She raised at least $20,000 from out-of-state, principally California and Massachusetts. \nBoth Soto and Randolph also raised tens of thousands more dollars in South Florida and Tallahassee, traditional fund-raising areas for any Florida Democratic candidates. \nRangel and Crabtree focused more on Osceola County, where they each live, but their efforts were modest. Rangel raised $19,000 and spent $16,000. Crabtree raised $23,000, including $10,000 she donated herself, and spent $22,000. \nLiebnitzki started with $3,000 of his own money, and spent $2,000 of it. \nSoto, Randolph and Rangel also benefited some from early political action committee money. \nSoto’s PAC money is mainly a mix of Tallahassee-based and national interests. The national Latino Victory Fund and a national painters’ union each donated $5,000 to him, while the Florida Fruit & Vegetable Association and the Florida Citrus Mutual PACs each donated $1,000 to $2,000. \nRandolph got $5,000 from a national journeyman labor union and smaller donations from two national progressive politics groups that endorsed her in September. \nThe Wawa PAC gave $2,000 to Rangel’s campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:24:24.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
