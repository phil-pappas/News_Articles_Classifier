(Vision courtesy ABC News 24)\nPT2M42S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Tony Abbott's new take on coup warning I would have been re-elected: Abbott Comment: Interview shows exactly why Abbott is no longer PM Are you OK, inquired Ray Hadley?\n\"Yes, I am Ray, and thank you for your concern,\" responded Tony Abbott.\nTony Abbott's interview with Sydney radio's Ray Hadley was clearly so therapeutic it might have taken place on a couch.\nHe was about to get even better.\nAdvertisement It's like that, in therapy.\nAbbott's interview with Sydney radio's Hadley - a shouter, often, but in this case, a soother - was clearly so therapeutic it might have taken place on a couch.\nAbbott was ready to advise that none of his policies have been changed under the Malcolm Turnbull-led government.\nAbbott's face shed all the grimness of recent dreadful days and assumed something teetering on hysterical delight as Hadley played a recording of Malcolm Turnbull offering a world of understanding and a mountain of pity to Kevin Rudd in the dire days after he was cast into the darkness by the Labor Party in 2010.\n\"It was one of the cruelest moments I've ever witnessed,\" came Turnbull's voice from all those years ago.\n\"The betrayal of you as leader of your party was one of the most shocking events I've ever witnessed and I would thinkâ€¦.any of us have ever witnessed in politics.\"\nAbbott's lips quivered on the very edge of something between a triumphant grin and a serene smirk.\n\"The scale of it, the idea that the man that had won in this presidential campaign an election against John Howard was then going to be disposed of, discarded, like another course on a Lazy Susan in a Vietnamese restaurant,\" came Turnbull's disembodied voice. \"The cruelty of it was extraordinary.\"\nIt was as if Abbott's psychic pain at his own turn on the Lazy Susan had taken to flight.\n\"Well Ray,\" said the former prime minister, straight-faced now, \"I think Malcolm obviously points to a real problem and that is the revolving door prime ministership.\"\nWhy, Australia's habit of discarding prime ministers had become worse than Italy and just better than Greece, he said - quite forgetting for a moment his enthusiasm for the going of Rudd, of Gillard, and of Rudd again.\nThey, of course, were from the Labor Party.\n\"It's very important that Liberal members of Parliament stick with the leader,\" said Abbott.\n\"Sure there'll be difficult times, sure there'll be ups and downs, but people of character and steadiness don't panic at the polls; they stick with good policy.\n\"And the interesting thing is that no policy has changed since the change of PM.\"\nBy now, either the therapy or the happy pills or both were kicking in, and Abbott was ready to advise those he clearly felt had no character at all just what they had done.\nBorder protection policy, same-sex marriage policy, climate change, national security. All the same as his. Why, nothing had changed.\nThe vindicated Abbott was on his personal cloud nine, deaf to the shrieks of gladness issuing from Labor Party election campaign headquarters.\n\"And if you listen to the PM and the Treasurer, they're even using exactly the same phrases that Joe Hockey and I were using just a fortnight ago,\" added Abbott helpfully.\n\"Slogans, you mean?\" inquired Hadley.\n\"I think they're resonant phrases,\" Abbott countered airily.\nThis being therapy, he wasn't required to ponder the matter of why his resonant phrases had left his party in such an extended slump of depression that a solid majority of his colleagues had stampeded, apparently suffering infectious lack of character.\nHe later advanced the interesting proposition that if people were to judge anything by the polls, he had always been unpopular, but it had never mattered much because \"it didn't stop us winning - I mean, effectively we won the 2010 election, but we lost the negotiation [and] then, of course, in 2013, it was a very, very emphatic thumping victory.\"\nAbbott's therapy was going well.\nHe was OK for a politician who had lost everything, and thanks, Ray, for asking.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-09-29T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:14:23.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
