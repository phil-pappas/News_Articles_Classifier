Meanwhile, two others are in their final terms in office and several political newcomers have declared they will run for their seats. \nHere is a quick rundown of next year's local races for state office: \nDistrict 131 \nRep. Sonya Anderson, R-Springfield, has held the 131 District, which covers the northern edge of Springfield and nearby rural areas, for two terms. \nShe will likely face a primary election challenge from political newcomer John Seroka. A retired truck driver, Seroka said he’s not been impressed with Anderson and that he would like to cut taxes and that he opposes big government. \nAnderson said she would point voters to her record, especially her support for agricultural issues. \nSeroka’s campaign committee entry on the Missouri Ethics Commission website lists him as an Independent, which would mean he would face Anderson in next year’s Nov. 8 general election. However, Seroka said he plans to change his affiliation to Republican and that would mean he would face off against Anderson in next year’s Aug. 2 primary election. \nDistrict 132 \nRep. Charlie Norr, D-Springfield, will finish his fourth term in office in 2016. As of Sunday, two candidates, a Republican and a Democrat, had declared interest in running for the 132 District, which covers parts of north Springfield. \nThe Democrat, Crystal Quade, 30, is the director of chapter services at Care To Learn, an organization that works to help impoverished students. She is also a protege of Norr's, having served as a legislative intern for him while studying at Missouri State University. Quade said she understands serving the Republican-controlled legislature as a Democrat would be an uphill battle. But Quade said she has good practice having grown up in a conservative family. \nThe Republican candidate for this seat is Tyler Hobbs, 28, a political science student at MSU who served overseas in Iraq and the Republic of Georgia as part of his ongoing nine-year stint with the U.S. Army reserves. \n\"I feel like we need strong leaders in Jefferson City right now. With my training and experiences I feel like I could be that strong leader for this district,\" Hobbs said. \nDistrict 133 \nLike Norr, four-term Republican incumbent Rep. Eric Burlison will be termed out after 2016. \nIn his place, three Republican candidates have declared they will run, according to committee reports with the Missouri Ethics Commission. \nDavid Cort, executive director of the Missouri Grassroots Coalition, is among those running. He said conservatives have made strides in the statehouse lately and he would like to help that trend continue. \n\"We've gained some good ground in the legislature for our side and Eric Burlison has been a very good representative for us and it's important that we just hold the ground we've gained as well as gain new ground,\" said Cort. \nOne of his opponents is Curtis Trent, an attorney at the Parmele Law Firm, and formerly the deputy chief of staff for U.S. Rep. Billy Long, R-Springfield. Trent said that his experience in Washington D.C. would serve him well in Jefferson City. Trent also said improving education in the state would be a major focus for him. \nThe third candidate is Mathew Sims, an attorney who owns a law firm in town with his wife, specializing in personal injury, family law and grandparents' rights. \nSims, a self-described \"typical conservative\" who served in the Air Force, said he believes he could give back to the community by serving in office, like he did when he was in the service. Sims is also on the management team for the local Rock'n Ribs BBQ Festival. \nDistrict 140 \nChristian County Democrat Jim Billedo, who challenged District 140 incumbent Lynn Morris two years ago said he is again considering a run but hasn't made up his mind. Morris said if Billedo doesn't run against him another Democrat likely will and that he will be seen campaigning in the community regardless of whether someone challenges him. \nMeanwhile, Rep. Kevin Austin, R-Springfield, of District 136, will be challenged by Jeff Munzinger, a Democrat and local businessman known for his support of gay rights in Springfield. \nLocal Republican representatives Lincoln Hough , Elijah Haahr , Lyndall Fraker and Jeffery Messenger are up for reelection next year — representatives serve two-year terms — but as of Sunday did not have opponents who submitted committee information with the Missouri Ethics Commission. 5 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1LpMYEx TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:48:27.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
