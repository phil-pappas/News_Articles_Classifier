We believe Neighbourly will help us achieve that. \n\"Neighbourly will provide a channel for residents to ask questions about council services or activities and to raise concerns. Council staff can then respond directly, or pass the matter to councillors or community board members for their consideration and action. \n\"Council can also pass on information about proposed policy changes and other public consultation processes. We are about to launch a review of the Far North District Plan and we will be using Neighbourly to inform residents and ratepayers about what the review is all about. The public will be able to ask questions and put forward submissions.\" \nMs McInnes says Neighbourly will assist in getting out news and advice in emergencies. \"The July 2014 storms showed the importance of getting out accurate information and advice speedily to affected communities about the extent of the threat, and services that are available to assist them.\" \nFocus Paihia treasurer Sarah Greener says her group, which is about community engagement and action, was delighted to accept the Council’s invitation to organise the launch event. \"Neighbourly is really complementary for us. We can use it communicate with everyone. The event will enable people to meet their neighbours. And that is what Neighbourly is all about.\" \nNeighbourly fosters interaction and conversation between neighbours and community organisations by creating an easy way for them to talk and share online through free and private websites for their suburbs. Members use the site to exchange recommendations on local services, ask questions and share advice, find employment, plan events, discuss local issues and get to know one another. \nNeighbourly community partnerships manager Maureen Glassey says Far North District Council is joining hundreds of organisations across New Zealand in using Neighbourly.co.nz as a free communications channel to connect with their local communities. \n\"We’re really thrilled to have another passionate Council on board,\" says Ms Glassey. \"Through their commitment to using Neighbourly and by encouraging local residents to do the same, the site will develop into a truly useful platform for both members and organisations. We’re looking forward to working closely with the Far North District Council to help grow a stronger, safer and friendlier Far North.\" \nInterested residents are invited to attend Ms Glassey’s presentation on how Neighbourly works at Our Place/ Horotutu on the Paihia Waterfront at 4pm on Friday 23 October. \nThat will be followed by a community celebration from 5pm to 7pm. It will include live music and a bubble machine and face painting. Families are invited to bring a plate and share. \nFor more information on Neighbourly visit www.neighbourly.co.nz. \nInterested community organisations should visit www.neighbourly.co.nz/community \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:04:32.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
