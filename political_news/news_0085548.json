Previously, the Holy See had it “won’t deny” the meeting, but had no further comment. \nThe statement comes a full two days after the news broke about the meeting. During that time, observers speculated it meant the pope’s message of “tolerance and inclusion” wasn’t intended for LGBT people. \nAccording to CBS 2 in Chicago , Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich spoke out for the first time on the meeting on Wednesday in Chicago before leaving for Rome, saying don’t read too much into the exchanged. A highly placed source inside the Vatican claims the Pope was blindsided, CBS 2 reported. \nLiberty Counsel, the social conservative legal firm representing Davis, announced late Tuesday Davis met with the pope last week during his visit to D.C. According to Liberty Counsel, the pope thanked Davis for her courage and gave her and her husband rosaries he personally. Meanwhile, LGBT advocates who were pressing Francis to meet with LGBT Catholics say their request for a meeting was ignored. \nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide, Davis, an Apostolic Christian, instituted a “no licenses” policy in her office, prompting a lawsuits from couples, gay and straight, who sought to wed in Rowan County. Despite multiple court orders, Davis continued to refuse marriage licenses, prompting U.S. District Judge David Bunning to find her in contempt of court and jail her for five days. A deputy clerk in Rowan Clerk is now issuing licenses in Davis’ stead. \nChad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said he was glad to hear the Vatican statement on the pope’s meeting and called for more inclusion. I'm glad the Vatican doesn't endorse her views and hope we can move toward greater inclusion. http://t.co/IWNPkER3Of", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:04:54.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
