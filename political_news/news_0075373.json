GOP presidential hopefuls Donald Trump and Marco Rubio bring their showbiz connections to the Strip seeking to get voter support, as Nevada becomes the third state in the Union to hold its early Republican caucus voting Feb. 23.\nThe Democratic caucus is three days earlier on Feb. 20. There will be 34 Republican delegates and 33 Democratic delegates who represent precinct-level voters at respective national conventions to select the party nominee.\nThe Nevada caucuses began in 2008, reflecting the growing importance of the West, as well as Nevada’s electoral bellwether status. In 2012, the Nevada caucuses were the third major electoral event in the nominating process for president, although little attention was given to the contest.\nIn 2016, Nevada will gain more prominence by holding its vote after South Carolina, with the hope of giving the West a greater voice in the process.\nThe Donald is up Thursday. He’s expected to fill the 1,500-seat Mystere Theater in his pal Phil Ruffin’s hotel Treasure Island.\nA day later, Marco Rubio and Rick Harrison celebrate the grand opening of the latter’s Pawn Plaza at World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop. Mayor Carolyn Goodman will join them for the 6:30 p.m. ribbon cutting to officially open the first eight stores.\nIn addition to Body Spa Salon, Inna Gadda di Pizza, Pawn Donut & Coffee, Vegas Flip Flops and So-Cal Speed, there are marriage vow renewals by VegasWeddings.com, Rick’s own Rollin’ Smoke BBQ & Tavern and Smoke’s Poutinerie, which we reported here at Vegas DeLuxe on April 26. \nI’m not expecting the young Florida senator to be alongside Rick when he showcases his bartending skills at BBQ Tavern for two hours after the opening party, but we will see how the patriarch of the History Channel’s top-rated “Pawn Stars” does with margaritas, mojitos and martinis!\nCheck back for reports and photos.\nRobin Leach of “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous” fame has been a journalist for more than 50 years and has spent the past 15 years giving readers the inside scoop on Las Vegas, the world’s premier platinum playground. \nFollow Robin Leach on Twitter at Twitter.com/Robin_Leach . \nFollow Las Vegas Sun Entertainment + Luxury Senior Editor Don Chareunsy on Twitter at Twitter.com/VDLXEditorDon . \nThe Strip Las Vegas Boulevard Las Vegas , NV 89109 Treasure Island Hotel and Casino Treasure Island, now known as TI to many, is a Strip casino and resort that features a tropical pool, a variety of restaurants and Las Vegas' first resident Cirque du Soleil show. \nBefore even entering the casino, Treasure Island treats visitors and Strip passersby with a raucous and free pirate show, \"Sirens at TI,\" each evening in the lagoon in front of the property. \nInside, guests will find a 95,000-square-foot casino with thousands of slot machines, a race and sports book, a poker room and plenty of table games.
