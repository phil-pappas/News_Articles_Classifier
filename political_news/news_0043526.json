Share This Article New property-tax notices are delivering frightening news to some areas during this month ending with Halloween. The scariest, biggest tax hikes statewide are in the Tintic School District, up $153 on a $220,000 home; Wayne County School District, up $91; and in Draper's Traverse Ridge Special Service District, up $79. Meanwhile, the area haunted by the highest overall property taxes — when taxes from the local city, county, school district, water districts and others are combined — is \"Tax Area 13 G,\" a tiny corner of Salt Lake City near Magna, where taxes total $2,269 on a $220,000 home. VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs That is nearly three times higher than the area with the lowest property tax in the state — $790 on a $220,000 home in an unincorporated part of Summit County in the Park City School District. That's according to data provided by the Utah State Tax Commission and analyzed by The Salt Lake Tribune. — Where taxes rose • This year 35 local governments are raising property taxes: 14 school districts, 14 cities, five special service districts, one county and one water district. Last year, 37 governments raised taxes as did 42 in 2013. That was up from 20 in 2012. During the Great Recession, many governments said they tried to hold down taxes. But after the recession, a number of governments said they couldn't hold off any longer in the face of pressing demands. Besides increases already mentioned, other big tax hikes include: Willard, a $69.82 hike on a $220,000 home; Fruit Heights, up $64.98; Tooele School District, up $64.75; Box Elder School District, up $59.53; and Circleville, up $43.80. The biggest increases by percentage are: Willard, up 60.5 percent; Fruit Heights, 29.3 percent; the Moab Valley Fire Protection District, 21.1 percent; and Tintic School District, 19.8 percent. Only about 6 percent of the 600 or so local governments raised taxes this year. Billy Hesterman, vice president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, said that is a bit unusual among states, and credits Utah's truth-in-taxation law. It requires public hearings and notices when a government seeks more property tax revenue than the previous year (not counting any extra that comes from new developments). Those hearings can be wild, with upset taxpayers bringing intense pressure on elected officials. This year, four governments rejected proposed tax hikes after truth-in-taxation hearings: Cache County, the city of Woodland Hills, the Box Elder Mosquito Abatement District and the Richmond Cemetery Maintenance District. Another two lowered, but did not completely drop, proposed tax increases after hearings: the Tintic School District and the city of Elk Ridge. While property taxes generally were held down, Hesterman notes the Legislature passed a $75 million tax hike for schools, a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline taxes and Proposition 1, which, if approved by voters, would increase sales taxes by about $50 a person annually. \"So it's still been a rough year for taxpayers,\" Hesterman said. — Real tax hikes? • Some governments contend that revenue increases defined by state law as tax hikes aren't really tax hikes at all. For example, a former spokesman for Salt Lake City stressed that the capital was keeping the same tax rate as last year in what he called a move to \"stabilize\" revenues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:23:41.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
