So long?\nBy Rachel Brody Oct. 20, 2015 | 6:00 p.m. EDT + More Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb announced Tuesday that he is dropping out of the Democratic primary race. \"I fully accept that my views on many issues are not compatible with the power structure and nominating base of the Democratic Party,\" he said at a National Press Club event. Webb signaled, however, that he may not be entirely out of the 2016 picture; he hinted at an independent run, saying, \"I'm thinking about all my options.\"\n\"He's a perpetual quitter,\" writes Tina Nguyen at Vanity Fair, noting that he left both the Senate and his Navy secretary post after one term in each. \"[H]e entered the 2016 race for unclear reasons, he complained about how little time he got during the last debate, and he's now dropping out – to possibly run as an independent candidate, which is just plain adorable,\" she says.\n[ READ: Jim Webb Drops Democratic Bid for President ]\n\"Most voters won't even realize Webb is gone,\" writes New York magazine's Jaime Fuller. \"A recent poll from CNN showed that 56 percent of Americans had never heard of him.\"\n\"He wasn't a traditional politician, having only ever run for office once,\" argues Andrew Prokop at Vox, \"and it showed.\" Yes, Webb made it onto the debate stage, acknowledges Prokop, but he didn't do himself any favors while there, spending most of his speaking time complaining about how little speaking time he got. And running as an independent will be much more challenging, says Prokop. \"To mount a national run, Webb would somehow have to qualify for the ballot in 50 states – an expensive and difficult process,\" he writes. But his time on the national political stage so far, he notes, doesn't \"inspire confidence.\"\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the 2016 Presidential Elections ]\nStill, Ed Kilgore concedes that Webb's independent bid wouldn't be totally out of left field, so to speak. \"Webb is the self-proclaimed tribune of the white working class folk who have been alienated in significant numbers from Democrats in recent years, and who are now rebelling against the elitist economic policies of Republicans via Donald Trump's candidacy,\" he writes. Then again, he says, independent runs are expensive, and Webb likely doesn't have the backing for one.\nSo Webb would be a long shot as an independent, but he might still affect the 2016 election, says Ron Chusid at Liberal Values. \"If Webb is to have any impact as an independent candidate, most likely it would be to affect the outcome in close states,\" he writes. \"The best case scenario is that, if Virginia is close, he takes more support from the Republican candidate and enables the Democrats to win the state.\"\nTAGS: Democratic Party Webb, Jim 2016 presidential election", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedzpd%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Jim%20Webb%20Drops%20Out%20of%20Democratic%20Primary%20Race%2C%20Pundits%20React&summary=What%20everyone%27s%20saying%20about%20Jim%20Webb%27s%20withdrawal%20from%20the%20Democratic%20primary%20race.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://liberalvaluesblog.com/2015/10/20/webb-dropping-out-and-considering-futile-independent-bid/", "http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2015_10/jim_webb_to_go_indie058210.php", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedzpd%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedzpd%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Jim%20Webb%20Drops%20Out%20of%20Democratic%20Primary%20Race%2C%20Pundits%20React", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/20/politics/jim-webb-2016-election-drops-out/", "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/10/jim-webb-drops-out-democrat-presidential-race", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedzpd%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/jim-webb-dropping-out.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedzpd%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.vox.com/2015/10/20/9574013/jim-webb-quits-presidential", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedzpd%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Jim%20Webb%20Drops%20Out%20of%20Democratic%20Primary%20Race%2C%20Pundits%20React"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:11:49.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
