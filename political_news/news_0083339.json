Bernie Sanders. \"Now, I'm a little different from those who say free college for everybody. I am not in favor of making college free for Donald Trump's kids. I am in favor of making college free for your grandson by having no debt tuition,\" Clinton told an undecided 71-year-old voter identified as Candy during the event, broadcast live Monday on NBC's \"Today.\"\nOf Trump's five children, two (Donald Jr. and Ivanka) have graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, and one from Georgetown University (Eric). Trump's daughter Tiffany currently attends UPenn as well. Barron, his youngest son, is almost a decade away from college, at 9 years old.\nSanders has introduced legislation that would make tuition free at four-year public colleges and universities through a combination of federal and state funding. (All of Trump's children have attended or are attending private institutions.)\n\"And then I do think, because I worked while I went to college. I went to law school, I had a job. I also had loans when I went to law school. I think if you are then having to figure out how to pay for your living expenses if you're eligible for a Pell grant, they should be able to be applied to your living expenses,\" she explained, running through her campaign's \"New College Compact\" plan, unveiled in August. It would cost $350 million over 10 years, according to the campaign.\n\"I think everyone who goes to a public college or a university should be able to do that without having to borrow a penny to pay tuition,\" Clinton said.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:26:50.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
