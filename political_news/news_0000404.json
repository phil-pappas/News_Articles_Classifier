Holloway to become schools lobbyist By - Associated Press - Friday, October 23, 2015 \nKING, N.C. (AP) - A veteran North Carolina House member who recently served as one of the chamber’s chief budget writers is leaving the job to become a lobbyist for local school boards. \nRep. Bryan Holloway announced Friday his immediate resignation from his legislative seat, which he had held since 2005. He said he would become the associate director of governmental relations at the North Carolina School Boards Association. He starts at the new position Monday. \nThe 38-year-old Republican represented Stokes County and part of Rockingham County in the 91st House District. District GOP officials will choose someone to serve out the remainder of Holloway’s two-year term. \nThe Friday resignation means Holloway can begin lobbying his former colleagues when the General Assembly reconvenes April 25. A six-month cooling-off period is required. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:05:19.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
