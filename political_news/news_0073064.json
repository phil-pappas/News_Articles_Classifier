Jensen and Eileen T. Rowin, a former mayor, voted to formulate an opinion. Schwager, who also sits on the board, abstained. \nThe ordinance, which was introduced on Aug. 26, was formulated in response to a 178-mile pipeline system that has been proposed by Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings LLC. The dual pipeline system would extend from Albany to Linden, transporting Bakken crude oil through part of the Highlands region, including Oakland and Mahwah, to a refinery in Linden and return the refined product to Albany. \nThe borough passed a resolution to \"formally object and oppose\" the project in October, but the more recent regulation would classify the pipeline as a \"prohibited use.\" \nJensen asked that the record of discussion at the council’s meeting include the Planning Board’s vote. Pignatelli, a Republican who is vying against Schwager, a Democrat, asked Schwager the reason for her abstention. \n\"This council wanted an objective opinion from the Planning Board,\" said Schwager. \"It was my opinion, and I said so at the Planning Board meeting, that I felt uncomfortable voting because you wanted an objective opinion from the Planning Board members as to whether or not this issue should come before the council as an endorsement. That is why I abstained.\"\nAt the following Oct. 8 Planning Board meeting, during a discussion to approve the minutes of the Sept. 10 meeting, Jensen said he perceived a discrepancy between the council discussion and his recollection of the Planning Board discussion\n\"I’m going to actually ask that we have the exact transcript,\" Jensen told the Planning Board. \"I find the conversation listed here different from the conversation I recall in that the mayor actually never explained that it was about unregulated pipelines…I just want to be sure it’s accurately reflected, that’s all.\"\nA majority of the board voted to table approval of the Sept. 10 minutes until Nov. 12. Board member Lee Haymon abstained.\nE-mail: torrejon@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:52:02.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
