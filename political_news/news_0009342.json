The set and the candidates were too blue.\nBy James Warren Oct. 14, 2015 | 2:45 p.m. EDT + More Charles Newell, artistic director of the Court Theater in Chicago, is directing a world premiere translation of Aeschylus' \"Agamemnon,\" replete with themes of blood revenge, cycles of violence and primal human behavior.\nThat's a bit more rancorous than Tuesday's Trump-free, Hillary Clinton-centric Democratic debate that he watched. And why wouldn't he check it out? It was, after all, a piece of pretty rehearsed political theater suited to the critical eyes of Newell and other creative professionals.\nCast aside the mountain of instant wisdom of professional political analysts – mostly that Clinton cleaned up in what even Hillary-averse Fox News claimed to be her winning effort---what were artistic pros to think?\n\"It changed as the evening wore on,\" Newell says. At first he found it akin to a yelling context, with parents shouting at their kids and \"dopey uncles standing around.\" But later, it struck him as akin to a bad community theater production of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"\n\"It felt overly pushed and everyone trying to vocally top one another without a whole lot of authenticity.\"\nHe was not inspired. Nobody connected with him emotionally. If a professional reviewer, he would have concluded, \"A lot of sound and fury but not much heart.\"\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Hillary Clinton ]\nThe most intriguing actor? Unlike the echo chamber of political reporters and pundits, he found it to be Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Maybe it's because Newell is immersed in Aeschylus, but he sees a bit of Cassandra in him, namely \"somebody speaking the truth but nobody wants to believe it. He hammers away out of desperation but the harder he hammers, the farther we want to move away from him.\"\nScott Turow, the renowned lawyer-author, thought, \"The story remains Bernie Sanders. How a guy who looks and sounds like an elderly character on 'The Goldbergs' can be getting so much traction remains amazing, especially when you realize that much of his appeal lies in his freedom to say what he actually thinks, since even he knows he can never get elected.\"\nTurow found Sanders and Clinton speaking two different political languages. She was solid, he says, and got a boost from Sanders on her email mess. But Sanders, \"this white haired old guy, even whose age would be an issue against him, is just a beguiling phenomenon. He's like your elderly uncle who talks over everybody at Thanksgiving but at least he has something to say.\"\nHarvey Young, a dramatist and a theater and African American studies scholar at Northwestern University, says, \"This was not '12 Angry Men,'\" meaning there was no single personality who stood out by \"persuading everyone to think differently.\"\nThere were moments of fleeting, feverish intensity as candidates raised their hands to speak and a hopeless Jim Webb pleaded from the side for attention. Young might grade it a \"B\" despite CNN's \"manufactured drama\" which was instantly undercut by the candidates' drab entrances and attire. This was not Sylvester (\"Rocky\") Stallone versus Dolph Lundgren, he says.\nAs for individual performances, Clinton is a celebrity and, regardless of what you think of her, \"there's a thrill in seeing her.\" She commanded the stage, he says, as if a cohost. Sanders relayed his frustrations with the status quo but lacked the \"optimistic, happy, hopeful\" air that general election audiences tend to prefer.\nLincoln Chafee was artificial, even unnerving with his forced smile, says Young. Webb was stiff and grumbling and his complaints about speaking time diminished his presence. O'Malley was better, a good performer \"who knows how to play sincere, projecting a calming and slightly quivering voice.\"\nJon Maas, a Hollywood producer-writer, would have subtitled the debate, \"Waiting for Jodot,\" given the media and Twittersphere's \"waiting in vain for the arrival of someone not ready to run.\" You know, right, that Joe guy who now works at the White House?\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the 2016 Presidential Elections ]\nWebb, Chafee and O'Malley needed nametags, he thought. Was Hillary likable enough? Yes. But, hey, why was everyone wearing blue and white? \"Did no one have Crayolas growing up? Did no one tell them the eye always goes to red first? The set was so blue, the debaters were literally fading into it.\"\nSanders seemed to have only two volumes, loud and loud, Maas says. Did he realize he had a microphone? \"There's a difference between passion and volume. I get this image of Ethel Merman hearing him and covering her ears and shouting, 'JEEZ-US!'\"\nThe last words are suitably left to a professional theater critic, the Chicago Tribune's British-bred, urbane and prolific Chris Jones.\nSanders' opening salvo was energized and wonkish, a \"Ralph Nader-esque kind of righteous anger – measured, intellectual, forceful but not inaccessible to millennials.\" But his opening statement was more like a closing argument, while Clinton was \"sunny and measured in contrast.\"\nShe raises her eyebrows at certain moments, \"usually when she's being more idealistic.\" She borrows her husband's technique in using her hands to focus attention. \"She has a range of views [hands go out] but they are rooted in 'my values' [hands go in]. Her first job [chop, chop] will be to...\"\nHe thought Sanders won, putting him in sync with Fox News and CNN focus groups of Democrats but putting him, too, at odds with the political journalism class. \"For an old leftie, he has managed to dispense seemingly fresh rhetoric remarkably well.\"\nSanders' best moment was what Jones, unlike many political journalists, deemed the double-edge sword of Sanders' defense of Clinton and her emails. He found the key line – \"the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails\" – ambiguous in its simultaneous defense and attack.\nClinton viewed it as an unadulterated anti-Republican, anti-media volley, while the press deemed it a Clinton victory that now diminishes the issue's relevance.\nBut it was also an anti-Clinton statement that, in a subliminal way, resembled the handiwork of the better playwrights.\nTAGS: Clinton, Hillary Sanders, Bernie 2016 presidential election primaries debates politics Webb, Jim Chafee, Lincoln O'Malley, Martin", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe73o4%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Reviewing%20Clinton%2C%20Sanders%20and%20the%20Democratic%20Debate%20as%20Political%20Theater&summary=Here%27s%20how%20the%20pros%20rated%20Clinton%2C%20Sanders%20and%20the%20Democratic%20debate%20as%20political%20theater.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe73o4%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe73o4%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Reviewing%20Clinton%2C%20Sanders%20and%20the%20Democratic%20Debate%20as%20Political%20Theater", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe73o4%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Reviewing%20Clinton%2C%20Sanders%20and%20the%20Democratic%20Debate%20as%20Political%20Theater", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe73o4%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe73o4%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:00:11.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
