Hide Caption 2016 election candidates \"Given the image of big banks today, it is easy now to take on Wall Street. I was there when it was not so popular,\" Sanders said. Clinton has sought advice on her Wall Street plan from a host of advisers, including former Rep. Barney Frank, who called the plan a \"thoughtful, comprehensive proposal.\" Not advocated for in Clinton's proposal is the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall, a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banks until its repeal under President Bill Clinton. Clinton dismissed the idea of reinstating Glass-Steagall during an event in Iowa on Tuesday, and wrote in the her op-ed that while the proposal to bring back the law is \"serious,\" it isn't targeted enough. \"I certainly share the goal of never having to bail out the big banks again, but I prefer the path of tackling the most dangerous risks in a different way,\" Clinton wrote. On Tuesday, Clinton said she would go after \"not the problems of the past, but the problems of today,\" a subtle knock against two of her stoutest Democratic opponents: Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley . Lis Smith, O'Malley's deputy campaign manager, said Tuesday that \"Clinton's plan falls short on what should be our ultimate goal: preventing reckless Wall Street speculators from backing up their bad bets with taxpayer money.\" Clinton also looks back in the opinion piece, casting herself as someone was worried about the stability of the financial market long before the 2008 crash. \"Unfortunately, the Bush administration and Republicans in Congress largely ignored calls for reform,\" Clinton writes. \"The result cost 9 million Americans their jobs, drove 5 million families out of their homes and wiped out more than $13 trillion in household wealth.\" Releasing the plan on Thursday makes sense for Clinton, who will spend the weekend preparing for next week's CNN Democratic Primary debate, the first in the nominating process. Wall Street reform, an issue regularly addressed by Sanders and O'Malley, will likely be a topic that allows the candidates to draw contrast with one another. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Race to the White House", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:11:09.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
