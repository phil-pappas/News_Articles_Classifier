Dozens of injured veterans and their families boarded the USS Yorktown Tuesday evening to see the retired aircraft carrier up close. Wounded Warrior Project ® (WWP) brought the injured service members to the ship as part of its Alumni program.\nThe WWP Alumni program helps create support through shared experiences. Wounded veterans have the opportunity to share their transition to civilian life with other service members who are going through the same life changes. The Alumni program is one of 20 free programs and services provided by WWP.\nTuesday night, veterans walked the decks of the Yorktown, learned about the World War II battles CV-10 experienced in its 27 years of service, and even saw how the carrier helped in the space race.\nSam McCarthy is an Army veteran and WWP Alumnus who made the trip down from Charlotte with his wife to see the carrier.\n\"I love coming to Charleston . I've enjoyed seeing the Yorktown,\" McCarthy said. \"All the history on this ship, and getting to spend time with other veterans is great.\"\nOn the flight deck of the Yorktown, injured service members walked among fighter jets, helicopters, and anti-submarine aircraft.\nWounded veterans also had the chance to experience the USS Clamagore, the only GUPPY III-class submarine preserved in the United States , and the USS Laffey, a Sumner-class destroyer that also saw action in WWII.\nInjured veterans and their families ate dinner in the hangar bay and competed in a Halloween -themed clay sculpture contest before the night concluded.\nAbout Wounded Warrior Project\nThe mission of Wounded Warrior Project ® (WWP) is to honor and empower Wounded Warriors.
