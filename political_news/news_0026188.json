Gov. Jay Dardenne and state Rep. John Bel Edwards answered questions about everything from transportation funding to their personal wedding proposals before a live audience. U.S. David Vitter, considered one of the front-runners in the race, did not participate.\nVitter said his Senate business in Washington D.C. kept him from attending the debate, but the Republican is skipping more forums and debates than the other major candidates in the run-up to the primary election on Oct. 24. During the debate, Dardenne jokingly referred to Vitter, a fellow Republican, as \"the elephant not in the room.\"\nCritics say Vitter is avoiding debates where questions aren't provided in advance. Debate organizers putting together events around the state have also privately said the senator isn't wild about debates taking place before a live audience on television.\nBut remotely from Washington, Vitter defended his decision not be in Baton Rouge. He (or his staff) tapped out messages over Twitter about the importance of congressional votes he had cast Wednesday, as the gubernatorial debate featuring his three opponents was broadcast live on television stations across Louisiana.\nToday I report 6 pro-small biz bills out of my cmte w/ bipartisan support. Apparently my opponents think I should have skipped #lagovdebate\nâ€” David Vitter (@DavidVitter) October 8, 2015 Back in Baton Rouge, the three candidates turned in some surprising answers about what they would do to fix the state's significant financial woes. Louisiana is just a quarter through its current fiscal cycle and already facing a state budget shortfall of well over $100 million. Next year's budget hole is expected to be even bigger -- around $700 million.\nOf the three candidates in Baton Rouge, only Dardenne said he would consider raising personal income taxes to help close the state's budget gap next year. Edwards, the only major Democrat in the race, and Angelle, another Republican, said they wouldn't put a personal income tax hike on the table.\n\"I think we have an obligation to consider everything,\" said Dardenne, on the personal income tax issue.\nAll three candidates, including Dardenne, said they would look more closely at rolling back business tax credits and incentives to fix the state budget problems before raising any taxes. Edwards went the farthest with this proposal, saying he would put a blanket cap on every tax credit the state offers currently. The Democrat would also push for a \"sunset\" to be put on every tax credit -- an idea that Vitter has also floated on his website.\nThough Vitter wasn't attending the debate, the candidates occasionally appeared to respond to the senator's previous comments. During a discussion of the state budget, Edwards went out of his way to mention he didn't think the state would be able to fully repeal the inventory tax, one of Vitter's key budget proposals.\nWhen it came to transportation funding, Angelle and Dardenne said they would consider building toll roads to address the need for new roads and other infrastructure. But Dardenne said tolls couldn't be the only solution.\n\"Toll roads are not going to fix the problem -- the $12 billion backlog [in transportation projects],\" he said.\nEdwards and Angelle, specifically, shied away from saying they would support a gas tax increase for new roads and infrastructure, but both hinted that they might consider one under certain scenarios.\nEdwards said once some other changes had been made to the transportation trust fund -- including cutting off state police access to transportation dollars -- he would consider a \"short-term gas tax\" for specific projects. The gas tax increase would have to be passed by the voters, however.\nAngelle initially said he did not support a statewide gas tax, but he does want to set up a regional transportation system in which certain parts of the state could decide to raise their own gas tax. Vitter has floated a similar idea in previous forums.\nThe candidates also had to field some personal questions about themselves in addition to inquiries about taxes and state spending. When asked about his toughest time as a parent, Edwards mentioned he and his wife's decision to carry through with a pregnancy that produced their daughter two decades ago, even after a doctor had advised they look at abortion. Edwards is also running a television advertisement about this period in his life, highlighting his anti-abortion views.\nAngelle got the biggest laugh from the crowd when he admitted he had never gotten his wife an engagement ring. \"I told her if I ever got elected governor, I would buy her a ring,\" he quipped.\nThe three candidates at the debate also took time to compliment each other -- after the debate moderator asked what they liked best about their opponents. But none of the men took that opportunity to say anything nice about Vitter.\n\"The three of us have developed a great relationship during our time together,\" said Dardenne, indirectly referencing Vitter's absence from the debate.\n\"I have genuine affection for these two men. I think they are good men and decent men,\" Edwards said. \"We actually show up.\"\n . . . .\nJulia O'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge .
