He recognises that it was the shaitan in a manner that is similar to people recognising their relatives.\"\nRidiculing Prasad's remarks that it was the 'devil' under whose influence he made the beef remarks, Modi said \"So far we were fighting (political rivals) human beings. Now a shaitan has entered a human body which is after us.\"\nThe PM also blamed RJD chief for insulting \"Yaduvanshis\" by his utterances.\n\"What all did he (Prasad) eat? It (the remarks) insulted the Yaduvanshis ... Laluji these Yaduvanshis helped you to come to power. Was it not an insult of Yadavs and\nBihar?\" he said. The PM made similar reference in his speeches at Begusarai and Samastipur too.\n Election Commission poll speeches Narendra Modi nation Also Read Bihar Assembly polls: Allies press BJP on seat-sharing NDA will declare CM candidate: BJP 49 schoolgirls allege sexual harassment in Maharashtra RLD lodges complaint against Hema Malini's advertisement", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/nation-current-affairs/article/election-commission-review-poll-speeches-narendra-modi", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Modi-at-Begusarai_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Modi-at-Begusarai_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:43:23.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
