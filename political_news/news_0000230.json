Photo: Andrew Meares\nThe Deloitte financial services group has proposed a \"circuit breaker\" on superannuation it believes will save the budget $6 billion per year while giving every worker in the nation a tax break.\nThe plan goes further than the one proposed by Labor and rejected by the Coalition under Tony Abbott. It would have raised less than $2 billion per year.\nWe will consider all good ideas, we will look at them very, very carefully\nIt would build on a model developed by the Henry tax review, under which every worker would pay tax on the income they paid into super but then receive a rebate of 15¢ in the dollar.\nFor high earners on the 45¢ marginal tax rate, the rebate would leave them paying 30¢ in the dollar. For low earners on the 19¢ cent rate, the rebate would pay just 4 per cent. Earners below the tax-free threshold would receive a payment from the government of 15¢ in the dollar.\nAdvertisement At present, most Australians pay only 15 per cent, giving most high income earners an effective 30 per cent discount.\n\"We're suggesting a truly level playing field,\" Deloitte partner Chris Richardson said. \"The Henry review wanted to hand every worker back 20 per cent. We are suggesting 15 per cent because the budget is [in a] worse position than it was then.\"\nAssistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer said on Sunday the government would weigh up all proposals.\n\"Well, what we've said is that with our tax white paper process, everything's on the table. We will consider all good ideas, we will look at them very, very carefully and we're not ruling anything in or out,\" she told the ABC.\nMr Richardson said while stability was important to the super system, the system would be unstable until it was affordable and seen to be fair.\nThe Murray financial system inquiry found that only $1 in every $200 of super concessions went to the bottom 20 per cent of income earners while more than half went to the top 20 per cent.\nThe estimate of a $6 billion saving is for 2016-17 alone.\nMr Richardson said the savings would climb over time.\nThey would be large enough to fund a cut in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 26 per cent or to fund income tax cuts and increases in benefits to offset the effect of a higher goods and services tax.\nIn a report to be released on Monday, Mythbusting Tax Reform , Deloitte also proposes winding back the capital gains tax discount from 50 per cent to 33.3 per cent.\nIt would mean that two-thirds of each capital gain would be taxed instead of the present half.\nMr Richardson said there was a case for taxing capital gains more lightly than other forms of income in order to avoid taxing the result of inflation but that Australia \"overdid it\".\nNegative gearing was a symptom of the very high discount given to capital gains rather than a cause of a problem in its own right.\nMs O'Dwyer played down the prospect of the government cracking down on negative gearing, cautioning that it was used by a lot of mum and dad investors.\n\"Average income earners largely are the people who do get to take advantage of negative gearing,\" she said.\n\"Most of them hold only one property, which adds to the housing stock that's available for people as well. So, you need to look at this holistically, which is what we're saying that we will do.\"\nFollow Peter Martin on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Peter-Martin/713739465438660", "http://landing.deloitte.com.au/Tax-Reform-Registration_mythbusting.html"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:36:09.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
