(AP) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump doesn't think the Democrats' first debate will hold his interest long.\nTalking to reporters in New Hampshire Monday, Trump predicted many people will watch the debate for 10 or 15 minutes, get bored and turn it off. And he may be one of them: Trump says he'll tune in but doesn't know how long he'll last.\nThe Democratic candidates will debate for the first time Tuesday evening at a Las Vegas event with CNN as host.\nThe two Republican debates so far have scored record TV ratings.\nTrump says he doesn't expect the Democrats to do as well in the ratings - because he won't be on the stage.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
