He attacked Obamacare as a major drag on the nation's economy.\nRepublican Presidential Candidate Jeb Bush will appear on The 700 Club, Monday, Oct. 26. Check your local listings for show times.\n\"When you consider the wreckage, it makes you wonder how anybody could support this now,\" he noted.\nBut he added that the leading Democratic candidates are on board with Obamacare.\n\"And the debate tonight in Las Vegas will probably prove that they will be strongly supportive of this top-down driven, highly bureaucratic insurance plan that is stifling our ability to rise up,\" Bush said.\nThe Jeb Bush campaign says his plan would accomplish three goals: promoting innovation, lowering costs of health care, and returning power to the states.\nSeveral conservative analysts have praised the plan, calling it \"substantive, and a clear improvement over Obamacare.\"\nBut Bush's Republican rival in the presidential field, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal tweeted Tuesday, \"There's an empty podium (referring to Vice-President Joe Biden) in at the Democrat debate. @jebbush should take it and argue for his 'Obamacare Lite'' health care proposal.\"\nThe former Florida governor needs to burnish his credentials with conservatives. A CBS- New York Times poll shows him in fifth place and in single digits among Republicans, trailing far behind front-runners Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:12:48.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
