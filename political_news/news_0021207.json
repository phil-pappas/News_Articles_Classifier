But the former Florida governor saw a big drop in his fundraising prowess in the third quarter as his campaign struggled to generate momentum in a big field. \nMr Bush raised $13m between July and September, according to his campaign. While that surpassed almost all the other 14 Republican contenders, the pace marked a sharp decline from the $11m he amassed in the final two weeks of the second quarter after launching his campaign on June 15. More Sanders makes push to unseat Clinton \nIn a worrying sign for Mr Bush, he raised much less than Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has moved to the top of the Republican field alongside Donald Trump , the real estate tycoon. Mr Carson generated $20m in donations in the third quarter, with $12m lodged in September alone. \nMr Bush also raised less than the two top Democratic candidates. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, took in $28m, while Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator, drew $26m. In her filing with the Federal Election Commission, Mrs Clinton said her campaign had cash on hand of $33m. Her campaign team said they had received more than 600,000 donations from nearly 400,000 donors since she launched her campaign. \nMr Trump raised just under $4m from 74,000 donors. That was towards the lower end of the spectrum, although the billionaire says he is not actively soliciting contributions. Mr Trump said his campaign has pulled in $5.8m to date, including $1.9m of his own money. That figure suggests that while Mr Trump claims to be largely self-funding his campaign, the vast majority of the $5.6m that he has spent so far has come from other contributors. \nThe Bush campaign cast the former governor’s numbers in a positive light by pointing out that he had raised more than the combined total of donations to Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator who raised $6m, and Carly Fiorina , the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive who raised just under $7m. \nDanny Diaz, campaign manager for Mr Bush, said the $13m total was only slightly less than the $14m that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, had raised in the same quarter four years ago in a smaller field. \n“We knew from the start this was going to be a hard fought and close race, but few could have anticipated just how volatile this field would be,” said Mr Diaz. “I, for one, would be less than forthcoming if I said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer healthcare and partial-birth abortion would be leading the Republican primary.” I, for one, would be less than forthcoming if I said we predicted in June that a reality television star supporting Canadian-style single-payer healthcare and partial-birth abortion would be leading the Republican primary \n- Danny Diaz, campaign manager for Jeb Bush \nWhile the Bush campaign described the fundraising as a strong achievement in a crowded field, it appeared weak for a contender who has been tapping into the vast political network that his father and brother — two former presidents — have built during their years in politics. \nBut Mr Bush should benefit more than his rivals from the so-called super-Pac groups that can raise unlimited sums to support candidates as long as they do not co-ordinate with the campaigns. Right to Rise, the super-Pac backing Mr Bush, raised about $100m in the first six months of the year. \nYet the falling pace of direct campaign donations reflects the difficulty Mr Bush has faced in generating enthusiasm with rank and file Republicans. \nAccording to an average of recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics , only 7 per cent of Republicans support Mr Bush, compared to 23 per cent for Mr Trump and 19 per cent for Mr Carson. Mr Bush also trails Mr Rubio, his former protégé in Florida. \nBoosted by two strong debate performances, Ms Fiorina saw her donations quadruple from the previous three months. In the latest Fox poll, Mr Rubio had 9 per cent support, while Ms Fiorina came in at 5 per cent. \nThe same poll found Mr Trump and Mr Carson in a statistical tie — worrying for the property magnate, whom many experts now believe has peaked. \nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spar on Wall St and gun control \nBoth leading candidates have strong showing in first Democratic presidential debate \nRead more \nTed Cruz, the firebrand senator from Texas, also had a strong fundraising quarter, bringing in about $12.2m. He had 10 per cent support in the Fox poll. His campaign received 185,000 contributions in the third quarter, with an average donation of $66. He has also secured more than 6,000 “sustainer” donors who pledged to give a recurring monthly amount to the campaign. \nMrs Clinton’s campaign is hoping her strong performance in the first Democratic debate on Tuesday will reinvigorate donors, after she just edged out chief rival Bernie Sanders in fundraising in the last quarter. \nWhile she raised $2m more than the Vermont senator, more individual donors gave to Mr Sanders, with the average online donation in the last quarter coming in at $30. About 99 per cent of his donations were for $100 or less. \nMr Sanders, whose platform focuses on income inequality and Wall Street reform, has shunned super-Pacs. In the 24 hours since the Tuesday debate, he raised $2.5m, according to his campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:07:22.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
