On or about September 16, 2015, Obama and Dick Durbin were talking about granting asylum in America to Syrian Muslims displaced by ISIS (hereinafter referred to as “IS”, for, ISLAMIC STATE”) it was reported that churches in the United States, were laboring to grant “displaced Syrian Sunni Muslims, asylum, but NOT Syrian Christians, also displaced by IS, BUT largely ignored, in the shadow of Sunni Muslims being granted asylum in droves. This seems to be contradicting the fact that the United States, with its majority Christian population, is working doubly hard to DENY Syrian Christians asylum, while concurrently granting Syrian Muslims asylum by the thousands. This bizarre fact is true, regardless of the fact that Syrian Sunni Muslims (or any Muslims, for that matter), have NO intention of assimilating the American culture. In truth and in fact, it is a position banned by their Qur’an. Muslims are, in fact, making no secret of their plan to make America (and Europe) into Muslim enclaves, stamping-out Christianity, Judaism, and ALL “unbelievers in the Islamic CULT”, at best; or, making Christianity and all other non-Islamic religions, second rate religions, beholding to ISLAM and, rendering our Constitution subservient to Islamic sharia law, at worst. I strongly urge anyone who thinks the above is a, ”crazy, right wing, conspiracy theory”: A.) READ THE QUR’AN (so you know what you are talking about and are not just parroting leftist’s talking points); and B.) Study the disaster unfolding because of the Islamic invasion of the European Union. I warn you, though, its not pretty. In London, for example, there has been a dramatic increase in violent crimes, including rape and pedophilia, often perportrated by Muslims, against non-Muslims and non-Muslim’s children. For example, “ May 27, 2015 … 1,400 British non - Muslim children were gang-raped and brutalized by Muslims ….. The Muslims have been maneuvering for years in Europe and it looks like … groomed for rape by enemy pedophiles is completely defeated and ….. groups here in the UK and their increasing support (and it is happening).” http://www.jihadwatch.org/2015/05/uk-city-that-covered-up-muslim-rape-gangs-wants-to-ban-anti-child-rape-protests…” I’m confused about why some American Christian Churches are organizing to help grant asylum to Syrian Sunni Muslims (many of whom are likely ISIS plants, planning to commit terrorist operations in the United States); apparently, EVEN before granting asylum to displaced Syrian Christians, many of whom have reportedly made it to California, where their applications for asylum are reportedly being rejected, en mass , by the Muslim-happy Barack Hussein Obama regime. While, at the same time, Syrian and other Muslim’s applications for asylum are being “fast tracked” by the Obama regime. I’m sure many are fully aware of this outrage, which makes the Christian churches’ position of helping Sunni Muslims to settle in the United States, even more alarming and perplexing. It would seem to be a reversal of all sensible viewpoints on this subject, as well as a direct contradiction of how the United States should be acting, because Muslims are surrounded by Muslims throughout the Mideast, but Christians have no such luck. This is clearly a thinly veiled ploy by Obama’s regime, to rapidly speed-up the Muslim invasion of the United States, just as it is a blatant invasion of the EU. With all due respect, am I missing something, or just too ignorant to follow what is happening? For whatever reason. I know I’m being a nuisance, but this is an issue I am passionate about and must understand. I hope I’ve expressed my concerns without offending anyone. PS. Nothing you write will offend me! PLEASE tell me where you truly stand, because organizing churches to help displaced Syrian Muslims is a position I cannot, and will not, abide, and is in direct conflict with the best interests of the United States. Frankly, if that IS our position, I’m afraid we’ve reached an insurmountable division in our respective ideologies. If that IS the case, I will not be able to continue aligning myself with such policies, which would be a very sad day for me, since I had always thought we were fellow travelers, basically on the same page. In fact, my belief in our Constitution is the main reason I became such a fervent supporter of Israel. I’m sure many readers recall many articles, published to ardently support Israel by the United States. These inquires unearthed many of the facts and circumstances constructing an irrefutable case that Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton’s top aid, when Hillary was the Secretary of State, (married to the ex-Congressional sex addict, ANTHONY WIENER), was a spy for Islam, with 2 brothers highly placed in the muzzie bro’hood, a mother in the muzzie sis’hood, and a father who taught Muslim ideology on college campuses throughout the Mideast. In fact, when Congresswoman Michele Bachmann and 4 or 5 of her colleagues, wrote a letter asking to see how, in the world, Huma Abedin managed to get a, “top security clearance “, by merely asking to see a copy of Abedin’s application, they were staunchly rebuked (BUT NOT JUST BY THE DEMOCRATS, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT), but by the Republican leadership ( McConnell and Boehner), who warned Bachmann, et al,, to stand down and let the issue die. (Thereafter, the RNC refused to give Bachmann one red cent toward her reelection campaign, in Minnesota.) Michele Bachmann still won, through private donations, but her split with the GOP leadership was catastrophic and she later announced that she will NOT run again; a terrible loss for United States’ Conservatives and the infinitesimal amount of integrity Congress somehow still manages to maintain. Moreover, Abedin, a devout Muslim, and Wiener , a devout Jew, are prohibited from marrying, unless Wiener renounces Judaism and converts to Islam, which Wiener never did and never would do. The punishment prescribed in the Qur’an, for such a marriage, is publicly stoning the Muslim woman to death (a throwback to an archaic and lawless, misogynistic, society). However, there is one caveat, to wit: “IF THE MARRIAGE WILL SERVE TO SPREAD THE MUSLIM CALIPHATE AND A RANKING IMAM GIVES HIS BLESSING TO THE UNION.” (What we know as taqiyya , to wit: lying to unbelievers by Muslims to spread the caliphate. ) It turns-out that Abedin had virtual unfettered access to all manner of top secret governmental information; basically, whatever secret information Hillary Clinton was privy to, Huma Abedin was also allowed to see. Moreover, the head IMAM in NYC, not ONLY gave his blessing to the Abedin/ Wiener nuptials, but, after Wiener’s disgusting public disgrace, counseled Abedin to, “stay with [her] man”. Even stranger, it turned-out that Slick Willie Clinton, who was President at the time, “married” the couple, either at the Clinton’s Westchester mansion in New York State;, or, at a rented mansion in Rhinebeck, NY, (where Chelsea Clinton was subsequently married). “YES”, a sitting President has the authority to wed people. (You just couldn’t make this stuff up, out of thin air if you tried, no matter how talented a creative writer you might happen to be.) Sorry to go on so, but your response is very important and I wanted to try and be as clear as a bell. I hope I succeeded and will be hearing your “take” on this bizarre situation sometime soon.", "external_links": ["http://www.jihadwatch.org/2015/05/uk-city-that-covered-up-muslim-rape-gangs-wants-to-ban-anti-child-rape-protests&#8230;&#8221;", "http://search.myway.com/search/GGmain.jhtml?st=tab&ptb=A07CD15B-A34C-48B4-9526-67032D081B1A&n=781bd942&ind=2015091010&ct=SS&pg=GGmain&p2=%5EY6%5Echryyy%5ETTAB02%5Eus&tpr=sc&searchfor=taqiyya&ots=1444278713410", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Bachmann"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:50:13.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
