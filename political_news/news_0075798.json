It's a phase. Vance will get over it. \nHe didn't. \nMost Oregonians hadn't heard of Vance Day, a 54-year-old Marion County Circuit Court judge, until earlier this month when word spread that he was refusing to perform same-sex weddings due to his religious beliefs. Since then, he has become a nationally debated symbol of the culture wars, reviled by liberals and celebrated by conservatives in the same vein as Kentucky clerk Kim Davis . \nThat was never, he said, his intent. \nCritics of his marriage decision paint Day as a religious zealot who expects the world to bend to his belief. Findings from state regulators paint him as a judge who has repeatedly shown remarkably poor judgment. \nDay's family and professional acquaintances say his behavior is being taken out of context and his intentions ignored. He says he's being denied his First Amendment rights -- and that judges should be allowed to live their faith just as much as anyone else. \nFrom sports camp to the bench \nThat trip from Portland to Sports Acres camp in 1975 set the course for Day's life. A stranger on the bus gave him a Bible, insisting he should preach to fellow campers. \n\"I started reading it, and it was unlike anything I'd heard in church,\" he said. He'd attended Portland's First Baptist Church with his parents for years, he said, but had never been encouraged to take faith personally. \nHis cabin mates let him read to them each night, and a swim teacher helped organize a Bible study. Day said he met Jesus that summer and has maintained a personal relationship since. \n\"I'll never forget leaving that camp,\" he said. \"I was on fire.\" \nThe passion didn't ebb. He participated in Young Life during his years at Lincoln High School and went to Warner Pacific, a Christian college. Before law school in the late 1980s, Day worked as a television reporter in the Middle East and studied public policy at Regent University, a faith-based Virginia college, where also he met his wife. \nHe earned a law degree from Willamette University in 1991 and opened a civil practice in Salem. He represented people who had been injured at work or in car crashes, he said, and litigated a few civil rights employment cases. \nHe \"caught the campaign bug\" while studying at Regent, he said, and quickly became involved in Oregon politics after coming home for law school. He was chairman of the Oregon Young Republicans by 1992 and later served as treasurer and then chairman of the Oregon Republican Party. \nThen-Gov. John Kitzhaber appointed Day to the Marion County Circuit Court in 2011, saying in a statement that Day would bring needed civil experience to the bench. \nHe's in the limelight now as a symbol of division, but Day has far fewer affidavits of prejudice -- essentially requests from lawyers to switch judges -- than many of his colleagues. Since 2012, he's received just 15. The other 17 judicial officers in Marion County have received an average of 93 each , according to state records. \n\"He's one of the best judges I've seen,\" said James Vick, a Republican who has practiced law in Salem for four decades. \"He's very diligent, does his homework. He's fair to both sides.\" \nThough he never served in the military, Day has an affinity for veterans that dates back decades -- and began his current troubles. \nDay presides over the county's Veterans Treatment Court, a three-year-old program that helps vets who commit non-violent crimes access special services. \nIn January 2014, Day heard the case of a Navy SEAL facing a drunk-driving charge. Legal officials feared the vet might hurt himself, Day said, so they agreed to stay in touch with him outside of court. When the vet's heater broke, Day said, members of the legal team agreed the judge could fix it himself. \nIt's rare for judges to interact with defendants outside court, Day said, but this was a unique situation. Steve Tillson, a veterans court official in Southern Oregon, said he'd never heard of a judge intentionally spending time with a participant beyond the courthouse. \nThat day at the SEAL's home turned problematic. Day's 23-year-old son, Justin, tagged along with his father and brought a handgun. The veteran was a convicted felon, barred by law from handling firearms. \n\"He had quite a bit of military experience, and I was hoping he would show me stuff,\" Justin Day said. \"I did not think about the fact that he was a felon.\" \nDay said he didn't know his son brought the gun. While working on the heater he saw the two handling the weapon, but at the time didn't register a problem. \nGuns are common in Day's family. The judge's father carried a gun, and two of his children have concealed carry permits. Day carries a handgun when he's not on official judicial business, including during a recent interview at a Salem coffee shop. \nA few weeks after the visit to the SEAL's home, a court official told the judge the vet felt nervous about holding a gun in his presence, Day said. That's when the judge realized he'd made a mistake. He talked to the veteran's probation officer and others about the incident, he said, and was told not to worry. \nMonths later, the veteran reported the incident to Marion County's presiding judge , who did not respond to interview requests made through court staff. Day said the vet, who alsocould not be reached for comment, was irritated with an assignment Day had given him in court. In August 2014, Day reported the incident to the Commission on Judicial Fitness and Disability, a nine-member panel that reviews complaints against judges and justices. \nWhat began as a look into Day's conduct with the veteran broadened to include 13 alleged violations of Oregon's Judicial Code of Conduct spanning three years. \nState regulators said Day \"improperly\" imposed himself on the Navy SEAL by paying too much attention to him outside court. They reported that he referred to vets in his courtroom as \"raggedy asses\" and brushed off court staff who complained about office décor by explaining his role amounts to that of a \"benevolent dictator.\" \nInvestigators also noted that Day collected donations from lawyers to sponsor military displays in the courthouse, including one featuring a portrait of Adolf Hitler . And they said he ordered his staff to screen out wedding applications from gay and lesbian couples after same-sex marriage became the law of the land. Extra Want more details about the judicial fitness commission's allegations? Read this document Day's spokesperson shared with The Oregonian/OregonLive. It includes the commission's allegations as well as Day's legal responses. \nThe state commission can recommend that Day be censured, suspended or removed from office. \nThe judge disagrees that his behavior violated Oregon's judicial code, and disputes that some of what he's accused of doing even happened. In response to the state report, he hired lawyers and a spokesperson with extensive experience advocating for religious liberty; if upholding Oregon's code for judges means violating his own religious conscience, Day said, it goes too far. \nOn Sept. 3, the state approved his request to set up a legal defense fund, enabling him to raise money to cover legal expenses. That afternoon, Day's spokesperson went on Lars Larson's radio show to discuss the case, framing the allegations against him as a challenge to the judge's First Amendment rights. \nSuddenly, Day was national news. \nGood intentions? \nFriends and Salem-area attorneys who know him well say the commission is taking Day's behavior out of context. \nThe judge has a knack for lightening the mood when appropriate, said attorney Robert Gunn, who has dealt with Day on criminal and civil cases, in veterans court and mediation. Day often quips that, \"it's time to get our raggedy asses inside,\" Gunn said, or playfully teases his courtroom companions about his authority. \n(During an interview with The Oregonian/OregonLive, Day paused to joke with an acquaintance who'd just quit his job. \"What?\" Day asked, laughing. \"You mean they didn't fire your raggedy ass?\") \nDay said he uses humor with veterans to foster camaraderie. \n\"There's nothing that I've ever, ever heard him say that was malicious or mean spirited,\" said Gunn, a Republican. \nFriends and family describe Day as energetic, positive and eager to help – perhaps to the extent that he doesn't foresee the negative way others might view his actions. Take, for example, the Hitler painting. \nThe portrait was among memorabilia donated by Salem resident Mike Vollmar, whose father cut the picture out of its frame while abroad in World War II. Day included the painting as the backdrop for a collage of awards and photographs – a style similar to dozens of other collages he's made. \n\"Young men defeated a fascist empire, and if we don't remember what they did, then we're doomed to not recognize the face of evil again,\" Day said. \"I wanted the face of evil in that collage.\" \nDay hung the collage on the fourth floor of the Marion County Courthouse in summer 2014, along with other military-themed displays. He'd collected donations from lawyers for the nonprofit Partnership for Veterans at Risk to help pay for matting and framing, he said. He intended the collages to honor and perhaps help veterans who appeared in veterans court. \nVollmar said he and other members of the community thought the piece was impressive. But the county's presiding judge soon asked Day to take the work down. \n\"I think sometimes in the hunt for a sensational story a little nugget can get blown up pretty big,\" said Betsy Johnson, a Democratic state senator who has worked with Day on a committee supporting the Boy Scouts. \n\"Vance is aggressively patriotic and aggressively proud of being an Oregonian.\" \nSame-sex marriage \nFaith, Day says, is not something he can set aside during work hours. Rather, it is the framework for his worldview. \nHe said he believes sex outside of a marriage between a man and a woman violates God's design for humanity. Thus, he cannot officiate a same-sex wedding. \nAfter U.S. District Judge Michael McShane struck down Oregon's ban on same-sex marriage in May 2014, Day asked his staff to direct gay couples seeking to wed to other judges, he said. He intended to cease officiating altogether, but didn't want to draw attention from critics by stopping immediately after the ruling. \n\"As a conservative -- a Christian and a Republican -- I know there are people who don't like my profile as a judge,\" Day said. \"I was trying to stay under the radar, stay true to my religious beliefs, not be rude to people, and gently step away from the situation.\" \nHe stopped scheduling weddings altogether within about three months. \nJudges aren't required to perform weddings in Oregon. The judicial commission's report says screening out gay wedding applicants violates the rule that judges \"shall not, in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct, manifest bias or prejudice\" against anyone based on sexual orientation. \nOpponents of his marriage stance have called Day a bigot and a homophobe. Courthouse officials are scanning his mail for dangerous substances before he opens it. \nDay's voice wavered and he teared up recently as he talked about response to his marriage decision. \n\"Why would you judge me because I have this inner core that disagrees with you? \" he said. \" Why would you want to hurt me?\" \nDay said refusing to officiate gay weddings isn't the same as judging the couples' worth as humans. \n\"I don't have jurisdiction to do that,\" he said, shaking his head. \"They are just as valuable in God's eyes as anybody else.\" \nAs with the Hitler portrait, there's a gap between Day's stated intent and how some constituents perceive his actions. \nBrian Light, who has lived with his partner in Salem for 14 years and testified before the state legislature in support of same-sex marriage, said he doesn't think he'd feel comfortable in Day's courtroom, even for matters unrelated to marriage. He respects Day's right not to perform marriages, he said, but is saddened by the reasoning behind that choice. \n\"It makes me feel like less or a person in his eyes. He can tell me a thousand ways that I'm not, but it makes me feel that way,\" Light said. \"I don't think he's an evil man at all. I think he's a man struggling with his conscience. But actions have consequences.\" \nDay will get a chance to defend himself at a November hearing. He doesn't intend to stand down and believes there is room for judges to hold and act on religious values. He doesn't want to be seen as a rubber-stamping bureaucrat, he said, but as a \"philosophical lawyer chosen to decide issues for the betterment of society.\" \n\"The code should capture and envision the humanity in judges,\" he said, \"not punish them because they are human.\" \n-- Melissa Binder", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:43:00.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
