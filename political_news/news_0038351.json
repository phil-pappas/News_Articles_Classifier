The Bill implements a settlement between the PSA; the SFWU; the CTU; the Crown; DHBs; and providers. \nA legal case on behalf of PSA member Jenny Goodman sparked the negotiations that ended with this settlement, which sees home support workers paid for the time they spend travelling between clients, sometimes hundreds of kilometres per week. \nRichard Wagstaff, PSA national secretary, said \"This win has made a huge difference to the lives of thousands of low-paid support workers across New Zealand.\" \n\"For some home support workers, this agreement means hundreds more dollars in their pay packets, making a real difference to people near the minimum wage. \n\"The in between travel agreement shows that when Government sits down and talks with unions and providers, we can make a huge difference to people’s lives. \n\"More than paid travel time, the settlement also includes other changes to help strengthen the sector and improve the lives of those working in it. \n\"Home support to enable elderly and disabled people to live independent lives at home is the fastest growing part of our health sector. \n\"We were pleased to negotiate this agreement on behalf of thousands of PSA members in this sector, who are passionate about the work they do making a difference in people’s lives. \n\"Those who look after some of our most vulnerable should never be vulnerable themselves,\" said Richard Wagstaff. \nENDS \nFOR MORE INFORMATION \nThe Home and Community Support (Payment for Travel Between Clients) Settlement Bill is currently having its first reading in Parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:04:58.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
