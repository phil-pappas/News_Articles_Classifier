According to what we have been told, it could increase or decrease depending upon multiple factors. We have also requested payment options including the ability to use private funding in lieu of bonds, but as of the date of this letter, we have not been given that option....Even though we have continually expressed our wish to utilize the water more efficiently through water spreading, we are prohibited from doing so due to restrictive regulations. Water spreading would allow us to incorporate more farm ground, therefore reducing the cost per acre.\"\nIn effect, the October 1 st letter rejects the ECBID's socialized or normative financing scheme for surface water irrigation development in the Odessa Subarea, and comes on the heels of a \"Statement of No Acceptance\" to the ECBID Board and two lawsuits (as outlined in the following news articles) challenging the ECBID's Board and Manager's refusal to release new water service contracts for private sector development for Systems 1 and 2 (both north of I-90 and System 4 (south of I-90).\nhttp://www.theprairiestar.com/agweekly/news/irrigation/odessa-aquifer-irrigators-reject-ecbid-financial-plan/article_dcdc3f9a-da15-11e4-9cca-578b1af595f9.html http://www.lexislegalnews.com/mealeys-water-rights/articles/585/washington-irrigators-sue-bureau-of-reclamation-for-delaying-irrigation-project http://spokanepublicradio.org/post/washington-farmers-sue-feds-over-scarce-water-supplies http://www.theprairiestar.com/agweekly/news/irrigation/odessa-aquifer-irrigators-file-lawsuit-against-east-columbia-basin-irrigation/article_ac25b950-5cae-11e5-809c-aba0186d4446.html Combined, the Irrigators' letter, statement, and lawsuits stress two crucial points:\nThe private sector Irrigators should be allowed to develop the systems using their own private capital. The ECBID and US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) should release the new water service contracts. More ground, with less cost, will be developed with direct private sector capital than through the ECBID's \"normative\" scheme. The new water service contracts should reflect existing state water law authority for water spreading, using high water-use efficiency practices. This \"issue\" principally rests with ECBID management seeking to impede the release of a water service contract to irrigators wanting to privately fund/finance irrigation systems east of the East Low Canal. In the current litigation before the ECBID Board, a restructured water service contract payment (financial) package was presented that would allow for equitable development of East Low Canal water distribution systems north/south of l-90. This package would provide for:\nPrivate sector capital and construction for the systems. Full private sector reimbursement for USBR and ECBID OM&R (operations, maintenance and repair) associated with East Low Canal service and operations. Full private sector reimbursement for the remaining capital costs necessary to compete East Low Canal modifications, for water system access north/south of I-90. Additional private sector compensation to ECBID to assume administrative duties associated with irrigation systems\" integration to the East Low Canal. A reasonable path forward is clear, but the ECBID needs to restore credibility to their actions. The ECBID Board/Manager should redirect their efforts toward working productively with the private sector, to best serve the interests of the Irrigators, our local communities, and the state.\nIf the ECBID Board is unwilling to change course, then a direct legislative review should occur regarding the use of state funds already allocated to ECBID for the East Low Canal modifications.\nFor more information, please contact Darryll Olsen at 509-783-1623 or Email .\nAbout the Odessa Aquifer Privately Funded Project\nThe Odessa Aquifer Privately Funded Project has been widely endorsed by many newspapers and decision-makers as a viable, cost-effective and realistic option to immediately begin replacing the use of groundwater from the declining Odessa Subarea Aquifer.\nFollowing are recent editorials endorsing/supporting the privately funded/financed project:\nhttp://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/jun/04/editorial-dont-allow-litigation-to-divert-wise/ http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2013/09/24/2590487/our-voice-government-should-support.html http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2012/jul/13/editorial-water-flows-to-farms-with-help-of/ releases/more-odessa-aquifer-irrigators-reject-east-columbia-basin-irrigation-districts-expensive-socialized-plan-300161827.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2012/jul/13/editorial-water-flows-to-farms-with-help-of/", "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/jun/04/editorial-dont-allow-litigation-to-divert-wise/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278084", "https://www.facebook.com/OdessaAquiferPrivatelyFundedIrrigationProject", "http://www.lexislegalnews.com/mealeys-water-rights/articles/585/washington-irrigators-sue-bureau-of-reclamation-for-delaying-irrigation-project", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278085", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-xN73ylnN7ja1Z5Skx4T25kM0k/view?usp=sharing", "http://www.theprairiestar.com/agweekly/news/irrigation/odessa-aquifer-irrigators-reject-ecbid-financial-plan/article_dcdc3f9a-da15-11e4-9cca-578b1af595f9.html", "http://www.tri-cityherald.com/2013/09/24/2590487/our-voice-government-should-support.html", "http://www.theprairiestar.com/agweekly/news/irrigation/odessa-aquifer-irrigators-file-lawsuit-against-east-columbia-basin-irrigation/article_ac25b950-5cae-11e5-809c-aba0186d4446.html", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-odessa-aquifer-irrigators-reject-east-columbia-basin-irrigation-districts-expensive-socialized-plan-300161827.html", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=292674", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH31575&Transmission_Id=201510190846PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH31575&DateId=20151019", "http://spokanepublicradio.org/post/washington-farmers-sue-feds-over-scarce-water-supplies"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:07:41.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
