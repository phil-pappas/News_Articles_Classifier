After undergoing a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, she is now cancer-free. I found a lump in my breast in December 2014, before the holidays. Due to scheduling issues, I didn’t have a biopsy until January, after I had celebrated with my loved ones. Enjoying that December with a clear, calm mind was a gift. I didn’t know it then, but my life would have a line drawn through it — the delineation of my “pre-” and “post-cancer” memories.\nMy work at The Weinbach Group — representing Susan G. Komen ® South Florida — meant that I didn’t hesitate to get that lump checked out. I remembered other young women who had been diagnosed through Komen South Florida, and if it hadn’t been for them — their commitment to discussing screening and telling their personal survivor stories — I wouldn’t have gotten checked. It was their courage to speak out that made me realize I could also have breast cancer. I hope I’m doing them justice by continuing to share, because they saved my life.\nI was diagnosed with stage one breast cancer in February 2015. I was working full-time, taking classes, and enjoying married life. My husband and I were so happy together, making big plans, and then everything ground to a halt.\nMeieli Sawyer with her husband, Hayden Bean, on their wedding day. As a member of The Weinbach Group, Sawyer has represented Susan G. Komen® South Florida for several years — and, as a result of her own cancer diagnosis, says her work with the organization ‘now has more meaning than ever.’ Speaking to so many breast cancer survivors, so many activists, and so many volunteers, I thought I understood what it was like to have breast cancer. People told me about the fear — about both treatment, and about telling their families. Until I was diagnosed with breast cancer myself, I had no idea how it affected every aspect of my life — from my values, to my personal relationships, to my mental health. Empathy only took me so far; the rest of the journey I had to travel alone.\nI had a lumpectomy in March and completed radiation in June. I was “lucky” to skip chemotherapy, because the cancer had not spread to my lymph nodes and was not aggressive. Now, I have the scars, the memories, and more than a little pain every day. I’m told all of that will fade in time.\nMy work with Komen now has more meaning than it ever did. I thought I couldn’t be more supportive of the cause, but after my diagnosis, encouraging early detection is my passion. Screening and education can make the difference between life and death. Every year, Komen helps women and men make informed health decisions, locate screening options, and access treatment in some of the best facilities in South Florida. I am proud to represent an organization that impacts local lives so profoundly.\nIn some ways, my post-cancer life is better. I didn’t know how resilient I was. I didn’t know who would stand by my side when I needed it. I didn’t know how far I could be pushed, how much I could cry, or how well I could lie when somebody would ask me if I was OK. Now I do, and these are the gifts that cancer gave me.\nSome things haven’t changed — my wonderful relationship, my fulfilling job, and my sense of strength. But what has changed is the haunting sense of fragility that follows me every day … and the knowledge that you can “do everything right” and still become a statistic.\nThe only thing I can do is push forward, keep my head up, and continue to get checked. To all the survivors still fighting, you give me the courage to go on, instead of mourning my life as it once was — “pre-cancer.” Now, I celebrate a healthy life with a hopeful future.\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/23/7e/28/Book2.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/23/e0/89/IMG_0007.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:55:58.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
