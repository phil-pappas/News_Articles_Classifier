However, Minister of Education El-Sherbini previously told Ahram’s Arabic website that the ministry stands by their decision.\nThe new electronic system, enacted at the beginning of the 2015/2016 academic year, was introduced by education minister El-Helali El-Sherbini and aims to improve students’ attendance.\nIn previous years, 100 percent of the high school students' grades were based on their performance on the final year's exams.\nThis year, 531,800 have registered for Thanaweya amma, the final year of high school, which determines who qualifies to attend universities and colleges.\nThanaweya amma students must take highly competitive and complex tests in order to continue into tertiary education.
