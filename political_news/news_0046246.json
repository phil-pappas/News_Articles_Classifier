The Marijuana Party’s contender showed more vim, invoking her Algonquin ancestry and the need to protect “Mother Earth.” And the Peace and Prosperity Party candidate crossed his fingers in an X to symbolize his 10 legislative proposals, saying through a heavy Hungarian accent, “I hope we can get to that later.”\nLast came the incumbent, Sen. Bernie Sanders. His dark suit and striped tie, neatly trimmed hair and rhetorical polish unmistakably identified him as the establishment powerhouse.\nAs much as Sanders has inhabited the role of anti-establishment insurgent in shaking up the 2016 Democratic presidential field, his reputation in Vermont — where left-leaning is a relative term — is anything but. Now the question is how his lengthy, fed-up stump speeches will translate to the controlled environment of a CNN set in which he will face deft, accomplished debaters.\nThe answer is probably just fine.\nA review of Sanders’ campaign debates reveals a highly confident debating style in which Sanders wields his accomplishments and command of policy, but mostly a palpable sense of conviction and outrage, to set him apart.\nOver the decades, Sanders has learned to suppress his exasperated expressions and eye rolls, speak in sound bites and use humor to make his arguments more digestible. He will jab at an opponent’s weaknesses, dodge when necessary and compliment his questioners.\n“He can be adept at using sarcasm and irony as an attack style, but his primary voice is declarative,” said Greg Guma, a Vermont reporter.\nIn October 1972, the Burlington Free Press barred Sanders, then representing the Liberty Union Party, from a forum among candidates running for governor. But the Bennington Banner noted that year that Sanders’ contribution at a subsequent event made it clear that other candidates were “far better off for having a thorn like Bernard Sanders in the side of political debate.”\nTwo years later, that thorn was scratching at Patrick Leahy, who was seeking to become the first Democrat from Vermont to be elected to the Senate.\nLeahy won that election, and in 1976, Sanders tried a second run for the governor’s office. He came no closer to winning, but as Vermont poet T. Alan Broughton recalled to Russell Banks, writing in the Atlantic, “He always turned out to be the reason why you watched those televised debates.”\nThe 1981 race for mayor of Burlington changed Sanders from gadfly to officeholder. He surprised the incumbent, Gordon Paquette, with his expertise on local issues and stopped railing against multinational corporations.\nIn 1988, he returned to the stage as a candidate for Congress.\nHe lost, but in a 1990 rematch, he got to the right of Rep. Peter Smith, the Republican incumbent, especially on the issue of gun control. At a candidate forum about the Middle East, Sanders saved his sharpest criticism for the news media, bemoaning the lack of “coverage of Third World starvation as opposed to the life and times of Donald Trump.” (He added, “This is before his divorce, when he really got the news.”)\nSanders has not lost an election since", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:02:41.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
