Today the Court of Appeal in Brussels rejected the request and upheld the earlier decision by the Belgium Competition Authority (BCA). As a consequence the \"exclusivity clause\" of the FEI continues to be suspended in respect of the GCL.\nThe Court of Appeal said the FEI had failed to demonstrate the injunction inflicted serious and irreparable harm on the federation. The court said the FEI had managed for more than a century without the clause and failed to show why it was indispensable.\nFrank H McCourt Jr, co-owner of GCT, said: \"Momentum around the Global Champions League concept has been rapidly gathering pace since it was conceived and we welcome today's news that the last hurdle has been removed. We now look forward to focusing our energies on building a new and exciting era for show jumping.\n\"Global Champions League represents a transformational opportunity for the sport of show jumping. There has been great anticipation in the show jumping community for a clear path to growth, opportunity, and exposure around the world. We firmly believe that Global Champions League will deliver on all fronts as it builds a truly global fan base and creates exciting opportunities for everyone involved.\"\nContinuing in the same pioneering spirit of GCT to safeguard the future of the sport, GCL is committed to improving standards for horses, riders, owners and sponsors in the sport and horse welfare will remain a top priority.\nAlongside the GCT's top class vets, stewards will also be on hand at all GCL events to help ensure the well-being of participating horses.\nTo that end, GCL has invited the FEI to oversee horse welfare safeguards at the new-format competitions by inviting its own officials to join its own top class team of vets. At every GCL event experienced vets will be on standby with state-of-the-art horse welfare facilities available at all times as at all GCT events. Technology includes the Human Tecar Therapy technology, a physiotherapy system also used on Formula 1 drivers, and also high tech diagnostic equipment.\nNotes to editors\nAbout the legal case\nIn June, the GCL filed a complaint and a request for interim measures with the Belgian Competition Authority in Brussels alleging the FEI, the sport's governing body, was in breach of European Union competition law by using its rules to prevent riders from competing in events not approved by the FEI.\nOn July 28th the Belgian Competition Authority granted the interim measures and ordered the suspension of the FEI's \"exclusivity clause\", pending the investigation of the complaint. This prevented the FEI from sanctioning any riders participating in non-FEI approved events.\nThe clause prohibited riders from taking part in any non-FEI approved event for a period of six months prior to their participation in an FEI event. Given the year-round nature of world-class competitive show jumping, the exclusivity clause effectively banned riders from taking part in non-FEI events.\nAbout Global Champions Tour\nSince its launch in 2006, Global Champions Tour has revolutionised show jumping transforming the sport by attracting new audiences, staging events in ground-breaking locations and offering unprecedented prize money.
