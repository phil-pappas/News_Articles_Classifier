A 2013 study by the Sentencing Project found that police strategies that target black men and judges’ harsher sentences for minorities meant that one in three African-Americans born that year could expect to spend time in prison, compared with one in 17 white men. “After all the years I’ve been doing this work, I ask myself, ‘What is a crime, and what does the community want?’ ” Superintendent McCarthy, a chairman of the group, said. “When we’re arresting people for low-level offenses — narcotics — I’m not sure we’re achieving what we’ve set out to do. The system of criminal justice is not supporting what the community wants. It’s very obvious what needs to be done, and we feel the obligation as police chiefs to do this.” Chicago has seen a spike in shootings and homicides recently, but major crime has dropped by 39 percent since 2011, according to police statistics .

The law enforcement officials point out studies showing that more than one-third of prison and jail inmates have mental health or substance abuse problems, and are often in jail for crimes like drug possession and shoplifting. In addition to mass incarceration’s damaging social consequences, the group faulted the policy’s economics as unsustainable. A number of states in recent years have closed jails as state and local governments have struggled with budget shortfalls. Courts have ordered California, among other jurisdictions, to reduce overcrowding by offering early parole, modifying sentences or reducing the cost of bond to thousands of inmates. “We’re talking about using a scarce resource — beds in jails and prisons — in the most effective way,’” said Benjamin David, a member of the group and the district attorney for New Hanover and Pender Counties in North Carolina. “I would say to people, ‘Who would you rather have in there — a bank robber or an addict who is aggressively panhandling downtown?’ This is not a political issue, it is a moral issue.” The law enforcement officials said they would press Congress and state legislatures to reclassify some nonviolent felonies as misdemeanors and to eliminate some petty offenses from criminal codes. These changes, they said, would allow them to focus resources on those who have committed serious and violent crimes. The group has also pledged to repair rifts with the communities they serve and to advocate eliminating mandatory minimum sentences to give judges greater authority in punishments. “We are in the middle of a sea change focusing on who is in our prisons, why are they in there, and who is making the decisions,” said Mr. Vance, a member of the group’s steering committee. “At the end of the day, this is just common sense. This is nothing radical.” The group pointed to Florida’s Criminal Mental Health Project as an example of a program that had successfully provided mental health treatment to those who were arrested and in need of care instead of sending them to jail. The program , which provides training for the police to help people suffering from mental illness, led Miami police officers to arrest just nine of more than 10,000 people in response to mental health calls in 2013, according to the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in Florida, which operates the project. Previously, the majority of those cases would have led to arrests. Most people are brought to crisis stabilization facilities instead of jail, according to the project. The reduction in inmates has helped allow Miami-Dade County to close one of its jails. \nMichael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
