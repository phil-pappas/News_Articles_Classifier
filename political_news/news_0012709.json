It had revenue of $110 million in September, compared to $138 million in September 2014. \nDriskell said motor fuels tax collections have dropped sharply this fiscal year, which began July 1, due to a drop in the tax rate. \nShe also said motor vehicle usage tax receipts had been artificially high in the first two months of the fiscal year due to timing issues. That issue reversed in September, bringing a 26.3 percent decline, she said. \nThe official Road Fund revenue estimate calls for a 2.1 percent increase in receipts for the entire fiscal year, which ends next June 30, compared to last year's actual receipts. \nBased on collections so far this year, revenues must increase 5.8 percent for the remainder of this fiscal year to meet the estimate. If the estimate is not met, the state must make cuts in the Road Fund to meet the constitutional mandate of a balanced budget. \nGeneral Fund receipts for September were $945 million, compared to $920.6 million in September 2014. \nThe General Fund has grown 4.5 percent so far this fiscal year. \nIncome and sales taxes continue \"to be the engine of growth for Kentucky's fiscal economy,\" said Driskell. \nThe official General Fund revenue estimate for this fiscal year calls for revenue to grow 1 percent compared to last year's actual receipts. \nBased on September's results, General Fund revenue needs only to remain flat for the remainder of this fiscal year to meet the official estimate. \nA group of independent economists who predict how much money the state will take in — known as the Consensus Forecasting Group — will meet Tuesday to work on a revised forecast for the General and Road Funds for the next two fiscal years. \nThe state legislature and the governor will use the projections to write the next two-year state budget.
