Boehner has told Ryan that he is the only person who can unite the House GOP.\nBut an array of influential figures such as Ryan were reluctant to take McCarthy’s place as the consensus candidate of the party’s establishment. As they mulled and were courted, a parade of hopefuls with low profiles beyond Capitol Hill — such as Rep. Daniel Webster and Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz — made the case that they are ready to be a fresh face for an unsettled House.\nThe bench for the House GOP is sparse, emptied in recent years by the same forces that have vexed Boehner and McCarthy. Virginia’s Eric Cantor, then the majority leader and firmly in line to succeed Boehner, was defeated in a 2014 House primary by a conservative challenger, elevating McCarthy but gutting the leadership of the political capital that Cantor had accumulated.\nThe committee chairmanships, long a grooming area for future leaders, have been filled in places by youthful members such as Chaffetz, 48. And the leadership slots below Boehner and McCarthy — majority whip and chief deputy whip — are occupied by Steve Scalise and Patrick McHenry, both of whom have served in the House for a decade or less and are inexperienced as national spokesmen.\nRep. Peter King floated Rep. Tom Cole, a former House GOP campaign chairman, as a person who could be a calming presence. Several conservatives suggested House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) with his wife, Julie, after the nomination meeting where House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) dropped out of the race for speaker of the House, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 8, 2015. Chaffetz, who challenged McCarthy for the speaker�s chair, said he was �absolutely stunned� by his decision. �Our conference is going to have to do a lot of soul searching,� Chaffetz said.\nOthers on the right suggested Rep. Jim Jordan, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, but he said he is not interested.\nAnother House Republican who drew interest was Rep. Trey Gowdy, who is chairing the House Select Committee delving into the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. Also mulling their options are Rep. Peter Roskam; Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the conference chairwoman and the party’s highest-ranking woman, and House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price.\nYet none of those members seemed poised to follow in McCarthy’s footsteps as the front-runner for the gavel. They are all relatively popular with certain circles but few carry the same national political heft as Ryan or McCarthy.", "external_links": ["http://stmedia.stimg.co/1444356363_10101801+1chaff100915.JPG?w=263"], "published": "2015-10-09T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:16:17.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
