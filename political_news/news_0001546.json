Our practice in the past has been to forego opening statements to allow more time to address the critical issues that matter most to the American people. We started a dialogue yesterday with all of the campaigns involved and we will certainly take the candidates' views on the format into consideration as we finalize the debate structure.\"\nTrump also took to Twitter on Thursday to protest the terms of the debate.\n\"The @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party,\" he wrote.\n\".@CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials,\" he continued. \"Why is the @GOP being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring #DemDebate?\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/donald-trump-ben-carson-threaten-boycott-next-gop-debate-n445371", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:31:42.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
