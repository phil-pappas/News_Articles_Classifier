He also pledged to boost defense spending and gives states more control over Medicaid and welfare programs.\nKasich, who's struggling to stay in the nomination race, said his multifaceted economic approach is \"why some people just don't get me.\"\n\"Economic growth is not an end to itself,\" he said. \"We were able to take economic growth and the then spread a message that no one should be left behind. No one should have to live in the shadows,\" he said.\nKasich is one of several presidential hopefuls visiting Virginia, a competitive state expected to help decide the 2016 presidential contest. He's attempting to distinguish himself in the crowded primary field as a pragmatic leader rather than a party ideologue.\n\"Wouldn't you rather see people work together and be happier and more pleasant and more respectful of one another?\" he said.\nBill Montgomery, a Richmond resident who said he's a Kasich fan but remains undecided, said he thinks the governor does well in small town-hall settings but needs to show more passion to break out on the debate stage.\n\"I loved his style here, but he doesn't emote that as often when he's at the debates,\" the 66-year-old said.\n____\nFollow Alanna Durkin on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aedurkin", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/aedurkin"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:08:56.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
