Advertisement More by this Author \nThe feuding between Meru Governor Peter Munya and Senator Kiraitu Murungi boiled over this past week in what promises to be a titanic battle for the hearts and minds of Meru voters in a dress rehearsal for the 2017 General Election. \nOnly last Tuesday, the senator disowned an Alliance Party of Kenya (APK) meeting the county chief had called for yesterday, saying he had not followed the right channels in convening it. \n“I want to state categorically that the meeting convened by Governor Peter Munya on Saturday this week is not by any means an APK meeting but rather his own personal meeting with his supporters,” he fired, prompting the governor to retaliate. \nYesterday, a defiant Mr Munya took off his gloves and hosted APK delegates who resolved to form another party once Mr Murungi has wound up the party. They also endorsed him as a 2022 presidential candidate. \nMr Munya opposed the formation on JAP saying tending towards single large parties would kill democracy and criticized Mr Murungi for supporting it. \nSaid the Meru governor; “I will revive the dream of Mt Kenya East region by forming another party come December despite BUS party being dissolved.” \nMr Murungi has assembled all the elected MPs to his side, sidelining the governor. But the firebrand governor says he does not owe his current position to the senator and has asked him to be ready for an epic fight. \nAt the core of the dispute is a declaration by Senator Murungi three weeks ago that he would be seeking to replace Mr Munya in the 2017 polls, a matter the feisty governor is not taking lying down. They both belong to APK, with the senator as party leader and the governor as director of elections. \nTheir fights have now permeated to vernacular stations. \nMr Murungi first made the announcement at a meeting that brought Mt Kenya East’s Ameru and Aembu communities together in what is part of a plot to assert themselves in the national political arena and demand a bigger role in the post-Uhuru era, more than two decades after sticking to political arrangements made jointly with their larger Central Kenya cousins. \nThe Meru, Embu and Tharaka-Nithi counties that make up Mount Kenya East bloc have always voted with Central Kenya under the loose Gema (Gikuyu, Embu and Meru Association) political arrangement. But an aspect of fatigue seems to be setting in, with a feeling that the rules of engagement need to be amended to accord them a place at the political high table. \n“It was a stormy meeting largely because the participants felt that the Jubilee administration has not fulfilled its campaign promises to them. From the discussion, the government’s scorecard in the region is below 30 per cent. \nThey want projects completed before 2017 polls, or else there is no guaranteed support for Mr Kenyatta’s re-election,” outspoken Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi, who moderated one of the sessions, told the Sunday Nation. \nThe meeting saw Senator Murungi officially wind up APK, popularly known as the Mbus, a move already protested by the governor who says it ushers in party dictatorship. \n“I want to announce here today that there is no more Mbus (APK). Like the deputy leader, Senator Lenny Kivuti, will confirm to you, we are all joining JAP. \n“After consulting widely, I will be vying for the last time in 2017. I have decided to crown my legacy at home (Meru) where my people can easily access me without the punishing distance to Nairobi. The 2017 campaign will be like no other, it will be the battle of my life and, make no mistake, we will win,” Mr Murungi, also a poet, said evoking Churchilian rhetoric. \n“Even as we are told otherwise, I insist that folding parties to form only a few is not progressive and will not nurture democracy,” the governor would later retort. \nA vote basket with about 1.1 million registered voters, the region could certainly deny Mr Kenyatta a second term were it to craft a new alliance in 2017 polls. \nAnd so, if actualised, this political renaissance would no doubt disturb the power balance the region has known over the years. Central Kenya has always bargained for alliances with other regions in the assumption that Mount Kenya East is already in its basket. \nA communique they issued afterwards returns a verdict of a people who feel taken advantage of. \nThe region supported retired President Mwai Kibaki in his two terms as well as Mr Kenyatta in 2013. \nIt took the convincing of Mr Murungi to have the hostile crowd agree to continue supporting Jubilee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:52:43.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
