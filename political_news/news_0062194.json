Credit Mike Stone/Reuters Senator Ted Cruz has further shored up conservative support of his presidential bid in his home state of Texas. The campaign announced that Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick will serve as the chairman of his campaign in Mr. Cruz’s home state of Texas. Mr. Patrick is a favorite of Tea Party conservatives in the state. “Dan is a conservative warrior,” Mr. Cruz said in a statement. “He knows and loves Texas and understands how important the Lone Star State is to winning the nomination.” Mr. Cruz also announced that six Texas business leaders who had been helping lead former Gov. Rick Perry’s finance efforts for president have joined his campaign’s fund-raising efforts in the state, which currently have raised over $10.9 million in Texas. The two announcements help Mr. Cruz further consolidate support in Texas, where some of his Republican rivals like Jeb Bush also enjoy deep ties to the state. Texas will play a major role in the Republican presidential contests, having moved up its nominating contest to March 1 , its 155 delegates the biggest available haul for Super Tuesday. Fri.
