The ICC, he said, should be left alone to make rulings based on the evidence presented in court. \nREAD: We’ll not be bullied, Hague judges insist \n“There has been unending stream of clamour in the Kenyan media about the proceedings in this case. This is an odd contact that has been observed even before the commencement of evidential hearing in the case indicating divided sentiments on either side of the case,” said the judge who also warned that the court would not be bullied by political statements to make favourable rulings. \nBut the MPs who were in a defiant mood yesterday said the warning by the ICC judge raised questions about its independence and integrity. They wondered at whose behest the notice was issued and for whose benefit. \n“This raises fundamental questions on the general independence and integrity of the court: on whose behalf, at whose behest, on whose motion and for what benefit was the Court acting in making this bizarre intervention?” they asked. \nReferring to the Trial Chamber’s decision to allow Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to use recanted evidence from hostile witnesses, they argued that a court that changes its rules midway through a trial cannot run away from criticism. They said that was why MPs have petitioned the Assembly of State Parties and the UN Security Council to audit the way the ICC has handled Kenya’s cases. \n“We will resist at all costs, by all means and at all times, any forms of dictatorship from any quarter, including the ICC,” they said. \nREAD: Ruto suffers blow after ICC judges allow use of evidence by five hostile witnesses \nWRONG TURN \nIt is unusual for an ongoing case, even in the local courts, to become the subject of public debate. \nAs the MPs spoke, Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi and the Jubilee Alliance Party Vice Chairman, Mr David Murathe, warned that the debate on who fixed Mr Ruto at The Hague was taking the wrong turn. Political analyst Larry Gumbe, an associate of ODM leader Raila Odinga, also issued a similar warning. \nMr Mudavadi, speaking by phone, cautioned that the debate was likely to revive the hostilities of the 2007/8 post-election violence, which had long been buried. \n“This debate is taking us nowhere... It will reopen wounds which have started healing,” he said. \nREAD: Mudavadi: Prayer rallies creating tribal acrimony \nMr Murathe hit out at Mr Odinga for attempting to drag President Uhuru Kenyatta’s name into the allegations of fixing Mr Ruto and claimed that leaders who were taken to The Hague were taking bullets aimed at others. \n“Raila should think twice about what he is saying. He was the ODM candidate and Ruto took his bullet. We do not want to get to a point where we will bring up those who contested the presidency in 2007,” he said. \nREAD: Reveal your role in the Ruto case, Raila challenges Uhuru \nProf Gumbe urged politicians to be careful with their utterances, which he warned could easily whip up political and ethnic emotions. \n“We need to be a bit careful because there are people on trial who need justice. What we are witnessing is whipping up of emotions which could take us back. \n“All we need is a functional justice and truth reconciliation mechanism,” he said on phone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:58:58.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
