For some of those ballots, election administrators will be using new voting machines as Colorado plans a statewide upgrade.\nEight counties will be testing one of four new machines in the off-year elections. Those are Adams, Denver, Douglas, Garfield, Gilpin, Jefferson and Teller counties.\nColorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams says that one of the four will likely be chosen as the new model statewide. Colorado currently has a patchwork of 10 different types of voting systems.\nThe upgrade to a new statewide voting machine will cost about $10 million to $15 million, with counties picking up the cost. A voting machine will be chosen by 2016, with counties free to upgrade whenever they're ready.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:06:50.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
