After Ashish Hooda removed Gautam Gambhr (18), trapped in front of the stumps nine overs in to the day, followed by the wicket of young wicketkeeper-batsman Mohit Ahlawat (0) off successive deliveries, Chand and Rana steadied the ship for the hosts.\nWhile Chand was at his fluent best early on, executing a couple of fine off-drives, he seemed rattled and suffered a lapse of concentration with the fall of two quick wickets. He went after some wide deliveries, missing quite a lot of his slashes. Rana, at the other end, opted for a more dogged approach. Going in to lunch, Delhi were comfortably placed at 125 for 2, but Harshal's eight-over spell, his third of the day, shifted the momentum in Haryana's favour.\nOffspinner Jayant Yadav opened the floodgates with the wicket of well-set Chand for 68. Going onto the backfoot, Chand was rapped on his thigh pads, but was given out. Not amused, Chand stood for a while, staring at the umpire even as Yadav was mobbed by his team in celebration.\nHarshal, brought back in to the attack, cleaned up Milind Kumar with a delivery that kept low and then proceeded to remove Yogesh Nagar (4), caught by wicketkeeper Nitin Saini. Manan Sharma (4) perished going after a wide one, nicking it behind the wicket where the Saini completed a good catch diving to his left full-length.\nHarshal's third spell read 8-0-27-3 and if it was not for a no-ball, he would have had his fourth in the form of Rana.\nRana played a flick a second too early and his leading edge was well caught at short midwicket, but the third umpire found Harshal overstepping. The batsman, however, could not capitalise on the chance and was out after adding one more run to his total, losing his stumps to Hooda.\nSimilar to their last two games, Delhi's middle-order crumbled and left it for the tail to score the crucial runs.\nPradeep Sangwan and Sarang Rawat did exactly the same.\nThe duo wielded their bat at will and got together for 37 runs for the eighth wicket that helped Delhi overtake Haryana's total. With one six and six fours, Sangwan (34) took Delhi past the 200-run mark before Yadav polished off the tail removing him, Rawat (26) and Parvinder Awana (0), but not before the hosts had gained a lead of 42 runs.\nIn Haryana's second essay, Gambhir gave one over to pacer Sangwan and then operated with spinners from both ends to utilise the lack of bounce on the Kotla track. Milind gave his skipper the desired result by trapping Chaitanya Bishnoi (3) leg before wicket. Sehwag walked out to the middle and stroked three boundaries too start well, but after losing Rahul Dewan (15) to Sangwan, consolidated the innings with young Himanshu Rana (12*) in a cautious manner.\nBrief Scores: Haryana 68/2 (Virender Sehwag 29*; Milind Kumar 1/0) & 195 (Jayant Yadav 41; Manan Sharma 5/57) lead Delhi 237 (Unmukt Chand 68; Jayant Yadav 4/78) by 26 runs Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:44:39.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
