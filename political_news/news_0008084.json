The working group — requested by Mayor Michael Hancock's city attorney, Scott Martinez — could result in wider support for potential changes before they are taken to the council.\nBut that extra step also could slow the process. On Wednesday, chairman Brian Spano told fellow board members that he was determined to avoid a stall-out and was optimistic, given that Martinez had agreed to co-chair the working group with him.\nThe working group will include representatives from the city, the public and the mayor's office, Spano said. He also wants to include the League of Women Voters of Denver, Colorado Common Cause and another ethics board member.\n\"I'm not cynical, and I'm actually encouraged by that because the city attorney is prepared to put his name and associate his name with potential changes to the code,\" Spano said.\nStill, Spano, a Denver attorney, said he was skeptical at first.\nAdvertisement \"My immediate reaction to that was (that) I'm fine having those who have an interest in expressing their views about possible changes to the code to do so,\" he said, \"but I did not want to see this drag out. ... So I've received assurances that won't happen.\"\nSpano said he hoped to get the working group formed and have an initial meeting in the next 30 days, with the panel meeting three or four times before recommending changes.\nIt will use as a baseline the most recent list cobbled together over the last year during discussions by the board, Spano said.\nAmong the biggest potential changes: Setting a maximum annual value of $250 per donor or business for gifts of meals and event tickets to an official or employee in position to take action that benefits the donor; expanding the definition in the conflict-of-interest rules of family members who can't benefit from contracts or official action; adding restrictions on soliciting donations for the city or outside charities or nonprofits; and closing a loophole that allows for-profit organizations to funnel potentially barred gifts through nonprofit groups.\nThe last item has gained notice from the administration. Hancock came under fire last year for the financing of his trip to the Super Bowl and was dinged by the ethics board , though it found no wrongdoing.\nThe ethics board is still considering other ideas, including expanding rules governing outside employment and side jobs by city employees.\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or @JonMurray", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:11:39.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
