Published: 2 hours ago. Updated: 10/13/2015 at 10:24 PM Text smaller Democrats in Oct. 13, 2015, CNN debate (Photo: CNN screenshot) \nBy Garth Kant and Chelsea Schilling \nWASHINGTON – The moment drew the wildest applause of the night at the first Democratic debate of the 2016 campaign when Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders turned to frontrunner Hillary Clinton and declared: “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!” \nFive Democratic Party presidential candidates met Tuesday night in Las Vegas for the big event sponsored by CNN and Facebook: Clinton, Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. and Sen. Lincoln Chafee. \nThe debate, which began at 8:30 p.m. EST, was televised by CNN from the Wynn hotel and casino in Las Vegas. \nCNN host Anderson Cooper moderated, and he was joined by co-moderators Juan Carlos Lopez of CNN en Español, and CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash. Cooper has been listed as a “notable past member” of the Clinton Global Initiative , but he denied claims of his connection to the Clintons, calling the Weekly Standard reports “total bunk.” \nEmailgate \nAs the debate turned to Clinton’s email scandal, she blamed Republicans for her woes and declared: “Tonight, I want to talk not about my emails, but about what the American people want from the next president of the United States.” \nClinton continued, “Let’s just take a minute here and point out that this committee is basically an arm of the Republican National Committee. It is a partisan vehicle, as admitted by the House Republican Majority Leader, Mr. McCarthy, to drive down my poll numbers. Big surprise. And that’s what they have attempted to do. I am still standing. I am happy to be part of this debate, and I intend to keep talking about the issues that matter to the American people.” \nSanders interrupted, “Let me say something that may not be great politics. But I think the secretary is right. And that is that the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!” \nThose comments drew the loudest applause of the evening. \n“Thank you!” Clinton declared, laughing loudly. “Me too, me too.” \nShe turned to Sanders and shook his hand. \nCooper turned to Chafee: “I know that plays well in this room, but I’ve got to be honest, Gov. Chafee, for the record, on the campaign trail, you said a different thing. You said this is a huge issue. Standing here, in front of Secretary Clinton, are you willing to say that to her face?” \n“Absolutely,” replied Chafee, adding: “I think we need someone who has the best in ethical standards as our next president. That’s how I feel.” \nCooper then turned to Clinton: “Sec. Clinton, do you want to respond?” \n“No,” she replied, smiling as the crowd cheered wildly. \n‘I can to heal the divides’ \nEarlier in the evening, the action began with CNN declaring in its opening that Clinton’s “enemies are up to their old tricks.” \nSanders drew applause when he called for Americans to mobilize and “take back our government from the hands of billionaires.” \nClinton said the U.S. must go beyond raising the minimum wage to “finding ways to make the companies share the profits they make.” She said the wealthy must “pay their fair share,” and American families should receive paid family leave. \n“For me, this is about bringing our country together again,” Clinton said. “And I will do everything I can to heal the divides.” She cited racial, gender and income “divides.” \nHillary claimed she does not change her position on issues, arguing that she has been “very consistent” during the course of her life. \n“Like most people I know, I have a range of views, but they are rooted in my values and experiences,” she said. \nAsked whether she is a progressive or moderate, Clinton replied, “I’m progressive, but I’m a progressive who likes to get things done.” She accused Republicans of “never having a good word to say about me.” \nClinton added, “I don’t take a back seat to anyone when it comes to progressive experience and progressive commitment.” \nWhen asked if a socialist can win an election in the U.S., Sanders declared, “In a rigged economy, 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent. … When you look around the world, you see every other major country providing health care for all people as a right except the U.S.” \nGuns and Oregon massacre \nOn the issue of guns and the mass shooting in Oregon, Clinton declared, “We have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on for too long, and it’s time the entire country stood up against the [National Rifle Association].” She demanded that gun manufacturers be held accountable for shootings and accused Sanders of voting five times against the Brady bill. \nSanders interjected, “All the shouting in the world is not going to do what, I would hope, all of us want, and that is keeps guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns, and end this horrible violence that we are seeing.” \nWebb, who once held an A rating from the NRA, said the real issue is “who should be kept from having guns and using firearms.” He said many of these individuals are criminals and gang members, but others are mentally incapacitated. He said Americans should be subject to background checks, and guns should be kept from people who shouldn’t have them. He noted that some people have armed bodyguards, and average Americans don’t have armed security to protect them. \nSyria and Iraq \nOn the issue of Syria, Sanders called the situation a “quagmire in a quagmire.” \n“I will do everything that I can to make sure that the United States does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in Iraq, the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country,” he said. “I do not support ground troops in Iraq.” \nClinton replied, “Nobody does, senator.” \nChafee agreed with Sanders’ assessment of Clinton’s authorization of force in Iraq: “We just heard Sen. Sanders say it was the worst decision in American history. So, as we look ahead, if you’re going to make those poor judgment calls at a critical time in our history … we just finished with the Vietnam era, getting back into another quagmire, if you’re looking ahead, and you’re looking at someone who made that poor decision in 2002 to go into Iraq when there was no real evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. … I know, because I did my homework, and so that’s an indication of how someone will perform in the future, and that’s important.” \nClinton, the current front-runner and an experienced and aggressive debater, is getting an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sanders, an insurgent 74-year-old and self-described socialist who is generally considered far outside the political mainstream. Although he is running for the Democratic Party nomination, Sanders is still listed as an independent by the government’s Senate website . \nBenghazi \nAsked whether she should have seen the Benghazi attack coming, Clinton said a “murderous dictator” was “threatening to massacre large numbers of the Libyan people,” and Arabs wanted the U.S. to help deal with Moammar Gadhafi \n“Our response, which I think was smart power at its best, is that the United States will not lead this; we will provide essential, unique capabilities that we have, but the Europeans and the Arabs had to be first over the line. \n“We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya,” she said. \nWall Street \nAfter Sanders railed against Wall Street, Clinton told him: “I respect your passion and intensity. I represented Wall Street as a senator from New York, and I went to Wall Street in December of 2007 – before the big crash we had – and I basically said, ‘Cut it out. Quit foreclosing on homes. Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.’ \n“I took on the Bush administration for the same thing. So I have thought deeply and long about what we’re going to do, to do exactly what I think both the senator and the governor want, which is to rein in and stop this risk. \n“And my plan would have the potential of actually sending the executives to jail. Nobody went to jail after a $100 billion in fines were paid. … I’m tellin’ you, I’ll say it tonight, if only you look at the big banks, you may be missing the forest for the trees. We’ve gotta look at all the other financial institutions.” \nClinton vs. Sanders in the polls \nUnless Vice President Joe Biden jumps into the fray, it is still a two-person race, with only Clinton and Sanders in double-digits among the declared candidates. In the five months since Sanders announced his candidacy, he has shot up in the polls from 6 to 25 percent. \nIn fact, the three other declared contenders are not even in the single digits, though they hoped to have breakout moments in the first debate. Not one of them – not Webb, O’Malley or Chafee – even registers one point: All three poll at less than 1 percent. \nThe latest poll numbers in the Democratic race from RealClearPolitics, which averages the top polls : Clinton: 43.3 percent", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:28:24.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
