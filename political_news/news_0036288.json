Starting Oct. 13, DCTV programming will be split into Channel 9 for educational programs, Channel 18 for government access and Channel 95 for public access. “We’ve expanded so much we really can’t repeat much on one channel,” Marland said. “We are doing more and more with residents and high school students.” It’s a positive step for the 20-year organization, said Chairman Shawn McDonald at Monday’s meeting. “I look forward to it and I hope residents will too,” he said. “We’ll see what creative minds we have in town.” DCTV is also in the process of rolling out its new website www.DartmouthTV.com which has details about the expansion. With three channels and five full-time staff, the station will also begin to provide production classes to interested residents who may want to produce their own shows, said Derek Frates, cable access coordinator. Chinese restaurant to expand In other business, the Select Board approved expansion plans for Ying Dynasty, 724A Dartmouth St., a longtime Chinese restaurant. Owner Ying Zhao recently leased the long unused 3,000-square-foot space next door and plans to expand the bar with 20 more seats and the restaurant by 60 more seats, said his lawyer Pamela Gauvin. He will also hire 10 or 12 more people to support the expansion. Doing business there for about 14 years, Zhao said he hopes the expansion can be completed this month. No one except the applicants attended the public hearing. Dartmouth, Devon issues an invite Dartmouth has long enjoyed a close relationship with the small seacoast town of Dartmouth in Devon, England but a recent invite has raised hopes that the relationship may soon be formalized. Devon recently invited up to 20 people to visit for six days next May and may sign a Sister City protocol to cement relations, said Sheila Koot and Nicole Jackman, Sister City co-chairs. Dartmouth hosted representatives from the sister town during its 350th celebration last year, including Mayor Rob Lyon and his wife, and are now looking to return the favor. The co-chairs will meet with Town Administrator Cressman to figure out the costs and the guest list. The town may pay for the airfares of visiting town officials, said Koot who has visited twice. Dartmouth has Sister City protocols signed with three Portuguese towns and it helps promote educational and cultural exchange, officials said.
