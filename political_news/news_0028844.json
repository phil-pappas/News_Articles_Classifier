Even more so when they are another individual's fault. Now imagine that there is no way to hold the faulty party accountable. What happens if they hit a car, then just simply drive away? Hastings & Hastings offers advice on what to do if a driver is involved in a hit and run accident.\nPHOENIX , Oct. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Department of Motor Vehicles defines a hit and run as, \"any accident in which a driver intentionally leaves the scene without providing contact information.\" Parking lots are a common location for hit and run accidents to occur. If a driver hits a parked car, and the damaged car's owner is not present, the at-fault driver is obligated to leave their contact information. Hit and runs may also happen on the road, when the at-fault driver speeds off, and attempts to evade identification.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151006/274728LOGO\nThe number one priority for a driver who has been the victim of a hit and run accident, is to gather information. The goal is to be able to eventually identify the at-fault driver, and hold them accountable for the damages. At the earliest possible moment, following the occurrence of the accident, drivers should write down the make, model, color, and license plate number of the vehicle that hit them. Forgetting this information could make the process of identifying the driver extremely difficult.\nIt will also help to write down the time, date, and location of the accident. Drivers should also take pictures of the scene of the accident, as well as their car. Sometimes, paint will scrape off of one car, onto another. This paint could aid in identifying the at-fault car.\nHastings & Hastings advises that calling the police, and having a police report filed, is of paramount importance. Even if police are not able to quickly apprehend the guilty party, it is crucial that the accident be officially documented. This documentation will be very important when insurance companies become involved.\nIf the at-fault driver is never identified, drivers can file an uninsured motorist claim on their own policy, if they have that coverage. If the at-fault driver is identified, a claim can be made against the at-fault driver's insurance.\nHastings & Hastings acknowledges the stress and frustration of being the victim of a hit and run accident, and wishes every such unfortunate driver the best of luck in seeking justice.\nAbout Hastings & Hastings\nHastings & Hastings is an Arizona consumer law firm.
