Bush signed the USA PATRIOT Act, an anti-terrorism law drawn up in response to the 9/11 attacks. The act is an acronym for “Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism.” Its intent, in Bush’s words, is to “enhance the penalties that will fall on terrorists or anyone who helps them.”\nThe act increased intelligence agencies’ ability to share information and lifted prior restrictions on communications surveillance. Law enforcement officials received broader mandates to probe financial counterfeiting, smuggling and money-laundering schemes that funded terrorists. An expanded definition of terrorism gave the FBI increased powers to access personal medical and financial records.\nSome of the act's provisions were due to sunset in 2006. Supporters pressed to make the legislation permanent, while critics sought to revise it to bolster civil-liberty shields. The Senate made substantial changes, while the House reauthorization bill permanently retained most of the original language. The final bill removed most of the Senate changes. It passed on March 2, 2006; Bush signed it into law seven days later.\nOn May 26, 2011, President Barack Obama signed a four-year extension of three key provisions of the PATRIOT Act, including enabling roving wiretaps, searches of business records and the right to shadow “lone wolves”—people suspected of terrorist-related activities but not linked to known terrorist groups.\nPassage of the USA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015, restored parts of the act that had expired on the previous day and renewed them through 2019. However, Congress amended Section 215 to bar the National Security Agency from continuing its mass phone data collection program. Instead, phone companies now retain the data; the NSA can obtain information about targeted individuals only through a federal court order.\nSOURCE: WWW.HISTORY.COM\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:19:14.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
