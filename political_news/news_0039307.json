Although enacted under the NDA, the 99th Constitution amendment for setting up the NJAC marked the fruition of a process which had started under the UPA for restoring to executive the say it had in the appointment of members of higher judiciary.\nHowever, with tensions running high between the government and the opposition, the Centre seems wary that sections of opposition, particularly Congress, may not agree to back it in any standoff with the judiciary.\nThe estimate stems from Congress's opposition to the GST bill, another legislation conceived under the UPA, and could have been strengthened further by the main opposition party's statement terming the SC order an expression of lack of confidence in the government.\nThe government is likely to gauge the mood by starting consultations with political parties and following that up by convening an all-party meeting to examine the feasibility of a fresh shy at the collegium system which it considers to be at odds with the spirit of the Constitution.\nSources in the government said while the Constitution clearly provided for the primacy of the executive in the appointment of judges, judiciary wrested the power and turned it into its prerogative. \"From the position where judiciary had a collaborative and consultative role, we were brought to a situation where the judges have not just acquired primacy but, in fact, an exclusive say. This is not a case of simple overreach. They subverted the original constitutional design to come up with something different,\" said a top ranking government source.\nHe also said the SC's grudging acknowledgement that the collegium system had not worked well and needed to be fixed also raised the vexed question as to whose job should it be to enact the law needed for the purpose.
