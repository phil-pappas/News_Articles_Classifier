It will implement a settlement agreement between support workers, service providers, unions, DHBs and the Crown. \nThe settlement agreement also sets out an agreed process for investigating transitioning this important workforce towards a more regularised employment model. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
