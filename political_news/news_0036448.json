Major Bradley Podliska, who was fired from the committee in June after about 10 months on the job, told CNN the panel has veered off its original course to investigate the Sept. 11, 2012 attack that left four Americans dead — instead zeroing in on Clinton following news that she used private email while Secretary of State.\nThe segment, to be broadcast on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, is sure to feed the partisan fire surrounding the committee, which has been on defense for more than a week after comments Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) made suggesting the committee’s work has hurt Clinton on the 2016 campaign trail, where she is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.\nA GOP Benghazi panel spokesman in a statement called Podliska's allegations “transparently false.”\nThe committee says Podliska was let go in part because he had classified information on an unsecured system and because he tried to “develop and direct Committee resources to a PowerPoint ‘hit piece’ on members of the Obama Administration – including Secretary Clinton – that bore no relationship whatsoever to the Committee’s current investigative tone, focus or investigative plan.”\n“Thus, directly contrary to his brand new assertion, the employee actually was terminated, in part, because he himself manifested improper partiality and animus in his investigative work,” the committee statement says. “The Committee vigorously denies all of his allegations. Moreover, once legally permitted to do, the Committee stands ready to prove his termination was legal, justified, and warranted - on multiple levels.”\nThe Air Force Reserve intelligence officer, who told CNN that he himself is a Republican, said he’s planning to file a lawsuit against the panel next month for wrongful termination after “resisting pressure to focus his investigative efforts solely on the State Department and Clinton's role surrounding the Benghazi attack,\" reads a CNN preview.\nHe also alleges he was fired for taking time off the job to fulfill his military duties.\n\"I was fired for going on military service and I was fired for trying to conduct an objective, non-partisan, thorough investigation,\" Podliska will say, according to the CNN preview.\nA lawyer for Podliska could not be reached Saturday evening to confirm that report, but Democrats and the Clinton campaign seized on the story, blasting it out to reporters and holding it up as proof that the panel is, as they’ve said all along, a political circus.\n“These are explosive allegations,” said campaign spokesman Brian Fallon in a statement. “This Republican whistleblower's account from inside the Benghazi Committee may provide the most definitive proof to date that this taxpayer-funded investigation has been a partisan sham from the start.”\nNews of the dispute comes at a critical time for the committee, which will interview Clinton on Oct. 22.\nThe Benghazi panel by and large has not been out-front on the Clinton emails issue. Rather, Senate Chairmen Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) on the Homeland Committee and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on the Judiciary panel have taken the lead subpoenaing documents from Platte River Networks and other IT firms that oversaw Clinton’s server while prodding the intelligence community and the FBI to look into whether classified information was ever mishandled.\nThe closest the committee has come to the email probe was in September, when the panel called Clinton’s former top tech adviser, Bryan Pagliano, in for questioning about her email arrangement. The panel said their main focus of that interview was simply ensuring that all Clinton’s work emails were turned over, particularly after uncovering several Clinton undisclosed emails from another source that they say should have been turned over.\nPodliska will say on CNN Sunday morning that the committee told him he was fired because he used a work email account to send social invitations to colleagues, assigned an intern to do an “unauthorized project” and had classified information on an unclassified network. He disputes all three, according to the preview of the segment.\nBut Podliska will say his firing had more to do with his unwillingness to focus his probe solely on Clinton and State — something the panel says it’s not doing — and a leave of absence he took to fulfill military service obligations.\nThe panel also denied what it called an “outlandish” allegation about punishing him for taking time off for the military, noting that his former supervisor is an ex-Judge Advocate General of the United States Army.\nThe Benghazi panel spokesman said the Podliska dispute has been ongoing for a while but he had not mentioned anything about the committee narrowing in on Clinton until the CNN story broke Saturday. Podliska told CNN he was only now talking about the matter because of the panel’s continued focus on Clinton.\n\"I'm scared. I'm nervous. I know that this is, you know, I'm going up against powerful people in Washington. But at the end of the day I need to live with myself,\" he is Quote: d saying in the CNN report. \"I told my wife, I will view myself as a coward if I don't do the right thing here.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:01:44.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
