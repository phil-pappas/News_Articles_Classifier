The move comes after the government found ITT was failing to comply with previous orders to improve its financial controls.\nThe Education Department says in a letter sent to the company Monday that ITT failed to properly track the federal grants and loans it distributes to students since at least 2009. ITT schools will now be allowed to pay out federal education funds to students only after they have attended classes and been certified as eligible by a school representative.\nITT operates vocational colleges attended by 50,000 students in 27 states. It did not immediately respond to phone and email messages left at its corporate headquarters Monday evening.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
