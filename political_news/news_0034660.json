David Vitter spent the summer on a glide path to becoming Louisiana's next governor. But even if Vitter earns a spot in the general election after Saturday's all-party primary, the Republican's ascension to the governor's mansion is in serious trouble. Vitter is still blessed with the most financial backing of any of the candidates and near-universal name recognition in the state. But over the past few months, his approval ratings have slipped underwater after Vitter's opponents — including two fellow Republicans — have spent significant time and money rehashing Vitter's 2007 prostitution scandal.\nMost polls suggest that the lone Democrat, state Rep. John Bel Edwards, is a near-lock to qualify for the Nov. 21 runoff election. Vitter has consistently placed second, but the size of his lead over two fellow Republicans, Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, has varied from double digits in some polls, to within the margin of error in others.\nEdwards has thus far been content to stay out of the intra-GOP warfare that has dominated the race. Angelle escalated the rhetoric earlier this week during a televised debate, directing a statewide audience to a blog posting unsubstantiated allegations about Vitter and prostitutes. Vitter in 2007 admitted committing a \"serious sin\" after allegations linking him to a Washington brothel — but has avoided questions about the scandal since. Vitter campaign spokesman Luke Bolar called the allegations a \"story on a shady blog that’s been proven completely untrue.\"\n\"There is a shadow that has been cast over Sen. Vitter, a shadow that if it continues, will follow Louisiana,\" Angelle said at the debate at Louisiana State University. \"When that follows Louisiana, it hurts our ability to create jobs. It hurts our ability to grow our economy. We can’t have a cavalier attitude about this.\"\nDardenne also hasn't been afraid to reference the scandal. At a candidate forum in late August, Dardenne was asked what separated him from Vitter. His answer: \"I have not frequented prostitution, especially not on the floor of the U.S. Congress.\"\nObama says all lives matter By Sarah Wheaton\nVitter, who has been criticized by his opponents for skipping debates, wasn't in attendance to respond directly to Angelle, but his campaign views the rocks thrown at him as a sign of strength.\n\"Our three opponents and five super PACs are all running the same campaign, spending millions against me, which tells us I’m leading in this race, and they know I will reform their good ol' boy style of politics,\" the senator said in a statement.\nAngelle and Dardenne are using the scandal to make an explicit appeal to Republican voters: A vote for Vitter now will increase Democrats' chances of winning back the governor's mansion. Two anti-Vitter PACs, one funded by more than $1 million from a single Baton Rouge law firm, have also run ads directly attacking Vitter over the scandal.\nDave Carney, a New Hampshire-based consultant working for Dardenne, hasn't been shy about posting the allegations on his Twitter account. He said Republicans in the state need to be warned about the risk of pitting Vitter head-to-head with Edwards.\n\"This is just a tease of what [the blogger] is going to release during the runoff,\" he said. \"And you'll have [Vitter] against John Bel Edwards, a pro-gun, pro-life, West Point Democrat.\"\nCross, Angelle's campaign manager, agreed. \"David Vitter is a direct threat to Republicans holding the governorship,\" he said.\nThe senator's campaign has noted then-Democratic Rep. Charlie Melancon similarly tried to use the 2007 prostitution scandal against Vitter during their 2010 Senate race. Vitter won the contest, 57 percent to 38 percent.\nVitter apologized in 2007 for a \"serious sin in my past\" after his phone number was included in a list of client numbers kept by Deborah Jane Palfrey, known as the D.C. Madam. (Palfrey killed herself in 2008 shortly after her conviction on federal racketeering and money laundering charges.) Since then, other admitted prostitutes in the New Orleans area have stepped forward to claim they also had encounters with Vitter.\nVitter rarely speaks to the media and has largely avoided questions about the scandal. At a debate earlier in the race, an attendee asked Vitter if he had ever violated the state's criminal code.\n\"I've spoken about my past and how my family has dealt with that,\" Vitter said, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. \"If that's not good enough for you, then that's not good enough. But it's good enough for Wendy [Vitter's wife].\"\nWendy Vitter is also starring in a Vitter campaign ad . \"Do I think David Vitter has the courage and vision we need to turn Louisiana around?\" Wendy asks in the ad. \"I don't think it. I know it.\"\nObama: Death penalty 'deeply troubling' By Nick Gass\nThe scandal hasn't slowed Vitter's career. He has served as both a gadfly — his relentless campaign to force congressional staffers onto Obamacare exchanges has aggravated members of both parties — and a bipartisan dealmaker with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) on transportation funding and with Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) on chemical safety reform. Three GOP presidential hopefuls — former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — have backed his gubernatorial bid.\nVitter's lead over the other Republicans running in the all-party primary has varied from double-digits in some polls to within the margin of error in others. | AP Photo\n\"I’ve had the pleasure of serving with David Vitter in the U.S. Senate, and he and I have fought side-by-side over and over again,\" Cruz wrote in an email to supporters this week. \"Together, we've led the fight against President Obama's unconstitutional amnesty, and together, we've led the fight to defund Planned Parenthood.\"\nVitter's fundraising, boosted by Louisiana's plentiful oil and gas money, has consistently blown away his opponents. A month out from the election, Vitter and his super PAC, the Fund for Louisiana's Future, had $7.1 million on hand combined. The forces aligned against him, including the three major candidates, two super PACs boosting the other Republicans and two PACs set up explicitly to oppose him, had just $5.6 million in total.\nThat warchest has enabled a barrage of negative ads aimed at Dardenne and Angelle. The Vitter campaign has run ads claiming Dardenne \"even voted to stop illegals from coming to take our jobs.\" Vitter's super PAC has dubbed the state's No. 2 official \"double-dipping Dardenne\" and accused him of using taxpayer money for Valentine's Day and birthday vacations to Europe. The same super PAC has also run spots linking Angelle to a deadly sinkhole and accused both men of abusing privileges given to government employees. A Vitter campaign spot also claims Angelle \"has a lot in common with Obama\" and cites Breitbart.com to claim Angelle expanded the \"Obamaphone\" program.\nAngelle and Dardenne dismiss the charges. The so-called \"Obamaphone\" program actually began under Ronald Reagan, Angelle's campaign notes. Dardenne says he took his wife to Europe, but she paid her own way, and his campaign argues they played a key role in boosting tourism. Many pro-business Republicans voted with Dardenne on the immigration bill Vitter cites.\nMegyn Kelly to Jeb Bush: Will you drop out? By Eliza Collins\nThe normally mild-mannered and moderate Dardenne is clearly bothered by the attacks. In his final ad of the contest, he speaks directly to the camera and accuses Vitter of orchestrating a \"second Louisiana purchase,\" using out-of-state campaign money. In Angelle's closing-argument TV ad , he ends with a declaration that he will \"never embarrass you\" and calls himself the state's \"trusted conservative.\"\nBut his image has steadily eroded over the course of the campaign. A automated Harper Polling survey of Louisiana voters conducted last week found 56 percent had a negative image of Vitter, while only 36 percent viewed him favorably. By contrast, 61 percent of voters had a favorable opinion of Edwards, and 29 percent viewed him unfavorably.\nEven in the weeks leading up to the primary, Republicans were concerned what had been an almost-certain hold for the GOP was in danger. The Republican Governors Association has been running television ads for the past two weeks attacking Edwards, hoping to soften him up before the runoff. The Democratic Governors Association is still debating whether or not to invest in the state.\nPolls show a surprise second-place finish from either Dardenne or Angelle would boost Republicans' chances in the runoff. But Bradley Beychok, who managed Melancon's failed bid against Vitter five years ago, thinks neither Republican has been direct enough to sink Vitter in an open primary — despite the increasingly explicit references to Vitter's past.\n\"This is Godzilla. To slay Godzilla, you got to go directly at him,\" Beychok said. \"You can't slay a dragon by chopping at his feet.\"\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mzk0B6gYSA", "https://youtu.be/h4NgzbR46U8", "https://youtu.be/lI-eFSaWa4I", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFJ0h1JwsAg", "https://youtu.be/sU8OF_vSAYA", "https://youtu.be/YDpTl1Enh7Y", "https://youtu.be/KUoVuzu_rXc", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtTI37IBJbk"], "published": "2015-10-24T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:31:17.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
