The affected residents live in mostly known flood plains that appear in U.S. Geological Survey data used by insurance companies.\nCounty emergency officials said residents shouldn't solely base risk on their neighborhood's flood history, but take into account the conditions of hillsides and storm drains around their house. Erosion can be prevented or eased on slopes by planting groundcovers and shrubs, pouring down mulch or terracing, they said.\nOfficials said Department of Public Works crews are inspecting and clearing county road and drainage culverts. County damage assessment teams are being organized for deployment and recovery options are being streamlined in case heavy rainfall produces significant flood damage to properties.\nCity of San Diego officials are taking similar steps, according to a series of presentations given last week to the City Council's Environment Committee.\nAt a meeting at the county Office of Emergency Management, Alex Tardy of the National Weather Service said the current El Nino could be the strongest on record. The storms might or might not be stronger than usual, but they could be more frequent and last until April, Tardy told around 100 first responders and government officials.", "external_links": ["http://www.readysandiego.org/es-us/", "http://readysandiego.org/"], "published": "2015-10-14T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:40:21.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
