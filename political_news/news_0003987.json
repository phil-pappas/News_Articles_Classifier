Over the next parliament we will invest £200m to create a new network of elective treatment centres. \n\"We will extend the Golden Jubilee and develop new centres at St John's in Livingston, at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, at Ninewells in Dundee, at Raigmore in Inverness and here in this city at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\" Image copyright Danny Kearney Image caption Ms Sturgeon said the work being done at the Golden Jubilee Hospital would be the model for the new treatment centres \nHer speech comes at the end of the SNP's biggest ever conference, which Ms Sturgeon hopes to use as a launch pad for her party's bid to win a historic third term in office in next year's Scottish Parliament vote. \nThe election campaign will be her first as first minister, prompting Ms Sturgeon to ask voters to put their trust in her. \nShe will say: \"Over these next few months, as we prepare to seek re-election, I won't pretend that we are perfect. Or that I am perfect. \n\"But I will promise this. We will always strive to be the best we can be. And we will serve this country with imagination, courage, humility and always to the very best of our abilities.\" \nMs Sturgeon will also say the prime minister is showing a \"failure of leadership\" by \"pandering to eurosceptics\" as she attempts to drive home her party's pro-EU message. \nAnd she will use her address to make the case against UK military intervention in Syria, arguing instead that \"what is needed is not more bombing but a renewed and intensive diplomatic initiative led by the UN\". \nAnd she will warn that military action such as airstrikes risks \"simply adding to the already unimaginable human suffering\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:25:52.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
