(Christine Cotter | AP) Comments \nVice President Joe Biden announced in a statement at the White House on Wednesday that he is officially not running for president in 2016. \n\"Unfortunately, I believe we're out of time,\" Biden he said in a rare solo speech from the Rose Garden, flanked by his wife Jill and President Barack Obama. \"I've concluded the window has closed.\" \nBiden, 72, had long been rumored to be considering a campaign, but his decision solidifies the Democratic candidates for next year's election. He reportedly spent months discussing the possibility of a late entry in the primary race, challenging current front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. \nA super political action committee, Draft Biden, had even launched a campaign video encouraging him to run. Aides and supporters had also prepared a potential bid, according to the Associated Press, ready for whenever he made his decision. \nBut Biden, a Syracuse University College of Law alumnus, said he might not be emotionally ready to run after his 46-year-old son Beau died of brain cancer in May. Last month, he told Stephen Colbert on \"The Late Show\" that he was still \"overwhelmed\" at times by grief. \n\"While I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent. I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully,\" he added Wednesday. \nBiden, who served six terms in the U.S. Senate, previously ran for president twice. He was known for his experience in global affairs and had a reputation for being a plainspoken, sometimes unpredictable \"Uncle Joe\" politician. \nThe AP reports Biden has told friends he has no plans to \"retire,\" but is unlikely to seek elected office again. Future options include taking on roles as special envoy and elder statements or starting a foundation and launching an institute at the University of Delaware, where he got his undergraduate degree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:07:12.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
