Now, to draw more attention to inequality, he has announced plans to host a forum for presidential candidates on the subject—in Iowa!What are Americans saying about the issue that Mayor de Blasio and the candidates should know? Do people think the deck is stacked against them? Do they believe inequality is getting worse? How important will the issue be in 2016?We reviewed recent polls in the latest issue of AEI’s Political Report , and the picture couldn’t be clearer. Americans believe the gap between rich and poor is a serious problem and that it’s getting worse. In an ABC News/ Washington Post poll taken earlier this year, a majority, 51 percent, said the gap is a major problem, and another 32 percent said it is a problem but not a major one. Sixty-seven percent in a May CBS News/ New York Times poll said the gap was getting larger. Just a quarter thought it had stayed the same, and only 5 percent said it was getting smaller.Looking beyond those responses, however, the issue doesn’t seem to be front and center for most Americans. When the pollsters ask people to volunteer the most important issue facing the nation, “inequality” or “the gap between the rich and poor” is rarely mentioned by even 2 percent of those surveyed. The economy/jobs and government dysfunction top the public’s list of concerns today. Additionally, when people are asked to rank issues that will be important to their vote, the income gap comes in near the bottom. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll from September, the top five issues registered voters listed were the economy (52 percent said it was extremely important) followed by Social Security/Medicare (50 percent), terrorism (49 percent), health care and, separately, education (both at 47 percent). The income gap ranked tenth of twelve issues, with a third describing it as extremely important to their vote. Concern about the government’s competence is one reason for the disconnect in the polls between people’s view that the problem is serious but that it is unlikely to be a big issue for them in 2016.Despite concerns about Washington’s competence, the polls also tell us that in the abstract, people would like the government to pursue policies to try to reduce the gap. Sixty-one percent gave that response in Quinnipiac’s July poll of registered voters. But another question, asked by Bloomberg/Selzer & Co. four times since December 2013, suggests considerable doubt about what the government should do. Each time the question was asked, people were evenly split between the view that “it is better for the government to implement policies designed to shrink the gap” and the view that “it is better for the government to stand aside and let the market operate freely even if the gap gets wider.”When politicians talk about income inequality, they miss a key part of the story. Americans don’t particularly resent the rich, nor do they particularly admire them. As long as people are able to provide satisfactorily for their own families, how the rich are doing or how big the gap is between the rich and poor doesn’t matter that much to them. A question asked this summer in a survey by The Atlantic and the Aspen Institute illustrates this point. Thirty-six percent said “The concentration of wealth and privilege within the top 1 percent of American society is a problem,” but more than twice that many, 64 percent, said, “As long as I am able to provide the life I want for myself and my family, it doesn’t matter if others are substantially wealthier than I am.” Young and old agreed, as did whites and blacks. A NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll from May sheds additional light. People expressed much more concern about the middle and working class being able to get ahead (68 percent) than about the income gap between the wealthiest Americans and the rest of the country (28 percent).Americans think it is still possible to start out poor, work hard, and get rich in America, though they also believe it’s mainly just a few people at the top who have the chance to do so. Sixty-one percent gave that response in a recent question asked by CBS News/ New York Times pollsters. The responses of blacks and whites were identical at 59 percent. Just 35 percent nationally said everyone has a fair chance to get ahead in the long run.Politicians who propose ways to restore opportunity in America will be more successful than those who protest the rich getting richer. Presidential candidates, take note.
