(AP) - Republican presidential contender Ted Cruz says the Obama administration's plan to accept about 10,000 Syrian refugees is \"nothing short of crazy.\"\nThe Texas senator told a Michigan crowd on Monday he thinks a \"significant number\" of refugees entering Europe are terrorists from the Islamic State group. He says it would be the \"height of foolishness\" to allow \"Syrian Muslims\" into the country.\nGermany's top security official said last week that intelligence services are watching for signs that terrorists are mixing into the flow of incoming migrants but had confirmed no such cases.\nIn Michigan, Republican Gov. Rick Snyder is talking with federal officials about what the state can do about accepting more refugees from Syria.\nCruz is campaigning for Michigan's March 8 presidential primary.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:25:57.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
