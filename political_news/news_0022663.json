More \nBased on information the administration has so far, the test appears to be in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929, which stipulates that Iran cannot engage in any activities related to ballistic missiles. \nThe administration official emphasized, however, that the test is not in violation of the nuclear agreement reached in July between Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers because that accord is focused on restricting Iran's path to a nuclear weapon. \nA newer U.N. Security Council resolution, number 2231, implementing the deal and banning Iran from engaging in activities related to ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads is not yet in effect. \nOver the weekend, state-run media reported that Iran successfully test-fired a new precision-guided, long-range missile. \nThe Emad (Pillar) surface-to-surface missile, designed and built by Iranian experts, is the country's first long-range missile that can be precision-guided until it reaches its target, said Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehqan, Iran's defense minister. \nThe Emad would be Tehran's first precision-guided missile with the range to reach its enemy, Israel. \nIsrael is bitterly opposed to Iran's nuclear program, and observers have speculated that it could be prepared to launch pre-emptive strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in an effort to derail their progress. \nDehqan said after the launch that the Emad would greatly increase Iran's strategic deterrence capability, state media reported. \n\"To follow our defense programs, we don't ask permission from anyone,\" he said, according to state-run news agency IRNA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:56:59.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
