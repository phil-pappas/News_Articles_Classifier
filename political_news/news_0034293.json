Waryam Singh was ordered to be released by Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday. He is currently lodged in Bareilly Central Jail in Uttar Pradesh. \nThe grounds cited by the Home Ministry for his release are good conduct as also consideration for the nearly 25 years he has already served in jail since his arrest in 1990 and subsequent conviction in 1995, official sources said on Monday. \nSingh has never availed of parole and his conduct in jail has been impeccable, sources said, adding that Uttar Pradesh government had moved a proposal saying he should be released as he is also 70 years of age. \nSingh is one of the 13 Sikh prisoners whose release has been demanded by the SAD-BJP government in Punjab, which had also petitioned the Home Minister in this regard. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:06:42.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
