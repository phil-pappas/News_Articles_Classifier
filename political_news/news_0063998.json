Seneca County IDA to discuss former Army Depot's future   October 14, 2015 \nThe Seneca County Industrial Development Agency will host a public information meeting to discuss the immediate future of the former Seneca Army Depot next month. After two decades of marketing the site, the IDA is planning to sell the remaining land, which is some 7,000 acres, said Bob Aronson, IDA executive director. Of the 7,000 acres, roughly 3,000 acres are located in the town of Varick and some 4,000 acres are in Romulus. The IDA is planning to sell the depot because the Army’s environmental clean-up is expected to be completed in 2016. The IDA cannot afford to take on the caretaker responsibilities, which include management of the depot property, security, fence repair and maintenance, and wildlife management, officials said. Also, the IDA is eager to see the depot returned to the tax rolls, increasing the county’s tax base and serving as an economic asset, officials said. The IDA has been approached by bidders for the depot property in recent months, Aronson said, and the agency wants to give the public, including other prospective buyers, an opportunity to learn more. The meeting will take place at 10 a.m. Nov. 7 at Romulus Fire Hall, 2010 Cayuga St., in the town of Romulus, Seneca County. (c) 2015  .
