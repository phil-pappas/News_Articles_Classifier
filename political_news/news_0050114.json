Mainly: that he doesn't have any opinions.\nRenner acted alongside Jennifer Lawrence in the 2013 film American Hustle , and got paid more than her. But in response to Lawrence's passionate open letter demanding equal pay for women in Hollywood (which bilingual dream man Bradley Cooper has endorsed ), Renner said that it's \"not my job\" to help with all the little annoyances of Hollywood, such as women's equality. He's an actor , not an activist.\n\"That's not my job,\" Renner told Business Insider. \"I don't know contracts and money and all that sort of stuff. I'm a performer and I know human behavior. When it comes to that sort of stuff I let other people deal with that. I do what I'm good at, that's what I focus on.\"\nLucky for you, Academy Award–nominated actor Jeremy Renner, Academy Award– winning actress Jennifer Lawrence can \"deal with that\" without your help.", "external_links": ["http://moviepilot.com/posts/2015/10/19/bradley-cooper-advocates-equal-pay-in-hollywood-after-jennifer-lawrence-s-inequality-letter-3598444", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/jeremy-renner-on-gender-pay-gap-2015-10?r=US&IR=T", "http://variety.com/2015/film/news/chris-evans-sorry-for-calling-scarlett-johannsons-avengers-character-a-whore-1201478485/"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:28:34.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
