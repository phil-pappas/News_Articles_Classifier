Baker \nLITTLE ROCK - A federal judge is giving Arkansas two weeks to respond to an effort to expand the lawsuit challenging the state's decision to cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. \nU.S. District Judge Kristine Baker on Wednesday ordered the state to respond by Oct. 28 to Planned Parenthood's motion seeking class-action status for its suit challenging the cancellation of its Medicaid contract. Baker denied a motion by the state to extend its time to respond, as well as a motion by Planned Parenthood to expedite the response. \nBaker earlier this month ordered the state to continue paying Medicaid for three Planned Parenthood patients suing the state over the cancellation. The organization is seeking class-action status to stop the state from banning the funding in other circumstances. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
