Controllers at some of the nation's busiest air traffic facilities have been working six-day weeks for years because of short staffing.\nThe union is asking Congress to step in.\nUnion officials say safety isn't at risk, but they acknowledge controllers' work schedules are causing widespread chronic fatigue.\nNASA warned the FAA four years ago that controller fatigue was undermining safety.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
