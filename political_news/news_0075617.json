Joyner , director of Positive Action and Patient Advocacy, ViiV Healthcare. \"Through the Positive Action for MSM and Transgender programme, we hope to address the impact of the HIV epidemic in this underserved population.\"\nThe chairman of the Positive Action MSM and Transgender programme advisory board, Juan Jacobo Hernandez from Colectivo Sol added, \"The grantees' organisations - through their geographies and the scope of the programmes - selected will help make a real difference to MSM and transgender individuals in local communities all over the world. In that sense, the Positive Action programme is a welcome addition to existing interventions that address the challenges of stigma and discrimination.\"\nSelected grantees will receive funding to carry out projects that specifically relate to achieving three outcomes:\nReducing the level and impact of stigma experienced by MSM and transgender individuals Increasing access to health related services Enhancing the capacity of community based organisations that engage MSM and transgender communities in reducing HIV MSM and transgender populations are often stigmatised and isolated. Positive Action for MSM and Transgender launched in March 2015 to support interventions that will empower MSM and transgender communities who face significant stigma, discrimination and inadequate access to appropriate HIV care. Through the programme, ViiV Healthcare has committed to invest £2 million per year - £1 million to fund small grants and another £1 million for targeted interventions - to support these communities as they develop their capacity to lead, participate in policy-making and address the severe health disparities and health service access issues affecting MSM and transgender individuals.\nGlobally, MSM and transgender individuals are among those at highest risk of HIV infection [1] ; however, the World Bank estimates that fewer than one in 10 MSM and transgender individuals worldwide has access to the most basic package of preventive interventions [2] . Prevalence rates among MSM and transgender populations are consistently higher than for men of reproductive age in the general population wherever MSM have been studied [3] ; and scant data on transgender individuals reveals transgender women are 48.8 times more likely to be infected with HIV than the general population. [4]\nGlobally, young people comprise over 40% of new HIV infection and many of them are MSM and transgender individuals.
