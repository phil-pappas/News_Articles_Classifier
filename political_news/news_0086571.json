She is said to be critical. \nAccording to media reports Indrani consumed anti-epileptic pills. A forensic examination is underway in the matter. A news channel also reported that Indrani had been unconscious since 2 pm, and was in a critical condition. It is seen as an attempt by Indrani to commit suicide. According to reports she was distraught after her mother’s demise. \nIndrani was arrested on 25 August for her alleged role in the murder of Sheena Bora , her daughter from a previous marriage, in April 2012. The two other accused in the case are Shyamvar Rai, Indrani’s former driver and her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna. \nThe high-profile case has attracted media attention ever since it broke. The case was initially handled by Mumbai Police under the supervision of the then Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria and later transferred to CBI by Maharashtra government. The CBI last month filed a murder case against the three accused. On 7 September, Indrani was sent to judicial custody. Her husband, Peter Mukerjea , former Star India CEO, was also grilled several times by police. Peter had pleaded ignorance about the whole incident. \nIt may be recalled that Sheena Bora (24) was allegedly abducted by the three accused and killed inside a car after which her body was burnt and dumped into the jungles of adjoining Raigad district.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:38:29.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
