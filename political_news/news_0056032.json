Two of them — Charles Robert Bone and Howard Gentry — became active Barry supporters and are part of her transition team . Jeremy Kane stayed on the campaign trail for an extra month, supporting David Fox in the runoff, but has kept a relatively low profile since, as has Linda Eskind Rebrovick. Not so for Bill Freeman, whose campaign spent more than $3.8 million of personal money en route to a third place finish, and apparently isn't planning on fading into the background now The day after Barry's inauguration, Freeman — who quite publicly declined to endorse Barry in the runoff — appeared (by invitation) at a small gathering of local Republicans in Old Hickory, encouraging them to support the new mayor. A week later he reiterated that call in an op-ed piece for The Tennessean : The race for mayor was the most contentious any of us have seen in this city. Now that it is officially over, it is time for all of us to come together in support of our mayor and our city. No matter whom you may have had a sign for in your front yard, we all must now come together. I hope those who chose to support me during the election will join me in standing behind our new mayor as she begins her term. Mayor Barry deserves the opportunity to succeed. This weekend, his byline appeared again in the daily, with a piece arguing that the state fairgrounds can be as successful as the Ascend Amphitheater. While the full scope of the new amphitheater’s economic impact won’t be known until it has been open an entire year, anyone who has seen the massive crowds pouring into the businesses and restaurants along Lower Broadway on concert nights will tell you without hesitation that it will bring a big economic boost — all because we as a city saw the need for a first-rate facility of that size. Just three short miles down the road, we have another property not being utilized to its full potential. It could very easily provide an even larger economic boost to Nashville. That, of course, is the Fairgrounds Nashville property and Fairgrounds Speedway. The battles over our fairgrounds are long behind us, but the time to begin work on rejuvenating what could be our city’s crown jewel is now. During the campaign, Barry — who had previously supported the razing and redevelopment of the property — also said the city should invest in the fairgrounds now that the fight over its existence is over. But while its not completely surprising to see Freeman in the public eye — he was an occasional op-ed contributor and major political player before his mayoral bid — it is interesting to watch in light of the campaign and the possibility that his local political ambitions might not be dried up. He has declined to rule out a future run and a fair bit of speculation has come Pith's way suggesting that he might keep an eye on how Barry does early in her first term and assess whether to make another run at the mayor's office. In any case, he's not going away. Watch this space. Or don't. You still have a few months before another campaign season begins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:24:44.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
