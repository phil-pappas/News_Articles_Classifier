(aka Austerity Stew for us, Rib Roast for the 1%.) Pretty much every Republican who appeared sounded the alarm on Social Security: \"The sky is falling! The sky is falling!\" (They're also pushing means testing and the rest of the usual wingnut agenda.) \nBut Lindsey was especially egregious. When this veteran asked why he didn't support a bill to fix veteran's benefits, he went off on a rant about entitlement spending and said we had no money for ANYTHING until we cut Social Security and Medicare. \n\"Good dog, Lindsey. Good dog! Who's a good boy? You, Lindsey!\" -- Pete Peterson \nP.S. Bernie Sanders did a great job sharing the real facts about Social Security, getting a lot of applause when he pointed out there's \"always\" money for war.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:33:36.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
