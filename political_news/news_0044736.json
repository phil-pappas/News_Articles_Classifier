Over two weeks, our Hercules made more than 40 relief trips carrying in food and supplies and carrying out over 1,000 evacuees. \n\"New Zealand’s $4.8m support in the relief stage following Typhoon Haiyan was one of our largest ever responses outside of the Pacific. \n\"Because of its importance logistically and as a training hub, Cebu was one of the first warehouses to be retro-fitted. By the time this activity is completed in early 2016 we will have prepositioned 14,000 family kits, upgraded eight warehouses and trained 150 Red Cross officials.\" \nMr Bridges says New Zealand’s support to the Philippine Red Cross is just one example of our commitment to Disaster Risk Reduction and humanitarian relief in the Philippines. \n\"The Philippine Red Cross can be proud that, as a result of this activity’s success, the New Zealand Aid Programme is looking at replicating this initiative in other ASEAN developing countries.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:42:01.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
