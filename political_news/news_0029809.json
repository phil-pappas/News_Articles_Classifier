Putin said in remarks at the General Assembly here that only the Assad regime, which the U.S. has long insisted must go, and Kurdish forces on the ground are “truly fighting” the terrorist network, also known as ISIS or ISIL.\nRELATED\nRussia Begins Airstrikes in Syria as it Attempts to Overshadow Struggling U.S.-Led War Kurdish Regional Government Foreign Affairs Minister Falah Mustafa Bakir tells U.S. News he doesn’t care how peace for his countrymen is achieved, provided Moscow and Washington don’t let ego get in the way of winning the war.\n“It’s important that there is an agreement. Not to have two fronts: one with Assad and one against Assad. We want to have one,” Bakir says. He believes earlier Western intervention in Syria would have changed the reality on the ground as it exists today, but a lack of international unity now will only make matters worse.\n\"That’s why we have to reach an agreement in the international community. If we all agree there is no military solution to this problem, then we have to start a political solution,” he says.\nAnother key obstacle to international unity is Turkey. The key NATO ally has been long distrustful of international Kurdish forces, which Ankara links to domestic organizations like the Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, it and Washington consider a terrorist organization. The U.S. successfully brokered the use of Turkish air bases for its warplanes in July, though Turkey reportedly remains wary of continued U.S. efforts to support the Kurds through supplies and partnered air strikes.\nBakir expressed support for Turkey’s involvement, calling it a “positive development” and says their assistance will be particularly helpful in Syria.\n“We have to see Turkish full participation in this anti-ISIL coalition, especially allowing for the air bases to be used,” Bakir says. “This means that there would be more cooperation between Turkey and the coalition in terms of controlling the borders and controlling the access of the foreign fighters.”\nRELATED\nObama, Putin Meet in New York The U.S. and Russia are at odds over the role Assad would play in Syria’s future. President Barack Obama and many of his allies believe the only solution to the conflict in Syria is a political one, and that Assad can play no part in a future government. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, is doubling down on military support for his ally, who is struggling against the rebel fighters and the Islamic State group. The Russian military action in Syria has the U.S. concerned Putin plans to take an active role in supporting Assad and his forces, who have been responsible for killing thousands of civilians. But while U.S. officials have publicly maintained that Assad should go, direct assistance to that end has been nonexistent.\n“Had there been a timely intervention in one way or another, we would have been in a different situation today,” Bakir says. “But we are where we are. That’s why we have to reach an agreement in the international community. If we all agree there is no military solution to this problem, then we have to start a political solution.”\nIn addition to the vacuum in Syria, divisions between Sunni and Shiite groups and the failure of the past Iraqi government to be inclusive also allowed the Islamic State to gain ground. Bakir said that a political solution to the conflict needs to include representation from disaffected Sunnis like those sympathetic to the Islamic State group, but from what he’s seen from the terrorist organization so far, he doesn’t think they could eventually earn a seat at the table.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:20:45.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
