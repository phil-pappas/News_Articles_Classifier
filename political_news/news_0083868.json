A White House spokesman said tonight Scott requested that her nomination be withdrawn “due to personal reasons related to her family.”\nEfforts to reach Scott were unsuccessful.\nBay State senators had given news of Scott’s nomination a lukewarm reception after it was announced in July, the Herald reported then.\nU.S. Sen. Edward J. Markey, who sits on the committee tasked with vetting the nomination, and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren were both non-committal when asked if they supported Scott’s nomination., However,though one committee member, Nebraska Republican Sen. Deb Fischer, said she was “deeply troubled” by the T’s failures last winter during Scott’s tenure.\nHer problem-plagued tenure as the head of the MBTA culminated when the entire system collapsed at the height of last winter’s snowstorms.\nPerhaps the lasting image of Scott as MBTA chief was a bizarre press conference on Feb. 10 in which she at times paced, banged her hand on a podium, and referred to herself in the third person.\nShe announced her resignation from the agency in February and officially stepped down in April.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:33:13.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
