The declining exports trend may continue in FY16 due to subdued China demand and sluggish European economy,\" Texprocil Chairman R K Dalmia said.\nHe was speaking on the sidelines of the All India Exporters' Chamber's Platinum Jubilee celebration. \"A large part of the reason for the sluggish growth lies in the overall slowing of demand in the overseas markets too. Apart from a general decline in overseas demand, our over-dependence on China especially for cotton and cotton yarn exports, is magnifying the overall decline in our exports as China slows down,\" Dalmia added.\nFurther, the high cost of export finance which is around 10 per cent in India compared with 3-4 per cent in competing countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and Pakistan is also having an impact on our competitiveness, he said.\nDalmia elaborated on the representations that have been made to the government like the interest rate subvention, re-calibration of the product-market matrix to include exports to emerging markets so that linkages can be strengthened with the value chains in these markets.\nDalmia said that efforts must be accelerated to enhance the competitiveness of India's exports and the government should also expedite conclusion of FTAs with EU, Australia and Canada.\nHe stressed that dialogues need to be initiated with China and Turkey for reduction of duties on Indian textiles products and we need to take recourse to the review mechanism available under all the FTAs/ CEPAs signed by India in order to create additional market access.\nDalmia added that recent measures of the government like the increase in allocation of funds from Rs 18,000 crore to Rs 21,000 crore under export incentives scheme; eduction in Repo-Rate; Setting up of Textile Parks and the Relaxation of Coastal Shipping have given a sense of \"feel good\" to all at a time when the overall global outlook is still in the \"recovery mode\".\nThe five-year trade policy has provided a necessary framework for increasing exports of goods and services as well as job creation and increasing value addition in the country. Aim was to reach USD 900 billion of merchandise and services exports and the total two-way trade was expected to double from the present USD 1 trillion to USD 2 trillion annually in the next five years.\nThis was a gigantic task considering that global economy was still struggling to gain momentum, All India Exporters' Chamber President Preeti M Sheth said.\n business latest Textile sector Also Read FPIs end long positions, marts may fall Telecom companies to meet internet speed SpiceJet celebrates International Yoga Day at 35000 feet New PSL guidelines to be out by April-end: Raghuram Rajan", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/textile%20industries_1_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/textile%20industries_1_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151015/business-latest/article/textile-sector-urges-government-take-steps-boost-exports", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:14:14.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
