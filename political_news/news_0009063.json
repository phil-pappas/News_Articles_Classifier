(AP Photo/AJ Mast)\nAssociated Press Oct. 19, 2015 | 12:19 a.m. EDT + More By MICHAEL MAROT, AP Sports Writer\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Tom Brady got his revenge — with a little help from the Colts.\nHe exposed holes in the defense, allowed his teammates to do most of the heavy lifting and let Indianapolis take the air out of its own building with a bone-headed fake punt that turned the game.\nBrady threw for 312 yards, three touchdowns and led the Patriots to two second-half scores in a 34-27 victory Sunday night in the \"Deflategate\" rematch.\nIt was a strange night.\nIn a series defined by wild games and crazy plays, Indy's awful punt might have been the worst of the worst. With most of the offensive line set up near the right sideline, Indy snapped the ball to Colt Anderson, who was immediately tackled for a 1-yard loss that gave the Patriots the ball at the Colts 35.\nSix plays later, Brady got free from the pass rush and hooked up with LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a 34-21 lead early in the fourth quarter.\n\"I saw the formation, and I wasn't sure what was going on,\" New England defensive lineman Chandler Jones said. \"But it was great awareness by our special teams.\"\nIndy (3-3) never recovered.\nNew England has won seven straight over its longtime rival and is 5-0 for the first time since its 16-0 season in 2007.\nWhile Brady wasn't perfect — he threw his first interception of the season — he was pretty darn good again. Brady finished 23 of 37 in the first meeting since January's AFC title, which ultimately led to allegations of improperly inflated balls, months of investigation and eventually a four-game suspension that was nullified in court.\nHad the suspension been upheld, Brady would have made his season debut in front of a hostile Indianapolis crowd.\nInstead, Colts fans, who booed heartily when Brady first appeared at Lucas Oil Stadium, roared even louder when Indianapolis' Andrew Luck returned after missing two games with an injured right shoulder. Luck was 30 of 50 for 312 yards with three touchdowns and most importantly, no turnovers.\nNew England players didn't care about the crowd or the significance.\n\"I look at it just like any other win,\" Blount said after running for one touchdown and catching the first of his career. \"It feels good no matter who we're playing.\"\nThe game didn't go the way anyone expected, though.\nNew England got away from its strong running game and kept the ball in Brady's hands.\nBut the Colts were the more aggressive team. They scored a touchdown on the opening series by going for it on fourth-and-1. They tried a first-half onside kick. They continued to take shots down the field, and they refused to back down from the defending Super Bowl champs\nThe combination turned what many expected to be a blowout into one of this season's most entertaining games — until the fake punt.\nIt was s the game everyone wanted to see in last season's AFC championship game, a 38-point rout that spawned the \"Deflategate\" controversy.\nIndy led 21-20 at halftime, but in the second half, Brady took control.\nHe threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to the wide-open Rob Gronkowski to make it 27-21 early in the third quarter, and followed Indy's mistake with the scoring pass to Blount to seal it.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
