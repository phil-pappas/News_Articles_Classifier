Breast cancer took the life of Dr. Deborah Asnis on Sept. 12 at age 59. She was director of infectious disease at Flushing Hospital Medical Center. There, in the summer of 1999, several patients with similar symptoms puzzled her. She notified city health officials and started sending samples of patients’ blood and spinal fluid to a state lab. More patients showed similar symptoms of fevers and weakness that increased day by day. Gradually the mystery revealed itself: West Nile virus had arrived in the United States. Asnis took the time to report the symptoms that others then traced to mosquitoes in a Queens neighborhood. Within the next decade, WNV swept across the United States. For a time South Dakota stood out as one of the hardest hit despite one of the smallest populations. Through efforts by South Dakota’s medical community and health officials, WNV no longer is taking lives. No deaths were reported in South Dakota from WNV in 2014; none has been reported so far in 2015. WNV in South Dakota led to three deaths in 2013 and three in 2012, according to the state Health Department. Turning the calendar back to 2002 when the first WNV cases were documented in South Dakota, the state saw zero deaths that year from WNV but recorded 14 deaths from WNV in 2003. According to state epidemiologist Lon Kightlinger’s report on West Nile Virus covering the 2002-2011 decade, “1,759 people have been reported and confirmed ill and 26 individuals have died.” South Dakota State University researchers eventually helped isolate the species of mosquito that was the main carrier here. Knowing its habits helped South Dakotans better protect themselves. From 2008 through 2011, South Dakota recorded no WNV deaths. It is likely someone eventually would have pieced together the WNV mystery if Dr. Deborah Asnis hadn’t done so. But that she did, at such an early point, perhaps contributed to saving hundreds or thousands of lives. For more about her life, here are links to several good newspaper stories in The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times in the days after her death. Just like that newspaper coverage, her accomplishment was important nationwide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:42:44.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
