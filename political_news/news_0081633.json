They were after the rights to one of his photographs: an opener from a \"Best of New York\" Issue. It was a pretty meaningful photograph for Doherty — the first he’d ever taken for this magazine, and his first real magazine assignment. He shot the picture in his Brooklyn bedroom, in the company of his cat, River.\nThe photo shoot in Bobby&apos;s bedroom.\nBobby sold Taroni the rights, and in August, a swatch of rich, spectacular silk arrived. We kept our eyes peeled in New York, London, and Milan, wondering which designer had commissioned the work, but had started to assume it was for next season, or that maybe the designer had changed his mind.\nBut today, in Paris, we got the most thrilling of answers. LANVIN! There it was on not one, not two, but five pieces; with sequins and without, various colorways, various shapes, but always, unmistakably, Bobby’s elegant work.\nBravo to Bobby, and gratitude to Alber Elbaz.\nBEGIN SLIDESHOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:26:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
