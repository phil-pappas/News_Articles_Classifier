Biden Jr.’s decision not to run and Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s resurgence after a strong debate performance last week.\nThe dinner this weekend will unfold amid the hoopla of a mini-nominating convention. There will be bands, parades and orchestrated cheering sections for Mrs. Clinton and her main rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Bill Clinton, on his first visit to Iowa this year, will appear at a pre-dinner rally for Mrs. Clinton outside the Iowa Events Center in downtown Des Moines that will include a performance by Katy Perry.\n Hillary Clinton Advisers Woo Biden Backers, but Resistance Lingers OCT. 22, 2015 As new polls show Mrs. Clinton consolidating a small lead in the state, she is determined not to repeat the mistakes of her 2008 campaign, when the seeds of her upset by Barack Obama in the Iowa caucuses were seen at “the J-J” — common shorthand for the event. Back then, there were empty seats in the Clinton bleachers, and Mr. Obama’s speech critical of partisan politicians raised the roof.\nPhoto Senator Barack Obama speaking at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Des Moines in 2007. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times “I suspect this year the Hillary entourage will be compensating, or overcompensating, for 2007,” said Kurt Meyer, a Democratic county leader in Iowa. “Bringing Bill Clinton in, that’s trump high card. That’s your joker. How do you beat that?”\nStreet rallies are a big part of the day. Mr. Sanders will have alumni of the bands Guster and MC5 performing. The candidate will be introduced as the Steve Earle song “The Revolution Starts Now,” an anthem used by the Occupy Wall Street movement, plays. He will lead a march over the Des Moines River to the event hall.\nFormer Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who is a campaign-trail troubadour, will sing and strum the guitar at his pre-dinner rally. An aide said Mr. O’Malley might be coaxed to play a bit of Taylor Swift, as he did this week on the ABC program “The View.”\nThe dinner “is always influential in presidential years,” said Andy McGuire, chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party . “How you get your people there, how you do the pre-events and how you look like you’re organizing around the state is exemplified by the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.”\nThe evening promises a microcosm of the Clinton and Sanders strategies in Iowa, the state with the first nominating contest, where both have invested heavily. Mrs. Clinton is banking on superior organizing with nearly 125 paid staff members, according to Mr. Meyer, a figure that the campaign, without providing an alternative number, said was not correct. Mr. Sanders, who employs 67, is relying on grass-roots enthusiasm.\nContinue reading the main story Interactive Graphic Who’s Winning the Presidential Campaign? History suggests that each party’s eventual nominee will emerge from 2015 in one of the top two or three positions, as measured by endorsements, fund-raising and polling.\nOPEN Interactive Graphic Most of the nearly 6,000 attendees, including almost every elected Democratic official in Iowa, will have already made up their minds about who to support. The campaigns’ shows of force are intended to inspire activists, rattle the opposition and influence the narrative spun out by a large press corps.\n A poll for The Des Moines Register released on Thursday showed Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Sanders 48 percent to 41 percent in Iowa, with former Gov. Martin O’Malley, who had hoped for momentum after the debate in Las Vegas, far behind at 2 percent. The poll’s margin of sampling error is plus or minus 5 percentage points.\nSifting Iowans’ responses to issues, the survey’s pollster, Ann Selzer, told The Register, “Sanders has a big problem and it’s guns, not socialism.” Mrs. Clinton seems likely to raise the gun protection issue during her 15-minute speech at the dinner on Saturday, which will follow Mr. Sanders’s speech.\nOne consequence of Mrs. Clinton’s erosion of support over the summer, when Mr. Sanders nipped at her heels in Iowa polls, is that lowered expectations now work in her favor, Iowa strategists said: If she wins by 5 to 8 percentage points in the state’s caucuses on Feb. 1, it will be seen as a solid victory. Her campaign could brush off a defeat in New Hampshire the next week as inconsequential because Mr. Sanders is almost a native son there.\nBoth campaigns know that Iowa is won not in polls, but by organizing to draw supporters to the more than 1,600 precinct caucuses. Mr. Sanders must convert the enthusiasm shown at huge rallies into caucus turnout by supporters, many of them political newcomers. It is the goal that Mr. Obama pulled off spectacularly in 2008, but which eluded other grass-roots favorites like Howard Dean in 2004 and Bill Bradley in 2000.\nContinue reading the main story First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race , the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n“Will Bernie Sanders succeed like Obama did or fail like the others?” asked Norm Sterzenbach, a former executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party. “The thing it’s going to come down to is how they organize.”\nThe Jefferson-Jackson Dinner is an early test of organizing, as well as the potency of the candidates’ messages. The 2003 dinner (with Mrs. Clinton, then a senator, as M.C.) was a turning point, Mr. Sterzenbach said. The front-runner, Mr. Dean, had begun to fade, and John Kerry, whose slogan “The Real Deal” appeared on signs at the event, emerged en route to winning the caucuses and the nomination.\nBoth the Sanders and Clinton campaigns bought the maximum number of tickets available for supporters: about 1,950, mostly bleacher seats at $50 each, and table seating for $120 and up. The O’Malley campaign said it, too, would fill almost all its allotted seats, though tickets were bought by supporters, not by the financially struggling campaign.\nIn the bleachers, the candidates’ supporters will chant and wave signs keyed to themes in their speeches. A theme for Mr. O’Malley will be “Action Not Words,” according to Kristin Sosanie, the deputy Iowa director.\nBefore the dinner, Mr. Sanders will lead a march across a bridge over the Des Moines River, with supporters waving signs and placards.\nThe event is “an opportunity to organize,” said Pete D’Alessandro, coordinator of the Sanders campaign in Iowa, including holding television watch parties around the state to attract new volunteers.\n“There is not a lot of conversion going on” at the dinner, Mr. D’Alessandro said. “There will be other things to look for. Were you able to get 2,000 people to an event? Were you able to pull off six watch parties in different regions? When you call me on Monday, how many people did we sign up at those events?”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/16/us/elections/presidential-candidates-dashboard-1442376909418/presidential-candidates-dashboard-1442376909418-master495.png", "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2015/10/22/iowa-poll-clinton-up-7-but-gap-tightens/74306980/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/us/politics/23dems-web/23dems-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/us/23iowa2/23iowa2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/us/23iowa2/23iowa2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://www.google-analytics.com/ga.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:16:45.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
