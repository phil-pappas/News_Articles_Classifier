A worker walks near a washed-out bridge on July 20, 2015, near the town of Desert Center, along Interstate 10 in Southern California.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 8, 2015 | 6:05 p.m. EDT + More \"Sexy\" isn't particularly high up on the list of words Americans use to describe infrastructural investments. Very rarely in U.S. history have those two concepts even been featured in the same sentence.\nBut a group of mostly left-leaning corporate executives, academics, nonprofit leaders, policy experts, distinguished journalists and even a few members of Congress announced Thursday they want to bring sexy back to infrastructure – if it was ever there to begin with.\n\"Somewhere in here, [in] the same way that the new economy, the tech economy, the Uber economy [are described], infrastructure can be made sexy. Really,\" Carl Bernstein, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and author best known for his coverage of the Watergate scandal for the Washington Post, said in the course of a panel discussion Thursday morning at the American Job Creation and Infrastructure Forum in Washington, D.C.\nAmerica's infrastructural deficiencies have been well-documented. A study commissioned by the White House last year found that 65 percent of America's roadways are in \" less than good condition .\" The Federal Highway Administration estimates more than 10 percent of the country's bridges are structurally deficient. And the American Society of Civil Engineers recently gave America's infrastructure a D+ grade and estimated that $3.6 trillion would need to be invested by 2020 to get U.S. roads, bridges, ports, dams, railways, electrical grid and wastewater management up to snuff.\nRELATED\nFed Minutes Show Lone Hawk Battling Doves Over Interest Rates \"When you have an inability of cars to get to work, if you have an inability of rapid transit to be rapid, you have a problem. People don't get where they need to be, information doesn't get where it needs to be and products don't get where they need to be,\" says Heidi Crebo-Rediker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former chief economist at the State Department. \"There are costs associated with congestion and fuel and repair that go straight to consumers.\"\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers estimates U.S. households will incur costs of $481 billion related to degraded surface transportation between 2012 and 2020. And a failure to increase current infrastructural investment levels could cost American households $3,000 per year until 2020, just in terms of job cutbacks and declining business productivity, according to the society.\n\"I think it's very important to discuss this issue from the perspective of the future. A lot of people today have talked about how the need for increased funding is very well established,\" says Felicia Wong, president and CEO of the Roosevelt Institute. \"I think the politics around this are what's most interesting.\"\nInfrastructure has generated ripples on both sides of the political spectrum. Senate Republicans caught flack earlier this year when they blocked a $478 billion infrastructure bill introduced earlier this year by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate. But one of the most significant infrastructural reform projects in U.S. history was launched by Republican President Dwight Eisenhower back in the 1950s.\nSeveral speakers at Thursday's forum referenced Eisenhower's revolutionary Interstate Highway project – the massive infrastructure program established through the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. The legislation eventually led to the construction of some 41,000 miles of interstate highway, directly and indirectly generating millions of jobs and allowing people and products across the country to efficiently travel from point A to point B.\nRELATED\nHigher Interest Rates Could Make Fixing America's Infrastructure More Expensive \"There used to be a bipartisan consensus that infrastructure was important,\" Vice President Joe Biden said Thursday. \"We can debate how we pay for these investments, but we can't debate about whether they're necessary.\"\nPlenty of Republicans and Democrats alike have spoken in favor of updating America's dilapidated infrastructure in recent years, but there are holdouts on both sides of the aisle. And there's disagreement on how best to fund the projects or how big of a priority they should be.\n\"When there is not enough money to fix our transportation system, then it's because this government has made other choices,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Thursday. \"No one sits around and says, 'I hate roads.' Underinvestment is a necessary consequence of other decisions that are undermining our economic future.\"\nSome left-leaning legislators have used congestion to garner support and further other political interests without directly addressing actual infrastructural deficiencies, says Robert Atkinson, founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. And many on the right have spurned infrastructure legislation to avoid raising taxes or altering spending priorities.\n\"What we've got to really do is get a new dialogue. This stuff works,\" Atkinson says. \"At least parts of either side don't want to acknowledge that.\"\nRELATED\nIs the U.S. Due for Another Recession? The forum's general consensus was that infrastructure proponents need to take a two-pronged approach to winning allies. The first is generating bipartisan support, and the second is getting millennials to care about long-term infrastructural investment.\n\"It is partially a marketing issue. When I told my daughter I was speaking at a national infrastructure panel, she said, 'Again?'\" Crebo-Rediker said.\nPart of the problem is also the fact that millennials don't have a particularly large seat at the table in policy discussions like these. Only one of the 22 members of Thursday's panel discussion self-identified as a millennial, and that lone millennial wasn't directly involved in the discussion of how to improve infrastructure's standing in the eyes of young people.\nReaching millennials may ultimately come down to actually reaching out to millennials. Until that happens, though, the politicians, policy buffs and business leaders in attendance Thursday have taken it upon themselves to make infrastructure a sexy topic of discussion.\nTAGS: infrastructure transportation", "external_links": ["http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/no10/defbr14.cfm", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0r4x%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Bringing%20%27Sexy%27%20Back%20to%20Infrastructure", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0r4x%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/economic_analysis_of_transportation_investments.pdf", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0r4x%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0r4x%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Bringing%20%27Sexy%27%20Back%20to%20Infrastructure&summary=American%20infrastructure%20is%20doomed%20to%20dilapidation%20without%20more%20interest%20in%20paying%20for%20necessary%20upgrades.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0r4x%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Bringing%20%27Sexy%27%20Back%20to%20Infrastructure", "http://infrastructurereportcard.org/a/#p/grade-sheet/americas-infrastructure-investment-needs", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0r4x%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:07:30.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
