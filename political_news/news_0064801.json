But all that money can't even buy a dead cat bounce. If money won't move the meter, the money is going somewhere else. If Jeb doesn't break out of single digits, the money has got to reevaluate the field. Quote: Originally Posted by Camelot Citizens United will make Bush a shoe in to win the nomination.

Citizens United will make this decision. The media has fooled you. We are still a whole year out from the election. All the Republicans have is Bush, Rubio and Kasich. Rubio is a man-child joke and Kasich has been off the national stage too long. It will be Bush - Hillary. In time you will see that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:55:58.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
