As a GIA partner we provided input during the consultation period to ensure the best possible outcome was achieved for the kiwifruit industry and New Zealand.” \n“We believe the Government has landed in an appropriate and pragmatic place as a result of the consultation.” \nThe kiwifruit industry is no stranger to unwanted pests and diseases so is very supportive of any initiatives that increase protection at the border. \n“As passenger numbers coming into New Zealand rise, so too does the risk of unwanted pests and diseases. Therefore it makes sense to have a funding mechanism that can keep pace with the changing risk profile; and those that create risks at the border will also fund the activities to mitigate them.” \nPassenger volumes are forecast to increase to 13.3 million by 2018/19. This growth is expected to continue at around 3.5–4 percent per year. \nClick here for more information on the Government’s website. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:58:01.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
