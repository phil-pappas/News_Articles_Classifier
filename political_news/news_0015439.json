Elijah Cummings, the committee’s top Democrat, said of Gowdy on the show.\nBut Democratic glee over Republican discomfiture and the political theater aside, serious questions await Clinton:\n• Whether Clinton received or was aware of Stevens’ emails. Gowdy did not release the emails, but he assured that that question would be atop his list for Clinton Thursday: “I want to know why certain things made it to your inbox, Madam Secretary, but the plaintive pleadings of our own ambassador that you put in place for more security never bothered to make it to your inbox. I think that’s a fair question.”\n• If so, why there was no response. Gowdy claims that Stevens even joked about his messages to the State Department being ignored. That is where the tens of thousands of deleted emails from Clinton’s private email server could hurt her the most. “Her biggest problem has always been herself,” GOP strategist Lisa Boothe said.\n• Whether or not officials were adequately prepared to respond to the attack once it began. Gowdy said there was new information about preparedness that he could not disclose, but if put to Clinton she has to have an answer.\nGowdy needs to tread carefully, however. When men have questioned Clinton too aggressively in the past it has backfired, as in the case of her Senate debate with Rick Lazio.\n“If Trey Gowdy comes at her too hard, she will win that in a rout,” said Democratic strategist Matt Bennett.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:08:58.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
