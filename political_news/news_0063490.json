But when adjusting for currency movements, revenue growth was one percent.\nActing CEO Jan Gurander said the company sees \"continued improvement in Europe\" in the truck market, declining demand in North America and a weak market in Brazil. Demand in Asia, except for China, is set to remain \"relatively stable.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
