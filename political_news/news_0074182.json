(AP) - Former Gov. John Kitzhaber is on his own when it comes to paying for legal help. \nGov. Kate Brown rejected Kitzhaber's request for the state to pay legal bills stemming from an ongoing influence-peddling investigation, according to a report in the Oregonian. \nThe state offers legal coverage if employees are taken to court for performing state duties. \nBrown spokeswoman Kristen Grainger says the governor felt Kitzhaber's application didn't address that requirement, the newspaper reported. \n\"State policy required written representations by the Governor's Office that Kitzhaber had acted in good faith and within the scope of his job duties, and there wasn't sufficient information to do that,\" Grainger told the Oregonian. \nKitzhaber resigned in February amid questions of whether his girlfriend used her position for personal financial gain and whether Kitzhaber helped. They have been under investigation by the FBI and IRS. \nThirteen former state employees have gotten more than $37,000 of their legal defenses paid for by the state as of late September. They include Kitzhaber's former appointments secretary and his former adviser on energy issues. \nTop local headlines:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:53:19.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
