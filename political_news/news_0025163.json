Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H. said U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid was \"just wrong,\" when he questioned the importance of the New Hampshire's presidential primary. Shaheen said Tuesday that Reid \"doesn’t understand the New Hampshire primary (and) why it’s so important.\" The primary is important, Shaheen said, because the electorate is so “engaged.” Reid questioned the roles New Hampshire and Iowa play in picking a president. “You go to New Hampshire — there aren’t any minorities there; nobody lives there,” Reid said, according to published reports. “You go to Iowa, and there are a few people there. But again, it is a place that does not demonstrate what America is all about, for a lot of different reasons.” “Candidates have to go out and talk to real voters,” Shaheen said Tuesday during a teleconference from the American embassy in Berlin, Germany. “It’s the best job interview that a presidential candidate gets.” She said the state’s first-in-the nation primary is “very important to our presidential selection process.” “New Hampshire has very diverse opinions and ideas about the future of this country,” Shaheen said. Foreign affairs Shaheen also called Iran “a bad actor,” in reaction to reports it test fired a new ballistic missile. “They are engaged in terrorist activities in the Middle East and other parts of the world,” Shaheen said “It’s very important for us to do everything we can to try to thwart what they’re doing.” She also called for the U.S. to continue its fight against Islamic State militants and addressed the conflict in Syria. She also stressed, “I don’t think we should putting tens of thousands of troops on the ground in the Middle East.” CNN reported Monday that state-run media had reported that Iran test-fired a new precision-guided, long-range missile. Shaheen held the teleconference to address the Syrian refugee crisis and made stops in Greece, Germany and the Ukraine. She met face-to-face with refugees, who told her “very heart-wrenching stories about the challenges the Syrians are facing in the conflict.” She said she supported the plan by the Obama administration to allow 100,000 Syrian refugees to come into the United States during the next two years. “We need to look at how we can expedite those refugees who want to come to the United States,” Shaheen said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:20:42.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
