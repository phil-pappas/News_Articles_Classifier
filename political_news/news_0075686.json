I wanted to talk with him. I wanted to have the two sides of the coin,” he said.\nChretien also encouraged Trudeau to re-open Canada’s embassy in Iran. The Conservative government severed ties with the Islamic Republic in 2012, citing Iran’s “significant threat” to global peace and security. \nMore generally speaking, Chretien advised Trudeau to remember Canada’s place in the world when dealing with international partners. \n“Canada is a big country but we are not the biggest.”\nAnd when it comes to Canada’s closest ally, the United States, Chretien said a good relationship is pretty easy to maintain, as long as there’s an understanding of the president’s political limitations. \n“The difficult thing with the president of the United States is he cannot deliver as a prime minister can deliver, because he has always to go to the Congress and to the Senate,” said Chretien. \nBut Chretien also said the prime minister must stand by Canadian values if the U.S. comes knocking. He pointed to the country’s tradition of joining military missions led by the United Nations or NATO, rather than a single country, such as the U.S.-led mission against ISIS in Syria and Iraq. \n“That was the policy that existed under (Pierre Elliot) Trudeau when we had the first war in Iraq … And it was my policy, too, and that’s why I said no to the war in Iraq to George W. Bush.” \nTrudeau confirmed to U.S. President Barack Obama last week that Canada will pull its fighter jets out of the war against ISIS. Rather, he has pledged to bolster the Canadian Forces’ training of Iraqi forces. \nHigh hopes for the young leader \nChretien, who joined Trudeau on parts of the marathon 78-day election campaign, said he is happy to support the 43-year-old prime minister-designate. He said Trudeau is a “serious” politician, like his father was, but that he also got a lot of his political skill from his maternal side. Trudeau’s grandfather, Jimmy Sinclair, was a cabinet minister in Louis St. Laurent’s Liberal government. \n“Jimmy Sinclair was quite a politician,” said Chretien. “He was a tall guy, good looking, comfortable with people.”\nRelated Stories Trudeau enlists Chretien's support to attack NDP Chretien says Putin's help in Syria should be welcomed by Canada 'Sunny ways': Justin Trudeau celebrates historic Liberal victory Photos Former prime minister Jean Chretien speaks to CTV's Question Period on Oct. 25, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:38:34.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
