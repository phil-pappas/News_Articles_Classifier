The court says on its website that it tries to issue opinions within 60 days after arguments. \nThe judges did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n“We feel they’ve had enough time to rule,” Arias said. \nIsabel Medina of Los Angeles said she and her family came to this country in 1996. \n“Fasting is not really a sacrifice for me. The sacrifice is being away from my children for 9 days,” she said, her voice trembling. \nIf the president’s proposals stand, she said, she could benefit from Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, which would protect some parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Another major part of Obama’s executive orders would expand a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects young immigrants from deportation if they were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \nMedina said the orders would let her keep her family together and let her “continue with my schooling so I can fully contribute to this great country.” \nShe and Arias both spoke in English, then in Spanish. \nOther “fasters” are from Silver Spring, Maryland; Mountain Home, Arkansas; Woodburn, Oregon, and Albuquerque, New Mexico. \nMiguel Claros, of Silver Spring, spoke in Spanish, with Arias translating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:20:17.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
