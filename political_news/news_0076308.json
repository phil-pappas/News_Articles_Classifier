Ltd. Chairman Yang Zhongmin and Dwi Windarto, the president director of a consortium of Indonesian state companies, PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN Indonesia.\nChina had been expected to secure the project in Southeast Asia's largest economy after Indonesian officials rejected Japan's requirement for a government guarantee of loans late last month.\nRegional rivals China and Japan had been competing to construct the 150-kilometer (93-mile) Jakarta to Bandung high-speed line as part of 750 kilometers (466 miles) of new rail planned for Indonesia.\nThe Indonesian state-owned companies forming the joint venture agreement are a construction company PT Wijaya Karya, railway operator PT Kereta Api Indonesia, toll-road builder PT Jasa Marga, and a plantation company PT Perkebunan Nusantara VIII.\n\"We hope this new company will compete outside Indonesia for high-speed railway projects,\" said the joint venture chairman Sahala Lumban Gaol at the signing ceremony.\nHe said the construction is expected to begin early next year and completed in 2018. The trains are to start operating in early 2019 with eight stops, speeds of 250 kilometers (155 miles) an hour, and a fare of about $16.\nThe existing regular trains to Bandung, the capital of West Java province, take about three hours and cost about $8.\nPresident Joko Widodo has ambitious plans to improve Indonesia's infrastructure, which could boost manufacturing and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.\nThe competition between China and Japan for the rail project has been accompanied by many twists and turns as Indonesia weighed proposals and counterproposals.\nChina won the rights to build the high-speed railway after standing firm on not using Indonesian government money or requiring a government guarantee for loans.\nChina will hold 40 percent of the venture and the state-owned China Development Bank is to finance 75 percent of the project.\n\"We stand ready to work with Indonesia to ensure the quality and safety of the project,\" Yang told reporters, \"We hold our commitment strongly since the beginning.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
