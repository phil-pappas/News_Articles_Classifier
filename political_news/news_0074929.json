Before the Ffestiniog Railway ran the journeys, it was illegal for a small railway to carry passengers. As the tracks were only two feet (60cm) apart, it was thought carrying people would have been impractical. To mark the anniversary, events will be held throughout the weekend at the station and in Porthmadog.
