(Nati Harnik / Associated Press) \nAs the Democratic candidates prepare for their first televised debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner in the race, continues to enjoy a more favorable image among her party's voters than any of her challengers, new polling shows. \nA Gallup poll of nearly 6,000 Democrats and independents who lean Democratic provides an unusually detailed view of how the party's voters view their potential nominees. \nClinton has lost ground since the summer, but she still has a \"net favorable\" rating -- the difference between the percentage of Democrats who view her favorably and those who see her unfavorably -- of plus 52, Gallup found. \nBy comparison, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her closest challenger, has a net favorable image of plus 40. His rating is lower in large part because fewer Democrats know enough about him to have an image one way or the other. \nAnalysis of the favorability ratings illustrates the different bases of support the two candidates depend on. Sanders has a slightly higher net favorable rating than Clinton among white Democrats, those younger than 30 and those with college degrees. \nBut Clinton's net favorable rating is far higher than Sanders' among blacks and Latinos, those with a high school education or less, women and voters older than 50. Her ratings are also somewhat higher among Democrats who call themselves moderates. \nAmong men, liberals and voters with graduate or professional degrees, the two candidates' net favorable ratings are nearly the same. \nGallup based its analysis on polling conducted between Sept. 12 and Oct. 10. The candidate ratings are based on a random subset of those polled and have a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 5 things to watch in tonight's Democratic debate \nBy comparison with the reality TV series that has been the Republican presidential debate season, tonight's gathering of five Democratic candidates may seem like a quiet dinner party. \nBut there will be plenty happening both onstage and off, as the Democrats try to infuse their race with some of the excitement surrounding Trump and Friends. \nHillary Rodham Clinton will try to take back the narrative of her history as secretary of State, whereas Bernie Sanders -- while promising no personal attacks -- will seek to contrast his record with hers and solidify his standing as a serious contender. \nThe three other guys you haven't heard about so much? They're each hoping the debate will offer a moment in the spotlight. \nHere are a few of the things to watch for in tonight's conversation: \nRead more More from Trail Guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:52:33.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
