It has been selling its lending and finance units, exiting a banking sector with stricter oversight.\nTrian acquired 98.5 million shares, or about 1 percent of the Fairfield, Connecticut, company. The fund's executives, Peltz and Ed Garden, have a longstanding relationship with GE CEO Jeff Immelt.\n\"GE is executing a bold transformation that will generate attractive stockholder returns in the years ahead as the company reshapes its portfolio,\" Trian said in a statement.\nThe investor has not asked GE for board representation.\nIn May, Dupont shareholders rejected a contentious campaign by Trian for seats on its board. The fund had sought more influence at DuPont, saying that the company was falling short of its potential. In June, Trian took a stake in the water and fluid-products systems company Pentair and pushed it to consider acquisitions.\nImmelt, meanwhile, says GE is looking forward to constructive dialogue with Trian as it moves ahead with its transformation.\nGeneral Electric shares rose 78 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $26.25 in premarket trading Monday shortly before the market open.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
