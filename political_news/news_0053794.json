Tim Ryan and Bill Johnson don’t have announced opponents for next year’s election, they busied themselves raising money in the year’s third quarter to be prepared if someone declares their candidacy for their House seats. \nBetween July and September, Ryan of Howland, D-13th, raised $260,056 toward his re-election bid, according to his Thursday filing with the Federal Election Commission. In the first nine months of the year, he’s raised $456,995. \nOf the money Ryan raised in the third quarter, $134,600 came from political-action committees and $125,456 came from individuals. \nIn the last quarter, Ryan received $5,000 donations from the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Active Ballot Club; the United Steelworkers Political Action Fund; the International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers PAC; the Carpenters Legislative Improvement Committee, the Machinist Non-Partisan Political League; and the Service Employees International Union Committee on Political Education. \nDuring the third quarter, Ryan spent $105,303. As of Sept. 30, Ryan’s campaign fund had $505,869 in it, largely because of money he carried over from previous years. \nEarlier this year, Ryan used campaign funds to travel to New York City, Miami and four places in California. \nHis campaign report for July to September listed hotel stays a lot closer to home. His campaign paid for hotel stays in Warren, Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus. There’s also a $1,489 expense for “travel/lodging” at Capitol Hill Suites in Washington, D.C. \nRyan’s district includes portions of Mahoning, Trumbull, Portage, Stark and Summit counties. \nDuring the third quarter, Johnson of Marietta, R-6th, raised $291,537. In the first nine months of the year, he’s collected $824,454. \nIn the third quarter, he received $134,350 in contributions from PACs, and $142,185 from people. Johnson also loaned $15,000 to his campaign on Sept. 30. \nJohnson received a $10,000 contribution from Majority Committee PAC, the committee founded by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who recently opted not to run for speaker of the House. Johnson also received $5,000 from Political Education Patterns, Political Arm International Union of Operating Engineers, and Prosperity Action Inc., a PAC founded by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2008 failed GOP vice presidential nominee and House Budget Committee chairman who has rejected requests to run for House speaker. \nDuring the third quarter, Johnson spent $93,728, and had $913,878 in his campaign fund as of Sept. 30, including money he carried over from previous years. \nJohnson used campaign funds in the third quarter to travel to National Harbor, Md.; New York City for a campaign event; Farmington, Pa.; Canton and Columbus. \nDec. 16 is the filing deadline for candidates to run in the March 2016 primary.
