Human rights activists say all Eritreans are forced to join the army at 17, supposedly for two years of national service, but claim many are not allowed to leave. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:54:59.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
