And if you're a potential investor in the daily fantasy sports websites FanDuel and DraftKings, it's pretty much the same.\nCan recent stinging setbacks be offset by a \"wait 'til next year\" promise?\nBoth were on the fast track to initial public offerings next year, but now DraftKings and FanDuel are under fire after revelations surfaced that they allowed employees to play at each other's sites and win large amounts of money, using information its customers didn't have.\nNew York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman launched an inquiry and at least one class-action lawsuit has been filed. Boston-based DraftKings and FanDuel, headquartered in New York, are now in damage control, and have banned their employees from playing in daily fantasy games.\nTrue, some investors still can't wait to get in the game, despite the controversy. Daily fantasy sports sites have grown at explosive rates over the past few years. But the scandal is producing two major outcomes that can't be ignored.\nFirst, more attention is being focused on the lack of regulation in these sites, which reward fans financially for winning play. And second, some multi-million dollar entities have turned a bit skittish: Major League Baseball, which owns a piece of DraftKings, is distancing itself from the site as the scandal unfolds. ESPN, the cable network owned by the Walt Disney Co. (ticker: DIS), cut sponsored daily fantasy sports elements from its news shows.\nThat may not affect the long-term prospects or desirability of any IPO, but it does raise questions as to how much both sites must tighten up their operations in the face of increased scrutiny.\n\"I do believe that both companies have some public trust work to do, more so now than ever,\" says Derrick Morton, CEO of FlowPlay, a Seattle-based developer of virtual worlds, social casinos and fantasy sports-based casual games. \"There have been rumblings about the gaps between the casual sports fan looking to have some daily fantasy sports fun versus the professional players who have advanced computer algorithms that aid them in their selections of players.\" (When you think about it, that sounds a lot like what happens in daily trading on Wall Street.)\n\"How the public will react to the story … will be interesting to watch,\" says Ed Edmonds, associate dean for library and information technology and a law professor at Notre Dame Law School. \"This could have a big impact on the future of FanDuel and DraftKings. But if they were to go public in the current environment, I think they would do quite well.\"\nOthers counter that investors might shy away from the sector once the insider-information brouhaha foists more attention on how hard it is to win.\n\"Daily fantasy is in a bind even without the rigging,\" says Laurence DeGaris, author of \"Sports Marketing: A Practical Approach\" and professor of marketing at the University of Indianapolis. \"There's an argument to be made that it's a game of skill because most of the winnings go to a very small percentage of players. But if that's the case, then it'll be hard to attract new suckers — er, customers.\"\nAs for big payoffs for the everyday investor, that's another story, one that's apparently not a fantasy. If it's a question of \"show me the money\" (a phrase coined, after all, by a fictional football player), all you have do is look at the starting lineup.\nDraftKings has raised an incredible amount — $375 million — and aside from Major League Baseball, lists Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX), Kraft Heinz Foods Co. (HNZ) and the National Hockey League as investors. FanDuel isn't far behind at $360 million, and its roster includes Google Capital and Time Warner Investments, subsidiaries of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Time Warner (TWX).\nAnother FanDuel backer is the aptly named Bullpen Capital, a venture capital firm in Palo Alto, California, which has invested more that $18 million — and remains bullish. \"There are 56 million people in the U.S. and Canada playing fantasy sports every year,\" says Paul Martino, Bullpen Capital's managing director. \"Only a few million of them play on daily fantasy sites. So we are just at the beginning. There's still a huge market that's untapped.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:33:09.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
