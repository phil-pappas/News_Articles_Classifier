But what if slavery wasn't really all that bad? That's how one geography textbook played it when it sidestepped history, describing slaves as immigrants who came over to America to work without mentioning that these people were kidnapped, bought and sold like cattle, and worked for no pay because they were considered property of white men.\n Cobi Burren, a ninth-grader in Texas, texted his mother a troubling passage from his world geography textbook that characterized slaves simply as immigrants who came to America as agricultural workers:\nThe Atlantic slave trade brought millions of workers...notice the nuanced language there. Workers implies wages...yes? My son @coby_burren sent this to me today. He's in 9th grade...he woke y'all! #staywoke #blackboymagic\nA photo posted by @mscoachb_honest on Sep 30, 2015 at 10:05am PDT\n Cobi's mother, Roni Dean-Burren ​, a Ph.D. candidate in education curriculum, brought this indignity to the nation's attention via a video she posted on Facebook last week that has since gone viral with over 1 million views. The offensive caption appeared in a section called \"Patterns of Immigrants.\"\n\"So, [slavery] is now considered 'immigration,' \" she says in the video. She then points out how, in the same section, the text describes some Europeans coming to America as \"indentured servants\" who earned \"little to no pay.\"\n\"So they say that about English and European people, but there is no mention of African working as slaves or being slaves,\" Dean-Burren says. \"It just says we were workers.\"\nIn a caption below the video, Dean-Burren wrote, \"Erasure is real y'all!!! Teach your children the truth!!! ​ #blacklivesmatter\"\nAfter the post went viral, McGraw-Hill responded by saying, \"We believe we can do better,\" and promised to correct the caption:\nFollow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/prachigu", "https://www.facebook.com/McGrawHillEducation/posts/1056963857671901", "https://www.facebook.com/roni.deanburren/videos/10208248919206996/?pnref=story?type=1", "http://abc13.com/education/mom-who-called-out-textbook-publisher-talks-to-abc-13/1016634/", "https://instagram.com/p/8QzMZ3krmT/"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:13:54.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
