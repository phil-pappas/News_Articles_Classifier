The league has been able to use the exemption to prevent its teams from moving, and it was a relocation dispute that had landed on the court’s doorstep.\nRead More Supreme Court on Deck in MLB Antitrust Battle? San Jose Takes Its Hacks Against Baseball The justices, in a brief written order, declined to hear an appeal by the city of San Jose, Calif., which has sought to become the new home of the Oakland Athletics. The city alleged the league and team owners have colluded to prevent the team from moving.\nLower courts ruled for MLB, saying they were bound by previous Supreme Court precedent establishing the exemption.\nThe exemption dates back to an earlier era of Supreme Court jurisprudence. The court in 1922 ruled that federal antitrust law didn’t apply to baseball because the game was a local affair, not interstate commerce.\nIn two subsequent cases, from 1953 and 1972, the Supreme Court chose again to leave baseball’s exemption in place, deciding that overturning it could be destabilizing and hurt the sport. The court in those cases said any changes should come from Congress.\nThe baseball rulings have been widely criticized by legal scholars, a fact noted by current Justice Samuel Alito in a historical lecture he delivered in 2008.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:21:11.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
