There, plaster is peeling away from the bricks laid in place more than 100 years ago when the Capitol was built. The plaster is deteriorating due to a moisture problem caused by humidity changes, leaking water and non-breathable oil-based paint. \nThe problem has been known for years, and now repairs are underway. \nThe project's lead architect, Laura Davis, says it's \"pretty much\" a plaster repair project â€” \"but it's 200 feet in the air in the most prominent building in the state.\" \nThe repairs mark the end of a series of rehabilitation work that began at the Capitol in the 1990s. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
