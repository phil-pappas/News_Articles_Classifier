Advertisement More by this Author \nAfter a week of silence, Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has said that his Motion for the impeachment of Devolution and Planning Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru is still on course. \nMr Keter told the Daily Nation that after he submitted the Motion to the National Assembly Clerk with the backing of 97 MPs, he was asked to add some details and flesh out his grounds for the impeachment. \nHe said he had been informed last Friday that the Legal Department had finished working on it and had then handed it back to the Clerk, Mr Justin Bundi, who will submit it to the Speaker. \n“We are done with the legal issues and will now wait for the Speaker’s approval and the House Business Committee (HBC) to decide on it. It will appear next week, I think,” Mr Keter said on the phone over the weekend. \nSpeaker Justin Muturi told journalists two weeks ago he would have no qualms approving the Motion, after which Mr Keter would be required to officially notify the House of his intentions to initiate it. \nIt would then be up to the HBC to decide when it is to be debated. House rules require that motions of such nature are dealt with expeditiously. \nGrounds cited for the Motion are gross violation of the Constitution in the management of the National Youth Service, leading to loss of public funds, financial irregularities among others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:58:58.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
