Bernie Sanders has raised nearly as much money as the former secretary of state and she has not put to bed the ongoing scandal with her use of a private email server.\n“She brings in baggage, and doesn’t do well against all the Republican candidates,” Zogby said.\nThe vice president, though, polls well against the still-vast Republican field of candidates.\n“At 72, he may be the fresh face in all of this,” he said.\nFormer Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman, a Biden confidant, sent a letter to the vice president’s closest friends and advisers Thursday that says while the vice president is still undecided, a decision is close.\n“If he runs, he will run because of his burning conviction that we need to fundamentally change the balance in our economy and the political structure to restore the ability of the middle class to get ahead,” Kaufman wrote.\n“If he decides to run, we will need each and every one of you — yesterday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:29:50.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
