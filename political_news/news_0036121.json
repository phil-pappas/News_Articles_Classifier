In a flurry of appearances on Sunday political talk shows, Donald Trump let it be known that he's ready to take off the gloves and hammer Ben Carson . Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was increasingly willing to hit fellow Republicans. And, on the Democratic side, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders indicated he's not going to let Hillary Clinton set her campaign in cruise control, even after two strong weeks. 20 photos: Who's running for President? 20 photos: Who's running for President?

And I hope you'll join me on this journey.\" Hide Caption 2 of 20 20 photos: Who's running for President? Sen. Bernie Sanders , an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, announced his run in an email to supporters on April 30. He has said the United States needs a \"political revolution\" of working-class Americans to take back control of the government from billionaires. \"This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists,\" Sanders said at a rally in Vermont on May 26. Hide Caption 3 of 20 20 photos: Who's running for President? Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley launched his presidential campaign May 30 in Baltimore with an appeal to the party's progressive base that he hopes will upend the conventional wisdom that Hillary Clinton is destined to clinch the Democratic nomination.\"This is the urgent work calling us forward today: to rebuild the truth of the American Dream for all Americans,\" O'Malley said at his rally. \"And to begin right now.\" Hide Caption 4 of 20 20 photos: Who's running for President?

Hide Caption 5 of 20 20 photos: Who's running for President? Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate, solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOP's establishment. He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23. \"These are all of our stories,\" Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia. \"These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.\" Hide Caption 6 of 20 20 photos: Who's running for President? Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, announced his 2016 bid with a rally in Miami on April 13, a day after Clinton announced. He's a Republican rising star who swept into office in 2010 in a wave of tea party fervor.\"Grounded by the lessons of our history, but inspired by the promise of our future, I announce my candidacy for President of the United States of America,\" Rubio told supporters at Miami's Freedom Tower.

Because politicians do what is politically expedient -- I want to do what's right.\" Hide Caption 9 of 20 20 photos: Who's running for President? Former Arkansas Gov.
