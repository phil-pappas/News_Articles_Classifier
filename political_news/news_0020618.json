I think that would not be the right answer,” he said. \n“The discussion in Britain has to address the real issues. Is there any of the major challenges and threats around us – the refugee crisis, conflict with Russia, the crisis around the Mediterranean – does anyone really think you can do it alone? That anybody of us can do it alone? I think the clear answer is no. Together we are strong.” \nAsked that many Britons will believe the country acted successful alone so for centuries, Mr Gahrer replied: “Yes, that time is gone. The Empire is gone once and for all. There is no such time anymore. \n“We are not in the Champions League alone. Together we can think of being in the Champions League globally, but not anybody of us alone.” \nMr Gahrer also warned that an Out vote would “reopen the Scotland debate” and that the City of London’s banks “might leave if you leave”. \nHe also said that Germany would not back an “ever looser union”– a warning shot over Mr Cameron’s determination to get a promise of “every closer union” removed from the EU treaties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:20:39.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
