(Steven Senne/Associated Press) October 2 at 6:10 PM Regarding the Oct. 1 editorial “ Flunking the health-care test ”:\nU.S. leaders and the American public agree that everyone should have access to affordable, high-quality health care, so why did the editorial board endorse a punitive tax on good health plans?\nThe editorial’s arguments for the so-called “Cadillac tax” were simply uninformed and wrong. This harmful and unnecessary tax is fundamentally flawed. It will hollow out health-care plans and drive up costs because people will not get the care they need until it is too late. Instead of asking industries and corporations that benefit richly from health-care reform to make a fair contribution, the editorial board wants to increase what working people have to pay out of pocket. This means cutting benefits for those who need them the most. That’s bad policy and bad for working families.\nThe editorial board should be a leader in exposing the real problem facing most Americans: a health-care system that is the most expensive in the world because of the outsize profits that go to drug manufacturers and insurance companies.\nRichard L. Trumka , Washington\nThe writer is president of the AFL-CIO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:32:34.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
