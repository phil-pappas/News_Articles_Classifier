Having the input of psychologists for patients and their families during this challenging period of their lives will help people to adjust to their diagnosis and cope with the demands of treatment. \nIris Fontanilla, Chair of the NZPsS Institute of the Health Psychology said today that psychologists have a depth of understanding of the psychological effects of illness and are experienced in working in physical health settings. They are well placed to provide support and expertise for patients with cancer. Indeed, many are already working very effectively in this area. Having this level of support increased for adults, adolescents and their families will help alleviate the psychological distress, depression, and anxiety which can accompany a diagnosis of cancer. Many psychologists who work with people who have had traumatic experiences will be in a position to take up these roles. \nThe Government is to be congratulated for meeting a significant health need and responding to it in a way that will make a difference to the lives of cancer patients across the country. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
