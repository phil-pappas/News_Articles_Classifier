Erie Christian Academy ​barred a 5-year-old girl from attending school just days before classes started allegedly because her parents are lesbians, local ABC affiliate KGTV reports . The girl's parents, identified as Sheena and Lashaune, are planning to file a civil rights suit against the school alleging discrimination.\nSheena and Lashaune's daughter had attended the private school for preschool, so when they were called into a meeting with a school official and told that their daughter would not be allowed to enroll, they were blindsided. \"They told us, 'Oh this is not about your child,' but it is about my child,\" Sheena told KGTV.\n \"If we knew from the beginning that this was unacceptable, they didn't condone or believe in this, if it was such a big deal, we would have never started her off there,\" she said. \"I would never put my child's emotional well-being in an unstable setting like that.\" ​\nAn administrator who identified herself as ​Kailyn told the news outlet that the school has a non-discrimination policy, yet when KGTV asked her whether the school had discriminated against the child because her parents were a same-sex couple, the administrator said, \"The Bible says homosexuality is a sin. We don't condone any sinful lifestyles.\" ​\n The same contradictory policy is reflected in its student handbook, which says that \"all people are valuable in God's eyes, regardless of physical, social, economic, ethnic, or other factors,\" but then also notes that the school opposes gay people and transgender people and reserves the right to \"refuse admission ... or discontinue enrollment\" of such students:\n​Mt. Erie Christian Academy is a religious, Bible-believing institution providing education in a distinct Christian environment, and it believes that its biblical role is to work in conjunction with the home to mold students to be Christ like. On those occasions in which the atmosphere or conduct within a particular home is counter to or in opposition to the biblical lifestyle that the school teaches, the school reserves the right, within its sole discretion, to refuse admission of an applicant or to discontinue enrollment of a student. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, living in, condoning or supporting sexual immorality; practicing homosexual lifestyle or alternative gender identity; promoting such practices; or otherwise having the inability to support the moral principles of the school (Leviticus 20:13a; Romans 1:21-27; Matthew 19:4-6; I Corinthians 6:9-20).\nIn response to KGTV's report, Mt. Erie Christian Academy released the following statement on its Facebook page :\n​Hello Mt. Erie family! We have been informed that today Channel 10 news will be airing a story about a Biblical decision that the School board made regarding our admissions policy. We stand firmly behind our board's decision and ask that you support us through this time. We may receive some backlash from those who do not respect our Biblical perspective, however we will continue to provide a Christian education. It's more concerning that we have invited Channel 10 news ou t to cover so many of the events and programs that we have for the community however they have never shown any interest, but the first opportunity they get to talk about controversy they are willing to spend significant resources to convince you that the church must conform to the world's beliefs and disregard our own. Show your loving support for Mt. Erie Christian Academy by posting a positive review about our school on google or Channel 10 news. ​\nKGTV consulted San Diego attorney Eugene Iredale, who said that the school — which receives no public funding — is protected by the First Amendment. However, he says that there's a limit to religious freedom, and because of the increasing public acceptance of same-sex marriage, a case like this may end up at the Supreme Court in the near future:\n\"Now the question is where do you draw the line?\" Iredale asked. \"If you have a religion that believed in human sacrifice or amputation of the arm or the hand for theft, would we permit that in the interest of permitting the free practice of one's religion? I don't think so, and one could argue that psychologically… this is as devastating to the little 5-year-old girl as some of those other vicious practices.\" ​\n\"I want my baby to be safe when she grows up,\" Sheena said. \"I don't want her to ever have to be discriminated against because of her lifestyle. That's not fair.\" ​ ​\nFollow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://www.10news.com/news/team-10-girl-barred-from-san-diego-school-due-to-lesbian-parents", "https://www.facebook.com/mterieschools/posts/10153352694292928", "https://twitter.com/prachigu"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:51:46.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
