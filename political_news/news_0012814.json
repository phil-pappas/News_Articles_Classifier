The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating whether Volkswagen's \"clean diesel\" advertising claims amounted to a fraud on American consumers, adding a new avenue for regulators to punish the company for its deception. For years, the company aired memorable TV spots using terms such as “miraculous” to describe the car’s seemingly too-good-to-be-true balance of peppy acceleration, 40-mile-per-gallon gas mileage and low greenhouse gas emissions.
