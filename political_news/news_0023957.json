POSTED: 02:09 PM CDT Oct 14, 2015 UPDATED: 06:43 PM CDT Oct 14, 2015 Tweet DIXON, Mo. - \nABC 17 News obtained copies of a grand jury charges filed against two city officials in Dixon, Mo., about an hour south of Jefferson City. The documents accuse the couple of covering up evidence in the police department and stealing from taxpayers. \nMichael Plummer is the Marshal, and his wife, Shelia, was the city's collector. They are facing a total of sixteen counts filed under a sealed indictment that was just made public Wednesday. \nMichael Plummer, among other things, is accused of: lying to the Pulaski County Sheriff about another police officer accused of stealing a car, covering up a DWI case, and stealing city-owned police lights. His wife, Shelia, allegedly reduced the water bill for her parent's home while she was on the job. \nThe case started following a state report from the Missouri auditor that uncovered several issues. Around the same time, Dixon police officers turned over allegations involving the marshal to the town's mayor. He requested a special investigation to the county prosecutor, who went to the highway patrol. More charges could be filed, while they continue to investigate.
