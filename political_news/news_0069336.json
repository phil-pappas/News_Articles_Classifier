But the hackers tried at least five times.\nThe news highlights the potential national security risk Clinton took when she chose not to use a government email account.\nThe security of Clinton's private email system, including the server in the basement of her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., has been an important question since Clinton admitted in March that she had used it for all official government business.\nThe fact that infected emails were delivered to Clinton, even if she didn't infect herself, suggests that security protections and email filters on her homebrew server were weak or missing.\nAnd it's still a significant mystery how the hackers knew to send emails to Clinton's private server address which she used for State Department business, since in 2011 it was still a secret email address to most of the world.\nRoughly two years later, the email account belonging to an informal adviser to Clinton, Sidney Blumenthal, was hacked by a Romanian named Marcel-Lehel \"Guccifer\" Lazar who is now serving a seven-year prison sentence.\nEmails released from that hack in 2013 included the first public references to Clinton's private email address.\nIt's possible there were additional unwanted messages in Clinton's email account that she deleted before turning over work-related emails to the State Department.\nThe hackers designed these five messages to appear to be sent from a New York City government account, NYC.gov, so it's likely that Clinton mistakenly preserved them under the notion that these were government messages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:33:46.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
