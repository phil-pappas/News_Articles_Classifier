We welcome any opportunity to talk about this important issue and the work that has been done.\nThe NFL’s player health and safety efforts include nearly 40 recent safety-related rules’ changes, groundbreaking and longtime investments in independent research to advance knowledge, equipment, diagnostics and treatment, and a well-established suite of programs to promote youth safety in football and across all sports.\nThese initiatives and others are producing real results in the NFL: Concussions are down 35 percent since 2012 , helmet-to-helmet hits are down 43 percent since 2012, concussions caused by helmet-to-helmet or shoulder-to-helmet hits were almost exactly halved in 2014 from two years before, and hits to defenseless players were down 68 percent from 2013 to 2014 .\nThere is more public attention paid now to player health and safety. For that we are grateful. Broadened and deepened awareness will serve only to provide a better and safer game for players and fans.\nJeff Miller , New York\nThe writer is senior vice president of health and safety policy for the National Football League.", "external_links": ["http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2015/08/05/0ap3000000506671.pdf", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/08/05/concussions-reduced-rule-changes-defenseless-injured-players/31189031/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:55:09.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
