But it's not known how much class time students spend preparing for tests that became mandatory, starting in third grade, under the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind law and are a flashpoint in the debate over the Common Core academic standards.\n\"Learning is about so much more than just filling in the right bubble,\" Obama said in a video released on Facebook. \"So we're going to work with states, school districts, teachers and parents to make sure that we're not obsessing about testing.\"\nTo drive the point home, Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan plan an Oval Office meeting Monday with teachers and school officials working to reduce testing time. In all, between pre-K and 12th grade, students take about 112 standardized exams, according to the council report. It said testing amounts to 2.3 percent of classroom time for the average eighth-grader.\n\"How much constitutes too much time is really difficult to answer,\" said Michael Casserly, the council's executive director.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:13:43.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
