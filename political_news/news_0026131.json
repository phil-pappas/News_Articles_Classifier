(Andre Chung/For The Washington Post) October 9 at 5:09 PM Regarding the Oct. 7 front-page article “ 6,000 to leave prison early ”:\nPresident Obama’s upcoming release of nonviolent drug offenders seems very similar to the emptying of state mental hospitals during the 1970s, which many believe caused the current homelessness, drug and street crime problems . They both were supposed to help offenders/patients in community-based programs, with offenders monitored by a crowded parole and probation system. This release effort will not work, just as the one in the 1970s did not, because we don’t have the programs and services to meet the need.\nMost studies show that prisoners who return to their old neighborhoods are most likely to be recidivist. We should take the many closed military bases and create a reentry system to ensure these drug offenders get the treatment and job training they need and a family support program. We should have learned from our failure to help the mentally ill.\nMike Gimbel , Timonium\nThe writer is a former director of Baltimore County’s Office of Substance Abuse.", "external_links": ["http://www.salon.com/2013/09/29/ronald_reagans_shameful_legacy_violence_the_homeless_mental_illness/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:45:58.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
