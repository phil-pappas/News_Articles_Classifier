It isn’t inability keeping women out of senior positions, it is systemic discrimination based on gender,” says Muriel Tunoho. \n“Having more women in senior positions in government is not only good for democratic representation, it sets an example for everyone else. \n“We’re looking forward to having a government that takes gender equality seriously, in policy and in practice.” \nENDS E tu \nE tū: the new union for New Zealanders \nE tū has been created by the merger of the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union and Service and Food Workers' Union. E tū represents more than 50,000 working New Zealanders in industries as diverse as aviation, construction, journalism, food manufacturing, mining and cleaning. By standing together in a union workers get higher wages and better conditions. As the country's largest private sector union E tū can provide members with workplace representation, legal advice, a freephone support centre, work rights education and broad representation through E tū's campaigning and research work. We campaign hard for workers' rights, health and safety, a living wage for all Kiwis, and recognising high-value skilled work.
