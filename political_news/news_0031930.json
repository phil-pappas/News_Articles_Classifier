On a vote of 33 to 15, the senate passed a resolution calling for the removal of the flag from being flown over campus buildings. The Daily Mississippian, the student-run newspaper on campus, reported that the resolution will now go to the Student Body Pres. Rod Bridges to be signed. It will then go to the dean of students for a review by the administration. The student senate does not have the authority to remove the flag, but the administration may choose to act on their recommendation.
