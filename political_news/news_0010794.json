Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills suggested it might be a mistake to \"telegraph how much folks do or don't do off state mail b/c it may encourage others who are out there\" — and that publicizing the use of home email addresses could encourage others to do it, leaving them at risk of being hacked. Mills noted that she was on the receiving end of an attempted email hack herself.\nSlaughter then replied that a better approach might be for Clinton herself to make the point quietly to lawmakers.\nClinton worried about Fox media storm over 'mother' and 'father' passport issue By Nick Gass\nThe email exchange was released on Wednesday as part of the State Department's latest public disclosure of Clinton's messages from her times as secretary of state.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:50:06.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
