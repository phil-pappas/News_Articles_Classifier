David Gaedecke, commander of the 552nd Air Control Wing out of Tinker Air Force Base.\n“They gave their lives for us,” Gaedecke said at a recent memorial service at Tinker. “It was why they're so special, so honorable and so worthy of remembrance. Though a solemn occasion, these 24 crew members would be so proud to know we have carried the torch for freedom and assured the freedom of our two nations.”\nGaedecke said the crew members would have been proud of the special relationship maintained by the two nations. The Canadian detachment, which lost two airmen, has flown with their American counterparts at Tinker since 1979.\n“They would cheer knowing we have taken the fight to our enemy abroad and protected our citizens at home,” Gaedecke said. “Their deaths were not in vain. Their sacrifice serves as motivation and a reminder of greatness, of honor, of commitment and of excellence. ” Gaedecke, Canadian Detachment Commander Lt. Col. Don “Boc” Saunders, retired former wing commander Col. Wylie Koiner and retired Master Sgt. Ken Lybolt laid a wreath at the base of the fallen airmen's monument. Lybolt, currently a civilian employee at Tinker, was the maintenance crew chief of Yukla 27 and witnessed the crash from the flight line.\nThe accident was caused when the plane, call sign Yukla 27, encountered a flock of Canada geese on takeoff, destroying the engines and wiping out thrust on the left side of the plane. The 962nd Airborne Air Control Squadron plane was airborne for 42 seconds before banking into the ground about a mile from the end of the runway.\n“Let's all remember to be grateful and to learn by the example of honor these 24 heroes set for us all those years ago,” the colonel said. “May the crew of Yukla Two-Seven rest in peace and continue their faithful watch over all of us as angels of America's Wing.”\nThe Airmen lost that day are:\n1st Lt.
