A group of young House Democrats in Congress led by 34-year-old Eric Swalwell (D-California) has launched a \"listening tour\" to try and find out. \n\"We've gone to New York, New Hampshire, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and now up here in the Seattle, Tacoma area.\" Rep. Swalwell told a small group of students at the University of Puget Sound. \nSwalwell's group is called \"Future Forum,\" and Washington Congressman Derek Kilmer (D-6th District) is one of 14 members. \n\"Part of the interest of the Future Forum is trying to solve problems and solve problems that are specifically facing our millennials,\" Rep. Kilmer told KING 5. \nTopics raised by Puget Sound students ranged from campaign finance concerns to the economy and wage stagnation. \n\"The number one issue in my mind is job creation and really our economy and that there are jobs for the kids coming out of college,\" said student Amy Welch. \n\"Some of the conversation today was disheartening,\" Welch said. \"There was a little bit of political bias that I saw from our representatives, but I was also encouraged that there was listening going on, that there's a conversation going on. I was encouraged by all of them that our vote does matter.\" \nWhen another student mentioned that she may not vote and questioned whether her vote counts because of the amount of money in politics, Congressman Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona) candidly responded by saying: \n\"This really pisses me offâ€¦that's what they want you to think.\" . \n\"I know among my friends, even, there's a lot of uncertainty about whether or not they should vote,\" said Kayla Southwick, newly 18. \nWhen asked what inspired her to attend Monday's talk, she said: \"I thought it was important to see (the congress members) face to face. And get a sense of who they are as people.\" \nLater in the day, the three Congressmen hosted a roundtable at Amazon attended by about 50 employees. Media was not allowed inside, but a spokeswoman said topics raised included climate change, campaign finance reform, improving public education and prospects for bi-partisanship. \n\"As we reach out to millennials and hear what's on their minds, they simply want to have leaders who are focused on actually solving their problems and not treating this like a game,\" said Rep. Kilmer. \n\"I think there's a general sense that we've got to get this economy back and track, but we've also got to get this government back on track too. I think people are tired of partisan bickering. None of us define success as trying to make the other party look stupid and yet too often that's how success is defined in our nation's capital,\" he continued.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:05:46.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
