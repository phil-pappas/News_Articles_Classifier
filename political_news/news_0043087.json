After that, a former staffer made the same allegation.\n\"And then you had a whistleblower come out, so that hurt. That was not exactly positive,\" he added, a reference to Bradley Podliska, a former Republican investigator of the committee, who made public allegations that the committee is a ploy to hurt Clinton politically.\nSince those events, Trump said he has seen a \"big pivot\" in the way that Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., is running the investigation.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Drudge looks like a 'no' vote on Ryan \"I made a few requests for what I think is necessary, and I asked to hear back by the end of the week.\"\nBy Becket Adams • 10/20/15 10:00 PM \"And then yesterday, I watched Trey, who I do respect, I think he's a terrific guy, but he seemed to be doing a big pivot,\" Trump said. \"He said, 'Well, this isn't about Hillary Clinton.' You know I'm pretty good at figuring this stuff out, and he seemed to be doing, Sean, I'm sure you saw it, he seemed to be doing a big pivot away from Hillary Clinton.\"\n\"And I was trying to figure out what that was all about. So you may not be as happy as you think with these hearings. I just don't know,\" he added.\n\"But with all that's happening, and I was surprised that he pivoted away so much from Hillary. He said these hearings are not about her, actually — we want to discuss other people much more so. And it sounded like he was sort of pulling away from going after her. So I'm going to have to see what the hearings are all about,\" he concluded.\nClinton is set to testify in front of the Benghazi committee on Thursday.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Tea Party Caucus chair: Ryan's conditions 'entirely unreasonable' \nPaul Ryan's   fell flat with at least one key conservative Tuesday night, who said his choice is still Rep. Daniel Webster, a member who is pledging to end the \"top down\" leadership approach.\nRep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan., head of the House Tea Party Caucus, called Ryan's conditions for becoming the next speaker \"entirely unreasonable.\" Those conditions include a request that the House eliminate a rule that allows a member to seek a vote to oust the speaker. That provision is part of the original rules of the House, authored by Thomas Jefferson.\n\"No other speaker I know of would ever have as much power as Paul Ryan asked for himself,\" Huelskamp said following a meeting among Republican lawmakers.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/20/15 10:18 PM Top Story Tea Party Caucus chair: Ryan's conditions 'entirely unreasonable' Paul Ryan's   fell flat with at least one key conservative Tuesday night.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/20/15 10:18 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:32:29.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
