The checkpoints are a recipe for harassment and abuse.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "https://accounts.brightcove.com/en/terms-and-conditions/."], "published": "2015-10-14T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:24:07.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
