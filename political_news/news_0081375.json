Since 2001, this tournament has raised in excess of $1 million to help local children and families in need.\nThe funds raised this year exceeded expectations and broke last year's record for the Fall Classic, now in its 15 th year. This year's beneficiaries were: Sacramento Children's Home, Children Now, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) for Children, Foster Youth Education Fund, Latino Sports Outreach and Positive Coaching Alliance.\n\"As an organization committed to California and its communities, Deloitte is proud to work with so many generous co-sponsors, volunteers and donors to support the work of these important charities,\" said Jason Salzetti , principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP. \"We know how committed they are to expanding opportunities for children and youth in the Sacramento area and advocating for services that strengthen the families who love them.\"\nCourt Appointed Special Advocates of Sacramento County said it will use Deloitte's donation to fund more CASA volunteers appointed by a judge as officers of the court to speak up for children in juvenile court, and to help to humanize the often frightening and confusing child welfare and legal systems for these children according to Carol Noreen , Executive Director of CASA of Sacramento County .\n\"CASA Sacramento is extremely grateful to Deloitte and its partners for their generous support of local children's charities. Funds raised will go directly to activating more CASA volunteers and will help us decrease the number of children and teens waiting for an advocate. This collaboration helps us fight for and protect each child's safety and dignity, while increasing their chances of finding secure and loving families, \" said Noreen.\nEvery year, Deloitte's Sacramento -based professionals select several local charities as the beneficiaries of the Fall Classic. Their commitment to helping children is a natural extension of the work they do every day with clients to make an impact on the lives of children and families served by California's state agencies.\nThe Fall Classic brings together Deloitte professionals, business partners and community leaders in support of many good causes. Deloitte covers the venue and administrative costs for the event so that 100 percent of the money raised from sponsorship fees, raffle ticket sales and live/silent auction proceeds can go directly to the charities. The event is part of Deloitte's ongoing commitment to the Sacramento Community through board participation, Impact Day and other community involvement activities throughout the year.\nAbout Deloitte's State Government Practice\nDeloitte has worked with government agencies to bring vital services to people in local communities, cities and counties across 47 of the 50 U.S. states, as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
