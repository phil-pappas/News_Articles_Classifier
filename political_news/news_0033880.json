African-Americans line up to vote in a recreation center in the presidential election on Nov. 4, 2008 in Birmingham, Ala.\nBy Joseph P. Williams Oct. 6, 2015 | 6:43 p.m. EDT + More On the heels of asking for a federal investigation into her state's closure of driver's license offices in multiple counties – an impediment for residents who want to get photo IDs to vote in next year's elections – Alabama's lone African-American representative is noting that no House Republicans have signed on to a bill that would update and strengthen the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nThe bill \"would not only restore but advance the Voting Rights Act of 1965,\" Rep. Terri Sewell, an Alabama Democrat, tells U.S. News. \"We have over 106 sponsors, and we're looking for our first Republican.\"\nIt's a sharp contrast from March, Sewell says, when her GOP colleagues headed to her hometown of Selma to join the 50th anniversary commemoration of the legendary \"Bloody Sunday\" march aiming to go from Selma to Montgomery – a watershed moment in 1965 that helped inspire passage of the original Voting Rights Act.\nRELATED\nVoting Rights: a Winning 2016 Issue for Clinton \"I was honored to welcome the world to my hometown in Selma,\" including President Barack Obama, former President George W. Bush and a bipartisan group of around 100 senators and representatives, says Sewell, who talked to U.S. News after participating in a round-table discussion on voting rights Tuesday in Washington.\nBut despite the bipartisan show of unity on the storied Edmund Pettus Bridge – and Obama's urging for Congress to restore sections of the Voting Rights Act invalidated by the Supreme Court – \"nothing happened in Washington after we got back,\" Sewell says\nAs a result, \"I'm calling on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the right thing here\" and bring the bill to a vote, she says.\nDuring the forum, sponsored by the Center for American Progress, Sewell reiterated her call for Attorney General Loretta Lynch to review Alabama's decision to close 31 driver's license offices – including in her majority-black district, which stretches across 14 counties. Though authorities say they're trying to fill a $200 million-plus budget hole, Sewell says the move will make it difficult for people in largely rural counties with limited modes of transportation to vote, as such offices are principal sources of government-issued photo IDs the state now requires to cast a ballot.\nPeople like her own father, left unable to drive or walk after a stroke years ago, could be affected, Sewell told the panel: It took him several hours and a lot of effort to get his photo ID , she said.\nRELATED\nVoting Rights Still a Political Issue, 50 Years Later \"Now just think about it: My dad is highly motivated – his daughter's on the ballot,\" Sewell says. \"Was he denied the right to vote? No. Was it harder for him to vote? Yes!\"\nIronically, Sewell said, had the Supreme Court kept the Voting Rights Act intact in its 2013 decision – or if Congress passed the new, updated law – Alabama, birthplace of the civil rights movement, would have to get federal permission before closing the offices or implementing changes to voter ID laws.\n\"Why is it that no Republican has signed on\" to the new voting rights bill? Sewell asked during the forum. \"Lots of Republicans came with me to Selma\" and walked across the bridge where demonstrators shed blood to demand the right to vote.\nSewell called on young people to call out elected officials who aren't working harder to update the Voting Rights Act, and suggested they use the Internet to do so. \"Shame on any elected official who's not about making sure everyone has access to the ballot box,\" she said.\nTAGS: politics voters Alabama", "external_links": ["http://northdallasgazette.com/2015/06/30/naacp-sponsors-panel-march-and-rally-in-shelby-county-on-2nd-anniversary-of-supreme-court-decision-gutting-voting-rights-act/", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdygb5%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdygb5%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://sewell.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-sewell-releases-letter-attorney-general-loretta-lynch-requesting", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdygb5%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Alabama%20Democrat%20Terri%20Sewell%20on%20Voting%20Rights%20Bill%3A%20GOP%20Is%20AWOL&summary=Despite%20a%20big%20presence%20at%20the%20%27Bloody%20Sunday%27%20anniversary%2C%20Republicans%20are%20absent%20on%20a%20bill%20updating%20the%20Voting%20Rights%20Act.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdygb5%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdygb5%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Alabama%20Democrat%20Terri%20Sewell%20on%20Voting%20Rights%20Bill%3A%20GOP%20Is%20AWOL", "http://www.voanews.com/content/us-voting-restrictions-fuel-tensions/2902011.html", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdygb5%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Alabama%20Democrat%20Terri%20Sewell%20on%20Voting%20Rights%20Bill%3A%20GOP%20Is%20AWOL"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T01:49:48.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
