With the support of the baby products industry, CBME China raised USD 34,614 via a charity sale during the event this year. 42 companies participated in this program and donated baby products for the charity sale. Participating brands include Baby First , Britax, Carefor, Dremz, Kiddy, Les Enphants, MWSJ, Nestle, Pigeon and more.\nAutism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. According to the Chinese Autism Rehabilitation Education Industry Development Report , currently, around 35 million children worldwide have been diagnosed with autism. In China , more than 10 million have been reported to be autistic, of which 2 million are children.\n\"We really appreciate the support from the whole industry to make this happen. Working in the baby products industry, it is our duty to care about the next generation, especially the children with special needs. We hope that with this initiative we can create awareness for autism, and at the same time support these children with autism so they can get back into society and enjoy normal life sooner. Also, we hope that more companies will share the burden to carry out their social responsibility.
