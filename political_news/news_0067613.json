It’s also an affront to the seven out of 10 taxpayers who oppose this $2 million-plus waste of their money. \n\"Of course, this is being pushed by Minister of Culture and Heritage Maggie Barry, who is a big fan of changing the New Zealand flag. She is also Minister of Senior Citizens, but this is hardly what they want. \n\"We ask councils to respect the wishes of Veterans and the overwhelming majority of ratepayers and only fly the New Zealand Flag on public buildings to respect those who fought under it. \n\"In particular they should not fly those National Government flag options on public buildings on any of the following dates\", says Mr Mark. \nSIGNIFICANT DATES OVER THE FLAG REFERENDUMS \n23 October 2015 - 73rd Anniversary - Battle of El Alamein: \n31 October 2015 - 98th Anniversary - Capture of Beersheba: \n4 November 2015 - 97th Anniversary - Capture of Le Quesnoy (last NZ action of WW1): \n11 November 2015 - 97th Anniversary - end of WW1: \n15-20 December 2015 - 100th Anniversary - Evacuation of Gallipoli: \n23 December 2015 - 99th Anniversary - Battle of Magdhaba: \n9 January 2016 - 99th Anniversary - Capture of Rafah: \n29-30 January 2016 - 73rd Anniversary - RNZN corvettes Kiwi and Moa sink the Japanese submarine I-1 off Guadalcanal: \n30 January 2016 - 48th Anniversary - Tet Offensive: \n21 February 2016 - 98th Anniversary - Capture of Jericho: \n1 March 2016 - 100th Anniversary - formation of the NZ Division: \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:48:56.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
