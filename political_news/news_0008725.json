How are you meant to plan when your roster keeps changing,” asks Gay. \n“Bunnings workers need certainty so they can plan things like their family time and sporting commitments.” \nBunnings workers and community supporters will demonstrate outside Bunnings landmark new store in New Lynn (corner of Great North Rd and Titirangi Rd) between 10am and 11.30am on October 17. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:40:10.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
