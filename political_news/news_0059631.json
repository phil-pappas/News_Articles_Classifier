We’ve got you covered. \nThe state has struggled to find a way to continue executions and until officials find a supply of legal lethal injections drugs or an alternative, executions have been delayed until 2017. \nDispatch reporter Jim Siegel writes the talks of alternatives range from unconventional to going back to old ways of execution. \n“If we can’t get the drugs that our protocol calls for, either we need to change our protocols, or we need to think about other solutions,” said Senate President Keith Faber, R-Celina. “There are a lot of people out there talking about other solutions. I’ve heard everything from using heroin, to using nitrogen, to going back to the electric chair. That’s a debate we probably need to have.” \n*** \nAny other suggestions? This isn’t the first time an Ohio lawmaker has suggested an alternative to lethal injection. \nLast year, Sen. Bill Seitz, R-Cincinnati, said “Rope is cheap.” \n*** \nHappy news for some Ohio schools : “Schools including Worthington and Dublin that lost money when Gov. John Kasich vetoed a school-funding provision out of the new two-year budget could soon see some relief,” Siegel writes. “The Senate unanimously approved a budget clean-up bill Wednesday after Republican leaders added about $44 million for schools. It would provide partial relief from a $90 million cut for the 2016-17 school year when Kasich vetoed money designed to ensure those losing tangible personal property tax reimbursements wouldn’t see an overall funding cut.” \n*** \nDefunding Planned Parenthood : The Ohio Senate also approved a bill that would defund Planned Parenthood Wednesday, Dispatch reporter Dina Berliner writes. A third hearing on the bill was skipped because “We want to get it moving and get it enacted into law as quick as possible,” Committee Chair Sen. Bill Coley, R- Liberty Township, said. \nThe bill now moves to the House, which has it’s own version proposed. \n*** \nWhat opponents of the bill said : “The last time I checked, regardless of how we feel about it, Roe v. Wade has made abortion legal in the U.S. and is the law of the land,” said Ohio Sen. Capri Cafaro, D- Hubbard, who voted against the bill. “This debate shouldn’t be about abortion anyway, it’s about access to healthcare.” \n*** \nFrom the Kasich administration : “As you may recall, three Planned Parenthood agencies received just over $1 million in federal pass through funds last fiscal year through the Department of Health for reproductive health and wellness, personal responsibility education, sexual assault prevention, HIV rapid testing in non-clinic settings. When John Kasich became governor, Ohio's Health Department stopped awarding state dollars to Planned Parenthood. Also, Ohio kicked it to the back of the line for the federal government’s family planning grants which the Department administers. We have been working with the General Assembly to look for the best strategies to get taxpayer’s money away from Planned Parenthood,” Gov. John Kasich spokesman Joe Andrews said in a statement. \n*** \nMike DeWine 2018 : It’s really no secret that Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine could run for governor in 2018. And while he wouldn’t confirm his plans to Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson, he did say he’s interested. \nThat interest wasn’t highlighted Wednesday when DeWine took part in an economic development event. \n“DeWine is taking another unusual step, as the state’s top law enforcement officer, by compiling a guidebook on economic development he will publish later this year and make available on his office’s website. The guide is not about development strategies, but offers a ‘legal framework for economic development,’ DeWine said. It is designed for elected officials, economic development professionals, and the business community,” Johnson writes. \n*** \nHappening today : Gov. John Kasich heads back to New Hampshire to campaign for two days. \n“Struggling to hold ground in a state essential to his presidential hopes, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is tied for 5th in a new poll of GOP New Hampshire voters,” Dispatch Public Affairs Editor Darrel Rowland writes. “He is tied with former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina at 7 percent, well off the pace set by tycoon Donald Trump at 24 percent and retired Dr. Ben Carson at 17 percent in the Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm survey .” \n*** \nAnd in Iowa : \"A new Quinnipiac Poll today shows that the Ohio governor is tied for eighth place in the Hawkeye State with 3 percent. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson leads with 28 percent, followed by billionaire Donald Trump at 20,\" Rowland writes. \n\n*** \nNext debate : Not that there was much doubt but Kasich did make it into the GOP presidential debate next Wednesday. He will be joined by billionaire Donald Trump, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, former Hewlett-Packard exec Carly Fiorina, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul. \nThe undercard debate will include: U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum. \n*** \nIn the Democratic primary : Vice President Joe Biden finally ended the speculation Wednesday by announcing that he would not run in the Democratic presidential primary. \n“Vice President Joe Biden’s decision to skip a run for the Democratic presidential nomination appears to clear the way for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to become the first woman ever nominated for president by either political party,” Dispatch Washington bureau chief Jack Torry writes. “Although Clinton faces a spirited challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, most analysts believe she will win the nomination based on her popularity among Democrats and a well-financed campaign that will enable her to outlast Democratic opponents.” \n*** \nMore from Washington : While U.S. House Republicans debate about who the next speaker will be, the choice of Rep. Paul Ryan could mean a step-up for one local Republican. \n“Should Rep. Paul Ryan become the next Speaker of the House, Rep. Pat Tiberi will be a front-runner to head the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, the key tax-writing committee for the U.S. House of Representatives,” Dispatch Washington reporter Jessica Wehrman writes. “Tiberi, R-Genoa Township, has been a senior member of the committee and currently chairs its trade subcommittee. Breann Gonzalez, a spokesperson for Tiberi, said Tiberi’s current focus is on getting Ryan elected speaker.” \n*** \nMore on Ryan : While the Freedom Caucus - chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Urbana - said they won’t officially endorse Ryan for speaker, a super-majority of the group will back him to replace Ohio Republican and House Speaker John Boehner. \n\"I'm grateful for the support of a supermajority of the House Freedom Caucus. I look forward to hearing from the other two caucuses by the end of the week, but I believe this is a positive step toward a unified Republican team,” Ryan said in a statement. \n*** \nFrom Akron : First Lady Michelle Obama and basketball superstar LeBron James came together at the University of Akron to promote post-secondary education Wednesday evening, writes Northeast Ohio Media Group’s Karen Farkas. \nThose at the event were recipients of the LeBron James Family Foundation “which any child under James' mentorship who graduates from Akron Public Schools and meets yet-to-be-determined criteria for testing, attendance, and community-service will receive tuition and fees to attend the University of Akron,” Farkas writes. \n\"LeBron has invested so much in you guys because he knows you are worth it,\" Michelle Obama said. \n\"It's on you,\" she said. \"You got college paid for. The question is are you going to do the work to get there?\" \n*** \nVoters Guide : More than 61,000 ballots have been cast already in the Nov. 3 election.
