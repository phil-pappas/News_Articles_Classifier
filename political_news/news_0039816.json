Fantastic news for all, especially the millions of people who will be watching!\" the Republican presidential candidate tweeted.\nThe network declined to comment.\nThe message comes following two days of contentious campaign calls with the network over the debate rules, including one on Thursday during which Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said that if the debate did not include opening and closing statements and ran more than two hours, Trump would have to think again about showing up. The campaign of Ben Carson, who is running close to even or in second to Trump in many polls, also indicated that it would pull out on the same grounds.\nTrump had aired his grievances with the network in several tweets Thursday:\nThe @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2015\n. @CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2015\nWhy is the @GOP being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring #DemDebate ?\n— Donald J.
