Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Two of the federal opposition's up-and-coming MPs say Labor should move to seize the political initiative on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, arguing that Labor is better suited than the Coalition to help business take advantage of the deal's benefits.\nA discussion paper and opinion piece prepared by shadow financial services minister and shadow assistant trade minister Jim Chalmers, and Victorian MP Clare O'Neil, stresses that while Labor had legitimate concerns about elements of the FTA concerning imported workers, there were many positives should now become the focus.\nIts release coincides with the latest Fairfax Media/Ipsos Poll, which finds reasonably strong public support for the deal, with 54 per cent in support and 33 per cent opposed.\nLabor voters are more evenly split, with 46 per cent for the deal and 42 per cent against, while 68 per cent of Coalition voters support the deal and 20 per cent are opposed.\nLabor MP Jim Chalmers. Alex Ellinghausen The poll of 1403 voters was taken from Thursday night to Saturday night last week, just after Labor unveiled a compromise set of demands to protect local jobs and ensure skills standards were upheld. The government indicated at first glance it would accept the conditions.\nOfficials of Trade Minister Andrew Robb and shadow trade minister Penny Wong began formal talks straight away last week with a view to having the legislation pass Parliament by early December at the latest.\nMr Chalmers and Ms O'Neil say \"ChAFTA is not the perfect agreement, but the potential benefits for Australia are significant\".\n\"ChAFTA contains downsides which Labor would have not signed up to, but the quantum of the China growth opportunity is undeniably enormous.\"\n They contend, however, that the Coalition has failed to create the policy environment to exploit the opportunities, especially in the areas of skills and services exports.\n\"It is the services sector that will drive the economy in the decades ahead, and while this sector opens up the most opportunity, it has received the least attention on the political debate surrounding the agreement,\" they say.\nGillard white paper gathered dust They note that it was the former Labor government under Julia Gillard that commissioned the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper , which was a blueprint for operating in Asia, and this had gathered dust under the Coalition.\nJust 9 per cent of Australian businesses were operating in Asia and 12 per cent have any experience of doing business there.\n\"Today we lack the preparedness to engage with China. Worse than that, the government lacks a strategy,\" they say.\nMr Chalmers said that earlier this year, he asked a group of Sydney bankers whether exporting financial services to China was part of their growth strategy.\n\"Their laughter was enough to reveal that without language expertise, regulatory networks and deep cultural understanding, they considered the China opportunity was just too murky, complex and risky.\"\n\"We're not going to make the most of the relationship with China without policies which help remove barriers which lie in the way.\"\nMr Chalmers and Ms O'Neil speak of the need for policies to engender greater language and cultural understanding of Asia, and point to established Labor policies of focusing on the STEM subjects: science, technology, engineering and mathematics.\nThey say the labour safeguards put forward by Senator Wong would rectify the labour market concerns if agreed to by Mr Robb.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:39:30.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
