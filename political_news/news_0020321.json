Quinn III announced his plans to run in 2016 at a campaign kickoff event at White's of Westport Thursday evening. Quinn has served as district attorney since January when his predecessor C. Samuel Sutter was elected mayor of Fall River. Quinn was appointed by Gov. Charlie Baker and is now seeking office for the remaining two years of Sutter's term. \"I truly want to make a difference doing this job ... and I can only do this with your support,\" Quinn told the crowd, which included a heavy contingency of elected officials. \"I'm honored and privileged to be district attorney for Bristol County.\" This will be Quinn's first run for public office. He is currently the sole candidate for district attorney. Quinn said the Aaron Hernandez trial was his \"first big challenge under my leadership.\" He said he believed he brought justice to the \"victim, the family, and the citizens of Bristol County.\" A long-time resident of Fall River, Quinn said \"Bristol County has always been very important to me.\" He was formerly a prosecutor in District Court for 17 years and most recently served as co-first assistant district attorney under Sutter. One of his priorities moving forward as district attorney include dealing with illegal firearms. He said there have been 96 cases involving illegal firearms in Bristol County this year. \"It's one of the most serious risks to public safety,\" Quinn said. \"People need to feel safe in their communities.\" Domestic violence will also be front and center, with Quinn saying he would target repeat domestic batterers and provide domestic violence education to young people. Working with elders to ensure their safety is another area of interest. Quinn said he would like to start an elder abuse unit to bring to justice \"those who target our elderly population.\" He said he has made a personal commitment to meet with each Council on Aging program in the county. The district attorney said he strives for a \"more effective efficient prosecution\" of crimes in Bristol County. \"I'm about doing the job,\" Quinn said. \"I want to do the best job I can.\" By Deborah Allard", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:28:26.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
