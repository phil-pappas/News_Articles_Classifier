The disclosure set off investigations by the Justice Department and multiple congressional committees, and Republicans routinely pressed FBI and Justice Department officials for updates on the probe — as recently as Thursday — during their visits to Capitol Hill. \nLerner, who headed the division that processes applications for tax-exempt status at the time and has since retired, became the public face of the controversy. She was held in contempt of Congress by the House of Representatives after she refused to answer questions at two House Oversight Committee hearings. \nFederal investigators repeatedly interviewed Lerner and looked into whether she should face charges, particularly after the discovery of emails from her personal IRS account that “expressed her personal political views,” according to the Justice Department letter. \nBut prosecutors said none of the IRS employees they interviewed suggested that Lerner discriminated against conservatives while on the job. They said that while she used poor judgment to use her IRS account for personal messages, there was no evidence that Lerner had “exercised her decision-making authority in a partisan manner generally.” \nHer attorney, William Taylor, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:55:21.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
