State (pollution control) boards may make criteria stringent considering proximity to habitation, population density, water bodies, sensitive receptors, etc.,” the draft stated. \nThe draft also suggested that kilns not be set up in clusters. \n“Brick kilns should be established at a minimum distance of 1km from an existing fixed chimney kiln to avoid clustering of kilns in an area,” the draft added. \nThe move is part of the environment ministry’s larger plan to bring new industrial sectors under the pollution control mechanism and update standards. \nMint had reported in August that the ministry will be proposing new pollution monitoring standards for industries in at least 22 sectors. \nThe 22 sectors include paints, fertilizers, cement, pulp and paper, sugar, thermal power plants, textiles, slaughter houses, brick kilns, coffee, common effluent treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, fermentation (distilleries, breweries) and diesel generator sets.\nAccording to official estimates, India is the second largest brick producer after China and every year around 240-260 billion bricks are produced in around 140,000 units across India.\nOf the 240-260 billion bricks, nearly 74% are through Bull’s Trench Kilns. \nThe total employment at these units is around 10 million.\nBrick kilns are a significant source of pollution. \nThe consumption of coal/biomass in these units is around 35-40 TCE (tonnes of coal equivalent) and carbon dioxide emissions are to the tune of 66 million tonnes, according to official estimates.\nEnvironmentalists, however, are not sure the proposals will work.\n“The standards are very hard to implement as brick kilns are scattered across the country. Also, (setting) standards is one thing, getting them implemented is going to be a major challenge. The pollution control boards do not have adequate staff. They have so many standards to implement, but don’t have the capacity. Basically, regulatory mechanisms have not kept up with the kind of industrialization that has happened,” said Ravi Agarwal, founder director of Toxics Link, an environmental non-governmental organization, or NGO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:18:20.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
