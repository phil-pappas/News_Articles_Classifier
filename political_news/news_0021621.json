The hope now is they use that cunning to improve returns to the farmer suppliers. \n\"However, there is no economic incentive for the new owners to pay any more than they have to for livestock that will be controlled all the way to retail customers. \n\"It is deeply disappointing the Board didn’t have the courage to work harder on a New Zealand-based solution. \n\"This vote hands control of a New Zealand owned cooperative to a Chinese company with no guarantee of any benefits in the short, medium or long term. \n\"New Zealand farmers now face a decreasing number of opportunities to produce, process and brand what should be New Zealand’s proudest and most productive sector,\" Damien O’Connor says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:51:25.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
