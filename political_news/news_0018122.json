Soon after the announcement, they have transformed his election campaign—into one staking claim to the CM’s office. \nDuring a roadshow of the BJP leader, his supporters shouted slogans such as “Bihar ka CM kaisa ho, Prem Kumar jaisa ho (Bihar’s CM should be like Prem Kumar)” and Khaali kar do raaste, Kumar ke vaaste (Make way for Prem Kumar)”. \nDuring a nukkadsabha in Gaya, one of his senior party workers announced that Kumar hold an important position in Patna after November 8. Kumar told CNN-IBN, “I don’t have anything to say about this (Hussain’s announcement) . A decision in this regard will be taken by the party.” \nConfident of NDA ’s victory, Kumar said, “People are rejecting the grand alliance of Nitish Kumar-Lalu Prasad-Sonia Gandhi. They will soon be a thing of past. Our alliance will come to power on November 8. Wait and watch.” \nWhen asked about the slow pace of development work in Gaya, he said, “I have set up a special team, comprising some respectable citizens, to look into all issues concerning Gaya, and ensure the region’s development.” \nTalking about the drying Phalgu river considered sacred by Hindus, the BJP MLA said the process to connect it with larger rivers has begun, and the dry river would be dry anymore. \nWhen asked why BJP candidates have criminal records, the BJP MLA said, “When one joins politics, several false allegations are leveled against him/her. The criminal charges on BJP leaders may not be true, but in politics one must be ready to face all such charges.” \nWhen asked if the caste permutation was working in NDA ’s favour, Kumar replied with the BJP ’s slogan – “Sabka Saath Sabka Vishwas”, adding his party would never resort to caste politics. \nVoters feel the margin of Kumar’s victory may remain as low as 3,000 to 4,000 votes. Lined up against Kumar are Priya Ranjan alias Dimple of Congress and independent Raju Barnwal. The latter is likely to cut into Kumar’s votes. \nHaving been locked in a bloody conflict in the 1990s, which saw a string of massacres in Bihar’s Jehanabad district, the landed forward castes and deprived Dalits appear to be sailing on the same boat in the state assembly polls. \nThe coming together of BJP , largely considered a party of upper castes and baniyas, which are OBCs in the state, and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi ’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), has made possible what was unthinkable a few years ago. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:57:26.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
