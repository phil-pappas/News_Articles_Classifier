He added that people \"need to trust that nothing is being presented or withheld because of one man's extremist ideology.\" 'Gun control issue has no role in this,' says Sheriff John Hanlin Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin says his personal viewpoints on gun control have nothing to do with the UCC shooting. \"My job is to ensure the safety of the public here,\" he says. \nHanlin could not be reached for immediate comment. But he told reporters Friday that he did not believe that Sandy Hook was a government conspiracy and said that now was not the time to talk about his views on gun laws. \n\"My focus right now is on getting this investigation completed and taking care of the victims and the victims' families,\" Hanlin said. \"Now is not an appropriate time to have those conversations.\" \nHanlin has conducted several nationally televised press conferences since the shooting deaths of 10 people, including the killer. He also attracted headlines for refusing to name the shooter, saying he didn't want to give him the attention he believed he was seeking. \nHanlin testified against the bill that passed earlier this year expanding background checks to cover private gun transfers. The sheriff told legislators that the law was \"nearly impossible\" to enforce and cited his office's tight budget constraints. \nThe Brady Campaign is named for Jim Brady -- the press secretary to President Ronald Reagan who was seriously wounded in a 1981 shooting -- and his wife Sarah. The two helped lobby for passage of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 , which mandated background checks nationally on gun purchases. \n--Jeff Mapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:24:36.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
