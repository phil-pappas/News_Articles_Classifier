The council's chairman and vice chair — both state legislators — said Wednesday that legislation is probably needed after the Supreme Court's decision in a case filed by another General Assembly member. \nThe decision in that case, Department of Corrections v. Surovell, seems to do away with much of the government's duty to redact and release documents under the state's open records act. Absent specific language in the act demanding this step, public officials can simply withhold entire records to protect snippets that are legitimately exempt from release, the court's majority found. \nThe ruling surprised a number of legislators, who said the intent behind FOIA is to release as much information as possible, redacting sensitive material when needed. While the decision still allows government officials to do this, it doesn't require them to do so. \n\"It's hard to believe anybody really intended that,\" Del. Jim LeMunyon, who chairs the state's FOIA Council, said Wednesday. \nThe FOIA Council studies changes to the state's open records and meetings laws and oversees staff attorneys who interpret the law and train state and local government officials on implementation. State Sen. Richard Stuart, the council's vice chairman, said Wednesday that he thought the government's duty to redact documents was implicit in the law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:20:56.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
