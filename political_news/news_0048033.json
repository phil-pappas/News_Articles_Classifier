(Photo: NBC Charlotte) CONNECT TWEET   \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Controversy at city hall Monday night, as a Plaza Midwood development project gets shut down. \nIt's all about 4.5 acres at the corner of The Plaza and Belvedere Avenue known as The VanLandingham Estate. It's a historic district and very residential, too. A petition wanted to change it to mixed use development. But Monday, city council said no. \n\"I am really sorry but I cannot say yes to something I have some concern about,\" said Councilwoman Patsy Kinsey. \nIt was an emotional response from council as they voted to walk away from the petition to change zoning. \nPlans wanted to build a swim club and townhomes, keeping the significant trees lining the roadway and keeping similar architectural details, preserving the historical character of the estate. \nAnd while there were visible signs of support, there had been another petition out there concerned with traffic. \n\"There was a protest petition filed by some neighbors, 20 some odd signatures, the association worked with and spoke with-- we've tried to sort out traffic issues. It was an excellent example how a protest petition helps a project be better; we took out parking on that road, where they showed traffic congestion,\" current president of Plaza Midwood Neighborhood Association Phillip Gussman said. \nGussman says he is at a loss over the vote. \n\"Over 300 people have signed up to join the pool already. It is disappointing from neighborhood perspective. We will have to see if there is some other way to do this,\" said Gussman. \nThere was already a website built-- complete with membership applications and pool rules. You can tell the people behind this project were really ready to move forward. As for people who already paid for those memberships: there is a Q&A online that promises they'll be refunded.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/local/plaza-midwood/2015/10/19/city-council-says-no-to-vanlandingham-rezoning-petition/74251042/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:41:09.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
