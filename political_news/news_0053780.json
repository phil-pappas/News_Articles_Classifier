Ginther looks into the camera and talks about what he says are “false attacks” from his mayoral opponent Zach Scott, as ominous music plays in the background. Ginther then talks about why he thinks Scott’s ideas to fix Columbus City Schools are bad. The ad closes with Ginther sitting with kids and talking about his ideas to help the school district.\nScript: \nGinther: “The false attacks from Zach Scott just keep on comin’. This time it’s about a Buckeyes game. I paid my own way and he knows it.\n“But here’s what he doesn’t want you to know: Zach Scott has a risky plan to take over our schools, cutting parents and teachers out of decisions about our kids.\n“Here’s my plan: Pre-k for every child and after-school programs in every neighborhood so every child can succeed.\n“My opponent is betting on misleading ads. Columbus is counting on you.”\nAnalysis: This is Ginther’s fourth TV ad.\nThe “false attack” that Ginther references is in the latest TV ad from Scott, which mentions, among other things, an ethics investigation involving an Ohio State football game.\nGinther is one of three council members who are the subject of an Ohio Ethics Commission investigation of a trip they took the Big Ten Championship game in Indianapolis with lobbyist John Raphael in December. Former council member Michelle M. Mills went on the trip before she resigned from her seat on council in August amid ethics questions.\nScott, in his ad, implied that Ginther had been charged with ethics violations. Ginther has not been charged. The investigation is ongoing.\nGinther’s claim, “I paid my own way,” is misleading. Ginther used $250 in campaign funds to pay for the trip. He later told The Dispatch he was using the trip to help drum up support for his mayoral bid, making it a campaign expense. Experts have said the face-value cost of the trip, which included a chartered bus and ticket in a luxury suite, was $750.\nGinther’s claim that Scott’s education play is “risky” is subjective. Scott has said he wants to put before voters a plan that would allow mayoral control of the district. Scott said he would release a detailed plan after the primary, but has yet to do so.\nGinther has said he believes Scott’s plan would seize control of the school board. Ginther said that would be “cutting parents and teachers out of the decisions about our kids.”\nScott has never said he would appoint school board members if given control of the district nor that he would exclude teachers from his plan.\n“Mr. Ginther’s attack against Zach Scott is false and baseless regarding taking over city schools and excluding teachers and parents,” said Melissa Barnhart, Scott’s campaign adviser.\nThe ad closes with Ginther advocating for pre-k services for every child. The city allocated $4.2 million recently to fund 400 pre-k spots for children.\nThe city determined it costs $7,500 to $8,750 per pre-k student, per year. Educators estimate there are 2,500 to 3,000 pre-school-aged children in the school district.\nUnder those numbers, Ginther’s plan would cost between $19 million and $24 million per year.\n-- Lucas Sullivan \nlsullivan@dispatch.com \n@DispatchSully", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:01:26.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
