New York Daily News \"SUCK IT!\": New York Daily News front page from March 12, 2013, about the soda ban battle. \nThe two titans of business — along with top aides and Coca-Cola Refreshments CEO Steven Cahillane — met at Gracie Mansion, Farley wrote in his new book “Saving Gotham: A Billionaire Mayor, Activist Doctors, and the Fight for Eight Million Lives.” \nAt the meeting, which has never been reported, the impeccably groomed Kent told Bloomberg that all over the world people were asking him about Bloomberg \"banning your product in New York Cit y.\" \nNever mind that Bloomberg’s proposal wouldn’t ban soda, just portions larger than 16 ounces. \n“That’s the perception,” Kent told Bloomberg, according to the book. \nHe made him an offer. \nTake the ban off the table and Coke would take measures to decrease full-calorie soda consumption — including introducing smaller bottles and cans in grocery stores while still offering larger sizes. \n“It was the only time I ever saw Mike Bloomberg uncomfortable,” Farley wrote. \"He was a businessman before he was mayor, and he didn't like opposing another businessman.” \nBloomberg ordered his aides to look into the Coke proposal. After much internal deliberation, it fizzled. \nThe 310-page book — which arrives in stores on Tuesday — is a behind-the-scenes look at the Bloomberg administration’s biggest health policy battles, including the ban on trans-fats in restaurants in 2007 and years-long efforts to reduce smoking. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The book also details a tense meeting between Bloomberg and Sean Parker, founder of Napster and the first president of Facebook, over e-cigarettes. \nBloomberg’s first big public health initiative — the 2003 prohibition on smoking in restaurants — was at first deeply unpopular among some of his top aides. \nThe timing, with the city still reeling from 9/11, was seen as particularly awful. \n“Who the f--- needs this now?” Peter Madonia, Bloomberg’s chief of staff, said, according to the book. \nBloomberg was undeterred, Farley wrote, because he thought it would save lives. \nThe book, which is heavy on policy, has a few juicy tidbits. \nThe city’s current health commissioner, Mary Travis Bassett, told Farley that she “hated” working for Tom Frieden, Bloomberg’s first health czar because he got too “involved.” \nIt also details a meeting in the City Hall bull pen between Bloomberg and Sean Parker, founder of Napster and the first president of Facebook. Anthony DelMundo/for New York Daily News Former Health Commissioner Tom Farley shares stories of the Bloomberg administration in a new book. \nParker wanted Bloomberg — in his final five days in office — to veto a City Council bill banning e-cigarette smoking in offices, restaurants and parks. \nBloomberg calmly told him it was impossible but Parker — an investor in the e-cigarette company NJOY — persevered. \n“He became increasingly agitated as he kept arguing, as if he were a kettle about to boil,” wrote Farley. “Eventually the mayor, looking more bored than ever, stood up and walked back into the sea of desks. And then Parker left, red-faced.” \nFarley told the Daily News that he was proud of the work the administration did on health issues — even the unsuccessful soda fight. The ban never passed but the number of New Yorkers who say they drink the sugary drinks daily dropped by a third from 2007 to 2013. \n“This is a city that has absolutely been at the forefront of taking on the biggest health problems of our time,” he said.
