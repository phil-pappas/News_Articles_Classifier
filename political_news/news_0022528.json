He said the uniformed man pushed him inside the house, handcuffed his hands behind his back, then took the victim’s passport, two visas and a cellphone from his pants pocket. The uniformed man removed the cuffs before leaving with the items. \nPolice say they are searching for the impostor. \n___ \nInformation from: The Des Moines Register, http://www.desmoinesregister.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:52:32.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
