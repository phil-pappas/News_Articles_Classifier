All summer Kiev was busy fighting for power, plotting and scheming, continuing military operations in Donbass, completely forgetting that summer is followed by autumn, and then by winter and cold.\nOne of the Ukrainian economists Kuhar said that it would be difficult times for those who would stay in Ukraine this winter. There is only one half of the necessary gas supplies in gas storage tanks, the country’s economy and its budget are in decline and rapidly deteriorating. The population is not able to pay taxes. Those who stay in Ukraine this winter will envy those who have left.\nUkraine has passed the point of no return, the country is facing cold and hunger in the coming winter, as well as an offensive of the Donbass militia. This was announced on the TV channel “Russia” by the former member of the Party of Regions Oleg Tsarev, who is one of the leaders of the pro-Russian uprising.\n“I think that Ukraine is doomed. I think that the point of no return has already been passed … When with “criminal” Yanukovych the GDP growth was 3%, then after him it very quickly dropped to zero, then minus 3%, and now it is minus 6% officially. But realistically, economists believe that it is minus 25% today.\nWe expect a repetition of the tragedy we experienced during the collapse of the Soviet Union, perhaps, much worse. What lies ahead of Ukraine is hunger, cold and humanitarian disaster”, – said Oleg Tsarev.\nWhy do people have to flee from home in order to survive and not to freeze, because their country is run by idiots. One wise man once said: “If the army of lions is led by a sheep it is sure to lose to the army of sheep run by a lion”. This is why our country has lost on all counts, because it is run by a herd of sheep.\nNovorossia\nElections in the DPR in April 20, 2016\nOctober 10, 2015 No comments\nHead of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) Alexander Zakharchenko has rescheduled the date for the local elections from October 18 this year to April… Read more\nUkraine rejects DPR request for rail traffic at night\nOctober 10, 2015 No comments\nRepresentatives of Ukraine at the economic subgroup of the Contact Group (on settlement of the crisis in Ukraine) rejected a request from the Donetsk… Read more\nElections in Donetsk republic in Donbass set for March 20, 2016 — leader’s decree\nOctober 10, 2015 No comments\nLocal elections in Donetsk People’s Republic will take place on March 20 next year.
