Mumbai: Shiv Sena workers attacked writer Sudheendra Kulkarni on Monday, dousing him in black ink for organising the launch of former Pakistani foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri's book “Neither a Hawk nor a Dove: An Insider’s Account of Pakistan’s Foreign Policy”.\nThe incident has triggered massive outrage in the country and reactions have been pouring in from all quarters over the attack, with many calling it a shameful incident for a democratic country like India.\nFollowing are the reactions from famous personalities and political bigwigs on the ink attack:\nLK Advani, BJP veteran: “I strongly condemn whosoever has done this. Off late we have seen an increase in cases of intolerance, this is against democracy.”\nDevendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra chief minister : “Kasuri and the program will be provided total security. But this doesn’t mean that we endorse all views expressed in the program. No anti-India propaganda will be tolerated through any such program. If found so, the organisers would be held responsible.”\nSanjay Raut, Shiv Sena leader : “This is not ink, but the blood of our martyrs on his face. He should feel ashamed for siding with Pakistan’s ‘chamchaas’. This much reaction just because of a little ink on his face? You cannot stop people as they have pent up hatred against Pakistan in their minds.”\nUnion minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi: \"In a democracy everyone has the right to agree or disagree. But, this type of protest is not justified as it is against the very core of our democratic values. This is not the way\"\nUnion Minister Kiren Rijiju: \"This is about mentality...In this country, everyone has a fundamental right to protest but there has to be a way to protest, not physically harm anyone. This is not right\"\nMany leaders and famous personalities took to the microblogging site Twitter to condemn the attack.\nSuch Intolerance in India can't be tolerated. First Ghulam Ali concert and now Kasuri's book launch. We don't want a Desi Taliban in India\n— digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28) October 12, 2015 Black paint is not on @SudheenKulkarni 's face, but a dark blot on Indian democracy. The forces of fascism are flying high.\n— Sanjay Jha (@JhaSanjay) October 12, 2015 Am deeply saddened by Shiv Senas attack on Sudheendra Kulkarni.wish 2talk 2 @uddhavthackeray n @AUThackeray but neither is talking my calls\n— Azmi Shabana (@AzmiShabana) October 12, 2015 The attack on Sudhendra Kulkarni ridicules our constitution, shames our police, & debunks our claims to be a democracy.\n— Mahesh Bhatt (@MaheshNBhatt) October 12, 2015 #Pakistankachamcha seems to be the tag for anyone who doesn't want to bomb Pakistan back in to the dark ages.\n— Omar Abdullah (@abdullah_omar) October 12, 2015 I strongly condemn attack on Sudheendra Kulkarni.
