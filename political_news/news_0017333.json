For the Israelis, that would include making improvements in quality of life for Palestinians, and on the other side, the Palestinian Authority should tone down its rhetoric and focus on a positive message, he said. Al-Omari's sentiment was echoed by Dan Arbell, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former senior member of Israel's foreign service. \"Kerry's efforts (at a peace deal) last year failed. While he'll be listened to and he'd be used perhaps as a conduit to convey messages from one side to another, I'm pretty skeptical about what he can achieve at this point in time,\" Arbell said, adding the violence needs to subside before anything more substantive can be done. \"Kerry can put pressure on (Abbas) at this point and ask the Israelis to look at concrete ways of offering the Palestinians, once the violence is over, a political horizon, or that negotiations can be resumed,\" Arbell said. RELATED: More violence in Jerusalem Kerry would need to walk tightrope White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, in a briefing with reporters Wednesday, seemed to acknowledge to some extent the limitations the United States faces. \"Ultimately, ending this conflict will require both sides making some difficult decisions, some decisions that will require them to exercise some significant political courage,\" said Earnest, who noted U.S. officials were in touch with both sides. \"But ultimately, what the United States can do is to try to facilitate those conversations, to try to be supportive of that process.\" Elliott Abrams of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Middle East adviser to President George W. Bush, said two major factors complicate Kerry's efforts, particularly if he were to try yet another broad push for a peace deal. He cannot appear to be rewarding terrorism -- \"if the thing that gets you back at the table is killing Israelis, that's a very unhelpful lesson to teach\" -- and with Abbas aging and in a weakened position, Palestinians are facing a succession battle, Abrams said. Abrams also faulted Kerry for his comments linking the current violence to settlement expansion, which the former Bush official said had not occurred to the extent the secretary of state maintained: \"To say what he said at Harvard this week, that the massive expansion of settlements is the cause of it, I think it's actually false and it's going to make it impossible for the Israelis to work closely with him.\" Instead of trying to secure a peace deal, Kerry should focus on improving conditions on the ground, Abrams recommended. 12 photos: Tensions escalate between Israelis, Palestinians 12 photos: Tensions escalate between Israelis, Palestinians Two Palestinian women cry Wednesday, October 14, during the funeral of Muataz Ibrahim Zawahra, who was killed in clashes with Israeli troops near the West Bank city of Bethlehem.

I think he needs to be very careful about his rhetoric,\" Abrams said. Difficulty in calming the situation Former State Department Middle East negotiator Aaron David Miller gave some cause for hope that the United States could be helpful, noting that the United States had assisted in tamping down Israeli-Palestinian violence last year -- bringing Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah together -- even if Kerry at this moment cannot produce significant \"deliverables\" on the ground. Miller stressed that Obama has only a little more than a year left in his presidency and the Iran deal is his top regional priority. \"He does not want to pick another fight with the Israelis, and that fact (is) that Netanyahu isn't looking for a fight with Obama, either.\" He said that both Netanyahu and Abbas \"would like to find a way to calm this down and climb down so they are not some how outflanked or undermined by their own extremists.\" But complicating that desire is the nature of the violence, which has featured many lone-wolf style attacks, raising questions about how much control Palestinian leaders have over the situation. \"It's going to be very hard to get young, angry Palestinians who want to do violence and engage in terror spontaneously against Israelis ... to turn this off,\" Miller said. How the Palestinian leadership handles the situation could be key to its survival, al-Omari said. \"To me, this is symptomatic of a much deeper and much more worrying trend, which is the Palestinian organizations and leaders are losing their legitimacy,\" al-Omari said. \"This is a warning bell of a legitimacy vacuum.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:13:00.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
