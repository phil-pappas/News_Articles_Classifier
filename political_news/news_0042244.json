Second amendment rights. Immigration.\nThat's it. Nothing more.\nOn Friday, during an interview with Republican challenger Sen. Marco Rubio at a Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial board meeting, I quizzed him for his reaction to Trump's statement that people don't want policy papers, that the \"just trust me\" approach is good enough.\nI couldn't get a rise out of the Florida senator, who responded without mentioning Trump by name.\n\"It's impossible to hold someone accountable if they don't tell you what they're going to do before they run,\" he said. \"I'm going to continue to offer detailed ideas. I believe voters will ultimately reward that.\"\nHe discussed policy for an hour at the newspaper. I didn't agree with everything he said, but he said it clearly and precisely — from Yucca Mountain to abortion.\nIn October, Rubio is putting up a policy a day on his website, www.marcorubio.com\nAbortion isn't up there yet, but Rubio has not waffled or ducked that issue. He is unequivocally opposed to abortion, considering is a question of human rights. Rubio has consistently held he is against abortions in all situations. Doesn't matter if the woman's life is endangered. Doesn't matter if conception is a result of rape or incest. \"An unborn child has a right to live,\" he said, calling it a human rights issue.\nHe supports parental notification, opposes abortions after 20 weeks and opposes partial-birth abortions. He doesn't want federal funds used to pay for abortions.\nIf elected, Rubio said he would try to appoint Supreme Court justices with similar views. And if that loses him votes, then so be it. Rubio said he isn't changing his views on abortion to get elected.\nTrump's stance on abortion isn't up on his website, but his position has not been consistent. First he was \"pro-choice.\" Now he' says he's \"pro-life.\"\nThe best way to trace his turnaround on abortion rights is to go to www.ontheissues.org , which traces his 2011 transformation from pro-choice to pro-life.\nThe nonpartisan site researches sources to find out what people say, when they say it and who they say it to. It's one of the better websites I've seen and is a useful tool for voters. It includes excerpts from candidates' books, excerpts from their debates broken down into issues, and voting records. If you want details on a particularly subject, this is the website for you.\nFrom the www.ontheissues.org website, Trump told David Brody in 2011 why he changed his views on abortion. \"I changed my view a number of years ago. One of the primary reasons I changed (was) a friend of mine's wife was pregnant, and he didn't really want the baby. He was crying as he was telling me the story. He ends up having the baby and the baby is the apple of his eye. It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to him. And you know, here's a baby that wasn't going to be let into life. And I heard this, and some other stories, and I am pro-life.\"\nIn a transcript of Trump's Las Vegas speech, he rambled, jumped from subject to subject and often made little sense.\nLet's look quickly at the two candidates on veterans issues.\nAt one point in his speech last week, Trump said: \"They have totally forgotten the veterans. And I'll tell you what, if I get elected. Everyone says when, when … don't say if.\"\nBut he never returned to do what his veterans' policy might include. He simply continues with a stream-of-consciousness ramble.\nRubio has his veterans ideas listed on his website and detailed what he's done in his 4 1/2 years in the Senate. He co-sponsored legislation, which became law, to allow VA secretaries to remove senior executives at the VA based on performance. He has introduced legislation to allow removal of any VA employee \"based on performance or misconduct.\"\nTrump is hoping that his dubbing Rubio \"a lightweight\" will catch on. \"It might not stick, I don't know,\" he told his followers last week.\nSounds like wishful thinking. Trump fails to offer many specifics, he prefers sound bites, some of them incomprehensible.\nWhether it's abortion or veterans, taxes or immigration, gun rights or energy policy, www.ontheissues.org is a solid nonpartisan resource for serious voters.\nThe ones who care about policy.\nHopefully that's every one of you looking for substance.\n— Jane Ann Morrison's column runs Thursdays.
