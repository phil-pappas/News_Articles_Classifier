(AP) â€” Prisons have long been a way of life in this southern Colorado community, with schoolchildren practicing inmate-escape drills and almost everyone counting a relative who works in corrections.\nPeople are accustomed to some of the nation's most dangerous criminals living nearby in the 13 state and federal prisons emerging from Fremont County's rolling desert peaks. But the possibility of housing suspected and convicted terrorists from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is where some residents draw the line.\nA team of Pentagon officials began scouting some of the county's prisons this week as potential sites to house Guantanamo detainees amid the Obama administration's stalled effort to close the controversial facility. They are looking at upgrades the facilities would need to detain the prisoners and hold hearings for those facing trial by military commission, the Pentagon said.\nThough prisoners living just miles away from Canon City include a Sept. 11 conspirator and Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, residents worry about international attention possibly making the area a target for terrorists and their sympathizers.\n\"This is a concentrated group of people who are bent on the destruction of America and the American way of life,\" said longtime real estate agent Preston Troutman, president of Canon City's chamber of commerce. \"We don't have the answers for that.\"\nAmong the sites being considered is a sprawling, high-security state prison on the outskirts of town, Colorado State Penitentiary II. Built in 2010 to hold inmates in solitary confinement, it was mothballed two years later as officials moved away from the practice and the inmate population sharply declined.\nIts 948 cells now sit empty, and supporters say filling them with Guantanamo detainees would put to good use the shuttered $208 million facility that Colorado still has not finished paying off.\n\"I'd love to see us find a use for this empty building that's costing us money that we're not getting any use out of,\" said Democratic state Sen. Pat Steadman, a state budget writer. \"The fact that these are scary terrorists from Guantanamo doesn't bother me. That's what these facilities were made for.\"\nCanon City residents say they scarcely think of the prisoners living about 10 miles down the road in Florence, home to a maximum-security federal prison known as Supermax, also being assessed by the Pentagon team.\nDubbed \"Alcatraz of the Rockies,\" its 420 or so inmates include terrorists, such as Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person convicted in civilian court of the Sept. 11 attacks, and Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Wadih El-Hage, convicted of the 1998 bombings of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, also resides there, and Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was transferred there in July.\nMore than 7,000 prisoners live in the county's state and federal lockups, and many praise the industry for providing jobs and improving the economy. Residents encouraged bringing Supermax to Florence, donating 600 acres of land to the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1990.\nEven so, some say Guantanamo detainees raise unprecedented safety questions. Residents are less worried about escapes than becoming a target for terrorists on the outside and a destination for their friends and relatives.\n\"It would bring an element to our area that we don't want to have here,\" chamber of commerce director Lisa Hyams said. \"It could cause problems that we're totally unaware of.\"\nThe facility in Cuba has 114 detainees, 54 of whom have been cleared for release. The remaining 60 have been deemed too dangerous to send to another country.\nPentagon officials also have surveyed the Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston, South Carolina, as possibilities for housing the prisoners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:15:45.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
