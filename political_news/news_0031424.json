Another six civilians were killed in apparent Russian strikes in Idlib, the Observatory said on Saturday.\nRussia denies its strikes have led to civilian casualties and has instead hailed the results of the first three days of bombing, referring to “panic” among militants.\n“Some 600 mercenaries have abandoned their positions and are trying to find their way into Europe,” an officer of the General Staff, Andrei Kartapolov, said on Saturday.\nThe Observatory said that another four suspected Russian strikes hit the IS-held town of Al-Qaryatain in Homs province.\nIt said a Russian raid on a hospital in Hama killed several civilians and wounded doctors.\nRaids ordered by Moscow are also reported to have hit areas controlled by moderate groups and prompted a claim by US Senator John McCain that Russian jets had killed rebel soldiers trained and funded by the CIA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T22:22:56.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
