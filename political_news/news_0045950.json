(Photo: DC) Hyderabad: Moula Ali, the hill-top shrine that attracts not only lakhs of devotees but also adventure enthusiasts, has finally caught the attention of the Wafk Board after this newspaper revealed the appalling condition it is in. The GHMC has sanctioned Rs 2 crore to construct a road from the ground to the Kohe Moula Ali dargah on the hill top in two phases. This comes as a major relief to lakhs of pilgrims, especially the elderly visiting the shrine named after Hazrat Imam Ali, son-in-law of Prophet Mohammed. Many used to find it difficult to climb the 500 steps to the hillock. The first phase of the ramp begins from a spot behind the Moula Ali entrance and goes up to the fifth kaman. MLC, Syed Altaf Hyder Razvi, a former member of the Wakf Board committee overseeing the project, said the 20-feet ramp will have space for pilgrims to walk and can accommodate one four-wheel vehicle at a time. “It will start at the Khushal Khan Kaman and end at the fifth kaman on the hill. In the second phase, which is critical because of its steep elevation, the road will lead from the fifth kaman to the dargah. The second phase is under technical discussion,” Mr Razvi said. The ramp was initially proposed by the GHMC but it did not take off. Maintenance work at the dargah was stopped because workers found it difficult to transport material up the hill. The spring at the fourth kaman was being cleaned by a private organisation. There is also a proposal to start a shuttle service for pilgrims. Right now, there is no parking space for visitors who park their vehicles adjacent to the Ashoorkhana Hz-Imam Raza or in the by lanes of the area. The roads leading to the hill are extremely narrow and have been encroached upon. There are neither direction boards nor signboards explaining the history of the place. There are no drinking water facilities or dustbins. Behind the dargah, there was once a place for pilgrims to rest but it is now in ruins. The steps and the kamans too are covered in graffiti.
