Now the prime minister and Jeremy Hunt, his health secretary , are embroiled in a dispute that is becoming a serious test of the government’s authority. More Osborne to stand firm on tax credit cuts \nAt issue is a plan to change the contract for the UK’s 53,000 junior doctors to restrict the periods that are deemed unsocial and which thus attract higher pay. “Normal” hours — from 7am to 7pm Monday to Friday at present — would reclassified as being from 7am to 10pm, Monday to Saturday. \nThe government also wants to expand the availability of NHS services at weekends and to tie annual increments more closely to performance. The contract, due to come into effect next year, would apply in England only, with Scotland and Wales set to retain the existing deal. \nThe juniors — the word is perhaps a misnomer for doctors who can be pushing 40, since it applies to anyone yet to attain the rank of consultant or become a GP — say some of them will lose as much as 30 per cent of their basic pay under the proposals. They are now threatening strike action. \nJohann Malawana, who leads the junior doctors’ committee of the British Medical Association, says the reforms also threaten patient safety. The proposed new contract, he argues, would strip out the “punitive” fines that at present deter NHS trusts from forcing doctors to work dangerously long hours. \nEven now, doctors such as Dr Malawana, whose specialism is obstetrics and gynaecology, frequently work far beyond the end of their shifts. He says he often works an extra three hours or more if a difficult birth is under way; hospitals have to compensate, however, by reducing hours in succeeding weeks. \nRead more \nBut underlying the protests is the feeling that Mr Hunt’s criticisms of junior doctors are “essentially creating an environment that is anti-NHS staff,” says Dr Malawana. This, he argues, is threatening staff retention just as the NHS is under pressure to increase numbers. “And the problem is that . . . you need to lose such a small sliver of the staff to make the service completely undeliverable.” \nThe Royal Colleges, which guard professional standards but usually rise above the nitty gritty of contract renegotiation, have weighed in on the side of the juniors. \nAt a grand annual dinner held last week by the Royal College of Physicians, eminent doctors banged tables and applauded as Jane Dacre, the college president, expressed concern “about the impact that a perceived lack of value has on our trainees”. \n“They are the jewel in our crown and need to be nurtured and valued,” she said. \nMr Hunt believes that only by changing the way doctors work can the NHS provide a service fit for the 21st century. He and the prime minister are buoyed by polling that suggests the Conservatives’ manifesto promise of a “seven-day NHS” has resonated with the electorate. \nIn July, in a speech to the King’s Fund think-tank, he urged the BMA to “get real” about the need for change. The health secretary also highlights the issue of patient safety, citing figures suggesting that as many as 11,000 additional deaths a year are due to patients being admitted at weekends, when there is less cover. \nJunior doctors have retorted that they already work weekends — Mr Hunt’s claims have sparked a social media campaign with juniors posting selfies with the hashtag #ImInWorkJeremy. \nRead more \nMr Hunt, in a conciliatory letter to Dr Malawana sent this month, insisted none of his proposals would involve longer hours and that “the vast majority” of junior doctors would see no cut in their pay. He says the package is cost neutral, with no overall aim to save money on salaries. \nSupporters of the changes say the NHS is the least reformed outpost of the public sector in terms of pay and conditions. However reluctantly, the police force, under home secretary Theresa May , and teachers, under Michael Gove when he was education secretary, had to accept a far stronger link between salaries and performance. \nIn most cases doctors, however, continue to receive valuable annual increases with only limited reference to whether they have earned them by becoming more skilled or productive. \nAndrew Haldenby, who leads the pro-market think-tank Reform, said the government was “just asking the NHS to catch up with the rest of the public sector . . . and it is very, very surprising on that basis that junior doctors should see this as something unimaginable for them”. \nTheir “appalling overreaction” to the proposed changes reflected the fact that the contract row was “a sort of proxy battle”, he added. “It is partly about junior doctors’ terms and conditions, but it is just as much, I think, about [the medical profession] testing the resolve of the government to change the way that the NHS is organised.” \nThe battle comes as the NHS is already under huge pressure. Hospitals, facing an unprecedented cash squeeze, have accumulated deficits of close to £1bn in three months. A large majority are expected to end the year in the red, without a credible plan for returning their budgets to balance. \nWith Mr Hunt’s assurances seemingly falling on deaf ears and the difficult winter season approaching, much hangs on the outcome, for patients and politicians alike.
