Oaks declared.\n\"On the big issues ... both sides should seek a balance, not a total victory,\" he said. \"For example, religionists should not seek a veto over all non-discrimination laws that offend their religion, and the proponents of non-discrimination should not seek a veto over all assertions of religious freedom.\"\nThe speech marked another landmark moment in the conservative religion's transformation from a faith that frowned on gays and lesbians to one becoming more welcoming and compassionate, albeit in small steps that may seem nominal to outsiders.\nAs with the Roman Catholic Church under Pope Francis, the conservative Mormons are trying to assert a softer position in society, while holding firm inside the church to its own doctrines against gay marriage and homosexual activity.\nThe Mormons chose Oaks, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that guides The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to give the speech, the most detailed yet reflecting the new approach to what Mormons call \"same-gendered attraction.\" He brings credibility as a former Utah Supreme Court judge who also once served as a law clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren on the U.S. Supreme Court, church officials said.\nThe discourse was delivered to a closed gathering of judges and clergy in Sacramento, California. A copy of the prepared remarks was provided to The Associated Press.\nOaks declared himself devoted to both church doctrine and the laws of a democratic society. But when conflicts between them arise and are decided, citizens of a democracy must follow court rulings, he said.\n\"Government officials must not apply these duties selectively according to their personal preferences — whatever their source,\" Oaks said. \"A county clerk's recent invoking of religious reasons to justify refusal by her office and staff to issue marriage licenses to same-gender couples violates this principle.\"\nOaks didn't call out Davis by name, but his reference was clear, and confirmed by church officials.\nDavis' attorney Mat Staver, fired back at the Mormon Church. He said in an emailed statement that \"any attempt to punish a person for the exercise of conscience is sinful.\"\n\"Kim Davis has a right to represent her county as an elected official without violating her deeply held religious convictions,\" Staver said. \"Of all religious denominations the Mormon Church should understand the importance of protecting religious freedom. How sad the church officials have forgotten their history and the importance of protecting conscientious objectors.\"\nThe \"fairness for all\" approach now advocated by the Mormons is essential to protecting religious liberties in an open society where different religions co-exist, Oaks asserted. This question isn't academic, but personal, he added: His great-grandfather served time in a territorial prison for breaking a federal law intended to punish him for his religious beliefs, and his wife's great-great-grandfather was murdered by an anti-Mormon mob.\n\"It is better to try to live with an unjust law than to contribute to the anarchy that a young lawyer named Abraham Lincoln anticipated when he declared, 'There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law,'\" Oaks said.\nStaver, Davis' attorney and founder of the Liberty Counsel, scoffed at the approach. \"It may sound nice, but it ends up not pleasing anyone. You need to stand on principle,\" Staver said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:05:49.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
