(AP Photo/Tim Ireland)\nAssociated Press Oct. 5, 2015 | 12:25 p.m. EDT + More By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer\nMIAMI (AP) â€” Joe Philbin was fired Monday four games into his fourth season as coach of the Miami Dolphins, and one day after a flop on an international stage that apparently sealed his fate.\nTight ends coach Dan Campbell, who has been with the Dolphins since 2010, was expected to be promoted to interim coach.\nThe Dolphins (1-3) lost their third game in a row and turned in their fourth consecutive lackluster performance when they were beaten Sunday in London by the archrival New York Jets, 27-14.\nMidseason head coaching changes are unusual in the NFL, but few will accuse owner Stephen Ross of impatience. He ignored calls to fire Philbin in December after the Dolphins faded to finish 8-8 for a second successive season.\nBut doubts only grew regarding Philbin's inability to motivate players with his bland demeanor.\nThe Dolphins have started poorly in every game and have been outscored 37-3 in the first quarter. The offensive line has been a problem throughout Philbin's tenure, and the defense has progressively gotten worse under coordinator Kevin Coyle.\nMiami ranks last in the AFC in rushing and offensive points per game, and last in the NFL in sacks and run defense.\nPhilbin, who was hired as a first-time head coach in 2012, went 24-28. He failed to reach the playoffs or even finish above .500.\nHis job has been in jeopardy since a rocky 2013 season that included a bullying scandal and a meltdown in the final two games that cost Miami a playoff berth.\nThe Dolphins have floundered for more than a decade while going through frequent shake-ups at the top. The next coach will be their eighth since 2004, and the second hired by Ross.\nThe Dolphins are on course to miss the playoffs for the 13th time in the past 14 years, and the seventh season in a row. It has been 23 years since they reached the AFC championship game, 31 years since they played in the Super Bowl and 42 years since they won an NFL title.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n___\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
