But two years later, San Jose is plagued by hundreds of unpermitted boxes. \n\"There are hundreds scattered all over the city -- often times without property owner permission,\" Councilman Pierluigi Oliverio said, standing in front of a green box that solicited \"clothes & shoes\" donations. \nOliverio said the unmanned bins are an eyesore for the city, often becoming a target for graffiti, litter and dumping. And even more frustrating, he said, is that rules the city adopted years ago have been widely ignored by the donation box companies. \nOnly two donation bins, both owned by Replanet LLC, have been permitted to operate in San Jose, as required by the city ordinance. Each permit costs $509, said Susan Walsh, a supervising city planner. \n\"It's a problem,\" said Cheryl Wessling, a spokeswoman for the city's Planning, Building and Code Enforcement Department. \"We find unpermitted boxes in nearly every district of the city. We typically find them in business districts, in parking lots of supermarkets, and near churches.\" \nOliverio, who unsuccessfully pushed to ban the boxes altogether, is now asking city staff to take action by removing the unpermitted ones or those above the maximum limit of 18. But in a city with eight vacant code enforcement officer positions, Oliverio acknowledged, that becomes difficult. The city's plan to fill a vacant code enforcement position will help, he added. Advertisement \nBut the District 6 councilman said his bigger concern is that the bins drain donations from nonprofits like Goodwill and Salvation Army, which invest back into the local community through programs and services. \nMichael Fox, CEO of Goodwill of Silicon Valley, said the bins take high-value donations like clothes and shoes from his organization, which operates nine stores in San Jose and has 750 employees. He said that while transactions have increased 14 percent over the past year, the overall volume of donated goods hasn't gone up accordingly, suggesting those items are ending up somewhere else -- such as in unattended donation bins. \n\"We know they're taking substantial amounts of product out of the system,\" Fox said, adding that the donations help support at least 650 local jobs. \"Many of these companies are shell organizations and you don't quite know where the money is going or if they're a nonprofit.\" \nMattias Wallander, CEO of Chicago-based USAgain, insists the six green-and-white recycle boxes his company has placed in San Jose are properly permitted. Wallander said his company doesn't pretend to be a nonprofit. The company collects donations from the bins weekly and ships them to its Hayward warehouse, where half the items are bundled up and shipped to Central and South America to be sold by local entrepreneurs. The rest is sold to thrift stores around the country. \nWhatever is left over is turned into wiping rags or insulation materials for appliances. No one answered the toll-free numbers listed on some of the other boxes that Oliverio pointed out around town. \nWallander blamed San Jose's \"overly restrictive\" ordinance for culling what was once 30 donation boxes his company had scattered around the city down to half a dozen. \n\"When you pass an ordinance that's overly restrictive, you lose good operators like my company,\" Wallander said. But he added that his business is still thriving. \n\"I know some of the thrift stores would like to be the only game in town,\" he said. \"But people are voting with their feet and using the bins because it's more convenient.\" \nFox said nonprofits like Goodwill keep money and jobs in the community, unlike unattended donation boxes owned by out-of-state companies. But Wallander counters that his Hayward processing facility employs 13 people. \nOther Bay Area cities have taken different approaches with the unattended bins. San Francisco has no rules on the books, while Hayward dictates where they can go. Santa Cruz bans them outright. Oakland's ordinance prohibits new bins from being too close to existing ones and fines owners who ignore blight complaints. \nThe Salvation Army of Silicon Valley has also seen its clothing donations plummet. \nJohn Desplancke, who oversees the organization's rehabilitation program, agreed that most people will donate out of convenience -- not because of an organization's cause. \n\"So if someone can drop it off on their way to work -- they'll drop it off to a donation box not knowing where it goes,\" Desplancke said. \"The best way to get them out of the community is to leave them empty.\" Follow Ramona Giwargis at Twitter.com/ramonagiwargis or contact her at 408-920-5705.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:08:15.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
