Comment Episode 2: Origins \nThe one-sentence history of the Iowa caucuses goes like this: It’s all Jimmy Carter’s fault. \nThe unknown southern governor came to Iowa, over-performed in the 1976 caucuses, garnered national attention and went on to win the presidency, thereby cementing Iowa’s place at the front of the nominating process. \nThat’s not wrong, but it’s not the full story. \n“You really have to credit George McGovern and his campaign manager, Gary Hart, for deciding that they would come to Iowa and make a stand in the 1972 caucuses,” former Des Moines Register political columnist David Yepsen explains in the latest installment of “Three Tickets,” The Des Moines Register’s podcast of Iowa caucuses history. This week's episode focuses on how the Iowa caucuses grew into the political juggernaut they are today. \nListen to the podcast: \nYou can also subscribe to the podcast series in iTunes and Stitcher .

By the end of the night, they had set U.S. Sen. Barack Obama on the path to the White House. \nHow we arrived at that result is perhaps the greatest story in the history of the Iowa caucuses — and the first one to be told in Three Tickets, a new Des Moines Register podcast that launches Thursday. \nHere's the short version of that 2008 story: The 240,000-strong turnout was unprecedented in the history of the caucuses, and it’s essential to understanding the 2008 race. It sums up the enthusiasm that defined the contest between Obama, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards, and underscores the secret to Obama’s success. \nIt illustrates how organization is the key to caucus success. \n“We staked our whole theory of the campaign on Iowa,” Obama adviser David Axelrod said in an interview for the podcast. He added, “Our theory was that Obama had a unique ability to expand the universe. That’s sort of the Holy Grail that everyone chases in the Iowa caucuses but few achieve.” \nListen to the podcast below. You can also subscribe to the podcast series in iTunes and Stitcher .
