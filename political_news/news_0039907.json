(AP) - For many politicians, a prostitution scandal would be a career killer. But in Louisiana, Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter is a leading contender in the governor’s race - with a campaign built on conservative values. \nMany had thought Vitter’s career was over in 2007 when news broke that his number appeared five times in the phone records of Washington’s “D.C. Madam.” Vitter was a freshman senator, but had been in the U.S. House when those calls were made from 1999 to 2001. \nWhile never directly confessing to breaking the law, the married father of four admitted to a “very serious sin in my past,” and said his wife forgave him. \nHe did not resign, but rather hunkered down for months. He re-emerged as a vocal critic of President Obama, who is highly unpopular in Louisiana, and shored up his conservative base, opposing abortion and gay marriage. In 2010, he handily won re-election. \nEight years after the scandal, Vitter is the front-runner among GOP candidates heading into Saturday’s election and appears likely to reach the Nov. 21 runoff. \nBut the scandal won’t go away. \nAn independent PAC trying to elect “Anybody But Vitter” is running ads reminding voters of it, and his rivals in the race regularly allude to it. \nRepublican candidate Scott Angelle, a state utility regulator, quips Vitter is not only “wrong on fornication,” but also on “education, on medication, on transportation and on litigation.” \nJay Dardenne, the GOP lieutenant governor, built his campaign on the message “I’ll make Louisiana proud” and describes holding office without a “hint of scandal.” \nThe lone major Democrat in the race, state Rep. John Bel Edwards, asks voters to judge candidates on their personal character and regularly says in speeches: “I will never embarrass you.” \nVitter’s poll numbers have slipped with the attacks. But with Angelle and Dardenne splitting the Republican anti-Vitter vote, the senator is favored to be one of the top two vote-getters in the open primary and is expected to face Edwards in a runoff. \nVitter has chosen to deflect all talk of the scandal. When asked at a candidate forum whether he ever violated state criminal law as an elected official, Vitter angrily dodged, calling it a “gotcha question.” \nIn a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday, he suggested he - and voters - have moved on. \n“I’ve come to learn that life isn’t defined by our falls, our setbacks; it’s ultimately defined by if and how we get up, if we learn from our falls, and grow, and fight, and are redeemed. That redemption motivates me every day - to properly serve people, really stand up for them, fight for them, do right by them,” he said. \nNew Orleans is known for its laissez-faire attitude and Louisiana for a long streak of colorful politicians, including several with well-known reputations for womanizing, like former Gov. Earl Long, who famously had an affair with stripper Blaze Starr six decades ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:51:29.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
