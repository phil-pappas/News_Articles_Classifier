President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 on Liberty Island in New York Harbor on Oct. 3, 1965.\nBy U.S. News Staff Oct. 2, 2015 | 12:01 a.m. EDT + More More on Immigration:\n• Immigration Has Changed America\n• Immigration Is the New Obamacare\n• Why Immigration Rules the GOP\n• Should We Crack Down on Sanctuary Cities?\n• To Build a Fence or Not\n• A History of Immigration in the U.S.\n• A New Mix for America's Melting Pot\nThis article originally appeared in the Oct. 11, 1965, edition of U.S. News & World Report. Please note that it contains language that was widely accepted at the time, but may be considered offensive by today's standards.\nNow comes a new set of rules on who can enter this country as can immigrant.\nOld-style quotas based on nationalities will be scrapped. All countries, all races will be treated alike.\nIt will mean more Italians, Greeks, Poles coming in. Negro immigrants will increase in number. So will Chinese. That's just a sample of the changes.\nThe whole system of admitting immigrants into the U. S. is being overhauled.\nThe immigration bill of 1965, long delayed by controversy over terms, cleared Congress on September 30 and went to the White House. President Johnson set the signing ceremony for October 3.\nAs a result—\nThe mixture of races and nationalities coming in as immigrants will be changed.\nQuotas based on national origin, in use for 41 years, will be ended.\nInstead, over-all limitations will be set on the number to be admitted.\nA limit of 20,000 a year will be placed on immigrants from any one country.\nMore Negroes from the West Indies than in the past will, in all probability, be admitted.\nMore people are expected to come in from Southern and Eastern Europe—notably from Italy, Greece, Poland, Portugal. Fewer are expected from the British Isles and Germany.\nMore Asian immigrants, including Orientals, are probable.\nRush From Latin America\nA rush of immigrants from Latin America is expected in the next three years. Starting in mid-1968, total immigration from the Western Hemisphere will come under limitation for the first time.\nThe Hemisphere limit is to be 120,000 a year, unless changed as a result of studies to be made between now and mid-1968. Actual immigration now from Western Hemisphere countries is approaching 150,000 a year.\nPeople from all over the world with relatives in the United States will find it easier to get admittance.\nImmigrants will be given preference if they have skills that the U. S. Labor Department determines are needed in this country.\nThe total number of immigrants admitted to this country is expected to rise to about 340,000 a year, with possibly a temporary bulge to 375,000 between now and 1968. Until then, there will be no limit on the Western Hemisphere. Immigration now is running at a rate of around 300,000 a year.\nThese are the highlights of the new immigration law. Its provisions need to be examined in detail, as the effects will be far-reaching.\nFirst Come, First Served\nThe key point to note about the new system is this:\nImmigrants from all nations, once the changes are in full effect, will be placed on an equal footing, without regard to race or nationality. People seeking admittance will be handled on a basis of first come, first served.\nThis basic rule is subject only to the 20,000 limit for each country, a 170,000 over-all limit for Asia, Africa and Europe, and the 120,000 limit for the Western Hemisphere. Thus, the old preference for the British Isles and the nations of Northern Europe will be ended. In addition, outside the over-all limitations, members of the \"immediate families\" of U. S. residents will be admitted. These are estimated at about 50,000 a year.\nThe present quotas will be abandoned by stages, ending completely in mid-1968. Between now and that time, here is what happens: Any portion of the current quotas not used by the nations to which they are assigned will be divided among the countries that have been overfilling their quotas.\nThese unfilled quotas have been running about 60,000 a year. Most of them will be parceled out to Italy, Greece, Poland and Portugal. These, as shown by the accompanying chart, are the countries where the largest numbers of people are awaiting admittance.\nA study by the State Department indicates that in 1966, under the new law, 20,000 will be admitted to the U.S. from Italy, 4,200 from Greece, 9,000 from Poland, 3,900 from Portugal. These are far larger than the numbers admitted under old quotas.\nThen, in the free-for-all after mid-1968, those countries probably will continue to send many more immigrants to the U. S. than under the quotas.\nIf people of Northern Europe want to come to this country as part of the 170,000 who will be admitted each year, they will have to compete with the Italians, Greeks and others in countries where the pressure has been great.\nAs for the Western Hemisphere, controversy raged for months over limiting the number of immigrants to 120,000 a year. Supporters of the limitation cited the high birth rate in Latin America, where the population is expected to triple in the next 35 years.\nIn the West indies, the islands of Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago have been singled out for attention.\nUntil now, Jamaica and Trinidad-Tobago have had quotas of 100 each. The new law puts these islands on the same footing with other nations of the Western Hemisphere, with no restrictions, except those applicable to all the countries. Until 1968, there is no limit in the Hemisphere.\nOf Jamaica's 1.6 million people, 98 per cent are Negroes, and the Negro population is heavy in the other islands. Negroes from that area used to migrate to Britain in large numbers. In recent years, Britain has adopted curbs that have reduced this migration almost to the vanishing point,\nNow, in large numbers, Negroes from the islands are expected to seek admittance to the U. S. Requirements of health, education and income will restrict the number getting in.\nIncrease of Chinese?\nAnother point: People of Chinese ancestry in South America number in the hundreds of thousands. These people will become eligible to enter the U. S. as immigrants.\nHeretofore, with quotas based on national origins, Chinese people in South America and elsewhere have been subject to the tiny Chinese quota.\nNobody has estimated the number of Chinese who will apply to enter the U. S. The potential is large.\nFrom Africa, immigrants to the U. S. in the past have been small in number. Some increase is expected, but still only a few hundred a year at first. Again the potential is there.\nRelatives First\nRelatives of U. S. residents will get the highest preference of all. The definition of \"immediate families,\" admitted outside the over-all limitations, is now broadened to include the foreign parents of U.S. residents. As before, \"immediate families\" also will include wives, husbands, and unmarried minor children.\nGetting top preference under total limitations on immigrants will be other close relatives of persons living in this country.\nAlso high on the preference list are scientists and professional people. Then come people with needed skills, and unskilled workers capable of filling any labor shortages that the U. S. Labor Department finds in this country.\nAll the immigrants coming in because of their scientific or professional standing or on the basis of the needs of the United States will be counted against the over-all limitation on the number admitted.\nHow many will be accepted on such occupational grounds? Nobody knows precisely, but some officials estimate not more than 5,000 to 10,000 a year.\nA final group to be given preference within the over-all limitations will be refugees from Communism.\nRefugees to be accepted as immigrants under this provision are estimated at around 10,000 a year.\nThis new law on immigration, wiping out the old system and starting over again with a new system, produced one of the hottest controversies of the 1965 session of Congress. How it will all work out in practice is still a matter of debate in Washington.\nTAGS: immigration", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdr4v2%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=From%20the%20Archives%3A%20A%20New%20Mix%20for%20America%27s%20Melting%20Pot%20in%201965", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdr4v2%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdr4v2%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=From%20the%20Archives%3A%20A%20New%20Mix%20for%20America%27s%20Melting%20Pot%20in%201965", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdr4v2%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=From%20the%20Archives%3A%20A%20New%20Mix%20for%20America%27s%20Melting%20Pot%20in%201965&summary=This%20U.S.%20article%20from%201965%20details%20the%20newly%20signed%20immigration%20bill%2C%20now%2050%20years%20old.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdr4v2%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdr4v2%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:00:02.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
