Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told reporters that people were ready to seal the fate of those who promoted \"jungle raj\" in the state. \nUnion Minister of State Ramkripal Yadav also came down heavily on his former boss and said \"people would set on fire the Ravana enjoying patronage of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad.\" \nFormer Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi also came out harsh on his former mentor Nitish Kumar. \n\"He calls me Vibhisan of JD(U) which means he is Ravana full of false pride and ambition. I know where lies the amrit (nector) and now Prime Minister Narendra Modi only needs to fire an arrow to end the Ravana,\" Manjhi told reporters reacting to RJD chief's comment. \nBJP ally Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha also attacked RJD chief and accused him of speaking \"anap-sanap\"(irrelevant things) anticipating defeat. \n  Related Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:20:32.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
