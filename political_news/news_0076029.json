All too often, this important task doesn't make it onto 'to-do' lists as people being too wrapped up in their busy, daily routines. Checking expiry dates for both smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors does not take very long, but could be the difference between life and death. It is wrong to underestimate how important it is to have smoke alarms and detectors that work properly, for the safety of precious life and property. Finally, properly disposing of the used batteries keeps them out of our landfills. Spent batteries and cellphones, along with other used batteries found in homes, like those from TV remotes, laptops, game consoles and power tools, can be conveniently dropped off at a participating RONA, RONA Home & Garden store, or Call2Recycle location that can be found at call2recycle.ca/locator . Call2Recycle recycles and reuses batteries for many useful products, such as silverware, golf clubs, new batteries and so much more, preserving valuable resources. \"The Call2Recycle drop-off locations will accept all household batteries,\" said Zenobio. \"Conveniently located at national retailers like RONA, it's easy for residents to drop off their old batteries for recycling when they buy new ones.\" The collection network also includes government buildings and municipal depots.\nThere are 7,000 collection sites across the country. Ninety-one per cent of Canadians now live within 15 kilometers of one. To locate a collection site or for more information, visit call2recycle.ca or call 1.888.224.9764.\nAbout Call2Recycle Canada , Inc.\nCall2Recycle Canada , Inc. is a non-profit organization that collects and recycles batteries at no cost for municipalities, businesses and consumers. Since 1997, Call2Recycle has diverted over 45 million kilograms of batteries and cellphones from the solid waste stream and established more than 7,000 collection sites throughout Canada .
