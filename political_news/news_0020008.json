After Laurent Gbagbo, a rival of those first presidents, came to power in 2000, FESCI enjoyed a privileged status, and authorities looked the other way as members attacked opposition supporters on and off campus, said Yacouba Traore, a historian of Ivory Coast student movements.\nIn postelection violence that killed thousands in 2011, with Gbagbo refusing to concede defeat, the union and its former leaders allegedly attacked the regime's opponents. For his alleged role, one of FESCI's former leaders, Charles Ble Goude, faces trial for crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, accused of commanding violent FESCI members and alumni.\nLast week, Athanase Diomande, a 28-year-old graduate student and FESCI officer, joined hands with fellow union members and representatives of rival groups in the middle of a patchy soccer field at Felix Houphouet-Boigny University — named for the country's first president — singing the national anthem and listening to a referee read out rules for a soccer match.\n\"Today, we are trying to give a new image to FESCI, because our image was ruined,\" he later told AP. \"Today in Ivory Coast, when you say FESCI, people still have a bit of apprehension.\"\nNot everyone is convinced the makeover is genuine.\n\"I think that FESCI today is behaving like a boy trying to get a girlfriend,\" said Aristide Wise Bogny, a student who was harassed and extorted by union members in the years before the 2011 crisis. \"FESCI is trying to tell students, 'You see, now we have really changed.' But if you say FESCI is not violent, it means FESCI is no longer FESCI.\"\nHistorian Traore said it is impossible to condemn FESCI without also condemning the country's entire political class. He noted that another FESCI alumnus is Guillaume Soro, a former rebel commander and currently head of the National Assembly. A host of youth leaders of various political parties also got their early exposure to politics in FESCI, he said.\nAfter the post-election violence ended with Gbagbo's arrest, the university remained closed for more than a year with Ouattara's government fearing a return of violent student politics.\nToday, the campus is a microcosm of the country's uneven recovery. Alongside gleaming new facilities and manicured lawns are libraries devoid of books, science labs lacking equipment and a disused swimming pool half-filled with muck and rainwater.\nMany students say these shortcomings highlight the need for an effective student union, though FESCI's reputation has been marred as recently as July, when FESCI members allegedly attacked a \"Peace Fair\" organized on campus, stealing phones and computers and clashing with police, according to witnesses. The event was financed by the U.S. State Department, and a U.S. diplomat was among those who took shelter in an amphitheater as FESCI members hurled stones at the windows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:31:56.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
