The former secretary of state and frontrunner for the Democratic nomination will be questioned by the group's CEO and President Javier Palomarez at Sunset Station in San Antonio, Texas, on October 15.\n\"We're delighted to have Secretary Hillary Clinton join us in San Antonio, Texas for our Presidential Candidate Q&A session — the fifth in an ongoing series,” USHCC Communications Director Ammar Campa-Najjar said in a statement provided to POLITICO. “Since the first day of her announcement, Secretary Clinton's team has continued actively engaging our business owners throughout the country by listening to their stories, and sharing her vision for broad-based prosperity where every American has the chance to get ahead and stay ahead.”\nThe Clinton campaign also confirmed the Q&A will take place.\nPalomarez told POLITICO that while they’re “very happy” that their schedules finally work out this isn’t the first time Clinton has engaged with Hispanics.\n“We’ve been working with Hillary’s team for quite some time now. She’s been engaging our local chambers as she travels the country and doing round tables and so forth,” he said.\nPalomarez said he looks forward to a “very substantive conversation, she brings with her a track record that goes far beyond the rhetoric and I think she’s got the experience that’s necessary to take this country ultimately to where it needs to go.”\nThe non-partisan group is not endorsing any candidate yet. Campa-Najjar said they will consider endorsing a candidate after hearing from their members. The event is one of a series put on by the chamber for candidates of both parties to share their platforms.\nCampa-Najjar told POLITICO that Clinton’s team was the first campaign to reach out to ask for access to the chamber’s members and for more information about engaging the Hispanic community.\nThe Q&A will precede a Latinos for Hillary rally also at Sunset Station where Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro is expected to endorse Clinton.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:21:31.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
