About 390 South Koreans are temporally in the mountain resort for three days of reunions with loved ones many have had no contact with since war divided the North and South more than 60 years ago. (Kim Do-hoon/Yonhap via AP) KOREA OUT\nAssociated Press Oct. 22, 2015 | 3:55 a.m. EDT + More By HYUNG-JIN KIM, Associated Press\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) â€” A silver-haired South Korean woman adjusted her 83-year-old North Korean husband's necktie. He held her hands and stroked her shoulder. Before this week, they hadn't seen each other since war tore them apart 65 years ago, and there is no reason to believe they will ever see each other again.\n\"Let's meet again in the afterlife,\" Oh In Se told his 85-year-old wife, Lee Soon-kyu, during their final meeting Thursday at the North's Diamond Mountain resort. \"Be healthy,\" his wife replied. \"Live long.\"\nTheir bittersweet parting was among many at the close of the first round of three-day reunions of hundreds of elderly Koreans on opposite sides of the world's most militarized border for more than six decades.\nAbout 390 South Koreans, many in wheelchairs, traveled to the resort to reunite with their relatives under humanitarian reunion programs that the rival Koreas occasionally hold. Another group of 250 South Koreans will visit from Saturday through Monday.\nLee and Oh and the others gathered in North Korea are the lucky ones. Many have died before getting the chance. More than 66,000 South Koreans are on a waiting list.\nOh was 17 and Lee was 19 when they married in late 1949. After living together for less than seven months, they were separated during the turmoil of the three-year Korean War, which broke out in June 1950 when the North invaded. At the time, Lee was pregnant with their son, who is now 65 and accompanied her this week.\nShe raised her son on her own, making money from needlework and farming, and never remarried. She lives in the same house that she lived in as a newlywed with Oh. Until she recently learned that Oh was alive and looking for her, she assumed he had died and held an annual memorial service for him.\nSome South Korean media reported that Oh had remarried, but during their first meeting Tuesday, he told Lee that he has never stopped thinking of her.\nShe thanked him for being alive. Their son, Jang-kyun, knelt on the floor and made a deep traditional bow. The father and son later laid their hands on the table and marveled at the resemblance.\nThe next day, when their son jokingly asked his father not to tease his mother, Oh said: \"I'm doing this because I love her.\"\nWhen Lee asked, \"Do you know how big love is?\" Oh replied, \"Yes, I know. It's the same thing as when a young man and woman meet and live together until they die.\"\nOn Thursday they were separated again, along with dozens of other Koreans who wept and exchanged final hugs. All knew that no Korean has gotten a second chance to reunite.\n\"Please raise our son well and enlarge your mind,\" Oh told his South Korean wife.\nThe husband left first by boarding a bus with other North Korean participants. He stretched his arm out the bus window to grasp the hands of Lee, who smiled.\nBefore this week's meetings, about 22,550 Koreans have reunited since 2000: 18,000 in person and the others by video.\nKoreans on both sides of the border are barred from exchanging letters, phone calls and emails.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
