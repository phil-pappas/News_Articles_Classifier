But by next month, drivers and pedestrians can say goodbye — for the most part — to detour signs and cones resembling oversize plastic witches' hats downtown. So long to concrete barriers and piles of gravel, bulldozers and barrels. Goodbye heart-in-throat feeling as you cross the street. The third and final phase of the $15 million \"Downtown Circulator Project\" is nearly finished, except for some potential hold-over paving and landscaping next spring. \"It's imminent,\" said Stephen A. Cardi of Cardi Corporation, the prime contractor. \"It should be completed and buttoned up this season — before the winter. By sometime in November.\" The final phase involves the reconfiguration of LaSalle Square and Emmett Square. That includes creating two-way streets where there were one-way streets, in turn providing new direct access to Route 95; widening sidewalks and shortening pedestrian crossings; and adding landscaping and public art. And, of course, new traffic signals. In Rhode Island parlance, LaSalle Square is where the old police station used to be. A confluence of streets marks Emmett Square, off Kennedy Plaza at the end of Fountain Street, where the Providence Journal building is. On a separate note, commuters and pedestrians will also be able to unclench their teeth as a $40-million Providence road-improvement project nears fruition. \"It's 95 percent complete,\" said Nate D. Urso, deputy engineer with the Public Works Department. That project, begun in 2013 under former mayor Angel Taveras, by next spring will have repaired 65 miles of streets, or about 17 percent of the 386 miles of roads maintained by Providence. \"We're waiting for some utility projects to be completed,\" Urso said Wednesday. Those include some in downtown; the East Side's Summit area; Eagle Street; sections of Valley Street, and Wayland Avenue. The Downtown Circulator Project results from a bond issue dating to the early 2000s, said Bonnie Nickerson, director of the Department of Planning and Development. The project overall will \"increase connectivity\" downtown, she said, \"making it easy for cars to get in and out and through downtown, and enhance pedestrian safety by shortening the crossing distances.\" Phase I converted Washington Street to two-way traffic. Phase II included the return of Weybosset and Empire streets to two-way traffic. Phase III included the redesign of Kennedy Plaza — completed earlier this year — and the redesigns of Emmett and LaSalle squares. The city is partnering with The Avenue Concept in Providence, on a public art and landscaping project. Robert Azar, deputy director of the planning and development department, said that by November, \"Empire street will be two-way for its entire length,\" providing direct access to Rte. 95, and a left turn onto Broadway. Page 2 of 3 - Drivers heading northbound on Empire are currently forced to turn right onto Fountain Street, curve left by the convention center, and bear right onto Atwells Avenue by the Hilton Providence to access the highway. Dorrance Street between Washington and Fountain streets will be two-way, allowing drivers to continue straight on Dorrance through Emmett Square towards highway access; Exchange Terrace between Francis and Exchange streets will also be two-way. The widened sidewalks are creating landscaping and public art opportunities, \"and a small plaza at Emmett Square, where Francis Street, Exchange Terrace, Dorrance, Fountain, Sabin and West Exchange (streets) all come together,\" Azar said. \"What we're looking for are streets that have a better balance of uses between cars and pedestrians and bicyclists,\" Azar said. Prior to this project, \"our streets were much more geared toward the automobile.\" New markings will extend an existing marked bike lane on Broadway, into LaSalle Square. Ultimately the intent \"is to have a dedicated bike lane on Fountain Street up until Emmett Square,\" said Azar. \"That will be when we pave the street, which may end up happening in the spring.\" Beyond striping, \"We're looking at ways to buffer with planters or flexible delineators,\" Azar said. \"We're committed to trying to get a buffered bike lane on Fountain Street. That would be the first one in the city.\" Yarrow Thorne , founder of The Avenue Concept, said the arts organization is financing the public art project and landscaping effort. \"It's an exciting collaboration\" with the city, he said. \"Our goal is to feature as many local artists and some national and international artists as well. The art will rotate,\" Thorne said. (The Avenue Concept has also sponsored other downtown public art projects). Two sculptures are already installed. \"Pentagon Helix\" by Kurt Snell, described as \"a large wood fabrication of twisting pentagons\" on Fountain Street across from Trinity Brewhouse. \"Wheels and Wings\" by Gillian Christy, \"is a stainless kinetic sculpture that playfully explores movement\" at Fountain and Union streets. A third sculpture, \"Red Pencil Elbow Grease,\" by Gordon Moss, a steel and reclaimed wood piece, will be installed next week near the Dunkin' Donuts Center. A fourth, \"Lotus” by Jaehyo Lee, will be installed in two weeks. Working with 15 local designers, \"we are going to be planting as many of the corners\" as possible this fall, Thorne said. The goal is to create unique perennial gardens, using as many self-sustaining native plants as possible to relieve the city of any maintenance burden, and strong design that addresses urban challenges. A final note about those cones and barrels. \"We laugh about it, but they do a great job in saving lives,\" said Stephen Cardi of Cardi Corporation. \"Number one, they channel the traffic. And number two, they tell everybody, 'Okay, start being careful' — that's for both pedestrians and drivers.'\" Page 3 of 3 - Asked about the lifespan of a traffic barrel, Cardi said, \"You'd be surprised at the mortality rate. It depends on where the barrels are located. In a higher-speed area, the mortality rate could be 40-50 percent. They get smashed, and they go to barrel heaven.\" —kziner@providencejournal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:23:16.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
