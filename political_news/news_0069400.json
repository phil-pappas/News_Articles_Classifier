The Israeli prime minister, in a fiery speech before the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, said the deal \"will not turn the rapacious tiger into a kitten\" and that the agreement had only rewarded Iran's \"bad behavior.\"\n\"The greatest danger facing our world is the coupling of militant Islam with nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said — and the Iran deal represents \"the marriage certificate of this unholy union.\"\nHe then slammed the U.N.'s \"deafening silence\" about Iran's repeated threats to eliminate Israel, and stayed silent for roughly 20 seconds to drive home his point.\nThe prime minister also warned that Israel would do \"whatever it must do to defend our state and defend our people.\"\nDisagreements about the deal “are a disagreement within the family,” Netanyahu said, referring obliquely to his at times fraught relations with the Obama White House.\nMcCain accuses Russia of attacking CIA-backed Syrian rebels By Eliza Collins\nBut he also warned the world's leading powers that history would judge them by how they implemented the agreement's terms now.\n“As this deal with Iran moves ahead I hope you’ll enforce it — how can I put this — with a little more rigor than you showed with the six Security Council resolutions that Iran has systematically violated,” Netanyahu said. “Make sure that the inspectors actually inspect, make sure that these snap back sanctions actually snap back and make sure that Iran’s violations aren’t swept under the Persian rug.”\n“One thing I can assure you, Israel will be watching closely,” he said.\nNetanyahu also called out Palestinian Authority President Abbas for refusing to negotiate.\n“I am prepared to immediately resume direct peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority without any preconditions whatsoever,” he said. “The Palestinians have consistently refused to end the conflict and make a final peace with Israel.”\nNetanyahu ended his speech with a forceful plea for the U.N. to “let itself of the obsessive bashing of Israel.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:47:45.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
