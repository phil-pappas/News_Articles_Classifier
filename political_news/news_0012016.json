(Associated Press) Comments \nIncome inequality is a prominent subject in the national debate as we head toward the heart of presidential primary season. But it is not, of course, just an American issue. Income inequality affects every country to one degree or another, and it is high profile enough that it's even made its way into the questions that are asked of students interviewing for a place at prestigious Oxford University in England. Oxford, as it now typically does at the end of each year's admissions process, has released the questions professors ask candidates during interviews. One is, \"Do bankers deserve their bonuses?\" \nWhat are Oxford's admissions gurus hoping to learn about students by asking this question? Brian Bell , an associate professor of economics at Oxford, explained it to The Telegraph : \n\"A simple answer might be that since banks are generally private firms and workers are free to work where they wish, then the pay they receive is just the outcome of a competitive labor market. In this story, bankers earn a lot because they are very skilled and have rare talents. It is hard to see a reason for government intervention in this case, though on equity grounds one may want to have a progressive income tax system that redistributes some of this income.\" \nBell, who worked as a hedge-fund trader before going into academia, added: \n\"A good candidate would wonder why it is that seemingly equivalently talented people can get paid so much more in banking than in other occupations. Do we really believe that bankers are so much better than other workers in terms of skill? The key point about this question is trying to get candidates to think about the economics of pay rather than just whether they think it is fair or not.\" \nThat was as specific as Bell would get, but plenty of thinkers have broadly addressed this question and could show students a good way to answer it. \nHere's Pope Francis , in a speech that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has quoted from: \n\"Just as the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' sets a clear limit in order to safeguard the value of human life, today we also have to say 'thou shalt not' to an economy of exclusion and inequality. Such an economy kills. How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure, but it is news when the stock market loses two points?\" \nAnd here's the late conservative writer William F. Buckley, Jr. , like Francis a Catholic, when asked in 1982 if Reaganomics was essentially saying \"Screw the poor\": \n\"No, I don't think so. I think that people do not resent the existence of wealth if they feel that it is not acquired as a result of extortion. There are an awful lot of Americans who found themselves suddenly wealthy when they looked up and found that the house they were living in was worth five times what they paid for it. They found that they had a taste of wealth they didn't resent. So it is with the universalizing of opportunity, which, I think, tends to debunk the obnoxious theory of conspicuous consumption. I think conspicuous consumption is offensive not in terms of the value of that which is consumed, but as an exercise in bad taste. The trouble with bad taste, as Stendhal wrote, is that it can lead to murder.\" \nWell, we wouldn't want that. So, Oxford applicants, keep your answers tasteful. \n-- Douglas Perry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:50:11.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
