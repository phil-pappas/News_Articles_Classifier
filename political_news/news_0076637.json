But a mere two years later, it seems — at least according to this GQ essay — men are proudly standing up, declaring themselves groomzillas, and demanding to see more table-setting mock-ups, dammit.\nTo clarify, the proud groomzilla doesn’t go to Parker-esque extremes — yes, he’ll look at “three rustic barns in 48 hours,” but that’s just because it’s what it takes to plan a wedding. And what makes a man a groomzilla is simply caring about his nuptials — really caring, the way a bride would — in a sort of charming way. Writer Zach Baron explains:\nI care about table settings, family-style dinner service, centerpieces, the quality and shape of the shuttle bus that will be required to move our drunken friends and family from place to place. I will obsess, like I have obsessed over few things besides certain Future verses, over the guest list and our vows. Until a few months ago, I had no idea any of these things might matter to me. But they do. A lot. I like the decisions, the heightened stakes, the communal nature of it. I like trying to one-up other weddings I’ve been to. I’m competitive. I’m the bride.\nBaron asserts that in allowing men to be more “bride-like,” the existence of the groomzilla is a sign of gender-role evolution. The flip means it’s now cool for guys to involve themselves in something as frilly as a wedding, and it’s totally chill for a woman to just show up and eat the lemon-buttercream-and-blackberry-jam cake that someone else so fastidiously selected.\nCute, but it’s not a real toppling of traditional gender roles until the groomzilla gets the same foot-stomping, fire-breathing, manic-bitch reputation as a bridezilla — or until WE network produces a reality show about them.", "external_links": ["http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/weddings-used-to-be-sacred-and-other-lessons-about-internet-journalism/", "http://www.gq.com/story/plan-your-wedding-groomzilla"], "published": "2015-10-17T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:18:28.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
