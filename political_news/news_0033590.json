For all the American apologists that wanted to create a more “fair” world where the U.S. does not wield so much power, might I suggest the starving hoards of out of work and broke Americans bang down their doors FIRST when the final curtain call comes on the days of the U.S. Dollar, and all hell breaks loose.\nIn virtually every link below on the coming financial crisis, there is a video explaining exactly what is going to happen, and why. Sadly, many have chosen to ignore the warning signs by adhering to a philosophy of ignorance is bliss. Just remember that when the sh** hits the fan. Like I said, I suggest those people go straight to the homes of the American apologists FIRST!\nIn the video below, you’ll learn that Congress has Invoked Procedural Martial Law TWICE in the last month to pass unconstitutional spending bills. Procedural Martial Law FORCES members of Congress to vote on bills WITHOUT the full knowledge of what they were voting on. At $19 TRILLION in debt, the U.S. is BY FAR the largest debtor on earth, and the rest of the planet knows there is no way mathematically possible for us to pay back our debts, and confidence is disintegrating fast.\nLook at the recent military alliance in Syria between Russia, Iran, and China as a classic example. Rumor today has it that the U.S. is considering abandoning our efforts there all together. There was a time that a military alliance between Syria, Russia, Iran, and China in an area with heavy U.S. presence would NEVER happen. The gig is up. The world knows the U.S. is not even a paper tiger anymore. We’re barely even paper kittens.\nIF CONGRESS IS INVOKING PROCEDURAL MARTIAL LAW, YOU CAN BE SURE WE ARE ENTERING THE BEGINNING OF THE END, AND YOU BEST BE PREPARED!\nMac Salvo Writes:\nSGT Report issues a critical and under reported warning: “We are living in the last days of this Republic.” In the video below, Sean from SGT Report summarizes these important dynamics that are coinciding with Congress’ procedural martial law:\nThe dollar is collapsing.\nChina is demanding a “reset” of the global currency standards, which would official end the dollar’s reign as reserve currency.\nIn its place, a global reserve currency planned since 2009 is forming, using a basket of currencies as value, and SDRs as a drawing mechanism on the global stage.\nPutin is fighting with the U.S. openly on multiple fronts, as the War on Terror turns into a Russian offensive in Syria and Ukraine remains tense.\nThe Federal Reserve faces an existential crisis over its bipolar decisions in furthering quantitative easing and/or hiking the interest rate enough to leave the economy on life support.\nStock market gyrations, looming derivatives disasters, and a system wide economic collapse regularly threaten the financial system, as experts predict collapse as an inevitable result of the 2008 crisis, and detrimental recovery policies afterwards that have given more power than ever to the banks.\nProcedural martial law was passed in Congress under the guise of confronting the next round of debt ceiling\nFOR MORE NEWS BY VOICE OF REASON CLICK HERE!\nCHECK OUT THE NEW GOOGLE+ PAGE!\nThe debt ceiling issue is returning to the forefront in American politics, again threatening a government shutdown.\nLast time, the shutdown resulted in sequester for many agencies that suspended work for many government employees; a great deal of political theater dominated the news cycle; but ultimately, things returned to a basic normalcy.\nThis time may be different, as a number of critical factors face Americans in 2015. Last week, Congress passed “procedural martial law” to address stop-gap spending as it faces the debt ceiling crisis again.\nMeanwhile, this quietly announced martial law forced a vote on bills the same day, preventing members from even reading the legislation they were voting on, to avert an October 1 government shutdown. The move, which was done just a few weeks prior, shows how desperate things have become.\nThe Hill reported:\nFor the second time in a month, the House on Tuesday invoked “martial law” to allow more expeditious consideration of a stopgap spending bill to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1.\nThe use of martial law refers to bypassing the typical procedure that requires the House to wait a day after the Rules Committee produces a rule establishing floor debate parameters before voting.\n[…]\nHouse GOP leaders invoked martial law earlier this month to fast-track a spending bill. But they ultimately never had to use it after the Senate opted to go first with the spending bill.\nCrisis is averted – for now.\nBut the dollar is now an unwanted export commodity. As the U.S. rattles sabers with Russia in its proxy wars, the basis for American power overseas is rapidly collapsing.\nChina is ready to move forward with a “global reset” that would include the yuan in a global basket of currencies, and knock the dollar out of its reserve currency status.\nIncreasing troubles of U.S. and government financial institutions gives a sharp warning that things are coming to a head.\nChillingly, the SGT labels the United States a “banana republic,” noting that it meets the criteria of the definition:\nThe very definition of a banana republic is a politically unstable country whose economy is largely dependent upon exporting a limited resource product – like dollars.\nIt typically has stratified social classes, including a large impoverished working class, and a ruling plutocracy of business, political and military elites. This political economic oligarchy controls the primary-sector productions to exploit the country’s economy. (source: Wikipedia )\nNow, the last semblance of the power of that republic, in its military strength and the “export of freedom and democracy”, will fade significantly with the death of the dollar.\nThings have become so gnawed to the bone, that, as SGT Report notes:\nNow the criminal Congress and shadow government need to use procedural martial law to pass stop-gap spending measures to keep the entire house of cards from coming down.\nAnd who is at fault? We must remember and point to the Rothschild central bank – the Federal Reserve is to blame for all of this. The entire system has been manipulated to wring out the very last dollar from the American people, to bankrupt the Treasury, and to bring the United States of America to its knees – so that a new international currency can rise like a Phoenix from the ashes.\nWe are living in the last days of this Republic.\nThe republic died, unofficially, a century ago with the creation of the Federal Reserve , and many other shifts in power, finance and institutions during that era.\nToday, in the final stages, the undermining of the dollar as reserve currency (established in 1972 under Henry Kissinger’s shadow presidency during the Nixon and Ford Administrations) may well be enough to trigger a global economic collapse of epic proportions, and is likely to destroy the wealth and power of nearly all Americans, along with stock markets across the world.\nThere is likely to be deep economic pain for most Americans during this currency crisis. It would mean not only tremendous wealth destruction to individuals, businesses and families, but a threat to the physical survival of hundreds of millions of people – who will have to endure Greece-style money shortage, food and grocery shortage, hunger, power outages, rioting, looting and government assistance.\nMeanwhile, politically, the decline of the American empire overseas, its hegemony and dominant voice in global affairs will be even sharper – further weakening the economic status of the country, and amplifying the effect on individuals.\nIf America is reduced to alliances based upon the export of the dollar itself, which props up its military actions and keep the Pax Americana alive, what will happen when that dollar no longer holds any value? Will we soon see superpower rivals reach out with the hand of economic salvation?\nWhat will life be like under a global currency, in a digital age of control?\nCan another republic spring up in its place, after this present reign of tyranny wanes and carries out its course? Will there be patriots out there to restore liberty?\nImage Credit\nYou can read more from Mac Slavo at his site SHTFplan.com .\nFOR MORE LINKS ON MARTIAL LAW:\nPolitical Dissidents Homes Being Marked By FEMA Prior to Martial Law?\nWalMarts Converted to Prisons are Done, Elites Prepare Underground Bunkers\nEmperor Obama is Rehearsing Martial Law – Major Update as of 2pm\nObama Signs Executive Order Permanently Implementing Martial Law\nMilitary and U.S. Agents Patrolling Texas Streets Asking Mysterious Questions\nDHS is Filming Your Cars Every Movement With Unconstitutional RFID Chips\nFEMA Concentration Camps Disguised As Malls Being Built Everywhere\nVeterans: Obama is Coming For Your Guns, and he Will Get Them!\nAbbott Calls Obama a Liar & Has National Guard Monitoring Jade Helm\nJADE HELM DRILLS IN EXACT LOCATIONS AS RUSSIAN TARGETS!\nGovernment “Threat List:” 8 Million People To Be Detained Immediately\nMore Revealed About Secret Underground Tunnels, Walmart, and the Military\nWhen The Elites Wage War On America, This Is How They Will Do It\nCongressman Gohmert Expresses Fear on His Website About Jade Helm\nPentagon Issues Response to Texas Move Against “Martial Law” Exercises\nObama & Crime Inc.
