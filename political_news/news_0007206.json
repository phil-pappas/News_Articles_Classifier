He says, \"While I haven't seen the detailed judgement, I think it's the right decision because the livelihood of a lot of people is dependent on these bars, especially the dancers. While researching for Chandni Bar , I've seen their plight and trauma. Most of them come from small towns in North India. I know of girls whose husbands had abandoned them, leaving them to fend for themselves and their children. When the bars were banned, many of the girls had shifted base to Dubai and Malaysia. Their children were forced to take a break from education due to monetary issues. Some women even started doing odd jobs to earn a living.\"\nREAD:Madhur Bhandarkar: 'Chandni Bar' changed my life\nThe filmmaker adds that bar owners should follow rules and regulations, like ensuring the safety and security of the dancers and adhering to the timings etc. He says, \"Though I'm in favour of the dance bars opening again , the rules of the law should be followed. They should not be a nuisance to the public.\"\nLISTEN: Songs of Calendar Girls on Gaana.com\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Calendar Girls | Official Trailer\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wg77MZddikg", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "http://gaana.com/album/calendar-girls", "https://www.pinterest.com/timesofindia/", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107628521107103264647/+TOIEntertainment/posts", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:21:57.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
