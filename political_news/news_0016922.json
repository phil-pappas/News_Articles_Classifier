Hussain made the announcement at the party’s campaign meeting in Gaya. \n“I request you to return your MLA Prem Kumar again with a majority. He will be the NDA ’s CM candidate,” said Hussain, a senior leader said. \nThe BJP , trying to add Bihar to its kitty, has not yet announced a CM candidate. The party has only been campaigning in the state on the plank of development of PM Narendra Modi . \nIt may be noted that during Jharkhand, Haryana and Maharashtra polls too the CM candidate was announced only after the results were announced . \nKumar, a six-time MLA from Gaya, was propped by his supporters for the top job on social networking sites. He is regarded as the BJP ’s face for the EBCs, which form a chunk of voters in Bihar . \nKumar’s candidature can dovetail with Modi ’s development plank. But according to reports, competitors for the top post included a few other key leaders, including former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:56:04.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
