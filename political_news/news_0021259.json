As the movie unfolded, the idealistic freshman senator, speaking behind his back-row desk on the Democratic side of a packed Senate chamber, entered the 24th hour of his solo filibuster. Arthur sat in the gallery signaling which rules would keep him from losing the floor. The vice president was present as well as every senator.\nFinally, his leading antagonist, a cynical old-timer, rose to seek a unanimous consent agreement. He asked the Senate’s permission to bring into the chamber 50,000 telegrams, from all sections of the nation, demanding that the young senator end his futile crusade. Distraught, but vowing to continue his fight against an entrenched political establishment, the exhausted senator collapsed.\nAs overturned baskets of telegrams cascaded paper over the freshman’s body, the senior senator suddenly changed course. Shaken by what he had just witnessed, he confessed to corrupt deeds and demanded that the Senate expel him. The chamber erupted with joyful shouts as the vice president sought to restore order.\nSen. Alben Barkley, (D-Ky.), the majority leader, called the film “silly and stupid,” adding that it made the Senate look like “a bunch of crooks.” Years later, Frank Capra, the movie’s director, alleged that several senators had tried to buy up the rights to the film to prevent its release.\nMr. Smith proved to be a hit with movie audiences, finishing second only to \"Gone with the Wind\" in 1939 box office receipts.\nSOURCE: WWW.SENATE.GOV\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:36:56.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
