Yesterday was a really poor showing for House Republicans.” \n“What did they accomplish? They re-litigated the actual Benghazi attack, which has been debated and examined over the past three years. They almost turned Sidney Blumenthal into a sympathetic figure (which, trust us, is hard to do). They really had no understanding of how the State Department bureaucracy works in wondering why Chris Stevens never emailed Clinton while Blumenthal did… And then Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-SC), after the 11-hour event, had a difficult time answering the question what new was learned.” \n“How else do we know that yesterday was a disaster for Republicans? We saw more Republicans wanting to talk about President Obama’s Defense veto than what was occurring at the Benghazi committee. Bottom line: Just like at last week’s Democratic debate, Clinton was good yesterday — not great. But she looked great compared with her opposition.” Related Posts Never miss a Political Wire post Your email address: * Please enter all required fields Correct invalid entries Have Republicans Really Entered Into a ‘Pro-Outsider’ Phase?
