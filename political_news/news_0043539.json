We have a bi-lateral agreement. We don’t need this. Secondly, we’ve got this big tobacco exemption, which stops big tobacco hunting for us.’ \nWhen asked about the ability to protect a future government’s right to restrict the land, or the sale of land, to foreigners. Minister Groser said,’No, but what we’ve decided to try and facilitate the debate here in New Zealand is to make explicit what we thought was implicit in the Korea deal, which is a future New Zealand government - we have no intention of doing this - can take discriminatory tax measures.’ \nMinister Groser told the programme he would like Labour’s support and is meeting with senior Labour leaders tomorrow. \nQ+A, 9-10am Sundays on TV ONE and one hour later on TV ONE plus 1. Repeated Sunday evening at 11:35pm. Streamed live at www.tvnz.co.nz \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
