The providers are paid on the basis of the number of people finding and staying in work.\n'Less than effective' The committee said nearly 70% of people who had completed their two-year attachment to the scheme, which applies in England, Scotland and Wales, had failed to find sustained employment.\nThe MPs recommended a series of changes to the \"complicated and less than effective\" payments model when the current contracts expire in April 2017.\nPeople with drug and alcohol addiction, illiteracy and innumeracy and the homeless should be better served, the committee said.\nA separate, specialist scheme for people with \"substantial disabilities\" would also help the government meet its goal to halve the employment rate gap between disabled people and non-disabled people, the MPs added.\nCommittee chairman Frank Field said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) \"deserves credit for implementing a programme which, in general, produces results at least as good as before, for a greatly reduced cost per participant\".\nHe added: \"But we must not forget that nearly 70% of participants are completing the Work Programme without finding sustained employment. We must do much better.\"\n'Hardest to help' The Employment Related Services Association, which represents the programme's contractors, welcomed the report and said the next round of contracts had to \"build on success\" but would also need \"the right financing in place\".\nA DWP spokesman said it would respond to the committee's recommendations \"in due course\".\nHe said: \"Almost half a million of the hardest to help claimants have been supported into employment through the Work Programme.\n\"That's a real success, and we welcome the committee's finding that the programme is better value for money to the taxpayer than any previous scheme.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2817/production/_86236201_013136930-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:06:06.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
