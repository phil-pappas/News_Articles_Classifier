I am also going to post a link to Gcaptain forum. Gcaptain is a sounding board like this only its a bunch of Merchant Mariners and people in the maritime industry. Anyway the lot is a bunch of professional mariners and many of them are familiar with the vessel, the run it was on and other stuff. I would advise you to not make an account on Gcaptain and run in and start blabbering. I havent posted on that forum thread either. I am just going to post that link up in case if anyone is interested you can learn some more info that your not going to in the mainstream media.

The scary part is the EPIRB. EPIRB goes off when it is floating on the water..EPIRB is normally secured on and around the bridge in a way that if the ship sinks, the EPIRB floats free and transmits. Open life boats, that makes my heart sink as well..Blah I said I wouldnt speculate and now I am and I just cant make logically come up with a happy ending here.

I just saw it and my heart sank, but apparently that's not been confirmed, and the coasties don't say anything about that either so good news. Quote: MIAMI - Coast Guard search and rescue crews are searching for a container ship with 33 crewmembers aboard reported to be caught in Hurricane Joaquin, near Crooked Island, Bahamas. The El Faro, a 735-foot ro-ro cargo ship, was en route to San Juan, Puerto Rico, from Jacksonville, Florida. At approximately 7:30 a.m. Thursday, watchstanders at the Coast Guard Atlantic Area command center in Portsmouth, Virginia, received an Inmarsat satellite notification stating the El Faro was beset by Hurricane Joaquin, had lost propulsion and had a 15-degree list. The crew reported the ship had previously taken on water, but that all flooding had been contained. Watchstanders at the Coast Guard 7th District command center in Miami launched an HC-130 aircrew out of Clearwater, Florida, to search for the El Faro. At this time Coast Guard watchstanders and rescue crews have been unable to reestablish communications with the El Faro crew. Two Air Force C-130 Hurricane Hunter aircrews attempted to locate and reestablish communications with the El Faro unsuccessfully Thursday. Coast Guard crews remain on scene and will continue search efforts Friday by both air and sea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:48:56.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
