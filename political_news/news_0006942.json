We were raised in unity in the society, our ideology is that of secularism,\" Khattar added. Also Read: 'Muslims can live in India but they will have to stop eating beef' \nJawahar Yadav, officer on special duty to the Chief Minister, also said that the newspaper published, misquoted Khattar in its report. \n\"Our CM didn't say anything like this, all he said was we should respect everyone... The newspaper which has posted this news piece has tried to put words in the Haryana CM's mouth,\" he said. \nIn an interview published in Indian Express, Khattar was quoted as saying, \"Muslim rahein, magar is desh mein beef khaana chhodna hi hoga unko. Yahan ki manyata hai gau (Muslims can continue to live here, but they will have to give up eating beef. The cow is an article of faith here).\" \nThe BJP government in Haryana, which completes one year in office later this month, Khattar said, is doing good work and needs to be given time before people start passing judgement on its functioning. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:08:13.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
