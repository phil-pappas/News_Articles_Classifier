Trinity Health Corporation requires the 86 hospitals it owns and operates in 21 states to abide by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ Ethical Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services. “The Directives… prohibit Catholic hospitals from terminating the pregnancy of a woman suffering a pregnancy complication, even if such care is urgently needed to protect a woman’s health or life” in violation of the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, according to the lawsuit ACLU filed Thursday in federal court in Detroit. \nThe ACLU’s premise is that ethical directives like “Thou shalt not Kill” or “First do no harm” in the Hippocratic Oath must not have any authority on how doctors practice. “Catholic bishops are not licensed medical professionals and have no place dictating how doctors practice medicine, especially when it violates federal law,” said ACLU of Michigan staff attorney Brooke Merriweather-Tucker. But Eve Pidgeon, a spokeswoman for Trinity Health, told CNSNews.com in a statement that “this case has no merit. A federal court already dismissed a similar ACLU claim, and we will seek dismissal of this suit for the same reason. “The Ethical and Religious Directives are entirely consistent with high-quality health care, and our clinicians continue to provide superb care throughout the communities we serve,\" Pidgeon said. \"We are proud that more than 25,000 licensed physicians work directly with our health system and share our commitment to people-centered care.\" \nIt is obvious that the ACLU is going to keep bringing these lawsuits to court in the hopes that they will eventually find the right Obama-appointed judge who will invent the right to force doctors to perform abortions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:10:25.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
