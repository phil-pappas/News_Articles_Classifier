I would like to encourage more people to volunteer for the many organizations in town and I will support all volunteers, especially the Fire Department, in their dealings with the council.\nI teach an engineering class one night per week at County College of Morris and would like to encourage more young people to consider an engineering education and perhaps CCM as an option after high school. \nI deal with people in a courteous and professional manner and would continue that on the council. I would like to invite all Butler voters to take a look at my website www.gerry4councilman.com to learn more.\nGerry O'Halloran, PE, \nButler", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:53:26.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
