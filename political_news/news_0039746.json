FILE PHOTO | NATION MEDIA GROUP In Summary The proposed law seeks to give more learning opportunities to students who do not qualify to join universities by stopping the elevation of polytechnics and other tertiary colleges offering diplomas and certificates. According to the Universities (amendment) Bill, the Education Cabinet Secretary and the Commission for University Education will be prevented from giving permission to elevate a middle-level college to a university. Lawmakers have criticised the growing trend of converting middle-level colleges into universities, saying students who do not qualify to join universities are being denied an opportunity to progress in their education due to lack of adequate learning facilities.

The President will also be stopped from awarding charters to such institutions. \nSeveral colleges such as the Kenya and Mombasa polytechnics have been upgraded to public universities over the last five years. \nLawmakers have criticised the growing trend of converting middle-level colleges into universities, saying students who do not qualify to join universities are being denied an opportunity to progress in their education due to lack of adequate learning facilities. \nSenate Education Committee chairman Daniel Karaba is set to move the Bill for adoption on Wednesday. \n“The commission shall not issue to an applicant a letter of interim authority where that applicant is a public mid-level learning institution,” says the amendment set for introduction on Wednesday. \nAs per the new amendments to the Bill, a mid-level college means a post-secondary school learning institution that offers a certification below that of a degree. \nAccording to the Universities Act, the President is the only one allowed to grant a local university autonomy. \nHowever, the new proposal will now give the President powers to refuse to award middle-level colleges a charter. \n“The President shall not grant a charter where such a grant would result in the conversion of a public mid-level institution to a university,” says the Bill. \nAdditionally, the Bill sponsored by Nominated Senator Halima Abdille seeks the establishment of a university in each county. When it was brought for Second Reading, senators supported it, saying it would help learners in far-flung counties get access to university education.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:48:54.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
