Television Netflix Is Reportedly Bringing Back Gilmore Girls David Sims The streaming network will produce four new 90-minute episodes of the beloved series.\nGilmore Girls is one of the great triumphs of modern TV—a sharp, endlessly rewatchable dramedy that holds up better than most new television, with a Netflix fanbase as wide as its original audience on the (now-defunct) WB network. It also had one of the worst goodbyes in TV history, airing a tragically bad seventh season without the involvement of its creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. So Netflix is reportedly riding to the rescue , ordering a limited-series revival of the show, written by Sherman-Palladino and starring Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, and all the other cast favorites.\n\r \r \r Netflix long ago began branding itself as some super-powered take on Nick at Nite, airing classic shows and bringing them back to life with new seasons. In Arrested Development ’s case, it felt like an obvious move. A planned revival of Full House felt more cynical. The return of Wet Hot American Summer was unexpected and somewhat bizarre. But Gilmore Girls feels the most karmically appropriate of them all: a chance for Sherman-Palladino, who exited the show after its sixth and penultimate season because of a contract dispute, to right the wrongs done in her absence.\n\r \r Continue Reading Owen Sweeney / AP Eddie Murphy and the Long-Awaited Cosby Joke David Sims While accepting the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, Murphy launched into a brutal impression of the star, in his first stand-up routine in 28 years.\nWhen Saturday Night Live aired its 40th anniversary episode in February, many hoped it might be the perfect occasion for Eddie Murphy to return to stand-up comedy. They were off about the timing—but only by a little. The moment fans had been waiting 28 years for finally came when Murphy did five minutes of material while accepting the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center on Sunday night. His target: Bill Cosby. Though that might be the comedic equivalent of low-hanging fruit these days, Murphy’s jokes marked a deliberate shift in his own thinking on the subject in recent months.\n\r \r \r Murphy’s impression of Cosby is already legend. It memorably leads off his film Raw , where he recalls Cosby chastising him for using too much bad language in his previous stand-up set, Delirious. Murphy was asked to reprise his act for SNL 40 , in a sketch that mocked Cosby’s shattered public image. But he turned down the opportunity, only giving a brief “thank you” speech on the show and telling no other jokes. (Kenan Thompson did the sketch.) “There’s nothing funny about it,” he told The Washington Post . “If you get up there and you crack jokes about him, you’re just hurting people. You’re hurting him.

In a scathing response, Amazon says it presented its findings to the newspaper several weeks ago, “ hoping they might take action to correct the record. They haven’t, which is why we decided to write about it ourselves.” Dean Baquet, the Times ’s executive editor, in a response reiterated his “support for our story about Amazon’s culture .” \n\r \r The piece, published in Medium , is written by Jay Carney, the former White House spokesman who now serves as Amazon’s s enior vice president for global corporate affairs.

He was sweaty from the bout, and as he rode through a snowstorm to an Italian banquet hall for a rally, he worried about how he’d sneak in. “I’m in my boxing gear,” he said. “It’s awkward.” He also rehearsed his speech: The day before, in London, Ontario, he had opened with “This place is important,” but he wanted to change it up. “This place matters,” he said, editing himself. “Windsor matters. This place is too generic.”\n\r \r After slipping into the building, Trudeau found a shower, but decided to pass because there was no hot water. “Hair is as good as it can get,” he announced. The length of Trudeau’s hair has been a source of tension between him and his staff, but the demands of professional politics are winning out: as he has gone from parliamentary backbencher to party leader, his hockey hair has steadily gotten shorter. Today, he looks less like a goalie than an assistant coach. After he ordered some dinner—a whole pizza topped with rapini, and a regular Coke—an aide ran through various bits of business. She informed him that his wife, Sophie, with whom he has three children, had given him the green light to hold an evening rally the next week in Ottawa. “I’m taking her to a Margaret Atwood ballet on Saturday, so I think she owes me one,” he said, joking that he might bring a flask.
