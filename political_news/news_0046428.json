These findings by the Office of Inspector General present a potential security risk to the agency.\nInvestigators sent emails containing false links to 3,125 employees over a two week period. Of that number, 789 clicked on one of the fraudulent links in the phishing email.\nThe audit also found that of the 3,125 employees it investigated, 96 percent did not complete the annual security awareness training offered at the agency.
