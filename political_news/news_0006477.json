It's not the richest in society who pay the price, it is the poorest in society and it is the most progressive thing a government can do to run a sound fiscal policy and provide financial stability to the working people of this country.\"\nMr Osborne added: \"The truth is running a deficit forever is not socialist compassion it is economic cruelty and Britain wants no more of it.\"\nMr McDonnell accused Mr Osborne of changing the economic targets he sets.\n\"It is difficult to take seriously the charters and mandates when time after time the Chancellor has come to Parliament to revise his own charter,\" he said.\nShare article The shadow chancellor also announced a review of potential expansion of the remit of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is in charge of setting interest rates and meeting the inflation target.\nIt will be led by former MPC member Professor David Blanchflower and will be part of Labour's \"radical project\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-15T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:56:26.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
