Mr. Harper was, we all were,\" says Joe Clark, who at 39 became Canada's youngest prime minister ever, in 1979. Trudeau, at 43, will become the second-youngest. \nBut Clark, also a one-time foreign minister, says Trudeau will project a \"contemporary\" image of Canada. He has already shown \"a capacity to deal very effectively with people who are not like him, not his age, not his background, and that's an essential quality internationally.\" \n\"I think we will be seen as a more reasonable partner in the world,\" Clark concludes. Unusual prominence \nJust hours after Trudeau clinched his majority , Canada's accustomed place in the world seemed to already be shifting, starting with its unusual placement in the world's headlines. \nIn Britain, television networks provided hourly updates, flashing photos of a victorious Trudeau in their show openings, while live blogs and news websites played the story (and the photos) prominently. \nHis sweep was variously described as a \"sea change,\" a \"stunning comeback\" or a \"stunning rebuke.\" \nIn a German headline, Trudeau was a \"rock star,\" and his meteoric rise, according to a French one, a \"lightning ascent.\" \nTake an early look at the front page of The Wall Street Journal https://t.co/5xQPDPcm8q pic.twitter.com/izDWWGKlmo — @WSJ \n\"Canada is already in love with its new prime minister\" declared i100, the Independent's hip online paper, posting various pictures of a long-haired, shirtless Trudeau. \nMany of the outlets played up both Trudeau's age and his pedigree, mentioning his father, Pierre, and an upbringing that would have honed the younger Trudeau's political persona. Many others also highlighted Trudeau's feminism and his views on marijuana. \nOthers — media and world players alike — began the process of combing through his promises to spell out what a Canada under Trudeau will look and sound like on the international stage. Within weeks of being sworn in as PM, Trudeau will find himself at a G20 meeting with Vladimir Putin, left, and Barack Obama. (Mikhail Klimentyev/RIA-Novosti/Kremlin/AP) \nAllies are cognizant, for example, that Trudeau has promised to withdraw from the bombing campaign against ISIS. Today the White House weighed in on that prospect. \n\"We certainly value the contribution that we received from the Canadians thus far,\" spokesman Josh Earnest said, \"and we are, certainly are hoping that they continue to play this important role.\" \nTrudeau himself said today that with their vote, Canadians were sending a message to the world. \n\"Many of you have worried that Canada has lost its compassion over the past 10 years. I have a simple message for you: On behalf of 35 million Canadians, we're back.\" High expectations \nIn the meantime, international good wishes began to trickle in for the prime minister-designate. \nIndian PM Narendra Modi tweeted congratulations and a photo of the two of them when they met in Ottawa. \nCongratulations @JustinTrudeau for victory in Canadian parliamentary elections!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:28:06.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
