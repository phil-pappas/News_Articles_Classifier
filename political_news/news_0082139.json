Given DuVernay's ongoing work to advance the role of women in film and to portray the stories of people of color, Cosmopolitan.com asked DuVernay her thoughts on the recent controversy surrounding upcoming British feminist flick Suffragette .\n Check out #Suffragette Meryl Streep and Carey Mulligan talking about feminism @TimeOutLondon http://t.co/4DfMLRiMLL pic.twitter.com/yASP0lUByT\n— Curzon Cinemas (@CurzonCinemas) September 30, 2015\nMore From Cosmopolitan In case you missed it, many were outraged that actresses Meryl Streep and Carey Mulligan appeared on Time Out London in T-shirts with the words, \"I would rather be a rebel than a slave.\" The photo was in promotion of the film, about British feminists fighting for the right to vote. The phrase is a nod to a Quote: by British activist Emmeline Pankhurst, played by Streep in the movie. The full Quote: goes: \"Know that women, once convinced that they are doing what is right, that their rebellion is just, will go on, no matter what the difficulties, no matter what the dangers, so long as there is a woman alive to hold up the flag of rebellion. I would rather be a rebel than a slave.\" Stripped of this vital context, however, you can see how this would be misconstrued and seen as offensive across the pond in America, conjuring up imagery of the Confederate Army's \"rebels\" and the African Americans they fought to keep as their slaves. ​The promotion was, as Vulture put it, \"unfortunate\" and many argued that Streep, who is American, should have known better. ​ In response to the outrage, Time Out London issued a very defensive response .\nDeVernay welcomed the controversy as an opportunity for dialogue and a chance to learn about perspectives, however. ​ \"I think it's something that the people in charge of the campaign may want to look at and really listen to how folks were responding to it,\" she said. \"I think when people have differences of opinion about things like that, it's important not to dismiss what folks on the other side are saying. I thought there were a lot of really wonderful points made about perspective.\"\nAnother reason the shirt triggered outrage is because the mainstream feminist movement has not historically been inclusive of women of color or their perspectives. As IndieWire's Women and Hollywood blog founder Melissa Silverstein put it on Twitter , \"Hard to fight the #feminismsowhite narrative\" when seeing an image of two white actresses in the T-shirt.\nI cringed when I saw the t-shirt on the cast of Suffragette. Hard to fight the #feminismsowhite narrative with that one.\n— Melissa Silverstein (@melsil) October 6, 2015\nDuVernay expanded on the need for non-white perspectives in feminism. \"You have women from all across the spectrum looking at that one phrase and having differences of opinions about it. The great thing about it is that it shows that women are not monolithic,\" DuVernay said. \"It shows the specific ideas, opinions, and concerns of women of color within the feminist movement, and that women who are not of color need to really listen to that and integrate that into their vocabulary, into their language, and in the posture.\"\n\"I think the core of what was trying to be said was coming from a good place, but it was inarticulate,\" she said. \"So, it is important that we all listen to each other.\"\n​ Follow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/melsil/status/651390599497711616", "https://twitter.com/CurzonCinemas/status/649196352853962752", "https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://t.co/4DfMLRiMLL", "https://twitter.com/TimeOutLondon", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Suffragette?src=hash", "http://www.vulture.com/2015/10/meryl-streep-suffragette-shirt-is-unfortunate.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/feminismsowhite?src=hash", "http://t.co/yASP0lUByT", "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/time_out_responds_to_suffragette_t_shirt_controversy_it_has_been_read_by_at_least_half_a_million_people_in_the_uk_and_we_have_received_no_complaints/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=socialflow"], "published": "2015-10-06T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:50:46.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
