Marco Rubio, R-Fla., speaks to audience members following a town hall meeting, Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015, in Cedar Falls, Iowa. (Photo: AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCEDAR RAPIDS, IA. – The United States is “barreling toward a second Cold War” with Russia, Marco Rubio warned Friday. \nThe Florida senator called for new sanctions against Russian officials and companies, as well as the use of American Special Forces to confront ISIS. But Rubio said more must be done in the Middle East, including establishing a coalition of Sunni troops to defeat ISIS in Iraq. \n“Strong American leadership is the only force capable of ensuring that peace and security once again prevails,” said Rubio, who’s seeking the Republican nomination for president. \nJust two days after Russia started air strikes on Syria, Rubio spoke at the Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security forum here. Longtime CNN correspondent Jeanne Meserve, now a senior fellow at the George Washington University Homeland Security Policy Institute, pushed Rubio on how he’d respond as commander in chief. \nIn addition to sanctions, Rubio said he’d supply Ukraine with increased intelligence and military assistance, and work to isolate Russia diplomatically, except to resolve the crisis in Syria. He’d also impose visa bans and asset freezes against top Russian officials, and work with European allies to make it difficult for Russia to transfer money between countries. \n“(Russian President Vladimir Putin) will be treated for what he is: a gangster and a thug,” Rubio told the crowd of more than 250 at the Cedar Rapids library. “I stand by those phrases.” \nOn ISIS in Syria \nRubio said American special forces are needed in Syria to improve targeting success of airstrikes, he said. He called for special operations to target ISIS leaders. \n“One of the reasons that ISIS is able to conduct new recruits is that they win a propaganda war,” Rubio said. “ ... I think we need to conduct special operations toward them that capture senior leaders and publicize them on social media, to show the world that they’re not invincible.” \nBut Rubio stopped short of advocating using ground troops to intervene, telling Meserve he would do so “if that’s ultimately the only choice left.” \n“There’s no way we can live in a world where ISIS survives,” Rubio said. “But I don’t believe that embedding regular, American troops on the ground is the best way to do it, and I don’t believe we need to do it.” \nOn Russia \nRubio warned that Putin is seeking to re-emerge as “a rival to American military might in this century.” \nRubio criticized Hilary Clinton’s “reset” of U.S.-Russia relations as secretary of state. “If the reset worked, it worked for Russia – not the United States,” he said. \nAnd he accused President Barack Obama of creating “the view that America looks weak, which is a very dangerous perception and one that Vladimir Putin is nurturing,” Rubio said. \nRubio continued, saying: “By word and by deed, (Putin) is trying to convince U.S. partners that America is a losing battle, and that Russia is the only country willing to take decisive action to confront the threats of the region.” \nIn response, Sam Lau of the Iowa Democratic Party said that Rubio’s foreign policy ideas “are a dangerous mix of failed Bush-era neoconservative policies and an outdated Cold War mentality.” \nOn ISIS in Iraq \nIn Iraq, Rubio called for a coalition of Sunnis to defeat ISIS – and prevent the country from becoming a “puppet state” of Iran. \nRubio would call on Sunni partners in the region – “the Egyptians, the Saudis, the Gulf Kings, the Jordanians and others” – to contribute troops, along with Iraqi and Syrian Sunnis. \nThey would become a “capable fighting force that we would support – logistical support, intelligence support, and additional air strikes – to confront ISIS directly and defeat them,” Rubio said. \n“In the absence of that, you’re basically outsourcing the entire fight to Shia militia that are controlled and sponsored by Iran with the ultimate aim to not simply defeat ISIS,” Rubio said, “but to turn Iraq into a puppet state – a client state.” About the events \nSETTING: A conference room in the Grand River Center overlooking the Mississippi River in Dubuque, and an auditorium in the Cedar Rapids public library downtown. \nCROWD: More than 300 in Dubuque, and more than 250 in Cedar Rapids. A spike in interest in Dubuque prompted the campaign to switch to a larger venue than originally planned. \nREACTION: The audience was friendly, giving Rubio standing ovations. \nWHAT’S NEXT: Rubio ended a two-day swing through northeastern Iowa on Friday. He will return to his home in south Florida on Saturday.
