Hillary Clinton had a strong performance. \nYou could feel the Democratic establishment types in the audience breathing a sigh of relief as their front-runner showed she can shine when the spotlight is on her. \nClinton showed flashes of steel, fire, humor and pragmatism. She deftly zinged her major rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, as insufficiently strong on gun control – the one area where he isn't to the left of her. And when Sanders explained why he was a democratic socialist by pointing to Denmark, Sweden and Norway, she countered: \n\"But we are not Denmark. I love Denmark. We are the United States of America. And it's our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism that it doesn't run amok and doesn't cause the kind of inequities we're seeing in our economic system.\" \nIn this sense, Clinton was channeling Franklin D. Roosevelt – who many said saved capitalism by providing a safety net. And Clinton's passionate defense of Planned Parenthood and paid family leave – in essence saying that California proved it can be done –had to inspire her base among Democratic women. Sanders was basically left saying: Me, too. \nDid Clinton make the email scandal go away? No. Her claim she's been as transparent as she could is debatable. And she'll be back in the hot seat on that one when she testifies in Congress next week. \nIn addition, the Democratic debate wasn't expected to get the kind of huge viewership the Republican debates have gotten – so any bump Clinton gets out of this will be more limited. \nBut who knows, maybe it was enough to help persuade Joe Biden not to get in the race. Now that would be a big deal \n2. Sanders got his major points across: is that enough? \nSanders, used to lengthy speeches before adoring crowds, got out most of his top lines over the course of the more than two-hour debate. \nBut he wasn't as sharp as Clinton. And he wasn't always as specific as his rivals. For example, while Sanders described climate change as a huge threat, O'Malley had a more specific solution: a 100 percent clean energy electrical system by 2050. \nOne of Sanders' best lines of the debate probably helped both him and Clinton. He decried the Republican investigation of her emails and said: \"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails. ... Let's talk about the real issues facing America.\" \n\"Thank you, Bernie, thank you,\" Clinton responded, treating him a bit like a gruff but lovable uncle. \n3. But can they get anything done? \nMaybe this is expecting too much of candidates running for office. But the Democratic candidates really didn't explain how they would work with a Congress that could well remain in Republican hands. \nClinton said she's managed to work with Republicans even though many don't like her. Sanders said the solution is to mobilize millions of voters to confront Congress. \nMore specifics here would be nice. \n4. Following the Oregon shootings, guns are an issue in the presidential race . \nThe Democratic candidates competed to show who would be strongest in reducing gun violence and taking on the National Rifle Association. Since the mass shootings at Umpqua Community College on Oct. 1, presidential candidates in both parties have been quizzed on the issue, and it was a major topic on the Las Vegas stage. \nBy the end of the night, both Clinton and O'Malley – who boasted repeatedly of enacting tough gun restrictions in Maryland – said they were proud to have the National Rifle Association as an enemy. \nThe one possible outlier: former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, who supported background checks and other restrictions. But Webb also noted that top officials in government have armed bodyguards and added: \n\"The average American does not have that and deserves the right to be able to protect their family.\" \n5. O'Malley and Webb get a little traction; Chafee not so much. \nOf the three candidates who are basically asterisks in the polls, O'Malley came off as the most knowledgeable and detailed in his plans. \nIn some ways, Webb was the most interesting, making it clear he didn't always go along with Democratic orthodoxy. And he had a wry take on Sanders' calls for sweeping new programs: \n\"Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.\" \nWhat about Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island senator and governor? He was silent for much of the night and fumbled around on some of the questions. He came across as a nice guy, but there was a reason he wasn't getting much attention in the post-debate analysis. \n-- Jeff Mapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:31:24.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
