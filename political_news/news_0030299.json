(0) \nMargaret Thatcher would almost certainly have been forced to resign if No 10’s true role in the affair over Westcountry-based Westland helicopters had been made public at the time, according to her official biography. \nThe storm over the future of the Somerset-based helicopter manufacturer provoked one of the most serious crises of her time in office – culminating in a furious showdown with her chief cabinet rival, Michael Heseltine, who dramatically resigned over the affair. \nMr Heseltine, then the defence secretary, had angered No 10 with his determination to back a European consortium in its battle with the American giant, Sikorsky, to take over the firm, which was based in Yeovil, Somerset, even though the Government was officially supposed to be neutral. \nThe crisis developed in late 1985 when Cabinet ministers fell out over how best to secure the future of Britain’s last helicopter manufacturer, Westland, which was facing serious financial problems. \nLord Heseltine wanted a European solution integrating Westland with Italian and French manufacturers. But Margaret Thatcher and Leon Brittan favoured a merger with the Sikorski, as eventually happened. \nLord Heseltine walked out of the Cabinet in January 1986. Lord Brittan followed a fortnight later when it emerged he had leaked a document critical of his former Cabinet colleague. \nAt the height of the struggle, senior officials in Downing Street and the Department of Trade and Industry were involved in leaking the letter from the solicitor general Sir Patrick Mayhew, warning Mr Heseltine had made “material inaccuracies” when he set out the case against Sikorsky. \nAccording to Everything She Wants, the second volume of the authorised biography of Mrs Thatcher by Charles Moore to be published on Tuesday, if the civil servant at the centre of the row had disclosed what happened “she could probably have brought down the Government”. \nOn January 6 1986, Collette Bowe, press officer to trade and industry secretary Leon Brittan, passed details of Sir Patrick’ letter to the Press Association’s political editor Chris Moncrieff in an attempt to undermine Mr Heseltine. \nThe move – in breach of the convention that the advice of the government law officers is confidential – infuriated Sir Patrick who threatened to resign while the attorney general Sir Michael Havers “threatened privately to put the police into No 10 to investigate it”. \nAccording to the book, Mr Brittan’s private secretary John Mogg said he had been told by Charles (now Lord) Powell – one of Mrs Thatcher’s closest advisers - the letter needed to be made public, although his account is disputed by Lord Powell. \nMs Bowe then called Bernard Ingham, Mrs Thatcher’s press secretary, to ask his advice as to how to proceed. She told Mr Moore that he informed her: “I’ve got to keep the PM above the fray.” \nThe book says: “‘I took a deep breath,’ Bowe recalled, and thought ‘OK, I’ll have to do it’.” \nMs Bowe and other DTI officials believed they had “cover” from No 10 and were “stunned” when – amid the furore over the leak – Mrs Thatcher announced an internal inquiry by the cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong. \nThe permanent secretary, Sir Brian Hayes, threatened to resign if any of his officials were punished while Ms Bowe was “particularly incensed” over a suggestion that she could be prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act. \nPublicly, Mrs Thatcher maintained that while she believed the letter should have been made public, she had not known how it was disclosed and would not have approved if she had. \n“Of course she had not asked what really happened: she was quite cunning enough to understand that the answer would be highly embarrassing to know,” Mr Moore writes. \nWhile Mr Brittan was forced to resign, Mrs Thatcher was “lucky” that Ms Bowe was both highly professional a strong supporter in private of her policies. \n“If she had not been, she could probably have brought the government down,” the book says. \nWestland, now Agusta Westland, remains a successful helicopter manufacturer, employing a workforce in Yeovil, which is still a UK manufacturing base for the company. \nAgustaWestland’s Yeovil facility in South West England has been at the forefront of aircraft manufacturing for 100 years and has been producing helicopters for more than 60 years. \nThe site in Somerset is one of AgustaWestland’s key design, research, development and manufacturing facilities and produces helicopters for the UK Ministry of Defence, export military and commercial customers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:44:49.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
