Claims that it’s about “heritage, not hate” don’t recognize all the rich and varied aspects of Southern heritage that the flag fails to represent. It seems that others see it that way, too. \nOn Monday, the city commission of Greeneville, Tennessee—which happens to be just one town over from where I grew up— resoundingly rejected , in a 22-1 vote, the commissioner’s proposal to hoist the Confederate battle flag over the city courthouse alongside the American flag.\nU of Mississippi students pass resolution to remove state flag from campus https://t.co/jrSVrdhaHJ #ConfederateFlag pic.twitter.com/nUzousP9Hx \n— WMAL News (@wmalnews) October 21, 2015 And on Tuesday, 33 senators in Ole Miss’s student government outvoted 15 of their peers to pass a measure that favors the removal of the state flag —which includes a version of the Confederate flag in its design—from school grounds. University faculty and administrators would also have to move to finalize the maneuver, but should it succeed, it could bolster other efforts to change the design of the state flag altogether.\nThere are plenty of people at Ole Miss, in Mississippi, in Greeneville, Tennessee, and elsewhere, who embrace white-supremacist doctrines—and are constitutionally entitled to fly whatever symbols they desire. For that reason, “Southern pride” has long been a term seen by many as a euphemism for racism. But that may very well be changing .\nMore Notes From The Atlantic Turning the Camera on Pet Photographers Oct 22, 2015 Orbital View: Our Backyard Oct 22, 2015 Obama Defends Black Lives Matter Oct 22, 2015 Quoted Oct 22, 2015 Can 'Sustainable' Investing Pay Off?

When Emily Langan, an associate professor of communication at Wheaton College goes to conferences for the International Association of Relationship Researchers, she says, “friendship is the smallest cluster there.

Olga Khazan In the age of the digital hermit, a psychologist explains what it means to avoid other people—and what to do about it.\nPeople today might not actually be avoiding social interaction any more than they did in past decades, but they’re certainly more vocal about it. The rise of digital communication seems to be spawning a nation of indoor cats, all humble-bragging about how introverted they are and ordering their rides and groceries without ever talking to a human .\n\r \r Sometimes reclusiveness can be a sign of something more serious, though. Social anxiety is one of the most common mental illnesses, but it’s still poorly understood outside of scientific circles. The good news is that it’s highly treatable, according to Stefan G.

He shuffled his 39-year-old, six-foot-five-inch frame back a couple steps, then forward, and then let go of a low throw aimed at the right sideline, where the Denver speedster Emmanuel Sanders was presently streaking.

These throws had turned defenses’ fissures into gaping and exploitable openings and put point totals in the 30s or 40s on scoreboards across the NFL.

But in his place, practically everyone would be influenced––even in spite of themselves––by knowledge of what their father and big brother did in similar situations, especially given that every likeness and reversal will prompt commentary.

Surely Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton have gleaned insights and wisdom about being president from their unusual proximity to the office.\n\r \r The question is whether Jeb’s family ties would influence him for better or worse overall. That depends, in part, on whether he sees his family’s legacy more clearly than those in his wing of the Republican Party, who tend to underrate Bush 41 and overrate Bush 43. Perhaps that political reality helps to explain why Jeb has shown no inclination to emulate a tremendously successful father, even as he defends a big brother who has easily done more to tarnish the family legacy than anyone else. \n\r \r Continue Reading Jonathan Ernst / Reuters It's Hillary Clinton Day at the Benghazi Committee David A.
