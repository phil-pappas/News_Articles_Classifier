Biden Jr. to worry he has hesitated too long to enter the race. “I’ve kind of given up hope,” said Dean Lane, a farmer in Newton, who believes Mr. Biden would have an easier time winning a general election than Mrs. Clinton, who will continue to ignite Republican fury. “He would have had an easier time if he’d gotten in a month ago.” Mary Bruner, who runs human resources for her family-owned bank in Carroll, approached the debate as if it were a job interview.

But she thought Mrs. Clinton offered the more “stellar résumé” and showed she had “people skills” needed for the presidency. “What was impressive was when another candidate was talking, she listened to them,” she said. “I thought she was genuine, I thought she was prepared.” Some voters who were unexpectedly impressed with Mr. O’Malley said he would be a better second-choice candidate if somehow Mrs. Clinton stumbles. “Before he had seemed milquetoast to me,” said Cal Tormey, a writer who works as a waiter in Des Moines. “I was impressed by how strong he came across.” But he still plans to caucus for Mrs. Clinton, whom he supported in 2008. “I’m trying to bet on the horse that I think will win,” he said. Ben Nesselhuf, the vice president for development at an addiction treatment program in Sioux City, was still undecided after watching the debate. “For Hillary Clinton the bar was set high, and she went over it by a lot,” he said. “She’s had a rough six months with the Republicans zeroing in on her, and that’s taken a toll. I thought she was great last night.” A former chairman of the South Dakota state Democratic Party who moved to Iowa recently, Mr. Nesselhuf said that Mr. Sanders did “a good job introducing himself and his philosophy to a wider audience,” and that Mr. O’Malley “proved he belonged” in the race. As for the two other candidates on the stage, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, Mr. Nesselhuf said they were out of their league and “don’t belong on the stage.” Sarah and Bryan Vanderpool, professional folks singers who recently moved to Iowa from Los Angeles, began the debate as Sanders supporters. Mr. Vanderpool was still one afterward. “He really spoke to the issues and I’m really excited about him,” he said. But Ms. Vanderpool found herself unexpectedly drawn to the gravitational field of Mrs. Clinton. “I came in really, really supporting Bernie and now I like them both,” she said. “She really handled herself well: she has a history of working on the stuff she’s going to be dealing with if she’s president.” \nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .
