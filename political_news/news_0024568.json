Claus received 58 votes and a seat on the six-person Council. \nNo official candidates had filed for the two City Council positions. The second open seat was won by write-in candidate Elyse Dawson, a youth pastor at the North Pole Assembly of God. \nClaus is the former president of the North Pole Chamber of Commerce. \n___ \nInformation from: Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-Miner, http://www.newsminer.com \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
