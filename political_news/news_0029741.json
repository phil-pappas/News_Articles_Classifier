Larry & Teddy Page In rural America a firm handshake means something. Molecular gastronomy does not. Rooster calls are more common than sirens and the value of a dollar is appreciated. More importantly, patriot hero John Wayne is still afforded due reverence.\nSmall town livin’ isn’t for everyone. But for those into the lifestyle, several Minnesota cities are primo locations to plant roots. The National Association of Realtors recently compiled a list of the country’s “top 10 affordable small towns where you’d actually want to live” and three Minnesota cities made the cut .\nThe realtor group vetted 500 so-called “micropolitan” areas — where populations are in the 10,000 to 50,000 range — looking for cheap homes, low crime and unemployment rates, and places where there’s actually stuff to do.
