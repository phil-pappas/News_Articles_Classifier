To help raise awareness, participants can post a picture of their bare feet to social media with the hash tag #Barefoot4Them.\nBarefoot4Them brings attention to those who live without access to proper footwear. Without shoes, countless children will not be able or permitted to attend school. Tens of millions will become infected with soil-transmitted parasitic diseases like hookworm, which can cause lifelong debilitation and suffering.\n\"Most of us don't give much thought to putting on shoes because we have not ever been forced to go without them,\" Soles4Souls President and CEO Buddy Teaster said. \"Barefoot4Them is a way to be more thoughtful about what it means to have a pair of good shoes. More importantly, it gives each of us a reason to reflect on how much harder life is without a pair.\"\nIn addition to distributing new shoes to thousands in need every year, Soles4Souls uses many of the used shoes it collects to support its micro-enterprise programs, which create jobs and personal income in impoverished nations like Haiti , Honduras and the Philippines .\nAbout Soles4Souls\nSoles4Souls is a not for profit global social enterprise committed to fighting poverty through the collection and distribution of shoes and clothing. The organization advances its anti-poverty mission by collecting new and used shoes and clothes from individuals, schools, faith- based institutions, civic organizations and corporate partners, then distributing those shoes and clothes both via direct donations to people in need and by provisioning qualified micro-enterprise programs designed to create jobs in poor and disadvantaged communities. Based in Nashville, Tennessee , Soles4Souls is committed to the highest standards of operating and governance, and holds a four-star rating with Charity Navigator.
