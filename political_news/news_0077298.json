Disgraced former Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver should not be allowed to tell a jury that the kickback schemes that netted him nearly $4 million complied with state laws, federal prosecutors wrote Wednesday.\nNew filings from Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Preet Bharara's office ask Judge Valerie Caproni to prohibit Silver from introducing \"inadmissible and confusing testimony about New York State law.\"\nThe government says it intends to prove Silver failed to disclose the nature of his income on state-mandated disclosure forms â€” which it will then use as evidence that Silver broke federal laws. He is charged with seven counts of mail fraud, wire fraud and extortion.\n\"Silver's compliance or non-compliance with state laws is irrelevant to the charges here, and risks confusing the jury and prolonging the trial,\" Assistant Manhattan U.S. Attorney Carrie Cohen wrote.\nHAMMOND: POLITICAL CORRUPTION VS. PLAIN OLD POLITICS\nSilver's alleged compliance with state laws is critical to his defense team's argument that he is being charged for \"longstanding features of New York State government.\"\nSilver allegedly told Leonard Litwin, who sought tax breaks from Albany, to give work to a real estate law firm with ties to the politician. The government says it should also be able highlight contributions from Leonard Litwin, one of the biggest political donors in the state. Silver is alleged to have directed Litwin, who was pursuing tax breaks from Albany, to give work to a real estate law firm with ties to Silver.\nLitwin has not been charged with wrongdoing.\n\"The government intends to introduce evidence showing that (Litwin's) dependency on state action led (Litwin) to become the largest contributor to political campaigns and related political committees in the state,\" Cohen wrote.\nSilver has pleaded not guilty. His trial is to begin in November.\nRelated Stories Cuomo's $15 minimum wage popular with NY voters, but not GOP Scarborough will go to prison for ripping off taxpayers Lovett: Sheldon Silver no longer travels by plane to Albany Lovett: NY Assembly pols will push to legalize MMA in 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:25:14.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
