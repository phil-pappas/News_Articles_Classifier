Also on the ballot is George Garrison III, who was voted out of office last year after serving two terms on the board. \nThe four spoke Monday at a forum hosted by the League of Women Voters. The event was an opportunity for the quartet to make their case why they should be elected, and to take questions from residents. \nThe first question — what each candidate perceived as the greatest challenge facing Englewood schools — drew a variety of answers from the candidates. \nTest scores, said Garrison, who called the district’s ranking compared to others “embarrassing.” With a nearly $70 million budget, Garrison said money is not the issue, nor are the teachers and administrators, whom he said he had confidence in. The socioeconomics of the district, where about three-quarters of the students are eligible for free and reduced price lunch, is also not an excuse, he said. \nGarrison was hopeful that Kravitz could “turn things around,” noting that the incoming superintendent oversaw Fort Lee’s School 3 when it was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School. \nIn addition to improving test scores, Pruitt said the district needs to ensure there are opportunities for all students: “Some kids may want to go to Princeton or Harvard or Yale, but other kids may want to do other things,” Pruitt said. \nSchool officials have discussed using the former St. Cecilia School, which the district rents, for vocational instruction, Pruitt said. \nCraig-Berry agreed that the district needs to raise its academic standards, but said the district also struggled with communication and transparency. She, too, was optimistic that Kravitz would help address these issues. \n“Once you have that stability at the top, then we can really address certain things,” said Craig-Berry. \nHaughton, meanwhile, cited a lack of consistency and engagement from one school to another as the district’s biggest challenge. Test scores tend to decline when children move to a new school and teachers in those grades routinely complain that students are not prepared, said Haughton. \nKravitz is expected to establish goals and outline a vision for the district, Haughton said. The board’s job is to support him and the staff as they execute those goals, he said. \nThe candidates also fielded questions about topics that included funding, student discipline, letting the public vote on the school budget, tying teacher compensation to student performance and making afterschool programs more accessible. \nAnother candidates’ forum will be held at 6:45 p.m. Oct. 26 at the Ebenezer Baptist Church of Englewood, 216 4th St. The election is Nov. 3. \nEmail: lueddeke@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:56:31.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
