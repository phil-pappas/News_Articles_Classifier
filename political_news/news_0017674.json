But she reminded us over and over and over again in that debate that she’s an outsider because she would be the first woman.”- Carly Fiorina\nFiorina added:\n“Let me start by assuring you that I will never ask for your vote because I’m a woman…I’m very proud of being a woman but I’m going to ask for your support because I believe I’m the most qualified candidate to win this job and the most qualified candidate to do this job.”\nMore Fiorina:\n“I am running for president of the United States ladies and gentleman because I think we have reached a critical point where the possibilities for too many Americans, indeed the potential of this great nation, is being crushed by a government that has grown so big, so powerful, so costly, so inept, so complicated, and yes, so corrupt – and a professional political class that refuses to do anything about it.”\nYou can read more about Carly Fiorina here , as well as listen to a recent phone interview she did with us a couple months back.", "external_links": ["http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/carly-fiorina-in-fla-you-know-youre-dying-for-me-to-debate-hillary-clinton/2250762", "http://shark-tank.com/?s=fiorina"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:25:40.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
