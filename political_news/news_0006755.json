Though Ghana is billed to host the event last year, it was postponed due to the 2014 moratorium on all non-essential meetings and conferences owing to the outbreak of the Ebola disease in some countries in West Africa. \nAccording to the 2015 IIAG overall Governance ratings, Ghana ranked seventh out of the 54 African countries with 67.3 per cent, maintaining its position in the top 10 but with a decline of 0.4 per cent since 2011 while Mauritius topped the list with 79.9 per cent, a decline of 0.7 per cent since 2011. \nAs part of activities for the Weekend, there would be a ceremony to award a former African Head of State who had met the Foundation's criteria. \nThere are five Mo Ibrahim Laureates so far including late South African President, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, who was given an honorary award in 2007. \nAn Africa debate would be held at the Movenpick Ambassador Hotel in Accra followed by a Concert and a football match between the Ghana All Stars and TP Mazembe of DR Congo. \nShe urged Ghanaians especially the media, civil society and other stakeholders to participate fully in the event. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:02:26.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
