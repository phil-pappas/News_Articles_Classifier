While the transfer is being reported as a U.S. effort to bolster Saudi Arabia’s defenses in the wake of the nuclear deal between world powers and Iran , the arms sales are part of an ongoing trend. The IHS Jane’s 360 report, released in March, found that Saudi Arabia was the “number one” defense trading partner with the United States in 2014.\nU.S. Congress now has 30 days to block sale of the ships before the deal goes into effect. While both Lockheed and Austal Ltd. manufacture such vessels, the deal applies to the “Freedom” versions produced by Lockheed.\nThe tentative deal comes despite mounting evidence that Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners – including the United States – are responsible for widespread war crimes in Yemen.\nA report released by Amnesty International earlier this month concludes: “Damning evidence of war crimes by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, which is armed by states including the USA, highlights the urgent need for independent, effective investigation of violations in Yemen and for the suspension of transfers of certain arms.”\nWhat’s more, the announcement came just days after the U.S. Navy admitted that Saudi-led warships are enforcing a naval blockade that is “slowing” aid to Yemen, which is facing critical shortages of food, water, and life-saving medicines.\nRooj Alwazir, a Yemeni activist and co-founder of Support Yemen Media, emphasized to Common Dreams that the Saudi coalition has already bombed hospitals, schools, homes, and factories, in a conflict that has killed 5,000 people, including 500 children, according to United Nations estimates.\n“If what we’ve been seeing in Yemen is any proof,” said Alwazir, “Obama’s ‘democracy’ gift will only enable Saudi Arabia to intensify its illegal war and its heart-wrenching atrocities against the people of Yemen.”", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/zklEV/~4/vEZc1YI820c", "http://www.commondreams.org/tag/yemen", "http://www.janes.com/article/49809/saudi-arabia-replaces-india-as-largest-defence-market-for-us", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8mIw_n1fkOQ", "http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/07/14/opening-historic-possibility-peace-world-powers-clinch-iran-deal", "http://dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/kingdom-saudi-arabia-multi-mission-surface-combatant-mmsc-ships", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/puySUic1p1M", "http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-25/us-approves-11-billion-deal-sell-combat-ships-brutal-dictatorship", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/14/us-yemen-security-aid-coalition-idUSKCN0S81LT20151014", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ivlz3_aPUE", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//blogspot/https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/yemen-call-for-suspension-of-arms-transfers-to-coalition-and-accountability-for-war-crimes/", "http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/07/28/while-backed-us-saudi-coalition-accused-war-crime-yemen", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-20/u-s-said-to-approve-saudis-buying-11-billion-in-littoral-ships"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:35:05.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
