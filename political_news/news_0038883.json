We will keep the people of Nepal in our prayers and ask everyone to do the same,” Carter said in a statement released by the organization. “We look forward to our ongoing work with Habitat and continuing to help shine the light on the need for affordable housing.”\nThe 91-year-old former president, who announced in August that he was undergoing treatment for cancer, had been cleared by doctors to make the visit, which was set for Nov. 1-6 in the Chitwan district, west of the capital Kathmandu.\nIt's the first time in 32 years that the group has had to cancel a Carter work project, Habitat for Humanity International CEO Jonathan Reckford said in a statement, citing shortages of goods and materials.\n\"[T]he severity of the shortages has proven to be insurmountable and given the circumstances, we would not be able to guarantee volunteer care and safety. Additionally, a large-scale event like this would only take away precious local resources already in short supply. This has been a difficult decision, but it is the responsible thing to do. We are grateful to our supporters and ask for their understanding and patience at this time,\" Reckford said, adding that families that had been selected for new homes would still be served through local resources.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:07:42.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
