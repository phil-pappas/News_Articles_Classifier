Here is what Families for Excellent Schools is attacking in its new ad. In a recent major address, De Blasio committed to extending school improvement well beyond his vast expansion of pre-school over the past year. Well over 65,000 children in New York City are now enrolled in pre-K programs, including many low income children, even children living in shelters for homeless families. The district is also engaged in the ongoing transformation of New York Citys lowest-achieving schools into full-service, wraparound Community Schools. In the recent address de Blasio promised to ensure reading specialists across the citys second grades and access to algebra for all students by ninth grade. He also promised that all of the small high schools created by Mayor Bloomberg will offer courses in advanced sciences and math. Many of these schools that have offered a more personalized education have not, until now, provided a curriculum with enough courses for students to earn a Regents diploma. So, who are the contributors to Families for Excellent Schools, the organization that is attempting to undermine the mayors progressive education agenda? Nobody knows, though everyone suspects it is the hedge fund supporters who are known to support Success Academy Charters. Chris Bragg reported a year ago for Crains NY Business: Lobbying records show how Families for Excellent Schools was able to shield its donors names. Critics have called it the hedge-fund loophole. Founded several years ago by business executives including four Wall Street players, Families for Excellent Schools has two components: an apolitical 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit and a politics-focused 501(c)(4). The groups 2012 tax returns reflect a heavy overlap between the staffs of the two entities, which share an office suite New Yorks 2011 ethics law requires issue-oriented nonprofits that spend more than $50,000 a year on lobbying to disclose sources of funds of more than $5,000 But the bulk of Families for Excellent Schools spending is not by its political arm but rather its 501(c)(3)which does not have to disclose donors under state law. Much of the organizations expenditures have been for television advertising, but Bragg points out the ads do not explicitly advocate for legislation, and hence skirt the law. More recently in the Albany Times Union, Bragg reports that in 2014, Families for Excellent Schools spent $9.7 million without disclosing its donors. He explains that at a meeting in February of 2015, the New York Joint Commission on Public Ethics acknowledged that some organizations have been able to construct funding mechanisms that may avoid disclosure while still technically complying with the law and the regulations. Bragg adds that, David Grandeau, an attorney for Families for Excellent Schools and former top state lobbying regulator, has maintained that the IRS definition of lobbying is far narrower than the one found in New York law, a distinction that he says makes the heavy New York lobbying spending by the group permissible under federal regulations. . . .
