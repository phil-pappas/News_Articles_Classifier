Cuba has yet to allow foreign technology companies to wire the island, leaving it with the worst Internet access in the Americas.\nSome 500,000 of Cuba's 11 million people are authorized to work as private contractors. The Obama administration's measures have been aimed at helping them over the still-dominant state sector.\nPritzker repeated President Barack Obama's calls on the U.S. Congress to completely lift the embargo. Obama could use his executive authority to further chip away at the embargo, but Pritzker declined to say what Cuba might do to encourage that.\n\"That's the president's decision. Our job at the Department of Commerce is to give the president options,\" she told reporters at the end of her two-day trip. \"For us to suggest more options, we need to better understand the (Cuban) system.\"\nObama and Castro shocked the world with their December 2014 announcement that the two former adversaries would end more than half a century of hostility and restore diplomatic relations.\nSecretary of State John Kerry came to Havana to open the new U.S. embassy in August. Pritzker is the first cabinet secretary to arrive since then and the first commerce secretary to visit Cuba since 1950.\n(Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Christian Plumb and Lisa Shumaker )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:08:46.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
