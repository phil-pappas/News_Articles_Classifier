Nothing will change, he added, “if all we do is elect the same people with the same ideas, the next person in line, the person they tell us we have to vote for.” The next day, as Mr. Rubio spoke at a foreign policy forum in Cedar Rapids, the Bush campaign’s opposition research department sent emails to reporters suggesting that Mr. Rubio had only recently converted from a moderate to a hawk on national security. Mr. Kasich’s visit to Iowa on Wednesday was his second in less than a week, after he barely campaigned in the state all year. His strategists also took aim at Mr. Bush, whose support in Iowa polls has eroded to 6 percent from about 12 percent in the spring. “We’re close to the bottom in polls, but pretty close to Bush, interestingly,” said John Weaver, Mr. Kasich’s senior national strategist. “We’ve been in the race two months, and his family has been in national politics 40 years.” David Oman, a senior adviser to Mr. Bush in Iowa, said the former Florida governor would not want to change places with Mr. Kasich. “We’re working on a good organization that will prove helpful when it matters on Feb. 1,” Mr. Oman said. At the moment, Mr. Kasich’s organizational footprint in the state is far smaller than Mr. Bush’s, who has nine paid staff members and has rolled out lists of supporters from business, agriculture and local government.

The Ohio governor has just three paid staff members, although his state chairwoman, State Representative Mary Ann Hanusa , once worked in the White House for President George W. Bush. She said that Jeb Bush’s campaign had sought to enlist her, but that she was backing Mr. Kasich because she thought he was best qualified to handle national security. As a congressman, Mr. Kasich served 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee. “I was the only Iowan in the West Wing on the morning of 9/11,” Ms. Hanusa said. She recalled running from the White House after the signal to evacuate. “It’s a scary world out there,” she said. “I don’t want to relegate our nation’s foreign policy to on-the-job training.” Mr. Christie, who has spent twice as much time in New Hampshire as in Iowa, returned last week to trumpet the endorsements of six Iowa business leaders. “It was a big get for the Christie folks,” said Eric Woolson, a former senior adviser to Mr. Walker in Iowa. “These are guys used to writing big checks. If they donate to Mr. Christie’s ‘ super PAC ’ and run TV ads at the right time, that’ll lift his numbers.” Mr. Christie promised to return often to Iowa. “I’ll be here frequently, and I’ll be in every important part of the state, so by the time you get to February, you’re going to be tired of seeing me,” he said. In late August, a poll by The Des Moines Register found Mr. Bush second to Mr. Trump among likely caucusgoers who described themselves as business-oriented establishment types. Mr. Oman, Mr. Bush’s senior Iowa adviser, predicted that those Trump supporters would soon move on. “We had Trump blot out the sun for months, and nobody could push their message out,” he said. “People were entertained and titillated. But what I’ve noticed in the last week or so is that some conversations have changed and people are taking the field more seriously.” Mr. Gaer, the mayor who formerly supported Mr. Walker, said he expected to make up his mind soon. “I just got off a very nice phone conversation with Governor Bush,” he said on Thursday. He is leaning toward supporting him, he said. \nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .
