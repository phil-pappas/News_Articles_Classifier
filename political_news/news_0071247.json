When was the last time they stood up for us? The answer is: too long.” \n“Steven Joyce has been able to get away with underfunding this sector and shifting costs on to students because our leaders have lost their courage. Do they still believe that education is a fundamental right for all? If they do, better start speaking up.” \nThe rally included stirring speeches from politicians David Cunliffe, Gareth Hughes, Vernon Tava and Marama Fox. Associate Professor of Economics from the University of Auckland Susan St John. \nFox repeatedly called on universities to ‘grow a spine’ and encouraged students to “vote, march and tell this Government what you want!” \nAUSA President Paul Smith said the Government had made the choice in recent years to drop taxes and cut funding to tertiary education and student support. \n“There’s a $400 million surplus, but the Government has cut tertiary sector funding by at least 5 per cent since 2010. Clearly this Government has balanced the books on the backs of students.” \nHe says students should feel inspired by effective action in Australia and Quebec against shock-and-awe fee rises. But, he says, the New Zealand Government is smarter and has inflicted on New Zealand students “death by a thousand, politically innocuous, cuts.” \n“A small snip here, a frozen threshold there, -too many of these cuts have gone unnoticed.” \nAUSA Education Vice-President Jessica Storey says students should not accept that the way New Zealand funds tertiary education, with students picking up a large tab, is normal. \n“It’s not normal. If Germany, France and Scotland can have free tertiary education for all, we can too.” \n“It’s not right that the people deciding these fees are whisked off to an undisclosed location to increase a burden on the next generation that they never had to bear themselves. It’s despicable.” \nTo conclude, Mr McCourt declared that “This rally is only the start of the student movement’s long road to a debt-free future. We’ll be back next year, and the year after, until fees like these stop rising and we build a society where the size of your parent’s wallet doesn’t decide your chances in life!” \nNote: Fees calculations based on average annual tuition and compulsory services fees across Arts, Commerce, Engineering and Science at the University of Auckland 2005-2015 and 2010-2015. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:28:18.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
