But groups supporting Issue 1 are finding that getting the political parties to agree on a redistricting plan is one thing, but getting them to work together on an issue campaign is quite another. \n\n“Sometimes it’s the challenge of having too many cooks in the kitchen,” said Carrie Davis, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio. \n\nThe proposed reform was crafted through bipartisan efforts, so, not surprisingly, both parties wanted a hand in the campaign. Former state Reps. Matt Huffman, a Republican from Lima who also is running for the state Senate, and Vernon Sykes, an Akron Democrat, were named co-chairmen. \n\nInvolving the two parties has led to questions such as who makes the decisions, who gets paid to run the show, who raises the money, and who gets the contracts when it’s time to spend the money. \n\n“I think it was natural that there would be a struggle to find a bipartisan way to do Issue 1,” said Catherine Turcer of Common Cause Ohio. \n\nA number of supporters expressed frustration with the official Fair Districts for Ohio campaign, though most hesitated to speak on record because they did not want to hurt the effort to pass Issue 1. \n\nSupporters said the campaign has been slow to make decisions or keep its website updated. The most recent story posted on the campaign website’s “Press” section is from July 10. The endorsements page lists 15 people and organizations, about 85 short of the total. \n\nOne statewide organization told the Dispatch it is considering spending additional money on promoting Issue 1, but would sidestep the official campaign to ensure the money is spent directly on mailers and not on political consultants. \n\nThe Fair Districts for Ohio campaign was being run by a pair of lobbying firms, New Visions Group, led by Derrick Clay, and the Batchelder Group, led by Troy Judy. Clay has Democratic ties and Judy was chief of staff for former Republican Speaker William G. Batchelder. \n\nWithin the last few days, Clay left the campaign. \n\n“We are in full support of Issue 1 and the leadership of the campaign, however we made a business decision that would not hinder further progress of the campaign,” Clay said. \n\nMultiple people with ties to the campaign described concerns over implementing strategies in the face of weak fundraising. Worried that voters were not being engaged, a coalition of nonprofit groups that strongly support redistricting reform took the initiative. \n\n“Our effort is focused on filling the gaps and complimenting the work they’re doing,” Davis said. “We created a coalition website so we’re able to get things up faster without having to have it vetted through too many cooks and making sure we’ve got this clear message out.” \n\nUnlike the two political parties, which usually butt heads, the coalition members have vast experience collaborating to spread a message at the local level. \n\n“This is what we do. It seemed natural to complement the efforts and fill those gaps,” Davis said, adding there are “no hard feelings” with the official campaign. \n\nThe League of Women Voters, Common Cause Ohio, and Ohio Voice, with help from ProgressOhio, created its own website, yesforissue1.org. Thus far, the nonprofit coalition has collected about 80 percent of the endorsements for Issue 1, has organized forums, is running volunteer phone banks and is printing tens of thousands of cards to be distributed by groups going door-to-door. \n\n“We’ve really created the grassroots campaign,” Turcer said. “We’re doing many of the things that, traditionally, the campaign would do.” \n\nThe campaign has sent direct mail and plans to run radio ads, Sykes said. All have agreed on the message, he said, but there has been debate over coordination. \n\n“I feel pretty positive about out total combined efforts so far,” he said. “Our biggest disappointment has been not being able to attract enough dollars to do all the things we need to do.” \n\nSome groups are directing more of their money to marijuana-related state issues 2 and 3, Sykes said. With no organized opposition to Issue 1 and some positive polling numbers, it’s been difficult to motivate people to write big checks. \n\n“That’s the biggest problem that we have,” Sykes said. \n\njsiegel@dispatch.com \n\n@phrontpage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:42:59.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
