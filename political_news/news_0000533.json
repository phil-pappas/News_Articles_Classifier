It's time to think about it again'. We are assessing — it's not like we are making a different decision, we are on the sidelines, we made a decision in January not to jump in.\"\nRomney also told Kilmeade that the race is keeping the two \"entertained,\" while cautioning that the 2016 contest is \"a long way from being over.\"\n  Poll: Scott Walker's slide in Wisconsin continues Wisconsin Gov.
