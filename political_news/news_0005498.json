(Associated Press) October 19 at 5:19 PM The Oct. 16 op-ed by William J. Perry and Andy Weber, “ Kill the new cruise missile ,” recognized that the president has an opportunity to increase the safety of the world. Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush’s opposition to similar tactical nuclear weapons should provide guidance on how to approach nuclear-capable cruise missiles.\nPresident Obama should follow the previous presidents’ choices because, as the commentary said, the launch of any cruise missile — nuclear or conventional — can be mistaken by other countries as the launch of a nuclear weapon. The rising tension between the United States and Russia provides an additional reason for eliminating these weapons from the budget.\nCutting the proposed new nuclear-capable cruise missile from the budget would put the United States in a position to argue against other countries building and implementing this type of technology. The president can lead the international community away from future chaos by listening to Mssrs. Perry and Weber. The United States is not likely to gain trust from Russia upon a cruise missile launch, as tensions in Syria increase.\nJacob Chappell , Washington\nThe writer is a lobbyist on nuclear disarmament issues with the Friends Committee on National Legislation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:48:47.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
