People have left baby strollers, appliances, mattresses and couches. \n\"That's why San Jose gets a bad rap,\" Salata said, pointing to the spot where he finds abandoned furniture every morning. \"Because you have knuckleheads doing this. It's frustrating and it makes me angry.\" \nSalata said the city hasn't done enough to stop illegal dumping. And city officials agree, saying dumping has risen sharply in recent years due to ineffective public education and lack of penalties. So, for the first time, they are recommending that the City Council on Tuesday approve stiff fines for violators. \n\"The problem just got to the point that the current process wasn't satisfactory,\" said Kerrie Romanow, director of the Environmental Services Department. \nShe and San Jose's planning director called the city's current efforts to stop illegal dumping \"reactive and insufficient\" in a recent report to the City Council. They are urging new fines for violators -- the first time the city's ever penalized people for dumping: $1,000 for a first violation, $1,500 on the second and $3,000 on the third.

Both Oakland and San Francisco can fine violators $1,000 for dumping unwanted items on the streets. \nAccording to the city report, the amount of illegally dumped material has risen 75 percent in San Jose and 50 percent on private property over the last three years. City officials had no ready figure for the increased tonnage of illegal dumping citywide or removal costs to the public. \nBut Romanow said it's been a growing strain on the city. Just the amount collected from public rights-of-way rose about 30 percent in the past year to some 20,000 cubic yards, said Diane Milowicki, the city's interim deputy transportation director. That's enough to fill about 8,000 full-sized pickup trucks. Her department has spent more than $700,000 on cleaning it up. \nIllegal dumping is most prevalent around multiunit homes and apartments where renters are less invested in the community and absentee property owners don't respond quickly to problems, a city-funded study found. But San Jose offers unlimited pickup of bulky items to tenants at multiunit homes, Romanow said, and the city needs to educate tenants about the program. \nDowntown San Jose, particularly near San Jose State University, and East San Jose were identified as other hot-spots for dumping. \nCity officials have stepped up efforts to fight the problem. It now takes one to three days for city workers to respond and clean up illegally dumped trash, down from what had been an average 18 days. \nThe city is also making it easier to report illegal dumping. Instead of having multiple numbers to report private and public property dump sites, residents can call City Hall's main number. \nAnd a city mobile phone app also is in the works that would allow people to upload pictures of blighted areas with GPS technology capturing the location. It will be released in early 2016. \nBut without proper enforcement and fines, some residents say the new efforts are pointless. \nSalata said he's tried catching the dumpers on his own for years -- he even put up surveillance cameras. But it happens overnight or during the early morning hours, making it hard to get a good image of the violators. \nRomanow acknowledged catching people in the act is tough, but said the city can issue penalties if there's other evidence, such as a picture of a license plate or the address on a piece of mail inside a bag of trash. \nIf city code enforcers identify the illegal dumper, they can slap that person with a fine. Otherwise, the property owner must have the junk removed or potentially face a fine. Salata said he's already spent a bundle on security and dumping the refuse himself. \n\"I go away for an hour and come back, and someone dumped,\" Salata said. \"I just don't know how they're going to catch them. It's cost me a hell of a lot of money.\" Follow Ramona Giwargis at Twitter.com/ramonagiwargis or contact her at 408-920-5705.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:43:08.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
