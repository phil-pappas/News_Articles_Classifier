The EC took the decision on Sunday after holding a meeting with its officials.\nAccording to BJP leaders, they have assured the commission that all required norms will be followed by the party.\nEarlier the district magistrate and returning officer of Kaimur had denied permission for the political rally citing security threats. The entire district where the Prime Minister is to hold rally is considered Naxal infested and has been declared as ultra sensitive.\nBJP leaders after getting the permission on Sunday by the election commission said “we have assured the EC that all norms will be followed, earlier also only after the clearance from the SPG we had decided to hold the rally in Bhabhua, Kaimur”.\nAlso Read:\nStage set for 1st phase of polling for 49 Bihar seats tomorrow\nBihar polls: BJP in fix over Modi as face of campaign\nHolding Nitish Kumar responsible for pressurizing the state administration to create hurdles in the ongoing campaign, BJP senior leader Shahnawaz Hussain said “current state government is so much in fear that it doesn’t want Prime Minister to hold rallies, it is his right to address a rally anywhere in Bihar. Even our party is aware of the model code of conduct and we are not violating it. The rally is being held as proposed”.\nBut fresh trouble seems to have erupted for the BJP as leaders of grand secular alliance has raised an objection to the rally stating that it may affect the voters. According to JD (U) president Sharad Yadav “holding a rally of Prime Minister may affect the voters who are going to polls on October 12, we have no objection to his rally, anyone is allowed to hold rally in this country but the choice of date seems deliberate keeping poll dates in mind”.\nThe first phase of polls for 49 seats is to be held on October 12 in ten districts, terming the rally as“violation of model code of conduct” leaders of JD(U) and RJD said the live telecast of the rally may affect the minds of the voters.\n Bihar polls PM to hold rally Election Commission nation Also Read Nehruvian legacy of secularism, socialism core beliefs: Sonia Gandhi Meru cabs strike called off RS polls: TN parties to finalise ties All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen eyes 3 new constituencies", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/modi-12_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/nation-politics/article/bihar-polls-ec-permits-narendra-modi-hold-rally-kaimur-october-12", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/modi-12_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:33:55.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
