Jason Loucas Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl The countdown is on. In 10 days, tickets for bookings at Danish restaurant Noma's temporary Sydney venue will go on sale for $485 per person.\nOne of the world's top-ranked restaurants, Noma chef and co-owner Rene Redzepi said in July it would close up shop in Copenhagen and move to Sydney's Barangaroo waterfront for 10 weeks starting from January.\nIn an email early on Tuesday, Noma said bookings for Noma Australia would open at 10am Sydney time on Friday October 30. The menu will cost $485 per person plus a 1.65 per cent credit card fee.\n\"We will also offer an all-Australian beverage pairing or non-alcoholic pairing, as well as a short wine list,\" the email said.\nThe Australian venue will run from January 26 to April 2. Comprising 56 seats, it will be open for lunch and dinner from Tuesday to Saturday. Bookings can be made for tables of two, four, six and eight.\nJudging by the popular reception of Heston Blumenthal's UK restaurant The Fat Duck's six-month stay at Crown Melbourne, where $525 bookings sold out quickly , Noma Australia will be popular. The Noma team relocated to Tokyo in January this year and the waiting list for reservations reportedly numbered more than 60,000.\nOne-quarter of the seats at Noma Sydney will be set aside for international tourists under the initiative sponsored by Tourism Australia, Barangaroo developer Lend Lease and Singapore Airlines.\nRedzepi is known for cuisine from the regional landscape. The team has been exploring Australia and working on a menu by visiting as many regions as possible including Tasmania.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/worldfamous-danish-restaurant-noma-will-spend-the-summer-in-sydney-20150727-gil49o.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:05:57.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
