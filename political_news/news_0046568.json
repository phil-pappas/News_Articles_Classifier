The U.S. leads an international coalition that is conducting airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria.\nIn Moscow, Russia's Deputy Defense Minister Anatoly Antonov said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that signing the memorandum was a positive step that has \"important practical meaning.\"\nAntonov said Russian and U.S. military officials will set up round-the clock communications channels and \"determine the mechanism of interaction, including mutual assistance in crisis situations.\"\n\"The Americans have promised to get the agreed rules to all participants of the anti-IS coalition they lead, so that their pilots proceed from those agreements,\" he said.\nHe said the memorandum \"doesn't change the principled position of Russia.\"\n___\nAssociated Press Writer Vladimir Isachenkov in Moscow contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
