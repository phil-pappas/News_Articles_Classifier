She was particularly upset that no doctor was made available. \nAbhaya is also angry at the lack of mental health support for her husband Veejay*, who is in a poor mental state, which she says was brought on from his treatment by immigration security in Australia. \nNot being on Nauru, it is difficult to see for ourselves the reality of Abhaya's circumstances. RN Breakfast has verified her account as far as possible with people who have dealt with her and her family both in Australia and on Nauru. \nAbhaya joins Fran Kelly on RN Breakfast from Nauru. \n*All names of asylum seekers have been changed for legal reasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:42:35.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
