The current register in their view is bloated and therefore not fit to be used for the 2016 general elections. \nThe NPP has presented evidence it says shows more than 76,000 foreign names on Ghana’s electoral roll. If not dealt with, the legitimacy of the winner of the 2016 general elections will be compromised, the NPP leader has maintained. \nNana Akufo-Addo believes a new register is absolutely necessary. Nonetheless, the 2016 NPP flagbearer also wants the E.C Chairperson to be allowed time to take concrete and independent decisions on the matter. \nHe hopes Mrs Charlotte Osei will not bow to pressure from any quarters but take the right decision concerning the creation of a new voter register. \n“I’m hoping that what I’ve heard that she has an open mind on the issues that are before her are true,\" he said. \nHe urged Mrs Osei to continue to be open-minded, expressing the hope \"...that at the end of the day she is going to make up her mind based on the evidence that has been assembled to her about the register and other [electoral] reforms.\" \nWhilst pleading for time for Electoral Commissioner, Nana Akufo-Addo, exalted her to find a way to hasten the process determining whether there is merit in the calls for a new register. \nThis he said is critical because \"if you decide to have a new register, it carries with it several several steps before you get a new register and the sooner that decision is made so that the country can be better prepared for the elections in 2016 the better. \n\"She's set out a roadmap, I'll hope if possible that that roadmap can be quickened but for the time being I think it is right for all of us to give her the opportunity to lead us, hopefully down the right path\", he added. \nHowever, given that the elections are 14 months away Nana Akufo-Addo belives the E.C must quickly assess all the issues and decide on the electoral roll and start implementing all decisions. \n\"We all know how important the issues she has to deal with are so for myself, I'm prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt,\" he noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:11:48.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
