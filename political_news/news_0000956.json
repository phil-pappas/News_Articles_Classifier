NO on marijuana candy. NO on Issue 3.” \n\nAnalysis : This ad — the first and perhaps only one to be aired by Issue 3 opponents — relieves heavily on strong images and repeating “No” verbally and in print to hammer home that marijuana legalization is bad for Ohioans. \n\nThe strongest points are the monopoly issue, driven home by a group of men seated around a table shuffling huge stacks of money, and the potential lure for children of pot-laced lollipops, gummy bears and other candies. The accompanying images touch emotions: anger about people getting rich at the expense of others, and fear of children falling prey to drugs disguised as candy. \n\nBut do those images reflect reality? \n\nIssue 3 would grant a monopoly for commercial growing and wholesale sale of marijuana for at least four years, and perhaps beyond, for 10 investment groups which own pre-selected sites around the state. After that, a state commission could add to the number of growers, but only if the market demand exceeded the ability of the 10 growers to provide the product. \n\nWould growers get rich? The state Office of Budget and Management estimated marijuana sales could hit $2 billion a year, so somebody is going to make money. The investors are gambling that their multi-million-dollar investments will pay off handsomely. \n\nSupporters of Issue 3 argue that rigorous packaging standards will be in place for edibles so they are clearly marked to avoid children accidentally ingesting them. Nevertheless, accidental poisonings of children are up in Colorado, where recreational and medical marijuana are legal. An individually wrapped gummy bear or lollipop still looks like candy to a toddler.\n- Alan Johnson \n\najohnson@dispatch.com \n\n@ohioaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:28:27.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
