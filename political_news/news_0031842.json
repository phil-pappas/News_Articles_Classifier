We’ve got you covered. \nOhio Republican and House Speaker John Boehner has plans for when he’s finally done with his job - even if those plans are on hold for a bit (more on that soon.) \nBoehner talked to Ohio reporters, including The Dispatch’s Jessica Wehrman, just before House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy took himself out of the race to succeed Boehner. \nAnd though Boehner says he’ll stay put for now, once he leaves Congress he wants to start driving again, something he hasn’t done in years, Wehrman reports. \n*** \nWhat Boehner said about leaving : “There’s never a good time to leave,” he said. “There’s always something hanging out there.”  \n*** \nWhat about the monkey : Boehner for years had a wind-up monkey in his office. “He joked to staff that he was the monkey — his staff would wind him up and send him out to do his thing,” Wehrman writes. Find out what happened to the monkey and why it isn’t in his office anymore. \n*** \nWhat he said about McCarthy : “I’m confident he’ll win today and I’m confident he’l l win on Oct. 29.” But that was about 30 minutes before McCarthy announced he wouldn’t run. \n“In the hours leading up to the party nominating contest, McCarthy concluded the job was not for him. Even if he could win, he'd be unable to move a must-pass debt ceiling increase. He figured he'd have an equally hard time shepherding through a critical spending deal,” POLITICO reports. \n*** \nThe House Freedom Caucus : “Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who was poised to run for House majority leader, cast doubt on whether McCarthy could win the speakership. Members of the House Freedom Caucus met privately with McCarthy days before the planned vote, and threatened to overthrow him as speaker if he did not accede to their demands,” POLITICO reports. \n*** \nA new strategy : It looks like Gov. John Kasich’s allies are entering into a new phase of the presidential campaign. Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Chrissie Thompson writes, “In a memo sent to donors and obtained by The Enquirer, strategists for the New Day for America PAC say they will shift from the experience-laden biographical ads that fueled Kasich's early rise in polls in New Hampshire , home to the nation's first 2016 primary. Kasich's polling has cooled since his quiet CNN debate performance last month.” \n\"Messaging will share John Kasich's reputation as someone who has always shaken up the system to fix big problems,\" Executive Director Matt Carle and Chief Strategist Matt David write in the memo, Thompson reports. \n*** \nHappening today : Kasich begins a four-day tour of New Hampshire and Vermont starting in Concord. \n*** \nCharter evaluation review : “Ohio Board of Education President Tom Gunlock refused to release communications requested by state Auditor Dave Yost for his annual audit and probe into the education department’s rigging of charter-school evaluations,” Dispatch reporter Catherine Candisky reports. “In a three-page letter, Gunlock told Yost that communications between education department attorneys and employees regarding the evaluations were protected under attorney-client privilege.”& amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; lt; /span> \nYost is looking into former school choice chief David Hansen’s scrubbing of charter school sponsor evaluations to inflate their ratings. \n*** \nWhat other board members say : “They really don’t want this looked at. They’ve thrown up road blocks every chance they can. That only leads you to conclude they are hiding something,” said A.J. Wagner, a board member from Dayton who sought an independent probe. \n*** \nCongressional redistricting : “With voters deciding whether to change how Ohio draws legislative districts, a bipartisan pair of senators urged the Constitutional Modernization Commission on Thursday to recommend similar changes for congressional seats,” Dispatch reporter Jim Siegel writes. \n“If we don’t do it now, we’re not going to lose another year. We’re going to lose another decade,” said Sen. Tom Sawyer, D-Akron. \n*** \nIn Columbus politics : “Columbus mayoral candidate Andrew J. Ginther and three other current and former city council members are the focus of an Ohio Ethics Commission investigation related to a trip they took with a lobbyist to the Big Ten Championship game last year,” Dispatch reporter Lucas Sullivan writes. “The revelation came on the same day that Ginther announced a new plan to improve ethical conduct at City Hall and as federal investigations and ethics questions have swirled around him and other Columbus elected officials.” \n*** \nWhat about the guy in the hard hat?  Sullivan l ooked into the background of Emanuel Giles Jr. who called himself Emmanuel Golden Valentine when he appeared at the Columbus mayoral debate Wednesday night. “The man who appeared in a hard hat and demanded a spot on a mayoral debate stage on Wednesday has been convicted of drug trafficking, indicted for murder and has served prison time in Ohio and Oklahoma.” \n*** \nVoters Guide : Early voting has started in Ohio and you can see what will be on your ballot with The Dispatch's Voters Guide. \n*** \nGet the news in your inbox : Did you hear we have a Dispatch Politics email?
