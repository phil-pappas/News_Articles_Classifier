For part of the 51-day standoff outside the Branch Davidian religious compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993, he was the strategic coordinator for negotiations with the compound’s leader, David Koresh. This siege ended in infamous tragedy: The FBI launched a tear-gas attack on the compound, which burned to the ground, killing 76 people inside. But before Noesner was rotated out of his position as the siege’s head negotiator, he and his team secured the release of 35 people .\nJamie Holmes, a Future Tense Fellow at New America, spoke to Noesner for his new book Nonsense: The Power of Not Knowing. “My experience suggests,” Noesner told Holmes, “that in the overwhelming majority of these cases, people are confused and ambivalent. Part of them wants to die, part of them wants to live. Part of them wants to surrender, part of them doesn’t want to surrender.” And good negotiators, Noesner says, are “people who can dwell fairly effectively in the areas of gray, in the uncertainties and ambiguities of life.”\nRelated Story How Uncertainty Fuels Anxiety", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385348371", "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/19/us/nation-challenged-hostages-fbi-veteran-hostage-negotiations-helped-reshaping-us.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:13:25.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
