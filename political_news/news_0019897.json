Two thirds of those in the South West surveyed by Plymouth University report they have been hit by the ban. A fifth said they had lost as much as 30% of trade. \nFewer people are taking vacations because they cannot afford the premium prices charged during the school holidays. Families are suffering too. \nTaking a holiday during term time is not necessarily a matter of choice. Some parents are unable to take time off work when their children are out of school. \nFor example, the South West has a high number of military personnel whose leave after deployment rarely fits the school calendar. \nTo fine such people for taking their children out of school to enjoy the benefits of a holiday – precious, stress-free quality time that in itself can be educational – is plain wrong. \nSome parents cannot be left to decide when their children are taken out of school, but the vast majority can, and long-term and persistent absenteeism can be tackled using other legislation. \nSo the call by tourism businesses in the Westcountry and local authorities across the nation for a rethink on the Gove rule is perfectly reasonable. \nThey have done their own thinking and suggest several changes including phased holidays, grouping school training days to create an extra week and establishing “educational breaks”. \nGiving headteachers more flexibility makes sense too. After all, the state trusts more and more heads – supported by governing bodies – to run schools independently of central or local control. \nSuch moves would also spread the holiday load and reduce July and August congestion in the South West. \nThe timing is ideal, ahead of a Parliamentary debate on the issue on Monday. \nWe need more than talk, though. \nWe need change – and a sign that the Government listens to the South West.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:37:56.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
