We have no working time. Imagine receiving more than 200 calls in addition to other duties. You have to serve the people who elected you into office. You must be available at all times to help them solve their problems,' Mr Nitiwul said. \nHe added: 'Whether at the constituencies, the party level, and in parliament, we are working at the committee level, in our offices and making consultations. When the need arises, we can be called for emergency meetings during recess. At no point in time is the MP resting.' \nAccording to the Deputy Minority Leader, a number of his colleague legislators had used about 90 per cent of their Common Fund in helping the constituents solve 'petty problems,' including scholarships to needy students. \nHe said the MP must have the ability to legislate, and represent adequately the constituents, \n'The representation, which involves seeking the views, interacting and consulting with the people is mostly done during the recess,' Mr Nitiwul said. \nHe, however, complained that resources at the disposal of the Ghanaians legislator were not adequate to effectively carry out that function. \nHe assured Ghanaians that the Legislature would continue to exercise its oversight responsibility over the Executive without any compromise. \nMr Nitiwul said as agents of development, the MPs made statements, asked constituency specific questions, made follow-ups and lobbied for funds for the execution of projects. \nHe supported the view that District, Metropolitan and Municipal Chief Executives should be elected as in the case of Members of Parliament, to check sycophancy and to reduce or dilute the powers of the Executive, which was the current appointing authority. \nConfident of victory for the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the 2016 general elections, Mr Nitiwul said he would still advocate for the DCEs to be elected, no matter the party in power, \nGNA Politics Follow Us BUT A SMILE ON YOUR FACE TO FACE A SMLIE AND LEAVE THOSE TEMPORAL PROBLEMS ASIDE.
