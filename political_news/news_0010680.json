Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” on Sunday, Oct. 11, ... more > By ALAN FRAM - Associated Press - Monday, October 12, 2015 \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Paul Ryan says he doesn’t want to be the next House speaker but he’s thinking it through - even as the Republican establishment pressures him to just do it. \nFor that to happen, the Wisconsin Republican would have to conclude that the House Freedom Caucus wouldn’t make his life -and a possible future presidential run - miserable if he said “yes.” That cantankerous collection of conservatives helped usher current Speaker John Boehner out the door and shatter Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s quest for the soon-to-be-vacant post. \nHere’s where things stand: \nQ: What’s Ryan’s latest position? \nA: Geographically, it’s his hometown of Janesville, Wis., where he’s spending Congress’ Columbus Day recess week with his wife and three young children. \nPublicly, he’s still a no. “Nothing has changed on his position. He’s spending the week with his family and I don’t expect any news on it at all this week,” said Brendan Buck, spokesman for Ryan. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have tried talking Ryan into it, Republicans say. But there’s no obvious alternative or predictable end to the tumult that’s rocked the House since Sept. 25, when Boehner, R-Ohio, unexpectedly announced he’ll resign later this month. \nQ: Why Ryan? \nA: Nobody’s heard of most of the House’s 435 members, but Ryan stands out. He was the GOP’s 2012 vice presidential candidate, chaired the House Budget Committee and currently heads its tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Republicans consider him an articulate spokesman for the party’s efforts to cut taxes, remake benefit programs like Medicare and erase President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. \nHis youthful appearance - he’s only 45 - gives Republicans a face they’d love to present to voters. And he’s been in the chamber since 1999, letting him nurture good relationships with hard-right conservatives and pragmatic Republicans alike. \nHe could probably also raise lots of campaign cash for House GOP candidates. That’s a big part of the speaker’s job and one at which Boehner has excelled. \nQ: Do conservatives want Ryan to take the job? \nA: He’s not necessarily persuaded the grass roots. Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, which claims hundreds of chapters around the country, said Ryan represents “business as usual.” \nBut prominent members of the House Freedom Caucus flashed a green light over the weekend. That included the group’s chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who called Ryan “a great communicator” and said the organization “would look favorably on him.” \nThat’s important because one Republican close to Ryan says he’d only consider seeking the post if he doesn’t have to make promises to win the votes of GOP lawmakers when the full House picks the next speaker, perhaps late this month. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations with Ryan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:49:31.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
