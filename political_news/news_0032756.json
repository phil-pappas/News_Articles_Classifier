But one politician in particular who has really stood out and captured the attention of lots of students and young adults is Bernie Sanders. Sanders, a senator of Vermont, is running as a democratic socialist, something very unusual for a mainstream candidate. He advocates for ideas such as universal healthcare, free education, prison reform and environmental awareness.\nA lot of students love Sanders. He stands behind issues that will directly affect our generation and is not afraid to speak out on controversial issues like police brutality and the insanely unequal distribution of wealth in our country. He has been quite vocal about his liberal beliefs, making such statements as, \"it is wrong to profit from the imprisonment of human beings and the suffering of their families and friends\" and \"it is an outrage that not one major Wall Street executive has gone to jail for causing the near collapse of the economy.\" He speaks confidently about his views, even calling out Republican candidates like Donald Trump on their hypocrisy and blatant racism. These actions, in turn, are getting more and more young people to support him. Students say that he’s \"a refreshing candidate,\" \"has a goal for this country and knows how to get us there,\" and that he \"doesn’t take the easy way out.\" Some are planning to work for his campaign and also attending his fundraisers.\nOf course, not everyone feels the same way about Sanders. Other students say that they’re \"weary on the whole ‘free education’ thing and his overall liberal policies,\" that his goals are unrealistic, and that he \"totally alienates the upper class.\" His socialist stance has attracted a lot of attention. Republican candidate Donald Trump recently attacked him, calling him a \"socialist/communist,\" and one student acknowledged that they think the word \"socialist\" will scare off a lot of voters. \nBut from the look of things right now, that’s not what’s happening. He may not be the current Democratic front-runner, but Sanders is gaining on Hillary Clinton in the polls. Multiple polls from news sources such as Time magazine have stated that he was the obvious winner of the first Democratic debate.\nHis good showing in the campaign and the Las Vegas debate means that he should be attracting even more support. And while Clinton has raised nearly $33 million, Sanders now follows close behind with more than $27 million, much of which comes from small, grassroots donations.\nBernie Sanders is undeniably an unusual candidate for our country, seeing as socialists rarely run in the major elections, let alone catch the eye of mainstream media. Even so, he is someone that young people in Glen Ridge and elsewhere are able to get behind and feel is listening to their voices and working to make the kind of change that we feel our country desperately needs.\nThe author is a senior at Glen Ridge High School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:26:11.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
