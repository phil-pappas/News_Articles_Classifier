Fantastic news for all, especially the millions of people who will be watching!\nâ€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2015 Carson and Trump sent a letter to CNBC on Thursday demanding that the Boulder, Colorado debate be capped at \"120 minutes including commercials,\" and allow opening and closing statements. If those stipulations weren't met, the letter read, \"[neither] Mr. Trump or Dr. Carson will participate.\" \nThe network originally planned for the debate to stretch two hours, with commercial breaks adding up to 8-16 minutes. They also intended to forego candidate remarks at the beginning and end of the Oct. 28 forum. \nThe White House hopefuls were informed of the debate plans in a conference call with CNBC and Republican National Committee officials. \nAfter several campaigns complained about the format, CNBC suggested Thursday that it would be open to modifying the debate constraints. \n\"We started a dialogue yesterday with all of the campaigns involved and we will certainly take the candidates' views on the format into consideration as we finalize the debate structure,\" CNBC spokesman Brian Steel said in a statement to the Associated Press. \nThe network has not yet announced any changes to the debate format.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:58:12.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
