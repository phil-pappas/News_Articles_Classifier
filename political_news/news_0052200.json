Paul Ryan said must support him before he runs for speaker have lined up behind him. That makes it all but certain that he will take the chamber's top job. \nThe huge Republican Study Committee represents mainstream House conservatives and claims over 170 members. It said Thursday Ryan is \"the right person to lead the House going forward.\" \nMinutes earlier, the Tuesday Group, representing GOP moderates, praised him for being thoughtful and willing to work across the aisle. \nBoth groups' support had been expected. \nRyan cleared his biggest hurdle late Wednesday, when most members of the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus voted to support him. \nThe House is scheduled to choose the new speaker next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:48:44.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
