But they will follow the school's ruling.\nThe chapter is allowed to recruit new members and hold academic and service activities. It cannot participate in or host social events on campus.\nAccording to local media, the female student reported in August that three fraternity members yelled the slurs at her from the house's windows. Fraternity officials say the windows were not accessible.\nA Georgia Tech statement says members also will have to complete specified education and training before the suspension can be lifted in August.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:24:18.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
