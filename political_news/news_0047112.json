So far, police have gathered enough information to suggest that more than 80 garages throughout Spain have been offering performance-enhancing and emission test cheating services.\nInvestigators discovered that some garages specialized in the removal of filters, whose function is to collect diesel soot, while others concentrated on manipulating the vehicles' electronics systems.\nDiesel engines that have the filter removed freely emit particles into the air, \"something that degrades the atmosphere considerably,\" the statement said.\nThe police statement, issued by the Interior Ministry, said the software that reprogrammed the cars' computers was so effective it was able to make the pollution produced undetectable to machines supplied to government testing centers and even to the specialized equipment developed by the vehicles' manufacturers.\nAll of the exhaust-tampering services were advertised openly online and inside the garages, the statement said. Some garages worked on car computers that were delivered to them regularly by post.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
