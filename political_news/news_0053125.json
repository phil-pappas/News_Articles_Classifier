John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican. In the digital space, he continued, “you have to be much more creative visually, but also with a much more tight message and hook that’s upfront.” ( A recent Snapchat ad by the group earned praise for authentically and concisely conveying Mr. Kasich’s message in just 10 seconds.) Continue reading the main story Snapchat Ad Video by New Day for America Though no single formula exists, strategists agree on several basic rules for grabbing voters’ attention. First and foremost is front-loading the ad by placing the most important message in the first few seconds. Dynamic visuals, eye-catching graphics and compelling music can also help. “The content that works best in shorter form is content that’s smart, that’s funny, and that’s inviting,” said Rob Saliterman, head of political advertising at Snapchat, where all content runs a maximum of 10 seconds and requires vertical video format During the 2014 election, for example, NextGen released a 15-second digital ad featuring millennials dressed as dancing bananas and monkeys, urging viewers — within the very first second — to remember to vote on Election Day. Smart campaigns are also making sure the message matches the medium. On Facebook and Twitter, videos begin to play automatically, but without sound, which makes attention-grabbing visuals critical. And on Snapchat, the best spots often mimic the authentic, raw and humorous feel of other Snapchat videos. And, of course, just like television, content reigns supreme. “You can make any 15-second ad you want, but if they’re boring, and people are just overwhelmed with the amount of advertising out there, then they’re not going to stick out,” said Anton Vuljaj, a Republican digital consultant. A new generation of admen and women seems already to have grasped that an effective digital ad is a different beast, and not simply the best 15 seconds from a 30- or 60-second TV spot, cut down for digital. Days after announcing his presidential bid, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, tried a quirky approach to skipable online video, first popularized by Geico. His campaign released a 15-second YouTube ad that began with an unlikely, and direct, appeal: “Please don’t skip this video,” Mr. Paul says. “We must take our country back.” Another video — released on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube — featured Mr. Paul taking a chain saw and a wood chipper to the tax code , and underscored the new role of online advertising, both as a growth area for politics and a virtual sandbox for experimentation and even playfulness.

Video by Rand Paul “It was unique, it was riveting, and the actual content wasn’t a normal boring political spot,” said Vincent Harris, Mr. Paul’s chief digital strategist. “You don’t often see somebody who is an elected official sitting with a chain saw and a wood chipper and lighting things on fire, so that uniqueness piqued people’s interest.” “That is part of the blessing and the curse of the actual ad format online,” he added. “If you are not piquing people’s interest, they are just skipping.” \nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .
