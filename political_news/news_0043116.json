Hillary Clinton speaks during the CNN Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas on Tuesday.\nBy Kimberly Leonard Oct. 14, 2015 | 4:25 p.m. EDT + More When asked during the Democratic presidential debate what enemies she was most proud to have made, Hillary Clinton named pharmaceutical and health insurance companies at the top of her list. But that hasn’t stopped the Democratic front-runner from accepting millions of dollars in campaign cash from both industries in the course of her political career, financial disclosure records show.\nSince her first bid for Senate in 2000, Clinton has accepted nearly $1 million from drug and health companies and more than $2.7 million from the insurance field and its related sectors, according to an analysis of public records from the Center for Responsive Politics. While the analysis did not include campaign finance figures for the 2016 cycle, some of the same donors and patterns can be seen in Clinton’s lone financial disclosure filed in July.\nRELATED\nU.S. News Health Care Index Shows Massive Increase in Consumer Costs Contributions tied to some of the same firms that gave to her 2008 presidential campaign appear in the latest disclosure, including donations connected to pharmaceutical companies Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.; and insurers Aetna Inc., MetLife Inc. and Centene Corp., the latter of which is among Clinton’s largest donors this year.\nIn the course of her 2008 presidential bid, records show that Clinton was the third-largest recipient of campaign donations from drug and health product companies, receiving $738,359 in donations. The industry also contributed $86,875 to her 2000 Senate run, and spent $157,015 supporting her re-election in 2006.\nThe insurance industry – which includes health insurers and also car, life and property insurance – donated $1,260,400 to her 2008 campaign, making her the third-highest recipient of cash from the industry that year and also in 2006 , when she raised $397,110 for her re-election to the Senate. During her first bid for the Senate in 2000, she raised $167,550 from the industry.\nShe was the second-highest recipient of cash in 2008 from the health services sector and HMOs, receiving $636,670, and the highest earner in 2006, at $183,770. In 2000, she raised $70,575.\nMore recently, the Clinton Foundation has also benefited from these groups’ donations. Donors and grantors who have given between $1 million and $5 million include Pfizer, the Procter & Gamble Co., Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and Humana Inc.\n[ READ: CBO Projects Decrease in Obamacare Spending, Warns of Future Fiscal Crisis ]\nBut Clinton seems to have turned on the pharmaceutical industry in particular in recent weeks, releasing a plan to improve on President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act, by tackling drug costs. The plan includes allowing Medicare , the government’s health plan for adults over 65 and disabled Americans, to negotiate lower drug costs – a measure the industry heavily opposes.\nHer policy proposal also stated that she plans to reduce the amount of time a pharmaceutical company has exclusive rights to biologics, which are drugs made of living cells that are expensive to develop and can be difficult for patients to afford . Though she supported the bill that led to a 12-year exclusivity while in the Senate, her new proposals say she would reduce the patent to seven years, allowing the drug to be copied by other manufacturers and therefore reducing its price. Drugmakers are against this proposal, saying they need to recoup the massive costs of developing the drugs and to invest in new treatments and cures.\nWhen Clinton was secretary of state, she supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which includes provisions that strengthen patent protections for drugmakers. Last week, however, she said she opposes the deal .\nRELATED\nJeb Bush Presents Obamacare Alternative When asked for a response to Clinton calling the pharmaceutical industry “enemies,” Tina Stow, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, said the group has a long history of supporting and working with candidates and policymakers on both sides of the aisle.\n“We will continue to do so as we look to advance a pro-patient, pro-innovation, pro-jobs agenda,” she wrote in an email. PhRMA has publicly come out against Clinton’s plan for prescription drugs, saying it would restrict patients’ access to medicines, result in fewer new treatments, would cost jobs and would end the country’s standing as a leader in biomedical innovation.\nIt’s unclear to what extent insurers and drug companies will continue to support her campaign, particularly after the comments during CNN’s debate , although it would not be the first time Clinton has been at odds with the industries.\nAsked to explain the financial relationship between Clinton’s campaign and the industries, campaign officials pointed to the contentious war fought against Clinton when she was first lady and head of the Task Force on National Health Care Reform in 1993. The health insurance industry ran millions of dollars of ads against a health care plan she championed that would have overhauled the system, playing a large role in ultimately killing it. They also point out that her positions to tackle drug costs have been unpopular among pharmaceutical lobbying groups, which could help to demonstrate she ultimately isn’t beholden to the industry’s interests.\nIn total, Clinton raised $245.8 million for her 2008 presidential run, $51.6 million for her 2006 Senate campaign and $30.2 million for her 2000 Senate bid.\nPharmaceutical companies and insurers are typically generous with members of both parties, giving slightly more to Republicans. Clare Krusing, press secretary for America's Health Insurance Plans, says its political action committee supports candidates of both parties and, in particular, candidates who support policies aligned with the industry's priorities around affordability.\nIn recent years, both industries have contributed more to Democrats. Obama was the top recipient during the 2008 presidential election, and again during his re-election in 2012, with his Republican opponents – first Mitt Romney, then Sen. John McCain – receiving slightly less from pharmaceutical companies.\nTAGS: Clinton, Hillary campaigns 2016 presidential election Democratic Party debates drugs", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe798d%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=F09&cycle=2000&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U", "https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F09&recipdetail=S&sortorder=A&cycle=2006", "http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=h04&cycle=2008&recipdetail=A&mem=Y&sortorder=U", "https://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/select.php?ind=H03", "https://www.hillaryclinton.com/p/briefing/factsheets/2015/09/21/hillary-clinton-plan-for-lowering-prescription-drug-costs/", "http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/718/201507159000204718/201507159000204718.pdf#navpanes=0", "https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/summary.php?ind=F09&cycle=2008&recipdetail=S&mem=Y", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe798d%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe798d%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Hillary%20Takes%20Millions%20in%20Campaign%20Cash%20From%20%E2%80%98Enemies%E2%80%99", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe798d%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Hillary%20Takes%20Millions%20in%20Campaign%20Cash%20From%20%E2%80%98Enemies%E2%80%99&summary=Clinton%20named%20the%20drug%20and%20insurance%20industries%20among%20her%20%E2%80%9Cenemies%2C%E2%80%9D%20but%20has%20accepted%20millions%20in%20donations%20from%20them.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=h04&cycle=2006&recipdetail=A&sortorder=U", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe798d%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%241%2C000%2C001%20to%20%245%2C000%2C000&page=1", "http://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/contrib.php?id=N00000019&cycle=2016&type=f", "https://www.clintonfoundation.org/contributors?category=%241%2C000%2C001+to+%245%2C000%2C000", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe798d%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Hillary%20Takes%20Millions%20in%20Campaign%20Cash%20From%20%E2%80%98Enemies%E2%80%99", "http://catalyst.phrma.org/secretary-clinton-s-proposal-would-turn-back-the-clock-on-medical-innovation", "https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=H03&cycle=2000&recipdetail=A&mem=Y&sortorder=U"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:08:16.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
