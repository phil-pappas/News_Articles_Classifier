But not everyone in the pro-Second Amendment community was happy to see him. Kit Lange at Patrick Henry Society blog explained : \n“In the wake of the recent shooting in Roseburg, OR, President Obama has made a point to not only talk openly about executive orders regarding gun control, but also plans to make a visit to Roseburg on Friday to underscore the point. He plans to talk to the families of those killed, as well as push for ‘common sense’ gun control. \n“There’s only one problem. It seems quite a few in Roseburg don’t want him there. \n“One Facebook group titled ‘Stay Out of Roseburg’ had over 800 likes in only a few hours. The Heirs of Patrick Henry, another OR-based patriot group, is already planning a rally the morning of Obama’s visit, with the express purpose of making it known loud and clear that the President is not welcome in Roseburg.” \nThe power of social media was in fast-forward and picking up speed. Lange wrote that within 36 hours, “…23,000 people have been invited on Facebook alone, not counting emails, Twitter, and other social media. Watching the incoming links on PHS yesterday, I counted no less than 26 various patriot, gun, and prepper forums who were discussing it. Almost 2,500 people are listed as ‘going’ on Facebook with another 1,000 as ‘maybe.’ A search on Facebook for posts about the rally net an astronomical number of results.” \nThe protest resulted in several hundred pro-gun rights citizens who let the president know he was not welcome: \nBrrrrummmm, brrrrummmm!

What is so unusual about it? It's designed to be a futuristic ghost town. Why? Pegasus Global Holdings, a telecommunications and tech firm, is planning on building a full-scale American town where researchers can test experiments like a driverless car in a human-free environment \nAccording to a report in the UK Daily Mail, telecommunications and tech firm Pegasus Global Holdings is building the town so researchers can develop technologies for modern living. The investors hope to open the town by 2018. \n\"CITE will include a town big enough for 35,000 people, with a business district downtown surrounded by terraced housing suburbs – but no one will ever live there. \n\"Instead, companies will have the opportunity to test such innovations as driverless vehicles and natural disaster-proof homes in a human-free, practically risk-free, environment.\" \nRead more about it here . \nLike discovering gold! \nThe Conservative Chat blog has compiled a helpful list of Congressional members' Twitter addresses.
