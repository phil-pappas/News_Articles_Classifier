(Photo: JOURNAL NEWS FILE PHOTO) Buy Photo \nRe \" Rockland's Summit Park deal falls through ,\" Oct. 1 article: \nI was disgusted and saddened when I read an article saying Rockland's Summit Park nursing home complex sale fell apart , when it really didn't, did it? I think people were lead to believe that the buyer was ill-prepared to take over on the scheduled date. However, it was evident from this article that it was Ed Day that was dragging his feet. The intent of this letter is not to join the finger-pointing, but to address the real issue at hand and that is the lives of one of our most vulnerable populations, the elderly. \nI have been visiting Summit Park on a daily basis since the beginning of September when my mother was admitted there. Over the course of the past 10 years my mother has been in other nursing care facilities and hospitals in New York City and in Westchester County. As her daughter, I have had a great deal of experience advocating in systems that fall far short when it comes to providing care. Summit Park has by far surpassed the standards of care experienced with these other facilities. \nI have been overwhelmed with gratitude for the care she has been receiving despite the hush of uncertainty that hangs in the hallways. It would be a real disservice to the people of Rockland County by Rockland County Executive Ed Day, the LDC and Rockland Deputy Commissioner of Hospitals David Freed if Summit Park has to close its doors when there is still a viable and interested buyer, Shalom Braunstein , Sympaticare's owner who has publicly stated that he is still willing to go through with the purchase . \nI am disappointed, saddened and at a loss as to what my course of action should be on my mother's behalf, and that is the real issue at hand. \nAnn Ward Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1LfNxkf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:42:39.641+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
