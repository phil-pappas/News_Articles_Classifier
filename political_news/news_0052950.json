Tarfusser said a hearing would be held Jan. 18 to assess if evidence against Al Mahdi is strong enough to merit putting him on trial.\nAl Mahdi is the first suspect in the court’s custody charged with the war crime of deliberately attacking religious or historical monuments.\nThe entire city of Timbuktu in Mali, a historic center of Islamic learning, is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Islamic radicals overran the city in 2012 and destroyed 14 of Timbuktu’s 16 mausoleums, one-room structures that house the tombs of the city’s great thinkers. The extremists condemned the buildings as totems of idolatry. The 14 mausoleums have since been restored by the United Nations.\nThe ICC said it issued an arrest warrant for Al Mahdi on Sept. 18 and he was sent to the court over the weekend by authorities in Niger. But the court hasn’t said anything about the circumstances of his arrest.\nRights groups welcomed Al Mahdi’s arrest, but urged prosecutors to file more charges against him.\nIn a statement, a group of human rights organizations said that they filed a criminal complaint in Mali earlier this year against Al Mahdi and 14 other people, accusing them of crimes including rape, sexual slavery and forced marriage.\n“So we do believe that it is very important for the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to take into account the credible evidence that has been provided within the national system,” said Carrie Comer of the International Federation for Human Rights.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:46:54.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
