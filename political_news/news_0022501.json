Rand Paul on Saturday won the straw poll at a major libertarian gathering, with Sen. Ted Cruz coming in a close second. The poll, held at the Republican Liberty Caucus convention in Nashua, N.H., allowed attendees to vote for multiple candidates -- an effort to show which candidates would earn the approval of libertarian voters.\nPaul, the Kentucky senator and libertarian-leaning Republican, was voted the \"most-preferred\" presidential candidate, pulling in 57 percent of the vote. Cruz, of Texas, came away with 51.2 percent of the vote, meaning that both candidates were considered acceptable by more than half of those who voted.\nThe two candidates at the RLC, which endorsed Ron Paul in 2012, were separated by only 46 votes out of about 800 cast.\nThe Paul campaign insisted that the Cruz campaign bussed in supporters and still fell short in the poll, a charge the Cruz campaign denied. However, it was clear from the convention that both campaigns had organized heavily for the event, and Cruz and Paul were the only major candidates in attendance.\nNo one else came close to cracking 50 percent: in third place was Ben Carson with 18 percent, followed by Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio at about 10 percent. Donald Trump registered 7 percent.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:59:11.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
