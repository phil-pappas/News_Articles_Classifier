Perhaps aware of how his remark would be interpreted by a tea leaf-reading media, Biden quickly followed up. \"That's a joke! That's a joke! That's a joke! Thank you,\" he said. Biden and Clinton both ran against President Barack Obama in 2008 and served side-by-side in the first term of his administration. Pundits and strategists are parsing every utterance of Biden to learn whether he will launch a third bid for the Democratic nomination. People close to Biden have said he's weighing a potential 2016 bid while still grieving the loss of his son, Beau, with a decision expected soon. Sources told CNN he is expected to make his decision after a \"family conversation\" this weekend in Delaware. CNN's Gloria Borger contributed to this report. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Race to the White House More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:28:35.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
