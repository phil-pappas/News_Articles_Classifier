In it, Ms. Nguyen calls on South Korean President Park Geun-hye to acknowledge her assault and to formally apologize to her and the thousands of women like her on behalf of the South Korean government. President Park's father, former President Park Chung -hee, served as South Korea's president during the Vietnam War, during which hundreds of thousands of Korean troops were deployed.\nFormer Congressman Anh (Joseph) Cao of Louisiana , the first Vietnamese-American member of Congress, and Cyndi Nguyen , Executive Director of VIET New Orleans, will serve as co-chairs of Voices of Vietnam and its efforts.\n\"Even forty years later, the legacy of the Vietnam War is powerfully alive in the memories of those affected by it. This is particularly true for the thousands of Vietnamese women who were raped and sexually assaulted by South Korean soldiers. We are proud to join with these women, to share their stories of survival, to amplify their calls for recognition and acceptance, and to get them the apology they deserve,\" Ms. Nguyen said.\nDuring the Vietnam War, South Korean troops raped and sexually assaulted thousands of Vietnamese women across the country. Many of these women bore children as a result of their assault. These women and their children, the Con Lai Dai Han, have faced many challenges in the decades that followed. The South Korean government has never formally acknowledged what happened to these women.\nVisitors to the website are encouraged to watch and share their own stories of survival, adding to the catalogue of testimonies from across the country.\nFor more information, please visit www.VietnamVoices.org\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276124\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276123LOGO\n releases/voices-of-vietnam-launches-to-raise-awareness-of-south-koreas-vietnam-war-sex-assault-victims-300158224.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/voices-of-vietnam-launches-to-raise-awareness-of-south-koreas-vietnam-war-sex-assault-victims-300158224.html", "https://www.change.org/p/president-park-geun-hye-apologize-for-the-systemic-rape-of-vietnamese-women-during-the-vietnam-war", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC26017&Transmission_Id=201510121741PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC26017&DateId=20151012", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151012/276123LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276124", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151012/276123LOGO", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151012/276124", "http://www.vietnamvoices.org/"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:06:56.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
