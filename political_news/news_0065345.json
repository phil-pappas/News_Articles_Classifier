Mitch McConnell is guarded. McCarthy engineered a rapid ascent through the House of Representatives, buoyed by his close relationships with colleagues, a genial persona and a bit of luck. McConnell is a lifelong Senate creature who clinched his dream of majority leader last fall, and sometimes has left even his allies guessing as to his thinking.\nThe 50-year-old from Bakersfield is a prolific Instagram user who invites both Democrats and Republicans for long bike rides and pals around with actor Kevin Spacey. The 73-year-old from Louisville is a voracious history bookworm who likes to tailgate with longtime friends at University of Louisville football games.\nThe two men with diametrically different personalities and styles are about to begin one of the most important relationships in Washington, tasked with ensuring the GOP-led Capitol can present a unified front against President Barack Obama while trying to lead two chambers that inherently clash with one another.\nFiorina faces tough slog on Capitol Hill By Burgess Everett and Lauren French\n“Kevin is very, very outgoing, loves to meet people, loves to engage, loves to be able to talk to people,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a former House member. “And McConnell’s very, very close to the vest. That’s no big secret there. He’s extremely careful but also doesn’t talk about a lot of direction or agenda.”\nThe two top Republicans haven’t had much direct personal contact so far, according to lawmakers and aides. That’s chiefly by design, since it was outgoing Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and McConnell who’ve so far led the communication and coordination between the two chambers.\nBut that’s about to change, as McCarthy faces little more than token opposition to become the next House speaker amid a major GOP leadership scramble set off by Boehner’s surprise resignation announcement last week.\n“I do know Kevin,” McConnell told reporters on Tuesday. “We have a good relationship, and obviously I and [other Republican leaders] will be working with whatever team the House ultimately selects.”\nWith Boehner, McConnell had a partner who shared similar broad goals and challenges: a pragmatist who liked to cut deals and get things done, even while facing a loud and restive conservative flank. McConnell has learned to maneuver around those hard-right forces, helped in part by the Senate’s institutional rules and loyal allies, while those same conservative forces helped trigger Boehner’s decision to step down at the end of October.\nBut McCarthy has made no secret that he would like to be more confrontational when it comes to the Senate. Months ago, McCarthy began advocating abolition of the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance most bills – a move McConnell, a consummate institutionalist, opposes. And in his bid to succeed Boehner, McCarthy has pledged to take a more aggressive approach toward the Senate, reflecting the unhappiness among House Republicans when it comes to the other end of the Capitol.\nThose promises may preview an even bigger collision between the House and the Senate for the rest of this Congress if and when McCarthy takes over as speaker.\nHouse and Senate Republicans kicked off the 114th Congress emphasizing unity with a joint retreat in Hershey, Pennsylvania. But already this year, the two chambers have clashed on strategy and policy in a winter showdown over Department of Homeland Security funding and an extension of national security surveillance laws.\nEven bigger challenges are awaiting Congress later this fall. Lawmakers temporarily staved off a government shutdown on Wednesday, but merely punted the fight to mid-December when they will have to resolve even bigger battles over federal spending.\nBoehner is beginning the negotiations with the White House and other congressional leaders on a potential two-year budget deal, but McCarthy will likely have to take over the Ohio Republican’s slot in those discussions. The debt limit will have to be raised sometime later this year, too, although that could happen while Boehner is still speaker.\nShutdown fight pushed to December By Lauren French and Seung Min Kim\nThe Boehner resignation has unleashed an outpouring of House frustrations against McConnell, who is in no risk of losing his job but could bear the brunt of conservative angst once Boehner leaves. As the House’s top Republican, McCarthy will almost certainly be under continuous pressure from the right to take a firmer stand against the Senate.\n“We have to be realistic about what’s achievable and what’s promised to be done and what can actually be done,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). “If I were to advise Kevin on that, I would advise him to be cautious to make sure that you don’t overpromise something that you’re only going to be able to underdeliver.”\nThough he doesn’t yet know McConnell well, what will help McCarthy is his long-standing relationships with many others in the Senate.\nHe has particularly tight alliances with several of this year’s Senate GOP freshmen who are former House members, including Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lankford and Capito, who was on McCarthy’s whip team in the House. McCarthy is also close to John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 3 Senate Republican.\n“That relationship, I think, will build,” Thune said Wednesday. “They maybe haven’t worked together as much as Boehner and McConnell obviously have but Kevin is a very personable, easy to work with guy.”\nSen. Dean Heller of Nevada and McCarthy were both in the House GOP freshman class of 2006 and became friends even before they were sworn in. Even with Heller’s promotion to the Senate and McCarthy’s rise through the leadership ranks, the two have kept up their friendship through regular workouts at the House gym (Heller likes weightlifting and the treadmill, while McCarthy rides stationary bikes and participates in P90X sessions) and socializing with their wives.\nMcConnell and McCarthy “are very, very different people,” said Heller, who met with McCarthy in his House office earlier Wednesday. “But I know Kevin and I know Mitch also, and these are individuals that really want results in what they are doing.”\nTheir lives before being elected to Congress have some parallel tracks. Both are former Hill aides — McConnell interned for Sen. John Sherman Cooper and then served as chief legislative assistant to Sen. Marlow Cook, both Kentucky Republicans.\nAnd McCarthy was district director for former Rep. Bill Thomas, the longtime California Republican who also served as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\nBecause of his experience with Thomas, “I think Kevin has that understanding of what it’s like to work in tandem with someone who is an institutionalist, who has that kind of deep experience,” said Erica Elliott, McCarthy’s former communications director who is now at Franklin Square Capital Partners.\nScalise looks to show strength ahead of elections By Jake Sherman\nStill, it’s clear McCarthy will face new challenges in dealing with the Senate, particularly after advocating abolition of the filibuster and promising a more aggressive posture. Senators are never eager to hear suggestions from the House on how to operate their chamber, while House lawmakers are often impatient with the plodding pace of the Senate.\nWhen asked about McCarthy’s push to get rid of the 60-vote threshold for most legislation, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, the upper chamber’s second-ranking Republican, responded: “My experience is that the House recommending to the Senate how we should do our business is about as welcome as Senate recommendations for the House.”\n“I wish him well. We need to show that we can responsibly govern, and he’s obviously got his hands full,” Cornyn added. “But I like him and I have confidence in him.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:25:33.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
