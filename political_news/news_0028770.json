He said that people used to eat meat in Vedic period also and there is proof of it in the ancient texts.\n\"I don't understand the point of making it so much of a big deal. Vedik scriptures are evident of Hindu saints and sadhus eating beef in ancient times,\" he said.\nThe veteran RJD leader went on to say that the consumption of beef reduced with the rise of Buddhism and it was the latter that advocated against cow slaughter.\nCondemning the remarks made by Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, Union Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Giriraj Singh on Saturday said that the \"whole clan of RJD has gone mad.\"\n\"I am very much hurt by hearing this statement of Raghuvansh Prasad. I think all this spoken as a well thought strategy made by Lalau Prasad Yadav and Nitish Kumar. Whatever he is speaking is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated,\" Singh told ANI.\n\"I think Lalu and his party leaders are making these kinds of statements just for the sake of votes. I think the whole clan of RJD has gone mad,\" he added.\nWith inputs from ANI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:09:47.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
