He said it was more like “an enablement”: “She had attacks. She just swatted ‘em away like a bunch of irritating flies. Except that’s not what happened. She didn’t face one challenge. She didn’t face anything remotely serious. So all of you people in the Drive-Bys clapping your hands and saying, ‘Wow, what a great performance! Man, Hillary’s back!’ ( Free audio )” \nIn a surprise move, Clinton’s opponent Bernie Sanders said during the debate that the former Secretary of State’s “email scandal” wasn’t important. But Limbaugh said that Democratic donors “are really worried about this e-mail.” \nHe added, however, that in terms of national security risks, the president himself is the biggest on facing America: “I think Barack Obama’s our number one national security problem or risk, whether by accident, by design. I don’t know what else you’d call somebody who enables the Iranians to nuke up and then sees to it they end up with $150 billion to do with whatever they want, including buy new Boeing airliners and go out and sponsor terrorism in the Middle East. It doesn’t give me a whole lot of confidence in what’s going on with Syria and the fact that Putin and Russia are making a move on the entire Middle East. … I think it’s rich claiming that Hillary hasn’t posed any national security problems, when he is it, the number one risk, if you ask me. ( Free audio )” \nMichael Savage \nThis week, Savage told listeners about a moving experience he’d had before Tuesday’s show: “Last night was the memorial for my brother’s death. He died many years ago. My silent brother. … My brother, who never spoke and who allegedly couldn’t hear, taught me a great many things. … He taught me how to communicate with the silent. He taught be how to communicate with him, and as a result, I learned how to communicate with animals and how to communicate with audiences.” \nThe roles were reversed when Savage appeared as a guest on Richard D. Baris’s talk show to discuss his new book, “ Government Zero: No Borders, No Language, No Culture .” \n“Much of the various criticisms of Michael Savage leveled by the left and, indeed, by some on the right, have more than implied a level of pessimism is the core of his on-air content and written works,” Baris said. “Yet, within minutes of our one-and-one conversation, it quickly became apparent that these criticisms are unfounded. In fact, he is undoubtedly an optimist, which is what one should expect from a conservative who genuinely believes progressive philosophy and policy are so fundamentally flawed that they are self-defeating.” \nAaron Klein \nKlein brought back memories of Bill Clinton’s “bimbo eruptions” from the 1990s, with Gennifer Flowers speaking out in an exclusive interview for the first time since Hillary announced her campaign. \nFlowers called Hillary’s bid to run in part on women’s issues “a joke.” She accused Hillary of being “an enabler that has encouraged him (Bill) to go out and do whatever he does with women.” \nFlowers revealed for the first time that she has incriminating evidence about Bill Clinton locked in a safe deposit box, which she’s used to “ensure her safety.” \nThen, live from Israel, Klein reported on the new Palestinian “wave of terror,” and who is really behind it. \nListen to Aaron Klein’s show every week on radio (AM 970 The Answer in NY; NewsTalk 990 AM in Philly) or online . \nMark Levin \n“This administration is disgusting,” Levin said, adding, “This president is an anti-Semite. It reeks in this entire administration.” \nLevin pointed to the White House’s official statement on the new wave of violence in Israel, which made it sound as if Jews were killing Palestinians rather than the other way around ( Free audio ). \n“I think the next speaker should be Mark Levin,” GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz said in Iowa on Monday. A campaign aide later told the National Review that it “was just an off-the-cuff remark at a campaign event,” but the magazine noted that “Levin has a lot of fans among the kind of highly-motivated conservatives most likely to turn out on a January day and spend hours caucusing.” \nHowever, National Review added, Levin seems to lean towards supporting Donald Trump: “I’m not endorsing anybody as you well know, but the fact of the matter is I like the way this guy talks,” Levin told his listeners in August. \nLaura Ingraham \nVeteran reporter Mark Halperin told Ingraham that other Washington reporters just don’t understand the appeal of GOP candidates like Trump and Dr. Ben Carson. \nHalperin said that the establishment favorites – Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Chris Christie – are seen as “out-of-touch elites who don’t spend enough time talking to real people or things from any perspective but the most wealthy and elite people they hang out with.” \n“I meet Trump supporters all the time in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Halperin added, and “from their point of view, the country is broken, Washington is broken and they say, ‘You know what, if the guy is boorish or the guy’s loud or if the guy’s politically incorrect, either I like that or I can deal with that. I can accept those warts because I know that electing a career politician is not going to change a thing.’ ( Free audio )” \nIngraham’s other guests this week included Thomas Sowell (“The problem with Jeb Bush is that he has received publicity, unlike the other candidates”); and Gov. Chris Christie, who defended his low poll numbers while expressing his views on rival Donald Trump ( Free audio ). \nGlenn Beck \nOscar-winning actor Jon Voight joined Beck to talk about the 1960s, when, he says, American values were “turned upside down.” \nVoight witnessed this first hand in Hollywood during that era, when he was still a liberal. “It was a very disturbing period of time,” Voight said. “The left moved in, and when I say the left, I mean Marxism.” Text smaller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:46:28.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
