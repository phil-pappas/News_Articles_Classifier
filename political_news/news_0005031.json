He urged each member of the audience to bring three people to the polls in the upcoming election. They don’t even have to vote for him, he said. It is imperative to elect non-politicians who will help change the current fiscal course the United States is on, he said. “We’ve got to get responsible people into office,” he said. The country is now $18-plus trillion in debt, he said. If the country paid down the debt by $10 million a day, it would take over 5,000 years to pay the debt off. Because the debt is so high, Carson said, the Federal Reserve is almost forced to keep interest rates at record low rates as way for the federal government to afford the service of the debt. If interest rates were to rise to normal levels, the cost to service the debt would increase to about $800 billion to $1 trillion a year, he said. Yet the debt does not take into consideration the fiscal divide, he said. The fiscal divide — the amount of money owed for future liabilities, like Medicare, Medicaid and social security — and expected revenues, he said. “Our fiscal gap stands at $200 trillion,” Carson said. The only reason the U.S. is able to continue to keep all this debt and future debt is because people worldwide accept the U.S. dollar. If that changes, the country would face a worse crisis than the Great Depression, he said. Carson told the crowd, a mix of all ages including many UNH students, that education is the key to change and spoke of his own educational transformation. He spoke of how he went from a class dunce to a neurosurgeon. People in class used to call him “Dummy,” he said, because if Carson was in the class, his classmates knew he would get the lowest scores on the tests. What helped change his educational direction, he said, was a student television quiz show, “College Bowl,” which he wanted to be on. He worked to learn the topics of the show on his own, and he credited his knowledge of classical composers he learned for the show to help gain entry as a student in the competitive John Hopkins School of Medicine. Carson, 64, then went on to practice at John Hopkins Hospital, in Baltimore, Md. He has since retired. “Education is the great divide in this country,” he said. “Education is the thing that really liberates.” He urged the crowd to not let differences between people to divide them. \"We need to stop allowing ourselves from being divided,\" Carson said. “We are not Republicans first or Democrats first. We are Americans first.” Carson took only four questions during hour-long town hall event. One question was from 23-year-old Rye resident Tyler McFarland who asked if Carson believed in climate change or evolution. “Is there climate change? Of course there is,” Carson said. The temperature of the earth is always fluctuating, he said. “When that stops happening, we’re in big trouble,” he said. He also said he believes in microevolution or natural selection, and believed God gave organisms the ability to adapt to the environment, “because he is very smart,” he said. Though this is only Carson’s fourth trip to the state since he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination in May, he is in second place in state polls. In a poll released earlier last week conducted by the UNH Survey Center, Carson came in at 8 percent behind Donald Trump’s 26 percent. The poll’s margin of error is 5.3 percent. Carson is also in second place in national polls. A Bloomberg poll last week had Carson at 16 percent behind Trump’s 21 percent.
