A source close to the Labour leader said he had \"no idea\" what he would be wearing.\nA spokesman for Mr Corbyn later played down his decision not to attend the Privy Council.\n\"Although Jeremy was unavailable for today's meeting, he has confirmed he will be joining the Privy Council,\" the spokesman said .\n\"As the Prime Minister and others did, it is far from unusual to miss the first meeting due to other commitments.\"\nAccording to Cabinet Office records, Mr Cameron was made a privy counsellor shortly after becoming Conservative leader in December 2005, but was not sworn in for another three months.\nConstitutional expert David Rogers - who has written a forthcoming book: By Royal Appointment: Tales from the Privy Council - said while a member could be sworn in by an Order in Council, they had only been used when the individual concerned was physically unable to attend.\n\"I have never come across a case where an Order in Council has been made so somebody can become a privy counsellor because they didn't want to go to the meeting,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.\nThe Queen held the Privy Council meeting at Buckingham Palace at 5.30pm.\nShare article Among those present was the Leader of the House of Commons Christopher Grayling, Paymaster General Matthew Hancock, Business Secretary Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd the Energy and Climate change Secretary.\nThe MPs James Brokenshire and Gisela Stuart were sworn in as members of the Privy Council.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-08T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:47:31.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
