Western countries by their nature stand for democracy and against dictatorship, as democratic culture emanated from the West.When rebellions erupted in Syria against the regime of President Bashar Assad, the greatest expectation of the Syrian people was acquiring concrete support from the U.S. for their righteous rebellion. Indeed, at the beginnings of the Syrian mass protests, the U.S. provided such support for the Syrian people.As a member of NATO, Turkey in its policies on Syria both took part in the Western alliance and produced concrete theses that also involved its allies. After the resolute message, which derived from the conference of the Friends of Syria attended by then U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and Prime Minister Ahmet Davudoğlu while he was foreign minister, political developments seemed to convince all sides of the conflict to work toward a resolution of the civil war in favor of democratic forces in Syria and gave hope for the oppressed Syrian people. Now, in the face of the present situation, I wonder about the feelings of policy makers in the U.S. and Europe.Strictly speaking, U.S. foreign policy constantly weakened Ankara, one of its principal allies in the region, with its meaningless and irresolute policies on Syria. Indeed, it was plainly understood when Russia started bombings in Syria that the U.S. enfeebled not only Turkey's standing in the Middle East, but also the very NATO that it led.An expert on foreign policy who was the principal consultant on U.S. President Barrack Obama's Syrian policies recently published an article on the subject. In order to grasp the deadlock of U.S.'s Syrian policies and the contradictions hidden in the given process, it is enough to read this article conscientiously.It is mindboggling that from the very first days of the Syrian civil war, the foreign policy applications of the United States followed step by step the policies and mind games of Iran on Syria. Such an unbelievable attitude necessarily implied the following question: Is the United States forming an alliance with Iran instead of Turkey, a fellow member of the NATO?In the first year of the Syrian opposition movement, the Syrian regime was weakened and the Free Syrian Army was strong enough to take over the government on behalf of the Syrian people. In this initial phase, no foreign fighters existed in Syria and no one was talking about either al-Qaida, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) or any other fundamentalist organization. In order to complete the transition to a democratically elected government and prepare the ground for the construction of a democratic Syria, it was enough to acquire a moderate support from the Friends of Syria.The first trick that Iran and Russia played against the Western mind was the game of al-Qaida. Arguing for al-Qaida's prospective replacement of the Assad regime was the principal trick of Iran, and Western powers easily took the bait.When the Syrian regime experienced another danger of collapse, Hezbollah from the West and ISIS from the East simultaneously began to fight against the oppositional forces. Both of these organizations aimed at protecting the Assad regime from the opposition. Certain Western powers, Iran and the old Jacobins in Turkey have shoulder by shoulder initiated a campaign of disgrace against the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) and its leader, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Kurdish politicians who were oppressed by the traditional regime in Turkey and then treated justly during the AK Party's time in power participated in this alliance. They have become the enemy of Erdoğan, who enlarged their spaces of freedom and the partners of those that oppressed them for the last 40 years.When ISIS, which is an alliance of various intelligence organizations, emerged, Russia and Iran's hands were strengthened for dominating the lands of Syria.In the initial phase of the Syrian civil war, Iran and Russia waged war against the Syrian people at the risk of triggering a World War III in order to rescue Assad.Obama's policies and his irresolute attitude on Syria involuntarily and unconsciously enfeebled Turkey and NATO vis-a-vis Russia and Iran. I genuinely wonder if the policy makers in the U.S. truly grasp the magnitude of such a wrongdoing in Syria and the damage inflicted to their very allies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:58:12.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
