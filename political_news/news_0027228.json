RBI said the existing requirement of investments being made in G-sec, including state development loans with a minimum residual maturity of three years will continue.\nLimits for the residual period of the current financial year would be increased in two tranches from October 12, 2015 and January 1, 2016. Each tranche would entail an increase in limits by Rs 13,000 crore.\nThe report said once the Rs 13,000 crore FPI limit opens, flows will spread across the yield curve though short-end curve outperformed in the past fortnight.\nThe G-sec yield curve will gradually shift downwards. \"While the benchmark 10-year bond may remain around 7.5 per cent during this week, other parts of the curve may see further softening of yields in the range of 4-5 basis points,\" the report said.\nThe central bank also said there will be separate limit for investment by FPIs in the state development loans (SDLs), which will be increased in phases to reach 2 per cent of the outstanding stock by March 2018.\nThe rating agency said FPI investment in SDLs (Rs 3500 crore) will be gradual and may benefit certain states, initially. It further said industrial production for August is likely to have remained weak at 4.3 per cent, given decelerating exports and a lack of corporate investment demand.\n\"While month-on-month inflation may increase, we believe that retail inflation for September at 3.9 per cent will undershoot the RBI's projection of 4.5 per cent for the month,\" the report said. The rating agency sees rupee gaining further on the release of the first tranche of g-sec limit under the FPI framework this week.\n\"The rupee after posting 1.2 per cent gains last week is set to gain further towards 64.5 in our view,\" it said.\nHowever, further gains in the short-term may be capped on RBI reserves build-up, and may be affected from the potential weakness in equity-linked FPIs on weaker corporate earnings, the report said.\n business Economics FPI Also Read India needs Rs 7000 crore for block-level sports infrastructure HTC records Q2 losses, plans to cut global jobs by 15 per cent German Tourism Board holds roadshows in Kerala Lufthansa pilots extend strike to long-haul services", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/business-economics/article/fpi-framework-alleviate-hot-money-outflows-issues-irr-report", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/money-rupee_2_0_0_0_0_1_0_0.jpg", "https://www.indiaratings.co.in/", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/money-rupee_2_0_0_0_0_1_0_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:06:51.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
