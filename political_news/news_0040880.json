Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 21, 2015 The speech Biden gave at the Rose Garden with his wife, Jill, and President Barack Obama at his side was an acknowledgement that his career in public service is coming to a close. In light of a long career that reached the vice presidency, but fell short of the Oval Office, Democrats are dolling out the praise.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders released this statement: \"I thank the vice president for a lifetime of public service and for all that he has done for our nation. I look forward to continuing to work with him to address the major crises we face. He understands the need to rebuild the middle class; and to address income and wealth inequality, a corrupt campaign finance system, climate change, racial justice, immigration reform and the need for publicly-funded higher education.\"\nadvertisement Sanders' top adviser, Tad Devine, said Biden's decision has no impact on his campaign.\n\"It's not going to change what we're doing. We've laid out a path toward the nomination, and the path Bernie Sanders has revolves around his message, and revolves around the campaign we're building in Iowa and New Hampshire. Had Biden gotten in, there would be no deviation from what we're doing now,\" Devine told NBC News.\nAccording to polling data, Clinton is likely to be the most immediate benefactor of Biden's decision not to run. In the latest NBC/WSJ poll, Hillary's lead over Sanders is 20 points with Biden in the race (49%-29%) and 25 points without him (58%-33%).\nDemocrats in Washington also praised the vice president, including leadership in the House who took to twitter.\nadvertisement . @VP Biden is an all-American patriot and a middle-class warrior!\n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) October 21, 2015\nI'm proud of @JoeBiden .
