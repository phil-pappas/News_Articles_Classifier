Voters will be asked the question If the New Zealand flag changes, which flag would you prefer? \nThey’ll be asked to rank the five alternative flag designs selected through the Flag Consideration Process from those suggested by the public. \n\"On your voting paper, you will be asked to rank the alternative flag options - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - in the order you prefer them,\" says Mr Peden. \"Write a \"1\" in the box of the flag option you prefer most. Put a \"2\" in the box of the option you prefer next, and so on. You can rank as many or as few flag options as you wish, but you shouldn’t skip a number or use the same number more than once.\" \nIn March 2016, there will be another referendum to choose between the most preferred option from the first referendum and the current flag. The flag that receives the most votes in the second referendum will be the official flag of New Zealand. \n\"People need to make sure that they are enrolled and that their details are up to date now, as only those correctly enrolled will receive their voting papers,\" says Mr Peden. \"Check your details now - it’s easy. You can do it online or at your local PostShop. And if you’re not enrolled, you need to do it now.\" \nEnrolment forms are available from the elections website www.elections.org.nz, freephone 0800 36 76 56, by Freetexting your name and address to 3676, or from any PostShop. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:14:59.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
