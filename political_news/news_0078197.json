(AP) â€” A California agency is expected to consider a $100 million proposal by SeaWorld for a major expansion of the tanks its uses to hold killer whales in San Diego.\nThe plan is opposed by animal rights activists who say breeding the animals in captivity is cruel.\nIt is set to be reviewed Thursday by the California Coastal Commission, which has been flooded by tens of thousands of emails against the project.\nAnimal rights activists say bigger tanks will pave the way for more orca breeding and represent a marketing ploy to boost plummeting attendance at the marine theme park.\nOrlando, Florida-based SeaWorld says the orca population at the San Diego facility would not significantly increase if the project is approved and opens in 2018.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
