(AP Photo/David J. Phillip)\nAssociated Press Oct. 12, 2015 | 5:36 p.m. EDT + More By KRISTIE RIEKEN, AP Sports Writer\nHOUSTON (AP) â€” Astros shortstop Carlos Correa couldn't handle a deflected grounder that might have been a double-play ball, helping the Kansas City Royals rally for five runs in the eighth inning to beat Houston 9-6 Monday and force their playoff series to a decisive Game 5.\nCorrea homered twice, doubled, singled and drove in four runs in Game 4 of the AL Division Series. Houston took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but a tough error charged to the 21-year-old rookie keyed the Royals' comeback to even the matchup at two games apiece.\nGame 5 will be back in Kansas City on Wednesday night.\nLate in the game, a tweet from the account of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott congratulated the Astros on advancing to the AL Championship Series.\nBut the defending AL champion Royals had other ideas.\nKansas City opened the eighth with five straight singles off relievers Will Harris and Tony Sipp, with RBI hits by Lorenzo Cain and Eric Hosmer making it 6-4 and leaving the bases with no outs.\nKendrys Morales followed with a hard, one-bouncer off Sipp's glove. The ball took two more hops and glanced off the top of Correa's mitt, rolling into center field as two runs scored to tie it at 6.\nAlex Gordon's RBI groundout off Luke Gregerson later in the inning put Kansas City ahead.\nHosmer launched a long, two-run homer in the ninth for insurance.\nRyan Madson (1-0) allowed two runs in the seventh and still got the win. Wade Davis pitched two scoreless innings for his second save.\nSipp took the loss.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
