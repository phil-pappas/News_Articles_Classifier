Unpaid tax balances accrue statutory interest at the rate of 1.5 percent per month. Thus, less tax due means less interest due until the taxpayer can pay the balance.\n\"If you owe taxes, you don't need to wait to pay in full,\" Pappas said. \"Pay what you can now and ease your way to final payment. But finish paying before your unpaid bill has to be sent to possible auction at the Tax Sale.\"\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cook-county-treasurers-office-accepts-partial-property-tax-payments-on-website-300153467.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC18652&Transmission_Id=201510050700PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC18652&DateId=20151005", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cook-county-treasurers-office-accepts-partial-property-tax-payments-on-website-300153467.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:47:01.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
