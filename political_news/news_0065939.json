As outrage mounted nationally, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, criticized San Francisco's sheriff, saying that suspect Juan Francisco Sanchez-Lopez should have been detained. \nSanchez-Lopez says he found the gun under a bench on the pier, and it accidently fired when he picked it up. \n\"All of us in this room agree that the death of Kathryn Steinle was senseless and tragic, but what many of us disagree on is the role — if any — that San Francisco's existing sanctuary and due-process-for-all\" ordinances played in the event, Supervisor Malia Cohen said to cheers from the crowd that gathered for the meeting. \nSupervisors said they wouldn't let hateful commentary undermine a long-standing policy that improves public safety and embraces immigrants. \n\"I'm so proud of San Francisco,\" Supervisor David Campos, who co-sponsored the nonbinding resolution, said after the vote. \"I'm so proud that notwithstanding the climate at the national level of scapegoating immigrants that San Francisco went against that.\" \nRoy Beck, director of NumbersUSA, which calls for limiting immigration, said it's frightening that supervisors sided with immigrants who are in the country illegally — even violent ones — rather than public safety. \nSan Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city in 1989, passing an ordinance that bans city officials from enforcing immigration laws or asking about immigration status unless required by law or court order. A follow-up ordinance in 2013 allows detention only under a court order targeting violent felons. \nSan Francisco and other cities and counties have routinely ignored requests from ICE to keep people in custody. The jurisdictions say they can't hold arrestees beyond their scheduled release dates without probable cause. \nHowever, more than half of the roughly 340 jurisdictions that previously declined to cooperate with ICE are now doing so in some form, as long as they don't have to keep immigrants in custody. \nThe shift came after outreach by federal immigration officials and several high-profile cases, including the one in San Francisco. \nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said on Tuesday through a spokeswoman that the unanimous vote by the board validates his policy. \nSupervisors voted to table another resolution urging the sheriff to revoke a department-wide memo prohibiting communication between his staff and federal immigration authorities, saying it would send the wrong message to people living in the city illegally.
