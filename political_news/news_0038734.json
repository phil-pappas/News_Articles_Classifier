Finkelstein & Associates. It concluded that the way Nagorno-Karabakh pervades \"all aspects of politics and government\" in Azerbaijan makes it an electoral issue the West struggles to understand.\nThe Opinionway poll, like the Finkelstein survey, also reported a clear vote of confidence in Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev . Although not taking part in these elections, he received the highest possible rating according to both Opinionway (78.8 per cent) and Finkelstein (82.1 per cent).\nThe French firm conducted a survey of 1,200 registered voters, quizzing them on a broad range of issues. Asked \"which political force do you intend to support during the Parliamentary elections?\" more than 70 per cent answered with the \"party in power or candidate from pro-governmental party\". This trend, if continued on to the November 1 st election day , would translate as a huge win for the New Azerbaijan Party.\nIt also forecast a strong turn-out, with 63 percent of respondents saying they will \"certainly participate\" in the elections.\nBoth polls found voters to be comfortable with the economic situation in their nation despite the continuing impact of low oil and gas prices. The Opinionway poll found just nine per cent of respondents believe the economic situation in Azerbaijan is getting worse while 54 per cent believe things are getting better.\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=enUK201510203406&Transmission_Id=201510210230PR_NEWS_USPR_____enUK201510203406&DateId=20151021", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:26:32.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
