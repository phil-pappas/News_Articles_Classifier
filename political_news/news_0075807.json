The media would be up in arms. He could not get away quietly with such remarks. It seems that if you're John Kerry, a Democrat, a former Senator, and the current Secretary of State, you can suggest that if one does not hold to the politically correct environmental position on climate change (aka, global warming), it is so outlandish that one is no longer qualified to be a candidate for higher office. No one in the media would bling an eye at this remark. \nAt the opening session of the Climate and Clean Energy Investment Forum this week, Senator Kerry actually said that if you don't believe in climate change you are disqualifying yourself from running for higher office in this country. \nreported by State.gov : \n“ [W]hen I hear a United States senator say, ‘I’m not a scientist so I can’t make a judgment,’ or a candidate for president for that matter, I’m absolutely astounded. I mean, it’s incomprehensible that a grownup who has been to high school and college in the United States of America disqualifies themselves because they’re not a scientist when they’ve learned that the Earth rotates on its axis but they’re not a scientist; where they’ve learned that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west and it does so 24 hours a day; and you can run the list of things that we know science tells us happens, and we accept it every single day. And to suggest that when more than 6,000-plus peer-reviewed studies of the world’s best scientists all lay out that this is happening and mankind is contributing to it, it seems to me that they disqualify themselves fundamentally from high public office with those kinds of statements. And I think the American people will decide that this year, because the American people are overwhelmingly in favor of doing something about climate change.” \nI don't know about you, but I will not select the presidential candidate I vote for based on what he or she believes on climate change. Despite Mr. Kerry's assertion, climate change is NOT the issue that will determine who is going to be our next president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:01:13.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
