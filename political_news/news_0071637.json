There are good reasons to keep it.\nStill, 41 percent of U.S. households only have a wireless phone , according to a study that came out last year from the National Center of Health Statistics.\nIf you're looking for reasons to keep or ditch your landline, let's spell out some of the pros and cons.\nCon: Landlines can be expensive . According to CostHelper.com, the average cost for a landline is $15 to $30, which may not sound like much, but that's for basic service. Odds are, you have caller ID, call waiting and voice mail, and your price is considerably higher. Throw in taxes and additional fees, and your price goes up as well.\nIf you bundle with your cable or Internet , your phone bill may go down, but unfortunately, it may still feel expensive, since a cable/Internet/phone bill can easily go north of $100 or even $200 a month.\nPro: Landlines sound better. You may disagree, but talk with your friends and family, and you'll likely come up with a consensus that the landline sounds a little better â€“ and if nothing else, you'll have far fewer dropped calls on a landline.\nThat's why Heath Fradkoff, who lives and works in Brooklyn, recently added a landline to his home office after starting his own public relations business, Ward 6 Marketing.\n\"I've known plenty of people who run successful businesses with only a mobile phone, but I don't think it's for me. I need the hard line option,\" Fradkoff says, adding: \"Honestly, it's mostly for sound quality. I'm old enough to remember those late-80s Sprint long distance commercials with the pin dropping. Sound quality used to be really important to consumers. Since the mobile revolution, however, that's gone mostly by the wayside.\"\nCon: Landlines are conduits for spam. In 2003, the Federal Trade Commission launched a \"Do Not Call Registry,\" which allowed consumers to put themselves on a list, stating that they didn't want to receive phone calls from telemarketers. For a while, it seemed to have stopped telemarketers cold.\nBut it appears to have been an epic failure. In 2013, apparently the last numbers available, there were more than 3.7 million complaints to the FTC about telemarketers (and think about all the consumers besieged by calls who didn't complain).\nAccording to the Federal Communications Commission, it's illegal for telemarketers to call you on your cellphone. The phone industry might want to consider trying to get similar regulations in place for landlines.\n\"Marketers killed it for us. Ironic, considering my business,\" says Ben Landers, a resident of Gaithersburg, Maryland, and the owner of a company that specializes in online marketing. \"When we had a home phone, the only calls we ever received were from marketers.\"\nLanders got rid of his landline five years ago and has thought about getting his landline reinstalled, but because of all the telemarketing calls, he says, \"I highly doubt we'll ever switch back.\"\nOn the other hand, you may enjoy the marketing calls, to an extent. Brent Csutoras, a business owner in Boca Rotan, Florida, says when Caller ID shows that the call isn't coming from someone he knows and he is positive it's a telemarketer, he lets his young son answer the phone.\n\"It makes for a great experience as well for my 3-year-old, who loves answering the phone,\" Csutoras says. \"When it rings, I just let him have fun with it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:49:23.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
