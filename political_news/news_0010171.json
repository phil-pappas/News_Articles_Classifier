Dan Ramos, D-Lorain, called upon state legislators today to support a bill he is sponsoring that will address what he says is inequity in food assistance. \n\nEmphasizing that the “eyes of the world are on our governor right now,” Ramos criticized Kasich for presenting himself as a middle-ground Republican in his bid for the White House while many Ohioans lack basic food assistance. \n\nCurrently, federal rules place a time limit on food assistance for able-bodied adults, who are required to work 20 hours a week in order to receive aid. The limit restricts help for three months out of a 36-month time period unless a recipient is able to meet the work requirement. \n\nRather than accept a statewide waiver for the limit, the administration chose to accept it for specific counties — mainly in southern and eastern Ohio — based on high rates of unemployment. Ohio will no longer be eligible for the statewide waiver in 2016. \n\n“If they don't care if these people have enough food in their bellies and food on the table to survive, I wish they’d say that,” Ramos said. \n\nHowever, Ben Johnson, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services, said the state’s county-based approach aligns with their overall goal to give assistance to those in need. \n\n“The (food stamp) employment and training aligns with our larger goal of integrating public assistance and training through a person-centered program that provides immediate assistance to those in crisis,” he said. \n\nAlthough the state gave waivers to counties with high rates of unemployment, many cities within counties that did not qualify are also in need of assistance, said Wendy Patton of Policy Matters Ohio, a progressive think tank. \n\n“The exclusion of cities means many African-American, Asian and Hispanic Ohioans, who live mostly in cities, were subject to time limits on food aid,” she said, adding that Columbus Legal Aid filed a civil complaint in 2014 against the state in response to the rejection of the waiver for cities and its effect on minority populations. \n\nUsing the same criteria for cities that the state is currently using for counties, Patton said twelve cities — including Cleveland, Dayton and Toledo — would be eligible for a waiver based on their unemployment rates. \n\nRamos’ bill, which he says has only seen support from Democrats, would require the state to apply for waivers in areas of the state the federal government has determined does not have adequate job opportunities. \n\n“It’s time for Ohio’s elected leaders to protect every citizen’s access to healthy, affordable food, and to make a firm, demonstrated commitment that no Ohioan should go hungry,” said Lisa Hamler-Fugitt, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks. \n\nDina Berliner is a fellow in the E.W.
