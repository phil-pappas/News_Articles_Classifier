The Governorship of Diyarbakır province stated that the curfew which began on Friday Oct. 2, in the morning, has been lifted on Oct. 5, Monday at 5.30 p.m. (1430GMT). Renewed violence in Turkey has come in the wake of the July 20 Suruç massacre, blamed on ISIS. The subsequent PKK-linked murder of two Turkish police officers at their home sparked a new wave of conflict. The fighting has seen the collapse of a fragile cease-fire which began early 2013 and was dubbed the \"reconciliation process\". Founded in the late 1978, the PKK is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the EU and the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:23:52.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
