Then the president did a Grumpycat impression for the crowd at the Democratic National Committee’s meeting of the Women’s Leadership Forum, turning his own face into an exaggerated frown.\n“Why is it that so many Republican politicians are so down on America?” Obama said, reprising a theme he’s expressed at political events lately.\nObama recounted his successes, contrasting them to the situation when he took office—and to the way Republicans say “crazy stuff” about how the country’s in bad shape now.\n“They’ve constructed this entire separate reality. It’s like the Twilight Zone,” Obama said.\nHe called the Republican approach to climate change an example of a wrong-headed discussion that ignores facts and so doesn’t lead to the right solutions.\nHe compared those denying climate change to people who were told by 99 out of 100 doctors that they had high cholesterol.\n“Would you say those 99 doctors are crazy and part of a wild-eyed socialist plot to prevent you from eating cheese?” Obama said. “Or would you say, ‘You know what, I bet those doctors know what they’re talking about. I’ve got to modify my diet a little bit.’”\nObama made only one mention of Vice President Joe Biden, who ended his flirtation with seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination on Wednesday in a Rose Garden event with the president by his side. Biden, Obama said, was right when he said that the country should come together to end cancer -- the disease that took the life of his son earlier this year.\nWrapping up with a pitch for Democratic politics, Obama seemed to tease the crowd with news of his endorsement.\n\"I'm going to be supporting... whoever the nominee is,” Obama said.\nThe crowd laughed. Obama smiled.\n\"What are you laughing about?\" he said.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.grumpycats.com/"], "published": "2015-10-23T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:33:08.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
