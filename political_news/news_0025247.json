Our use of resources through direct and indirect have begun to disturb wild life, even depleting some species to near extinction. As a company specializing in finding love with rich millionaires, Luxy thought we'd help spread the love by introducing white roses on October 7 th . The goal is to take the money generated and send it off to the World Wildlife Foundation. The benefit for our clientele is that they have the money to spend on a good cause, and can give their romantic other an exclusive Luxy gift to be remembered by. White roses will labeled in the new Luxy \"rarer list\" and only be available for a limited time. This is a win-win for both parties. As a company we feel ecstatic to be facilitating real and positive change.\nLuxy expects to make a large donation to the World Wild Life Foundation after October 7 th , recent polls to the apps users had found that they were appalled with current animal hunting laws. Over 62% of users voted that the laws made them sick, 21% didn't mind, and 17% left no comment. By donating to the World Wildlife Foundation Luxy will help the majority of users who dislike current treatment of animals in the wild. Money raised by the white rose drive will be announced in the Moments, and on the Luxy Facebook and Twitter pages.\nIf you would like more information about this Luxy or would like to download the millionaire dating app to purchase your own white rose, please go to www.onluxy.com or email the company at partners@onluxy.com .
