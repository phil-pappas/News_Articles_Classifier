Or do you feel like your existing mobile software isn't letting you harness the true potential of all that fancy hardware in your mobile shooter? You are not alone. Our selection of camera alternatives frees you from the limitations of your camera app and adds zing to your mobile photography experience. Whether you're looking for some pro tools or ‘pre-shot’ filters to liven up your selfies, our list across mobile platforms should help.\nGoogle Camera\nOk, so it’s not as flashy as some of the other camera apps but, if you’re looking for an intuitive camera app with a clean UI, do give this one a serious look. Not all Android phones come pre-loaded with this app but you can snag it for free on the Google Play store. The menus might border on basic at first glance but dig a little deeper and there’s a whole lot of tricks, like lens blur, and Photo sphere, that lets you create 360-degree panoramas – perfect for the great outdoors.\nAvailable on: Android\nWhat we like: Clean, clutter-free UI.\nCamera 360 Ultimate\nSelfie-addict? Never get tired of looking at yourself on your front cam? This is probably the app for you. Camera 360 lets you ‘pre-set’ filters even before you click your selfie; it also works with the primary cam just in case you get tired of looking at your face all day. The app comes with a truckload of pre-set filters and just in case you’re not happy with your picture you can reset the filter once you click the image\nAvailable on: Android, iOS\nWhat we like: Pre-set filters.\nCamera MX\nIt’s not just one of the most popular photo editing apps for Android devices but Camera MX more than doubles up as a serious default camera alternative. The app’s biggest trump card is its ‘shoot the past’ mode. While most images capture memories, this feature manages to capture a slice of the past of that memory – the few seconds before the actual shot, allowing you to knock off photo bombs or those unintended shakes. The app’s clever interface also captures quite a few key attributes (like exposure value and image resolution) without requiring you to toggle screens.\nAvailable on: Android\nWhat we like: Shoot the past mode.\nCamera+\nIt’s not without reason that this app consistently figures among the most popular camera apps for Apple fanboys. The free version doesn’t pack too much but the nominally priced (Rs 190) paid version comes with a whole host of one-touch controls that pros, and occasional photographers, will dig. From stabilising images to allowing you to easily edit and monitor controls like white balance, focus, ISO and shutter speeds, Camera+ has quite a few tricks up its sleeve. It’s one of those rare apps that combine simplicity with professional settings and controls.\nAvailable on: iOS\nWhat we like: Simple yet full of professional photography tools.\nAlso Read: The 7 best photo editing apps for your smartphone​\nOneShot for Windows\nThe Microsoft store may be short on options for cam apps but OneShot somewhat makes up. This Camera alternative is quite versatile – you can keep tabs on shutter speed and tweak the exposure levels while a decent selection of live filters, and photo effects allow you to play around with images on the fly. The elegant user interface is overlaid on top of the viewfinder, allowing you maximum control, and is complemented by an efficient photo editor. The perfect companion for your Lumia 1020 or 1520.\nAvailable on: Windows Phone\nWhat we like: User interface and host of controls.\nCamera for Android\nIs your stock camera app too cluttered? Do the complex set of controls on your cam frustrate you when you need to click an image in a jiffy? Camera for Android might not have all the bells and whistles of other more advanced camera apps, but it’s simplicity will more than work for many users. It comes with quite a few useful features like ‘pinch to zoom’, white balance settings and a countdown timer.\nAvailable on: Google\nWhat we like: Simple, uncluttered user interface.\nVSCO Cam\nPro users will love the controls that this intuitive app offers. VSCO cam can enhance and fix images across lighting scenarios while the app’s editing options are quite nifty too. The app’s capabilities don’t end with just shooting and editing images. This is one of the best all-round apps that lets you manage your photo library efficiently; you can bring all your images (even your older pictures) to a single platform\nAvailable on: Android and iOS\nWhat we like: Great image controls and photo library manager.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:09:27.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
