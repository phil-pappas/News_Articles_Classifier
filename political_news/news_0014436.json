Mills, who resigned after the news of the trip came out in July, brushed off Stanley’s comments today. \n\n“This guy is in a political race and he’s trying to make noise,” James said. “People are speculating what the fair market value was.” \n\nStanley is one of eight candidates running for four open seats on the council. Four are Democrats: Elizabeth Brown, state Rep. Michael Stinziano, Councilman Zach M. Klein and Councilwoman Jaiza Page, who was appointed this year. \n\nStanley and the other three are Republicans: Business owner John Rush, engineer Besmira Sharrah and Ibrahima Sow, who works at Project Aspire. \n\nCouncil President Andrew J. Ginther, and council members Mills, Shannon Hardin, and Eileen Paley took a chartered bus with more than 15 other people, including lobbyist John Raphael, to Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis in December. The group sat in a suite owned by Centerplate, a national food vendor that had just been awarded the contact with the Greater Columbus Convention Center. \n\nThat trip is now the subject of an investigation by the Ohio Ethics Commission. \n\nRaphael was Centerplate’s lobbyist and was a member of the convention center board when it approved the Centerplate contract. Raphael and convention center officials said he had no influence on the contract and abstained from voting on it. \n\nAll four council members on the trip said Centerplate set the cost of the trip at $250. A local travel agency that specializes in such trips, three charter bus companies and Lucas Oil Stadium officials all determined the fair market value was $750. \n\nState ethics laws require officials to either disclose gifts worth $75 or more, or they can pay the amount over $75. \n\nHardin, who is running to keep an unexpired council seat in a race separate from Stanley’s field race, and Paley, who is running for Municipal Court judge, each paid $250 for the trip in June, after Raphael’s involvement in a federal bribery investigation related to another client, the city’s red-light-camera contractor, became public. They also disclosed the trip as a gift on their ethics forms. \n\nGinther, who is running for mayor, paid $250 for the trip using campaign funds shortly after the game in December. His campaign said it consulted previous rulings by the ethics commission and determined that Ginther acted appropriately. \n\nMills paid for the trip in early July but did not disclose the trip on her ethics form. Mills resigned from the council in August and took her name off the ballot. Mills’ attorney has said she has been subpoenaed by the FBI and has turned over records to the U.S. Department of Justice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:31:06.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
