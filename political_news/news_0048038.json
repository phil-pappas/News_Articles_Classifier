Today they released some new information detailing that before the Obama administration tied the attack to an anti-Muslim video about the prophet Mohammed, they tried to tie it to a different video they considered anti-Muslim.\nThese latest documents were procured from the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security in response to a court order in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on October 16, 2014, (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01733)).\nThe new emails demonstrate that only 3 hours after the initial Benghazi attack, the White House contacted YouTube in an effort to initially blame the assault on an obscure “Pastor John video,” rather than the one they ended up blaming, “Innocence of Muslims,”by filmmaker Nakoula “Mark” Basseley Nakoula.\nThe newly released video also mentions the involvement of Hillary Clinton. The S in the document below is the Secretary, Hillary Clinton.\nThe “Pastor Jon” reference at the bottom of the email was a video by Oregon-based Pastor Jon Courson entitled God vs. Allah , the first video they were going to blame for the attacks..\nJudicial Watch also obtained a Secret “Attack Timeline,” dated September 12, 2012, which raised additional questions about the Obama administration’s response to the attack. This State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security document makes no mention of any spontaneous demonstration or Internet video in describing the Benghazi assault:\nAt 1549 hrs, DSCC was notified that U.S. Mission Benghazi was under attack. At 1600 hrs, DSCC [Diplomatic Security Command Center] was notified by Regional Security Officer (RSO) Benghazi that armed individuals had entered the compound, and at 1614 hrs RSO Benghazi reported that an armed group had set fire to buildings inside the compound. The US Ambassador was visiting post from Tripoli, and as of 1614 hrs it was suspected that one of the buildings that had been set on fire was the building where the Ambassador was sheltering. [Redacted] Quick Reaction Force (QRF) responded from their off-compound Annex, but was turned back due to heavy hostile fire.\nAs of 1700 hrs, [REDACTED] QRF and host nation militia (17 February Brigade) have redeployed to the compound. One Assistant RSO (ARSO) suffered injuries from smoke inhalation. This agent was in the Principal Officer’s Residence with U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and Information Program Officer (IPO) Sean P. Smith. All three moved to the safe haven when the attack began, but had to relocate to the roof as the building caught on fire. The agent reached the rooftop but lost contact with the other two. The agent reentered the residence and found the IPO killed in action (KIA), and was unable to locate the Ambassador. The agent had given his cell phone to the Ambassador.\nThis timeline also confirms previous Judicial Watch disclosures that there was State Department intelligence that Ambassador Stevens may have been alive after the attack:\nThe QRF and friendly militia forces were unable to locate the Ambassador, and pull back to the off-compound Annex. All classified material on the compound is secured by RSO [REDACTED] personnel. Embassy Tripoli receives a phone call from the injured ARSO’s cell phone (which had been left with the Ambassador) from a male caller saying he is at the hospital with an unresponsive male who matches a physical description of the Ambassador. [REDACTED MATERIAL]. Tripoli charters an airplane and sends it to Benghazi with six personnel onboard as a response team.\nThe attack timeline also includes an entire section called “Causes and Responsibility,” which for some reason (like protecting Hillary?) is totally redacted.\nOther timelines are included in the State Department materials. These documents make no mention of Internet videos or demonstrations, for example one declassified timeline details:\n1550 The Diplomatic Security Command Center (DSCC) receives word that US Mission Benghazi is under attack by 15-20 armed hostiles.\n1615 RSO Benghazi advises hostile individuals setting fire to buildings on compound, including the one housing Ambassador Stevens, IPO Sean Smith, and ARSO [REDACTED] responds with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) and takes fire from hostiles. QRF returns to Annex to regroup with host militia and redeploys.\nThere is much more in this latest Judicial Watch report, all of it points to the fact that our government lied to us about Benghazi and then covered it up.
