I am going on 63 years old and times have indeed changed. I remember as a child getting up on a Saturday morning and heading off on my bicycle with my bat and glove or my fish pole and not coming home until just before dinner time and no one worried. That is not the world we live in today. Parents fear letting their children roam free because of the Evil that exists today.\nDo not get me wrong Evil has always existed. But in the past Evil kept to the shadows and the darkness. Today Evil walks freely amongst us in the daylight. This is because the people have accepted Evil as inevitable and even worse almost commonplace. Evil has not grown stronger, people have grown weaker. People have accepted Evil as we allow the murder of millions of children in the name of a women's right to Choose. We have accepted gay marriage given the blessing of the government over the permanent bond of one man and one woman given the blessing of God. Evil no longer fears the light because men have chosen to live in Darkness.\nWhere I grew up so long ago it was commonplace for major traffic intersections to be directed by a round about. Vehicles would enter the round about and travel around the circle until they got to the exit that would let them proceed on their journey. As a nation, as a people we have been on a round about for years. We have been going round and round trying to find the right exit to continue our journey. Perhaps if we just took the exit that gave us one more election with just the right candidate for President. Perhaps if the congress now just elects the right Speaker of the House. Perhaps if these don't work and we just take up arms and revolt striking out at any and all parts of the current order.\nThere is but one way off this round about. There is now an open war on the Christian faith. You cannot insult Muhammad or Islam but you can openly mock Christianity and art is a crucifix in urine. Christians are not only being slaughtered in the Middle East but right here in Oregon at a community college people were asked if they were Christian and if they raised their hand they were shot in the head. After that first person was shot more raised their hand or kept their hand raised not being willing to deny their faith even in the face of death.\nThere is but one way off this round about. When confronting the Darkness, walk in the Light. When your time comes will you raise your hand?\nGot Faithâ€¦\n Michael", "external_links": ["http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oc9i-oprBPM/UCMW_CS7h7I/AAAAAAAACOM/LeruCBsvES8/s1600/empty_brass.jpg", "http://alarmandmuster.proboards.com/user/224"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:12:37.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
