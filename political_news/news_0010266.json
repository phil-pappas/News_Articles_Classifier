Garrett raised $200K less than opponent in past three months, report shows October 15, 2015, 6:21 PM Last updated: Thursday, October 15, 2015, 6:24 PM By HERB JACKSON Print \nRep. Scott Garrett raised $175,000 for his re-election during the third quarter of this year, less than he raised at the same point in the past two election cycles and well below the $400,000 collected by his likely opponent next year, Democrat Josh Gottheimer, disclosures made public Thursday show. Buy this photo Rep. Scott Garrett \nBut Garrett, a seven-term Republican from Wantage in Sussex County, continues to have more than twice as much money as Gottheimer, a Wyckoff resident and former speechwriter to President Bill Clinton. Garrett’s account had $2.3 million on Sept. 30, compared with Gottheimer’s $934,000. \nOther disclosures on Thursday showed Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez raised almost $471,000 for his legal defense fund between July and September. During that time, the fund spent nearly $730,000 as lawyers filed more than a dozen motions, nearly all of them rejected, seeking to have Menendez’s corruption indictment thrown out. \nRelated: Backlash fuels potential challenger to Garrett; donors include major backer of gay rights \nGarrett is the chairman of the House subcommittee that regulates Wall Street and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and his disclosure with the Federal Election Commission shows he is a major recipient of contributions from the financial sector. \nThe political action committees of Capital Group Companies Inc. and Liberty Mutual Insurance both gave the maximum $10,000 in September, for example. The American Bankers Association also gave $2,500 in September, bringing its total for the year to $5,000. \nGarrett came under fire from Democrats and some Republicans in July when it was revealed he had told House Republican leaders he would not contribute to the party’s campaign committee because it had supported gay candidates. Bloomberg News reported at the time that a fundraiser organized by the Big 4 accounting firms had been cancelled. \nGarrett’s report shows, however, that the PAC of the accounting firm KPMG gave $2,000 in September, bringing its total to $7,000 for the year. Ernst and Young also gave $2,500 in July, but that was before the controversy erupted. \nGarrett, who opposed House Speaker John Boehner’s election in January, told The Record he has many disputes with party leadership and would not discuss whether support for gay candidates was among them. But he did tell Bergen County’s Republican chairman that that was one of his differences. \nBergen County is home to nearly 70 percent of the voters in Garrett’s district, and his FEC report shows he gave the party’s Republican organization $11,000 in contributions in July. \nCompared with the $175,000 total Garrett raised during the third quarter of this year, he raised $256,000 during the same time in 2013 and $226,000 in 2011. And in both of those previous election cycles, he was not facing an opponent like Gottheimer, who could be his best-funded challenger ever. \nGarrett’s total contributions for the period also trailed the amount raised by Rep. Tom MacArthur of Ocean County, another New Jersey Republican who could be targeted by Democrats this year. MacArthur, who does not chair any subcommittees, reported $204,000 in total contributions and had $506,000 in his account on Sept. 30. \nMacArthur, who spent $5 million of his own money winning his seat in 2014, represents a district that President Obama narrowly won in 2012 and 2008. Obama lost Garrett’s district by 3 percentage points in 2012 and 2 points in 2008. \nAlso disclosed Thursday was that money continues to pour into a legal defense fund that Menendez, a Democrat from Paramus, created in early in 2014 to deal with a federal investigation into his actions on behalf of his friend and top campaign contributor, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen. \nThe fund has raised $3.3 million so far and on Sept. 30 had a balance of $858,000, according to a calculation by The Record based on the latest disclosure to the Senate’s ethics committee. \nThe new report shows 20 contributions of the maximum $10,000 a year, including one from Cory PAC, a political action committee controlled by Menendez’s fellow New Jersey Democrat, Sen. Cory Booker. Booker, who has referred to Menendez as “the Batman to my Robin,” has called the indictment a “distraction” from the work of the Senate. \nMenendez is an outspoken critic of President Obama’s effort to relax the trade embargo with Cuba, and the defense fund received $10,000 during the last quarter from the U.S.-Cuba Democracy PAC in Florida. The PAC gave the same amount in December 2014. \nContributions connected to the Diaco construction company in Monmouth County also continued to come in, with the latest report showing $10,000 each being given by Zachary and Nicholas Diaco of Rumson, on top of $10,000 each given earlier this year by Anthony and Pamela Diaco. \nAn indictment handed up April 1 accused Menendez and Melgen of bribery, honest services and wire fraud, and both have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say Menendez used his office to promote Melgen’s personal and private interests, including a $3.9 million Medicare dispute, in exchange for lavish travel and contributions to political campaigns that helped Menendez win re-election in 2012. \nOther disclosures filed this week with the FEC showed: \nRep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-Paterson, raised $211,000 and spent $92,000, including a $25,000 contribution to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and $2,000 for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Pascrell had $1.2 million in his account on Sept. 30. \nRep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-Harding, raised $113,000 and spent $65,000, including a $34,000 contribution to the National Republican Congressional Committee. He had $385,000 in his account on Sept. 30. \nRep. Donald Payne of Newark, whose district has the biggest concentration of Democrats in the state, ended the quarter with only $6,344 in his campaign account. He plans a fund-raiser on Monday, however. \nThe pro-Israel political action committee NORPAC, which is based in Englewood Cliffs, raised $90,000 for Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, in September, weeks after Schumer became the first Democratic senator to come out against the multinational nuclear agreement with Iran. Other recipients of funds raised by NORPAC were: Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., $25,500; and Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., $16,780; Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., $10,000; and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., $5,400. \nEmail: jackson@northjersey.com Blog: northjersey.com/thepoliticalstate  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:24:41.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
