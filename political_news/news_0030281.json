They are dedicated to crippling government so that it doesn’t work. Another word for that is anarchy. Start with Mississippi. A perfect example is a top issue right now: adopting Initiative 42, a constitutional amendment mandating full funding of the state’s 18 year old public education budget formula. The formula is aimed at adequately funding schools in poorer districts.
