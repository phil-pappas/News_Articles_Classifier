The newspaper describes the emails as pornographic, or as mocking gays, women, blacks or Mexicans.Ardo says the office didn't give the emails to the newspaper. A message seeking comment from Eakin wasn't immediately returned.In a statement Tuesday, Justice Michael Eakin says it is \"disconcerting and embarrassing to find others searching years of private personal emails looking for and publicizing any insensitive content.\"The 66-year-old Republican says the messages don't reflect his character or beliefs and have never been part of his consideration of any case or court business.Two weeks ago, Attorney General Kathleen Kane gave the high court and various state ethics agencies more than 1,000 emails sent to Eakin's private Yahoo email account. She described some of them as racially offensive and misogynistic pornography.Eakin's colleagues said Monday they're disturbed by the revelations.The justice says he's cooperating with a court review and a Judicial Conduct Board investigation.
