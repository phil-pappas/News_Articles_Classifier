(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post) October 14 at 5:17 PM The Oct. 10 Metro article “ Montgomery schools graded on special ed ” reported on a study of the effectiveness and fairness of Montgomery County Public Schools’ special-education program. As a parent of a child with disabilities, I felt most of the conclusions in the report were untrue. I had to read closely to find even a glimmer of our family’s experience within the 144 pages of statistics and surveys.\nMCPS has a fox in the chicken coop in the form of legal tactics that scare, bully and financially overwhelm parents, most of whom have no means to fight back. This win-at-all-costs strategy has proved effective. The report indicated that most parents don’t pursue legal remedies against MCPS, and the ones who do have a 100 percent chance of losing. Yet investigations by the Maryland State Department of Education, in response to parent complaints about MCPS, were decided in favor of parents by a ratio of 7 to 1.\nSince 2004, MCPS has paid a single law firm with scorch-and-burn tactics an average of about $500,000 a year . This money punishes the handful of parents bold enough to seek legal redress and sends a “proceed with caution” message to anyone watching. Using heavy-handed strategies against parents of children with disabilities is deplorable, but it’s a symptom, not the cause. MCPS’s approach to resolving disputes is broken. As a public interest attorney dedicated to correcting social inequities, I hope MCPS finds a path toward a more just future.\nMary Greene , Silver Spring", "external_links": ["http://parentscoalitionmc.blogspot.com/2012/08/mcps-payments-to-jeffrey-krew-llc.html", "http://www.boarddocs.com/mabe/mcpsmd/Board.nsf/files/A35F9F3E0530/$file/Update%20Ext%20Rev%20Special%20Ed%20Proc%20Servcs%20Attach.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:25:23.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
