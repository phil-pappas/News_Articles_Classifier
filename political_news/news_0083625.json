The protesters then refused to leave. \nPolice spokesman T.J. Smith says less than 50 protesters are inside and police are \"monitoring the situation.\" \nA spokesman for the protesters has said they won't leave until Davis and the mayor agree to a list of demands. \nDavis was appointed interim chief to replace Anthony Batts . The full council still has to vote on his permanent appointment. \nBatts was fired due to a skyrocketing homicide rate in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray from injuries received in police custody. The city erupted in riots following Gray's death in April. \nThink your friends should see this? Share it with them! \nStory copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
