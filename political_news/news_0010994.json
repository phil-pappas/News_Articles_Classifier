Equally clearly, he is encouraging David Cameron to bring forward proposals to the Commons to involve Britain in a fourth Middle East war in twelve years.\nTwo years ago MPs voted against bombing Syria, which would then have been targeted at Syrian government forces.\nToday, it is unclear whether Mr Benn wants bombing of Islamic State sites in Syria, or if he is seeking to police civilian “safe havens”.\nNeither will work. The Islamic State needs defeating – but this can only be done by the people of the region themselves. Rather than bombing by outside powers, efforts should be made to stop countries such as Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Nato member Turkey giving aid, arms and logistical support to IS.\nBombing will kill more civilians, multiply the number of refugees and drive new support into the arms of Islamic State.\nLikewise establishing no-fly zones or safe havens – difficult under any circumstances – would risk a military confrontation with Russia and the Assad government. No-fly zones or safe havens would therefore themselves require further military intervention in a country already bombed by a number of different countries.\nThe pressing need in Syria is for an end to the civil war. This requires a serious diplomatic and political process without pre-conditions and an end to all foreign military interference in Syria.\nThere is no humanitarian solution which can be achieved by more bombing, or by further stoking up the civil war.\nHilary Benn and all Labour MPs should learn from the history of the calamitous interventions in Iraq and Libya and be supporting Labour’s conference policy and pushing for a peaceful settlement, not more war.", "external_links": ["https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/144/990_460x230_499112207_555x277.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:18:48.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
