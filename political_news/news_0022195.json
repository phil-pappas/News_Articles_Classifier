When questions were being asked about the legitimacy of Kids Company, the government chucked another £3m in four days before the whole thing went bankrupt.\n\"The whole thing stinks. I am afraid, and this is true, that within the charity sector there are quite a few charlatans...I am not against charity, I give to charity but I am selective about the charities I give to.\"\n'Most demonised' Asked during the phone-in about his public profile and what impact it would have on the forthcoming EU referendum, Mr Farage claimed he had become the \"most demonised person in Britain since Oswald Mosley\" - the British fascist leader who was imprisoned during World War Two.\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Oswald Mosley was the leader of the British Union Fascists in the 1930s He said he had been subject to \"appalling and untrue\" attacks in sections of the media but he suggested the criticism of him was motivated less by personal feelings than fear of UKIP's policies and their resonance.\n\"What is really interesting is the percentage of the population that really don't like me is not particularly big and it tends to be linked to my genuine policy positions rather than my persona.\"\nThere have been calls for Mr Farage to adopt a lower profile during the referendum campaign amid claims that he is a polarising figure among the electorate and could damage the fight to leave the EU.\nThe MEP, who failed to win a Westminster seat in May's election, said the Leave campaign must be a \"team effort\", appealing to both the left and right of the political spectrum, and should not be \"dominated\" by any one individual or party.\n\"I may not be everyone's cup of the tea but what I have done is that I have taken a political party that was virtually unheard of to winning a national election... and I, with my colleagues, have managed to force a referendum and a change of national debate about Europe, immigration, grammar schools and many other areas.\n\"I believe the net effect of what I am doing is good for our side of the argument.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7233/production/_86153292_farage.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33810782", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/22E7/production/_86153980_86153979.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34535954", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33641889"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:42:54.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
