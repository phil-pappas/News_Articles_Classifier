Republicans could attempt a variety of options, including taking up a separate measure that reins in spending alongside another bill that lifts the debt limit unconditionally.\nA debt ceiling proposal could also attract GOP votes by boosting military spending that was cut by the Budget Control Act, which imposed spending caps known as the sequester.\n\"The White House has said it's willing to put some things with it if it helps,\" Cole said. \"For a lot of our members, sequester relief for our military is a hugely important thing.\"\nAccording to some lawmakers, GOP leaders are aiming for at long-term debt ceiling increase, although Flores said a short-term increase could be on the table.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Romney admits: 'Without Romneycare, I don't think we would have Obamacare' Romney explained that his signature achievement helped pave the way for the Affordable Care Act's passage\nBy Al Weaver • 10/23/15 2:01 PM Democrats, meanwhile, are insisting on a \"clean\" bill that would raise the $18.1 trillion debt limit with no strings attached.
