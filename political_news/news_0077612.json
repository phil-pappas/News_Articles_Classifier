The move could complicate efforts by front-runner House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to win the speakership.\nBut Fleming added that Wednesday's decision by the group is an endorsement that does not necessarily bind them to stick with Webster when the full House votes on Oct. 29.\nOn Thursday, all 247 House Republicans are scheduled to meet behind closed doors and vote on who they want to nominate for speaker.\nUltimately, it is up to the full House - Republicans who control the chamber and minority Democrats - to vote for Boehner's replacement at the end of this month.\nGiven that all Democrats are expected to vote for their party leader - former Speaker Nancy Pelosi - Republicans will mostly have to stick together to anoint the next speaker. If too many were to splinter and back candidates other than the nominee, there could be a deadlock, requiring additional ballots and a potentially damaging fight for Republicans.\nMcCarthy is seen as the front-runner in the race.\nThe Freedom Caucus is comprised of conservatives sympathetic to the small-government Tea Party movement. They effectively pressured Boehner to announce his retirement recently by fighting a series of internal party battles with him during his speakership. Boehner is set to leave Congress on Oct. 30.\nThere are an estimated 40 members of the Freedom Caucus.\n(Reporting by Susan Cornwell ; Editing by Sandra Maler )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:24:15.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
