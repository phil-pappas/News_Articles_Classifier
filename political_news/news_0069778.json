Their site at Nursling is a landmark on the way into Southampton and they certainly have a proud reputation and relationship with our city. Promoted stories \n“I will certainly be raising this with BiS ( Business Innovation and Skills)and seeking reassurances that any plans will reinforce the robustness of this great local asset.” \nSouthampton Test MP Alan Whitehead said he would also be asking questions over whether the organisation could be in line for privatisation. \nMr Whitehead, pictured below, in whose constituency OS was based before its move to the city’s outskirts in 2011, said: “I am not aware of any proposal along those lines but it is certainly something I will be looking into and asking about.” \nAlan Whitehead \nWhen asked whether there was any proposal to sell off the organisation, a spokesman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills refused to rule it out. \nA statement read: “The Government is committed to ensuring the effective and efficient management of publicly owned assets and keeps ownership of all assets under review.” \nEarlier this year the OS became a limited company with the Government named as the sole shareholder. \nThe arrangement means the profit the organisation makes over and above what it costs to run, is paid directing back to the public purse. \nLast year around £20m in dividends were paid back into the Treasury. \nA spokesman for OS said the organisation could not comment on any plans the government may have regarding its future, but that speculation was often raised whenever there was a review of publicly owned assets. \nGroup secretary for the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union Tony Conway said he would be surprised if there was any proposal to privatise OS as a result of the spending review. \n“I don’t believe it will be sold off, I would be shocked if it were,” he said. Share article \nAlong with producing paper maps the lion’s share of OS business comes from digital map data, online route planning along with sharing services and mobile apps. \nAs a result of a deal with the government public organisations, including the emergency services, councils and highways agencies, can access the data held by OS for free.
