Butler Headstart on Tuesday, October 6, in celebration of Georgia Pre-K Week. This year’s fifth annual Georgia Pre-K Week ran from Monday, October 5 to Friday, October 9. \n“It was an honor to visit with the smiling students, faculty and staff at the Academy Child Development Center and E.E. Butler Headstart this week,” Miller said. “Pre-K week provides a great opportunity for us, as legislators, to submerge ourselves into the Pre-K programs across the state and witness the extraordinary educational foundation these programs provide for Georgia’s youngest learners.” \nWhile visiting both learning centers, Sen. Miller participated in a reading activity with the children, took a tour of the facility, talked with the staff, and got an up-close look at the many ways the center is supporting early learning. Sponsored by Voices for Georgia’s Children and Pre-K partners throughout the state, Georgia Pre-K Week focuses on the important role of Georgia’s Pre-K program on future academic achievement. \"The tremendous participation of public officials in this event demonstrates sustained support throughout Georgia for giving kids a solid foundation through early education,” said Emily Pelton, Executive Director of Voices for Georgia's Children. “The commitment of state leadership and the business community to broad access and quality pre-K programs ensures that our young learners get the best start possible in learning and in life.” Associated Categories : Local/State News , Politics Associated Tags : Pre-K Week, Sen.
