He's a major reason I became a state lawmaker and have been helping implement Oregon's new marijuana law. \nDuring the 1980s recession, Oregon's natural resources sector tanked. My dad stopped taking a salary at our family's rock crushing business to help keep the company afloat. Mom warned that if the business closed, we might have to leave the Rogue Valley, where our family has lived for generations. As kids, my cousins and I rode down Main Street in Ashland's Fourth of July parade, perched on the edge of a truck from M.C. Lininger and Sons, tossing out packets of candy that looked like gravel. Our business was a source of income and pride for the whole family. \nM.C. Lininger and Sons survived that deep recession, but by the time the housing market bounced back, 48,000 jobs in the Pacific Northwest's lumber sector had disappeared. Lots of related jobs vanished with them. I never want Oregon families to have to go through that again. Our state needs a diverse jobs base. \nRight now, city councils and county commissions across Oregon are deciding whether to allow legal marijuana businesses. They should keep in mind that legal marijuana offers a new way for people to earn a living from the land. Legalization could create a jobs boom in southern Oregon, a prime location for outdoor marijuana production. \nThe legal cannabis sector in the United States grew by 74 percent in 2014, according to ArcView Market Research. Once legalization goes nationwide, the sector is projected to exceed $36 billion in annual value. That's larger than the organic food business, and it could mean lots of good jobs for Oregon. \nBusiness is already booming, with family-wage jobs that provide benefits and can't be outsourced. In July, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 555 announced its first-ever union contract for an Oregon marijuana business. Workers at Stoney Brothers start at $15 an hour. Meanwhile, Oregon's Women Grow chapter in Portland has become one of the state's leading centers for female entrepreneurs. This matters, because women own only a third of Oregon businesses; nearly one in three working single mothers lives in poverty. \nThe emerging industry needs a chance to thrive so it can drive out the cartels and outcompete street dealers. But legalization must also be implemented in a way that addresses reasonable community concerns. Police must have the support to detect impaired drivers and make sure retail outlets are not selling cannabis to kids. At the same time, we must help the owners of legal marijuana businesses access banks, which are reluctant to work with companies that deal with a Schedule I controlled substance. By teaming up with officials from other states facing the same need, we can help persuade Congress to reschedule marijuana. We have a strong ally in Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer. \nOregon must also welcome outside investment and expertise. We should avoid extreme investment limitations and residency requirements. Misguided protectionism will stunt the growth of emerging companies, making it harder for Oregon businesses to compete in the legal national market that is coming. We should let market forces work, coupled by reasonable tracking and reporting requirements to prevent diversion. \nFinally, we need to contain the environmental impacts of marijuana production. Oregon's new Task Force on Cannabis Environmental Best Practices will consider incentives for efficient energy and water use, as well as other strategies. \nThe to-do list is daunting. But if we get the new industry right, Oregon could become for marijuana what Napa Valley has become for wine. Our economy would be more robust, and my father would be proud. â€¢ \nAnn Lininger, a business attorney, represents Lake Oswego and Southwest Portland in the Oregon House of Representatives.
