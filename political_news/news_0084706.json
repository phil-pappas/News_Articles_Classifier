Martin O'Malley - though he didn't name him) was heckled by Black Lives Matter activists for saying \"all lives matter.\"\n\"He got so much grief he came back and apologized,\" Carson said. \"That's bullying. Of course all lives matter. Of course we need to be concerned about everyone. Of course we need to extend respect to everyone. And you know, when we get off into a little thing that says 'no, this is the only thing you can say' -- that's sickening to me.\"", "external_links": ["http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/08/10/3533e67e-0bf2-44a8-8dc6-df7909f53c6c/thumbnail/220x140/054b8017a11600f02141f3dca868f2f0/cbsn0810fergusonviolence431752640x360.jpg", "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/09/11/cafc4ff7-2fb5-482d-923d-5b06fb6bb97d/thumbnail/220x140/53ffa43e5dcb916829e1510043e5541a/0911encarson444157640x360.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-14T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:56:07.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
