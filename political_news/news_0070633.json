County Officials call it “Dangerous” charter language that would take power from the County Commission. \nRosen Hotels Founder, Harris Rosen slammed opponents of the measure saying “We have to beg? That’s outrageous, I love this town,” while citing millions in TDT his company generates and the benefits his employees receive. “I was told if I speak here today, I’ll be called greedy and selfish,” he said. “I defy anyone here … to call me greedy and selfish. Tourism employs so many, but yet we treat it so badly. We abuse it. How incredibly sad.” \nYesterday, during a meeting of the Orange County Board of Commissioners, following a unanimous vote that allocated 2.1 million for cultural tourism (story HERE ) Jacobs said… \n“Its funny because with so many things, the squeaky wheel gets the attention and one or two people may speak out and it gets communicated as if that’s the voice of the tourism community” said Jacobs “I don’t think that’s the case and I’m not familiar with them being that unhappy about that.” \nShe briefly explains the Brummer amendment before continuing “I haven’t heard any complaints in particular and this process answers any questions anybody might have.” \nCommissioner Edwards commented on his former colleague saying “He wasn’t as enlightened as it came to the arts. As his successor” he said laughing and referring to Bryan Nelson who now represents District 2. \n“God Bless him” continued Jacobs “He also sat on this board for 8 years and never mentioned it and served in the legislature and never proposed it there either.” \nBrummer’s measure is set to go before the same board for a second look in a couple of weeks.
