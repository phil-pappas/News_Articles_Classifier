The project, which began as a student film, is now an award-winning documentary that will debut at the New York City Independent Film Festival on Oct. 15. Here, Galant and Cueva tell Cosmopolitan.com about the inspiration behind the film and how they hope to use their low-budget short to change the way both sides look at the abortion access crisis facing America.\n Why did you decide to create a film with an abortion provider as the subject?\nCueva: This film actually started as a class project [at Ithaca College] where Leah and I, and the rest of our film crew met. In this class, we had to choose topics for a documentary we would produce by the end of semester. We were already really interested in the topic of abortion access in the South, and our research led us to an article about a traveling abortion doctor, Dr. Willie Parker . We found that he traveled to the last remaining clinic in Jackson, Mississippi, and we were just really amazed by his story in particular. We had no idea that abortion doctors were needed this way. We wanted to learn more and focus on these types of providers and why they had to travel.\nMore From Cosmopolitan We began our search to find a doctor who would be willing to share their story with us. After about hundreds of phone calls and emails to abortion clinics across the country, we were finally put in touch with a doctor who travels from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to Dallas, Texas. She is now our main character in our film.\nI think one of the main things we had to realize was the abortion provider community as a whole has been mistrusted, and there's a lot of stigma around what they do.\nShare Tweet The focus of our film started out as a day in the life of this doctor. When we started filming, in October 2014, there were only seven clinics remaining in the whole state of Texas. The film later evolved into showcasing her story and the current situation in Texas with restrictive laws, such as H.B. 2 [the bill that required all doctors to have local hospital admitting privileges and that all clinics meet ambulatory surgical center building requirements]. Then it moved to focusing on patients who have to travel hundreds of miles, because we felt that that aspect of the story was really important and not often showcased.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail 3PointPictures What sort of things did other providers tell you about why they didn't want to participate in the project?\nGalant: I think one of the main things we had to realize was the abortion provider community as a whole has been mistrusted, and there's a lot of stigma around what they do. There is a lot of mistrust for journalists, and in particular filmmakers, because what [the abortion providers] do has been threatened by violence and by terrorism. It is one of those things where we had to really be sensitive to the needs of these providers and understanding where they were coming from. I think that was a big reason that we came across for why they wouldn't want to participate.\nHow did you film the documentary, and how long did it take to complete it?\nCueva: It was six of us in our film crew, and we were full-time students so it was really important for us to figure out the best time to continue researching and really setting up shoots at every possible moment. We knew that this situation in Texas was constantly evolving. Especially around what was happening with H.B. 2. I mentioned at the time there had only been seven clinics remaining, but there were a few changes in court after that, opening other clinics back up.\nWe actually made it work on a very tight school budget. We packed six of us in a car, and we traveled to Texas by car. There's a few times that a few of us –– Leah and myself and one other crew member –– did travel by plane, because we did travel with the doctor from New Mexico to Texas. Most of the times, we were just driving across country. It was a pretty amazing experience.\nGalant: We're actually not finished with our project. We are working on expansion, a potential feature-length nonfiction project. It's neat because the short cut that we have of The Provider right now has really been a launching pad for us to dive deeper into this issue and follow all the complexities as they unfold.\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail 3PointPictures ", "external_links": ["http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a23771/abortion-ministry-of-dr-willie-parker-0914/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444151283-11050839-1579671458939022-4123879138267741826-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444151283-11050839-1579671458939022-4123879138267741826-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x480/gallery-1444151283-11050839-1579671458939022-4123879138267741826-o.jpg", "http://www.nffty.org/festival-highlights/nffty-2015-award-winners", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x576/gallery-1444151283-11050839-1579671458939022-4123879138267741826-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x653/gallery-1444151214-11039163-1579671578939010-7504748774576827292-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x360/gallery-1444151283-11050839-1579671458939022-4123879138267741826-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/980x735/gallery-1444151283-11050839-1579671458939022-4123879138267741826-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444151214-11039163-1579671578939010-7504748774576827292-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444151214-11039163-1579671578939010-7504748774576827292-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444151117-10854469-1579671642272337-4781426836722151628-o.jpg", "http://www.theproviderfilm.com/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x320/gallery-1444151214-11039163-1579671578939010-7504748774576827292-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x426/gallery-1444151214-11039163-1579671578939010-7504748774576827292-o.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/768x512/gallery-1444151214-11039163-1579671578939010-7504748774576827292-o.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:48:00.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
