Jealous said he began working on the plan after the death of Freddie Gray in April. \nGray suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody. His death sparked weeks of protests, and his funeral on April 27 was followed by a several hours of rioting, looting and arson. \nJealous' report focuses on reforming police misconduct. There are no recommendations about lowering crime. \nIn an interview, he said crime would go down once trust is established between the police and community members. \n\"You're not going to get greater cooperation, which is necessary to solve homicides, until they feel that they can trust you,\" he said. \"Increasing trust lowers crime rates.\" \nThe report comes after interim police commissioner Kevin Davis received a vote of approval from a City Council committee amid protests. Davis next week will go before the full City Council to determine whether he will become Baltimore's 38th police chief. \nJealous said it is still \"too early\" to judge Davis' performance. \n\"I'm not going to second-guess the council,\" Jealous said. \"Like everybody in the city, I'm hopeful he's going to lead us in the right direction.\" \nThe police department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has begun work on some of the same goals. \nFor instance, this month, the city plans to begin a pilot program to equip a total of 155 officers with body cameras.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:55:10.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
