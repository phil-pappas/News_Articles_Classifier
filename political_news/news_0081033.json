Its architect, James Chen , the philanthropist behind UK charity Vision for a Nation Foundation and the innovative optical enterprise Adlens, calls upon the world's greatest thinkers to join together to answer one simple question: \"How can everybody in the world see?\"\nPoor vision affects 2.5 billion people in the world. With no means of correcting it, they face huge barriers to personal development, education, family life and a shorter life expectancy. To address this \"handbrake on development,\" James Chen and his team have made a global invitation to help them find the greatest solutions to deliver eye care quickly. The world has seen incredible technological advancements over the past fifty years. Now is the moment to harness it.\nProject Oversight will be running a challenge over the next year which will invite the public to reimagine and design the way the world can have access to vision correction. The three individuals or groups with the most promising ideas will each be rewarded with a $100,000 seed grant to turn their ideas into a reality. Ultimately, these ideas will be presented as a gift to the world: to pass the world's greatest eye care solutions on to the many great organizations already working in the development field.\nJames Chen said, \"Poor vision represents a significant handbrake on development for 2.5 billion people. And the loss in economic productivity associated with poor vision is estimated to be as much as $3 trillion globally.\n\"I have seen the global community come together over the past week and create something incredible: the Sustainable Development Goals. I believe that they can truly make the world a better place. However it is only by acting now to address eyesight that we can help the Goals to truly reach their full potential.\n\"Now is the moment to act. The way we deliver vision correction has barely changed since the 19 th Century. Yet we have gone from the telephone to the smartphone, from the horse and carriage to the car, from quill to tablet.\n\"Project Oversight is a call to every leader, every eye care practitioner, every innovator, dreamer and tweeter. Let's fuse the best technologies with the greatest practices of today. By bringing the brightest and boldest ideas and working together, we can create solutions to help everybody in the world to see. Join us.\"\nVision for a Nation will begin accepting proposals later this fall and announce the winners by early next spring. The final report will be presented to the world on World Sight Day 2016.
