Bernie Sanders said the other night -- and he's right, except that he's wrong. As various experts point out, it has been shrinking not because great numbers got poorer and joined a lower class, but because they got richer and joined a higher class.\nSanders thinks it was the other way around, and it's this kind of misinformation on which he builds ruinously ridiculous public policy proposals. In a debate with four other Democratic candidates for president the other night, he assumed his usual self-righteously indignant role, easily besting Hillary Clinton, Martin O'Malley, Lincoln Chaffee and Jim Webb in the absurdity category.\nClinton, nipped at by the others because of her political stardom, her lead in the polls and her culpability, was nevertheless self-confident and, in terms of stage presence, the most impressive. Webb, a writer, former Marine, former secretary of the Navy and former U.S. senator, was the common sense champ, thereby drawing the least audience applause. O'Malley, former governor of Maryland, seemed nice enough but nothing special. Chaffee, once a Republican senator then a Democratic governor of Rhode Island, made you wonder why exactly he was on any stage.\nThough Webb was a bit of a holdout, the other four scarcely let up for a minute in nonsensical progressive pandering about big government making everything super-duper for Americans who cannot conceivably take care of themselves. No one did it better than Sanders, who wants free college tuition and Medicare for everyone on top of enhanced Social Security benefits.\nHe apparently does not get that this country is facing downright perilous debt. As important as tax reform is, we can't confiscate our way out of this mess as he supposes, and his brand of spectacular new spending is the exact opposite of what's needed. It would invite explosive crises while leaving the middle class and poor many times worse off even in a gradual transition.\nAt one point, he said, American trade policies have cost the country millions of jobs. In fact, various trade initiatives over the years have been crucially stabilizing, have poked up pay in a variety of job categories and have especially helped the disadvantaged by keeping product prices down.\nClinton once seemed to know as much. As secretary of state, she helped shape the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade plan that would visit a host of benefits on us and Asian buddies, spoke well of it in her recent memoir and, according to one calculation, has piped up enthusiastically about it on no fewer than 45 occasions. Now, faced with Democratically allied special interests booing it, a populist mood that doesn't understand it and other candidates at politically beneficial odds with it, she has changed her mind, citing last-minute alterations that were actually nothing more than crossing t's and dotting i's.\nIt's one of several inconsistencies she explained away in the debate as resulting from a learning curve. Sadly, she has failed to learn that hiking the minimum wage would almost surely do serious hurt to many who can least afford it. Or that women mostly get pay about equal to that of men when the job is the same and can sue when it is not. Or that still more workplace interventions will likely have the effect of fewer workplaces in which to intervene. Or that, the way it was carried out, our Libyan adventure was a grotesque misadventure.\nThere were some good points made by the candidates, such as wanting to do something about mass incarceration, and there was the show-time moment when Clinton and Sanders shook hands on too much attention being paid to her email mistakes. At least she did not shake hands with him on some of his wildest policy longings. She is already overreaching enough without that.\nAbout The Writer\nJay Ambrose is an op-ed columnist for Tribune News Service.
