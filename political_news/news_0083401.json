The attack outraged aid groups and complicated U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. \nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama called the organization’s international president, Joanne Liu, and offered condolences to the group’s staff. \n“When the United States makes a mistake, we own up to it, we apologize where appropriate, and we are honest about what transpired,” Earnest said. \nA day earlier, the White House had stopped short of an apology, waiting to learn more even while acknowledging the attack was a U.S. mistake. \nObama told Doctors Without Borders that the U.S. would review the attack to determine whether changes to U.S. operating procedures could reduce the chances of a similar incident, and that those responsible for the Kunduz attack would be held accountable, if appropriate, Earnest said. \nObama also spoke to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to convey condolences and pledge continued cooperation, the White House said. \nInvestigations by the U.S., NATO and the Afghan government are underway, but Doctors Without Borders has said more are needed. Doctors Without Borders wants a fact-finding mission to determine whether the attack violated the Geneva Conventions. \nObama restated his commitment to a thorough and transparent investigation by the Defense Department, Earnest said. He didn’t specifically address the group’s call for an independent probe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T05:16:53.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
