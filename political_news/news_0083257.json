Phil Bryant says he won't debate his Democratic challenger, Robert Gray, before the Nov. 3 general election. His decision is bound to disappoint voters who wanted to see how Gray, a long-haul trucker with the CB handle Silent Knight, would fare in a side-by-side format with one of the state's longest-serving officials. During an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Bryant answered quickly and firmly when asked if he would debate: \"No, I don't intend to.\" That decision makes him Mississippi's first governor in two decades not to debate a challenger while seeking a second term.
