National pays lip service when we all ought to be paying real service. \n\"There are few World War Two veterans alive with most in their 90’s or, like Mr Martin, now 100. Every anniversary date matters because it is our chance to show those still with us, and the families of those who are not, that we care,\" says Mr Ball. \nDarroch Ball’s motion without notice and without debate refused by the National Party and Peter Dunne: \nI move, on the eve of the 73rd Anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein, that this House honours surviving veterans, the memory of those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and those veterans who survived the war, but who are no longer with us. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:08:51.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
