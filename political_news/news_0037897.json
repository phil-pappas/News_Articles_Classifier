If you need to pay heed, it should be to the message and guidance given by the President. Yesterday, the President showed the path. Whatever the head of the country of 125 crore people has said, there can be no bigger message, no bigger direction, no bigger inspiration than that.”\n PM Narendra Modi President Pranab Mukherjee communal harmony Bihar Assembly polls nation Also Read Union Cabinet reshuffle likely by end of the year Drastic fall in wind power in south 60 die due to encephalitis, situation alarming in West Bengal Nizam Sugars General Manager commits suicide", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccanchronicle.com/151009/nation-current-affairs/article/heed-president-shun-hate-talk-modi", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Modi%20in%20Begusarai%202%20Bihar%20Polls%20PTI.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Modi%20in%20Begusarai%202%20Bihar%20Polls%20PTI.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:54:52.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
