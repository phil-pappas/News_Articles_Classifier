The personality politics, appealing to the emotions of voters rather than their reason and intellect, tell a story all too familiar for the United States. \nTake for example the Republican Party’s frontrunners Donald Trump and Jeb Bush. \nOne could think of a plethora of reasons to criticize the former governor of Florida: his undying support for big banks that precipitated the collapse of the economy; his avowed commitment to the construction of more prisons and harsher sentences to non-violent offenders that cost taxpayers more money and perpetuate recidivism; his plans to defund programs and organizations that are often the only places women can turn for healthcare and reproductive services. \nYet, rather than offering any criticism of substance, Mr. Trump invoked Mr. Bush’s \"low-energy\" in order to get ahead in the polls, a telling signal that many people are more concerned with mudslinging than with discussion of the real issues and policies that could potentially revive our flagging democracy. \nEqually disappointing is the fact that potential Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is using the same kind of empty, vapid attacks to gain ground on U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT). Her super PAC, Correct the Record, circulated assaults on Sanders’ support of newly-elected Labour Party official Jeremy Corbyn in Britain and made unfounded comparisons of the senator to the late-socialist President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. \nBut the most discouraging reality in this upcoming election lies in our illusion of choice. Looking below the surface of the childish name-calling characteristic of contemporary politics, the moneyed influence of our nation’s largest corporations becomes apparent. \nTake, for instance, the fact that the top donors to Jeb Bush are the same as Hilary Clinton’s, i.e. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, the banking giants that were central to the 2008 financial and economic crisis. That crisis precipitated the collapse of the global economy with toxic mortgage securities and rigged credit ratings, which led to massive unemployment and homelessness. \nIt becomes apparent whose interests are being met by both party’s representatives when illuminating the sources of their campaign money. \nPrivate equity executive and Cuban refugee Miguel Fernandez’s donation of $3 million to Bush’s super PAC Right to Rise was followed by Bush’s criticism of Obama’s reconciliation with Cuba. And former Secretary of State Clinton’s campaign has received enormous amounts of money and lobbying from the biggest players in the fossil fuel industries. Her promise to focus on reducing fossil fuel dependence is weakened in light of her principal donors. \nAlmost all candidates’ support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, demonstrates the massive reach that moneyed interests have on our nation’s politics. This trade agreement is forecasted to move more jobs out of the United States in the all too familiar corporate race-to-the-bottom and gut environmental and consumer regulations that guarantee the safety of our planet and people for the benefit of big business. \nSo the question remains: Who, if anyone, is there that is not in the pocket of the affluent few and will fight to represent the interests and needs of everyday people and our communities? \nProgressive hopeful Bernie Sanders’ funding for his campaign stands out in sharp contrast from the political establishment’s candidates. Receiving the majority of his money from small donations given by everyday people, grassroots organizations and unions, the senator offers a glimmer of hope that there are still representatives of and for average citizens. \nHis ardent criticism of income inequality generated by corporate welfare is reflected in his voting record, in which he has proved his commitment to working towards a fairer and more equal future. His appeal is felt wherever he goes on the campaign trail with troves of people coming out to hear him speak. \nBut a disappointing reality is that some candidates are left out of the debate all together, even though their message is one that many people have been craving. Green Party candidate Jill Stein is one such candidate. \nStein has vocally made clear her platform to work for the betterment of ordinary citizens, whose voices have been stifled in the tumult of wealthy concerns. \nRunning in the 2012 presidential election on the Green Party ticket, Harvard-educated Stein put forth her program aimed at reforming our political and economic quandaries deemed the \"Green New Deal.\" The four-part program calls for an economic bill of rights that would protect against the interests of big business in politics while guaranteeing employment, healthcare, affordable housing and tuition-free college education; a transition to an economy that values environmental and social sustainability; reformation of our financial sector; and the reorganization of electoral politics to promote a truly democratic process. \nThe author is a Bloomfield resident and Montclair State University senior.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:05:42.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
