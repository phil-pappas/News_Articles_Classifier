Kim Davis and the Pope ChesusRice Well-Known Member Guess a private meeting didn't happen the way Davis and her Lawyer suggest \"The brief meeting between Mrs. Kim Davis and Pope Francis at the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, DC has continued to provoke comments and discussion. In order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired I am able to clarify the following points: \"Pope Francis met with several dozen persons who had been invited by the Nunciature to greet him as he prepared to leave Washington for New York City. Such brief greetings occur on all papal visits and are due to the Pope's characteristic kindness and availability. The only real audience granted by the Pope at the Nunciature was with one of his former students and his family. \"The Pope did not enter into the details of the situation of Mrs. Davis and his meeting with her should not be considered a form of support of her position in all of its particular and complex aspects ChesusRice Well-Known Member Her Lawyer last week showed a soccer stadium in Peru with 1 people in support of Kim Davis Problem is the photo was taken last year Her lawyer blames the government of peru for giving him the photo schuylaar Well-Known Member a random country..no connection?..it's like leaving the photo in a frame that you buy and tell everyone that's your family, boyfriend/girfriend etc..smacks of desperation. pnwmystery Well-Known Member \"After the huge blowback and resulting PR firestorm the Vatican endured for meeting with Kim Davis — the Kentucky county clerk who refuses to issue marriage licenses to LGBT couples — Pope Francis is expected to fire the church official who arranged the meeting. On Friday, the Vatican’s press office reiterated that the meeting with Davis was not meant to be interpreted as an endorsement of her views, but rather a simple exchange of pleasantries between the Pope and a group of admirers, one of whom happened to be Davis. The Vatican also emphasized that the only one-on-one meeting that Pope Francis had during his time in Washington, D.C. was with Yayo Grassi, a gay man and former student of the Pope’s. But the Vatican appears to go one step further to make it clear that the Holy See in no way endorses Kim Davis’ bigotry. Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, who arranged the Pope’s meetings in Washington (including the one with Kim Davis), is expected to be held responsible for blowback resulting from the meeting with Davis. According to the New York Times, Viganò is “likely to be removed at the first respectable opportunity” if blowback from the meeting with Davis continues to build.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:55:16.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
