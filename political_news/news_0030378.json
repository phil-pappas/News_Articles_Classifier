If we want to do our bit and be a responsible global player, we just have to do more. \n\"Response to climate disasters such as typhoon Koppu in the Philippines, as well as clean technology initiatives in developing countries, would come from this fund. \n\"The Green Climate Fund will have the capacity to help real people in real countries all over the world, but the National Government just doesn’t understand that we have a part to play. \n\"Even when we broaden the scope and look at all of our climate change related aid, including our initiatives in the Pacific, we contribute just a quarter of the amount most other developed countries do. \n\"First our emissions target, now our financial commitments? New Zealanders deserve a climate plan we can be proud of - and this just doesn’t suffice. \n\"I encourage New Zealand to step up in advance of the Bonn discussion around the Green Climate Fund, which will occur on Thursday. \n\"There are real lives at stake,\" said Mr. Shaw. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:24:28.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
