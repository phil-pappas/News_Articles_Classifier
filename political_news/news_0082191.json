Eubanks and Oakes were the top two vote getters among the 10 candidates in the Tuesday election, which was open only to the Sheriff’s Office’s 350 employees. Eubanks received 123 votes while Oakes got 52 votes. “None of the numbers are close enough for anything resembling a recount,” Okaloosa County Supervisor of Elections Paul Lux said. But a routine audit will be conducted on Monday to certify the results, he said. “For all intents and purposes, it’s a hand count of the ballots,” Lux said. Eubanks is a former lieutenant at the Sheriff’s Office who retired in April after 31 years with the agency. He remains an active member of the OCSO Mounted Posse and helps teach citizens firearms classes at the Sheriff’s Office firing range. Oakes spent 30 years in the Air Force before retiring as a colonel. He is active on the boards of Children in Crisis, the Air Force Association Education Foundation and the Emerald Coast Military Affairs Committee. Oakes and Eubanks will serve on the review board alongside two people appointed by Sheriff Larry Ashley and a fifth member chosen by the four. Oakes was one of four men Ashley offered as his preferred candidates for election to the board, before a judge ruled that the election had to be opened to all who qualified. It is unknown if Ashley has made his appointments. Tallahassee attorney R. Wayne Evans, who represents Ashley, did not return phone calls Wednesday. After the review board is established, its job is to hear the appeals of three former deputies – Rick Hord, John Lee and Jon Bush – who were fired in 2010. Pensacola attorney Eric Meade, who represents the deputies, said he and his clients view the review board process as “quite secondary” to their civil lawsuit. “They want their day in court,” Meade said. “That’s the bottom line. They don’t necessarily believe that this is it.” By KARI C.
