Bush did not keep the country safe since he was president during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Trump insisted he isn't \"blaming anybody,\" but repeatedly reminded Fox News viewers that the \"worst attack in the history of our country\" occurred on Bush's watch and suggested that the attacks could have been prevented. \"The fact is we had the worst attack in the history of our country during his reign. Jeb (Bush) said we were safe during his reign. That wasn't true,\" Trump said. \"And I'm not blaming anybody and I'm not blaming George Bush, although if you look at his three primary agencies, they hated each other, they weren't talking ... And a good leader would've made sure that they would get along and talk and lots of other things happen.\" Trump was referencing how top law enforcement and intelligence agencies including the CIA and the FBI weren't coordinating as closely as they do now in the run-up to the 9/11 attacks. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of Trump's rivals for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, said during the last Republican debate that his brother, the former president, \"kept us safe.\" Trump on Friday reopened that feud and challenged that assertion. Read More Jeb Bush responded swiftly after Trump's initial comments, calling the line \"pathetic.\" \"How pathetic for @realdonaldtrump to criticize the president for 9/11. We were attacked & my brother kept us safe,\" he tweeted. Trump also said Monday that tougher immigration policies like the ones he would implement if he became president would have thwarted the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Those hijackers entered the U.S. legally, but Trump said he would have implemented tougher visa standards to prevent their entry into the country in the first place. It's unclear what those standards would have been. Trump also said he would have had a \"massive whistleblower system\" to gain advance knowledge of the attacks. He did not explain how such a system would work. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:07:18.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
