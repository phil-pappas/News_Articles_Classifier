Wade Spees/Staff October 14, 2015 × Charleston’s mayoral candidates held their liveliest debate to date Thursday evening before a few hundred people inside the Sottile Theatre and many more watching at home.\nTo stay up-to-date on the race for Charleston’s next mayor, go to palmetto politics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android .\nAnd it may foreshadow how the race could get more bruising as the Nov. 3 election to replace longtime Mayor Joe Riley draws near.\nHighlights\nFirst dig\nDeerin threw the first punch at Stavrinakis. She said she believes the city must put in place infrastructure before new development. “But Stavrinakis said that was crazy. It would slow development,” Deerin said.\nBiggest gaffe\nGregorie, a City Councilman, said, “Mayor Riley has been a great leader not because of himself but because he’s always had a great City Council.”\nBiggest chuckle\nThere was time at the end of the debate for additional questions. Debate moderator Mark Hyman said, “You folks haven’t used all your time. Are you sure you’re politicians?”\nMost blatant Riley comparison\nThere are two.\nDeerin said she worked with Riley in different ways and at different times during his 40 years in office. “There is no Joe Riley on the stage, but I feel there is an imprint on me” in terms of leadership, she said.\nStavrinakis said, “You can’t try to be Mayor Riley, but you shouldn’t necessarily try to be different from Mayor Riley.”\nBest Quote: on race\nTecklenburg said, “It was great to bring a flag down from a flag pole, but what are we going to do from here?”\nLoudest applause\nTecklenburg supporters applauded, shouted and whistled after his closing statement, but that was in violation of the debate’s rules.\nMost confusing moment\nA question was submitted asking Deerin about Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who campaigned for her. But neither Deerin nor the audience seemed to understand the question.\nMost popular topics\nInfrastructure, race and gentrification\nBy Diane Knich and Robert Behre\nThursday’s debate differed in several ways: It was televised, lasted a relatively long 90 minutes and its questions were posed by College of Charleston political scientists, WCIV anchor Victoria Hansen and anonymous audience members.\nMost other forums have been quieter, less-attended affairs run by neighborhoods, nonprofits or business groups. And they have seen far fewer punches.\nGinny Deerin, founder of WINGS for Kids, criticized state Rep. Leon Stavrinakis for saying that requiring infrastructure to be put in place before development is “crazy” because it would slow development.\n“I think people are tired of leaders who are not willing to look to the future to invest in infrastructure and to have the political courage to provide funding,” she said, adding a friend in Shadowmoss was flooded out earlier this month.\nStavrinakis opted not to rebut Deerin’s barb, but he compared himself favorably to Riley.\n“We’ve seen how flooding can wreck lives, damage businesses and bring our community to a sudden halt,” he said. “What we need is a mayor like we have now who has shown that he can fund large infrastructure projects, which I have done.”\nThe other candidates also praised Riley and offered relatively limited ideas of how they would govern differently, if elected.\nCity Councilman William Dudley Gregorie said he would work more to enforce fair housing laws, while businessman John Tecklenburg vowed to conduct a performance audit of all city departments.\nToby Smith, director of Midland Park Community Ministries, said she would work harder on policies to battle gentrification, and former City Councilman Maurice Washington said he would focus more on core services.\nDeerin hit Stavrinakis again for voting against a gas tax increase as a state lawmaker earlier this year, adding, “I think he’s out of step and we’re stuck in traffic.”\nStavrinakis struck back the second time, noting the bill would not have helped the city’s bid to build Interstate 526 or finish major city drainage projects. “I am not going to raise your taxes to fund other parts of the state when we have critical needs here in Charleston,” he said.\nToward the end of the first hour, which was broadcast on both television and the Web, Deerin criticized Stavrinakis and Tecklenburg for taking contributions from The Beach Co., which is suing the city over its rejection of a Sergeant Jasper project.\n“The Beach Co. has become a very controversial development company,” she said, adding those contributions “put them in a position that’s a conflict or could be.”\nTecklenburg noted he opposed the company’s plans “and I have criticized their suing the city over the BAR (Board of Architectural Review).”\nStavrinakis said he was glad to see The Beach Co. pull its first controversial Sergeant Jasper redevelopment plan, adding, “I want to see the parties get back to the table and find a plan that works for the surrounding residents and the city as a whole.”\nWhile the audience was instructed to hold its applause, it increasingly failed to do so.\nGregorie drew chuckles from the audience twice by noting that the city’s progress under Riley also reflects on City Council, where he currently serves. “When anybody says anything good about our city, they’re talking about me,” he said.\nAll pledged to promote racial unity and work on lingering inequities between the city’s black and white population, and all pledged to work to support city schools, though they are run by the Charleston County School Board, not City Hall.\nGentrification, the loss of black residents and businesses downtown, also was a major theme. Smith said she doesn’t understand why a $400,000 house is built on the East Side next to a house that cost $70,000.\nWashington said, “It is unacceptable that there are no African-American business owners of any substance in our robust downtown business district.”\nAnd while candidates have agreed on several issues, such as the need to complete Interstate 526 and support public schools within the city limits, they have differed in the specifics of what they would do.\nIn the final 30 minutes, questions came from the audience and from social media. Those questions were more pointed and directed to single candidates, rather than the field.\nGregorie was asked about having a candidate in the race who has not lived in the city for 30 years. Though no candidate was named, Deerin recently moved into West Ashley after living on Sullivan’s Island.\nGregorie did not cite an opponent by name but said, “It does concern me considerably because it’s hard for me to understand how one can understand the problem of traffic from West Ashley when they haven’t been a part of it but for a very short period of time.”\nStavrinakis was asked about his role in appointing his brother Manny to the Medical University of South Carolina Board, but he said the question’s premise was false and he was glad to clear that up. “I have never nominated or voted for my brother or any family member for any position,” he said.\nSmith was asked about candidates who get contributions from outside the city limits, another apparently veiled reference to Deerin, who has had a major fundraiser in New York.\n“How fitting I would get that question since I’m the lady of $300 and proud of every penny,” she joked, a reference to her bare-bones campaign fundraising. “I’m proud of Ginny for the money she has raised. It’s a great step forward for women in this field.”\nReach Robert Behre at (843) 937-5771 or at twitter.com/RobertFBehre.", "external_links": ["https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palmetto-politics/id897497885?ls=1&mt=8", "http://www.nj.gov/oag/dcj/humantrafficking/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:46:46.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
