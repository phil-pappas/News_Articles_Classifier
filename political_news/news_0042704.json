The paper claims that government is behind the efforts to sabotage the opposition leader. \nBut a deputy communications Minister, Felix Kwakye-Ofosu has dismissed the claim describing it as astonishing and a deliberate misinformation. \nSpeaking on Morning Starr Wednesday, Mr. Kwakye Ofosu told host Nii Arday Clegg that the allegations must be ignored by well-meaning Ghanaians. \n\"There is no, absolutely no policy on the part of government to prevent him from being heard, it is impractical...it is not the first interview that Nana Addo has granted and I think that the management of Citi FM must distance themself from this deliberate campaign of misinformation,\" Kwakye-Ofosu said. \nHe added: “At no point in time has it been the policy of government, effected through any agency under it, to block access to an interview being done by an opposition leader. \n“In any event, the interview that he [New Crusading Guide’s Editor] is talking about was widely monitored and there was commentary run on it by various media platforms,” he stressed.
