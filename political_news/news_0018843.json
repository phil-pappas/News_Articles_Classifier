Steinem, who is about to release her memoir My Life on the Road , ​ s topped by the Hearst Tower on Wednesday night as part of the Hearst MasterClass interview series. The activist, organizer, and journalist dropped some serious wisdom in a one-on-one conversation with Cosmopolitan editor Joanna Coles that covered the election, gender pay gap, and reproductive rights. Here are some of her best Quote: s:\n On Hillary Clinton\n\"I would give [Hillary Clinton's campaign] 8 out of 10 ... she is just more experienced and braver than anyone else. \"\n\" ​I think she should have a button saying, 'I wasn't born a Clinton.' And I do wish that Bush hadn't had a son, the first Bush. But if it's OK to be a son, it's OK to be a spouse. ​\"\n\"Only she looks at the status of women and females everywhere as part of foreign policy. And this is especially crucial now because, for the first time that we know of, there are fewer females on Earth than males as a result of domestic violence in this country, sexualized violence in war zones, preference for male babies, FGM, child marriage ... and only she considers it. \"\nMore From Cosmopolitan \"[The Clintons] have a good marriage. I hope she's having a nice sex life, too.\" [ Joanna: \"Do you think she is?\" ] \"I have no idea, I'm always hoping for balance.\" ​\nOn Whether Carly Fiorina Is Good for Feminism\nShe's \"good for feminism because she demonstrates that it's not about biology, it's about consciousness. Bad for feminism because she doesn't represent the majority interests, even according to public opinion polls of women in this country.\"\nOn the Inability of Most GOP Candidates to Suggest a Woman to Put on the $10 Bill\n\"It just shows how much we need women's history, African-American history, gay and lesbian history. You know we are not learning history. We are learning about 10 percent of the country, so no wonder they don't know.\"\nOn Who Should Be on the $10 Bill Instead\n\"Sojourner Truth, because I thought she stood for universal adult suffrage.\"\n\" ​I thought it should be the $20 bill because that has Andrew Jackson, who was really the pits about Native Americans. He disobeyed the Supreme Court. He's the only president of the United States who has ever disobeyed the Supreme Court in order to banish Native Americans on the Trail of Tears. He was terrible. So I thought maybe we could replace him with Wilma Mankiller, who was the first woman chief of the Cherokee Nation and I thought that would be kind of symbolic. ​\"\nOn How Women's Rights Have Changed Since the 1970s\n\"It's really hard to generalize, because there's like five centuries existing simultaneously in this country ... Literally, we have people in this country who arrived yesterday, and people who have been here for 100,000 years. We have people who have been dealing with the residue of slavery and racism; we have people who don't even know slavery and racism exist. We have many different states of mind.\"\nOn American Conservatism\n\"The ultra-right wing has taken over one of our two great parties. I hope there are Republicans here, because I want to apologize to you for all the right-wing, old racist Democrats who came in and took over your party.\"\n\"The fact is that a lot of people have been born into a system that told them that they needed that kind of status. So now they are in full backlash, and it's why you get these very same groups that are against immigration, against sex education, against Planned Parenthood, contraception, safe and legal abortion ... it's the same groups. They're afraid, and they're powerful. And they could win. It depends what you and I do.\"\nOn Rethinking the Patriarchy\n\"All of our courses in economics should start with reproduction, not production.\"\n\"I had this thought that we should have this massive education campaign pointing out that the Pope and all of the other patriarchal religions that dictate to women in this way, accusing them of global warming. Because the human load on this Earth is the biggest cause of global warming, and that is because of forcing women to have children they would not on their own choose to have ... I'm glad the Pope spoke out about global warming and it was very helpful, but does he know he's causing it?\"\nOn Reproductive Rights and Whether Roe V. Wade Will Be Overturned\n\"It was been already overturned for poor women who are dependent on government funding. It has been already overturned for, say, women who are raped in other countries and are dependent on health services that are funded by us ... it's partly overturned, already.\"\n\"State legislatures take money away from universities, so people end up graduating in debt, and use it to build prisons, which we don't need. Most Americans don't know who their state legislators are. We have to pay much more attention to state legislators.\"\n\"​Reproductive rights are a fundamental human right, like freedom of speech.\" ​\nOn What Sex Meant to Her as a Young Woman\n\"It was dangerous not to be seen as a good girl. Sex was literally, I'm saying, important by its absence.\"\nOn the Gender Wage Gap\n\"Equal pay would be the single greatest econonic stimulus this country could possibly have. It would put $200 billion in the economy, way better than letting those bankers off the hook ... it would diminish government payments for dependent kids and poor women by actually allowing them to earn what they deserve. Those women are going to stimulate the economy by spending it – they are not going to put it in a Swiss bank account.\"\nOn Journalism Today\n\"What worries me the most is that there are more public relations journalists than journalists. There are more people devoted, arguably, to not telling the truth or shading the truth ... than actually reporting the truth.\"\nOn Playboy Announcing It Won't Publish Pornography Anymore\n\"They are so irrelevant.\"\n\"For Playboy to say they are no longer publishing nude photos of women is like the NRA saying we're not selling handguns anymore because there are machine guns and assault weapons so easily available.\"\nOn Donald Trump\n\"In real life, Donald Trump was born on third base and thinks he hit a triple. He had a very rich father, he's gone bankrupt four times, leaving people with millions and millions of dollars in debt.\"\n\"Suppose Donald Trump and Hugh Hefner did not exist. I imagine them, and I write a book about each one, just an imaginary novel. People would hang me from the tallest tree because they would say I was anti-male, oh this is ridiculous, nobody like this could possibly exist.\" ​\nOn Activism\n\"Being an organizer is like being a social entrepreneur.\" ​\nOn Advertising That Promotes Female Empowerment\n​\"It's a step forward, but you do not get liberated by buying something.\" ​\n​ On Aging and Time\n\"I worry that young women and men now think if they aren't successful by 30, that it's all over. No, it is definitely not over. No, I just have so much more I want to do, so much more to write, so much more I'm excited by.\"\n\"I regret wasting time, because time is all there is. I have wasted time by doing over what I already knew how to do, or not telling the truth, or not daring to start something that I really wanted to start, or doing what I knew people wanted me to do as opposed to what [I wanted to do].\"\n​ Follow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679456201"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:06:31.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
