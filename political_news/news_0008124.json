She threw punches at Bernie Sanders over his gun control record and his affection for the generous social safety net of Nordic countries. Sanders, by contrast, seemed more interested in attacking the economic status quo. Given a chance to criticize Clinton’s email scandal, he instead threw her a life preserver . \nClinton, like debate moderator Anderson Cooper, mostly ignored Jim Webb, Martin O’Malley and Lincoln Chafee—the three candidates on the stage below one percent in the polling averages—perhaps calculating that beating them down wasn’t worth the effort. But they didn’t ignore her. Reading off the playbook Barack Obama used against Clinton in 2008, the other candidates repeatedly needled Clinton for her vote in favor of the Iraq War. Unlike 2008, however, Clinton was ready with a response: “I recall very well being on a debate stage about 25 times with then-Sen. Obama debating this issue. After the election, he asked me to become secretary of State.” Story Continued Below \nBut was she—or someone else—tonight’s victor? Who was the biggest loser? And will Clinton’s performance reverse the erosion in her support seen over recent months? To help politico magazine ’s readers cut through the spin, we asked several of the nation’s premiere political strategists for their read on the debate. Their snap reactions are collected below. *** \n‘Hillary Clinton won by a mile’ By Ed Rollins, Republican political consultant \nHillary Clinton won by a mile. She is a veteran debater and it showed. She was articulate, her answers were thought through and she clearly defended herself when her opponents came after her. \nChafee was missing in action. O’Malley defended himself well on Baltimore. Sanders probably reinforced his socialist base, but no serious person could see him as a President. I think he was the biggest loser, but his answers were consistent with his philosophy. Jim Webb, a man I admired as a marine who served his country with heroism and as Secretary of the Navy during the Reagan administration, is going nowhere but his voice is important. \nThe bottom line is Hillary should not be underestimated. *** \n‘Debates can … solidify the existing hierarchy. That’s what we saw tonight’ By Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics \nClinton went into the debate the frontrunner and she came out exactly the same—probably strengthened in that role. Sanders went in as the chief challenger and he came out the same—likely reinforced in that role. O’Malley, Webb, and Chafee went in as also-rans, and their status is confirmed. \nClinton’s deep experience in debates shone brightly. She was better than at any similar forum in her previous campaign. Sanders’ strength of conviction was steely; the most liberal Democrats were thrilled. O’Malley, Webb, and Chafee all had decent, but not game-changing, moments. (If anybody inched up, it was O’Malley.) However, the trio has the satisfaction of proving “Saturday Night Live” wrong when they were called “the three mannequins from Jos. A. Banks.” \nDebates can generate a roller-coaster effect; ask this year’s Republicans. Debates can also solidify the existing hierarchy. That’s what we saw tonight. \nIf Joe Biden was looking for a reason to run, he’ll have to find it elsewhere. *** \n‘Bernie won the debate for Hillary’ By Bill Scher, senior writer at the Campaign for America’s Future \nBernie won the debate for Hillary. Both had solid performances. But when Bernie said “the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails,” the tension release in the room was palpable. He united the crowd and helped the Clinton campaign turn the page. Back in May, I wrote that Democratic voters wouldn't let the e-mail controversy rattle them because they have “ Clinton Fatigue Fatigue .” That hasn't seemed true over the summer, but it sure did tonight, because Bernie made it OK for Democrats to not care. \nHillary was eager to make the pragmatist case against Sanders, pointedly saying she is “a progressive who likes to get things done” and rejecting Sanders' dream of an America that emulates socialistic Denmark. When she tried a similar contrast with Barack Obama eight years ago, it went poorly. But that was against the backdrop of her Iraq war vote, and against a wilier opponent. It’s true that Clinton has sought to minimize daylight on Keystone and TPP. But these other responses show she doesn't believe she needs to go outside her ideological comfort zone to win the nomination. *** \n‘Sanders slowly revealed that he is likely going to be the Fabian Ron Paul of the Democratic 2016 race’ By Jonah Goldberg, conservative syndicated columnist and author \nHillary Clinton won. She was the best of the field, which is not exactly as high a compliment as it might sound given how abysmal everyone else was. Even Bernie Sanders slowly revealed that he is likely going to be the Fabian Ron Paul of the Democratic 2016 race. He will raise money off of his line that, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails!” but he also signaled that he’s not serious about doing what it takes to win. Whether that unseriousness is driven by cowardice or high-minded naïveté, I have no idea. \nThe question for Joe Biden is a vexing one. On the one hand, Hillary had a good night. On the other hand, the rest of the field seemed not ready for primetime (though Jim Webb was very impressive as he fought for a Truman-Kennedy party that no longer exists). Biden has to be saying to himself: I can mop the floor with those guys. The question is, at this point, is that enough? *** \n‘These other candidates cannot defeat Clinton unless she defeats herself’ Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball \nA big part of the decline in Hillary Clinton’s numbers over the last several months has been that she has been trapped in a recurring cycle of bad news. The falling poll numbers are a story. So are the private emails. And the Sanders surge and Biden’s shadow candidacy. Reasonable minds can disagree about whether she deserves a break, but she’s probably about to get one: Clinton was a clear winner in the debate and likely will be covered as one. There are more ups and downs to come but Tuesday night was a vivid reminder: These other candidates cannot defeat Clinton unless she defeats herself. The main landmines along the path to the nomination—the e-mails, the Clinton Foundation fundraising, Biden—remain in front of her. Whether they detonate is anyone’s guess. *** \n‘The clear loser tonight was Joe Biden’ By John Hudak, Brookings fellow in Governance Studies and author of the FixGov blog \nEveryone tries to focus on who wins a debate, but tonight, it is important to focus on who lost. The clear loser tonight was Joe Biden. Voters and prospective voters saw a group of individuals showing various hues of “readiness to lead.” They heaped upon Democratic voters plenty of red meat, touching on issues that matter to the party. They connected with voters at their level, showing empathy, understanding and sensitivity to the challenges that the average American faces. \nAbsent from that conversation, absent from that discussion of ideas, absent from that vision of the future was Joe Biden. His wheel spinning, his machinations about whether he should run ultimately left him in the dust. After tonight, Democratic voters aren’t hungry for an alternative. If anything, they are more confused about which one of a number of good options they have to pick from. The Democratic Party doesn’t want one additional choice; they want another look at a very satisfying menu before their waiter takes their order. *** \n‘Perhaps the biggest strategic winner was Joe Biden’ By Carrie Sheffield, Forbes contributor and senior writer at Opportunity Lives \nThe clear rhetorical winner tonight was Bernie Sanders (a truly terrifying thought, in my view, for the American taxpayer and broader society). Hillary Clinton held her own through a solid performance with no major blunders and a couple policy swipes at Sanders via gun control and economics. However, perhaps the biggest strategic winner was Joe Biden because Clinton was unable to definitively rout Sanders, who faces looming questions about mainstream appeal and general electability. Biden sitting at home watching these contenders may feel growing confidence after tonight that he may be able to split the middle of the Democratic Party, siphoning enough of Clinton’s support to forge a victory. A substantial push from Organizing for America alumni would help. \nGenerally, CNN executed the debate well, with great follow-up questions delivered with firmness by moderator Anderson Cooper. However, it was unfortunate that CNN allowed for such a divisive question on racial issues, e.g. whether Black Lives Matter or All Lives Matter. Such a limited worldview leaves little room for substantive dialogue and changes. \nMartin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb were generally weaker and unremarkable (Webb so much so that Cooper told him he was wasting his time!). This also gives Biden a greater potential to jump in given the narrowness of the race. *** \n‘It was most certainly not a good night for Joe Biden’ By Douglas Schoen, pollster for President Bill Clinton \nIt was not a good night for Joe Biden. Not a good night at all. \nTonight’s debate showed America that we have two credible, competent and enthusiastic Democratic candidates for president in former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders. \nIf Joe Biden was watching the debate looking for an opening, it’s not altogether clear that there is one for him. That’s not to say that Biden wouldn’t be a valuable addition to the field, but Clinton and Sanders made it clear that they are both strong on the issues and, at core, very appealing candidates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:52:45.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
