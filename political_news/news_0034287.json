It also said the disclosure of market-sensitive information could place a company at a competitive disadvantage.\nLabor and Greens MPs on the committee described the arguments used by Coalition MPs to justify the carve-out as \"absurd, illogical, and often lacking any evidence\".\n\"The ATO gave evidence during this inquiry that one in five private companies earning over $100 million do not pay any tax,\" they said in a dissenting report.\nThe committee has been examining legislation that would exempt about 800 privately held Australian companies from having their income tax payments included in a public report expected in 2015.\n\"This government should be making scrutiny of large Australian private companies a higher priority,\" the dissenting report by Labor and Greens MPs said.\nThe family that owns beef exporter Teys Australia told the committee it was worried it would be targeted by criminals on the basis of \"perceived wealth\" if details of its tax affairs were made public.\nThis followed concerns raised by Coalition MPs that revealing private wealth could make some Australians more vulnerable to kidnap attempts. But the majority report did not mention personal safety.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:51:19.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
