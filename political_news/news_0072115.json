This includes the power to increase local business rates, announced by the chancellor at the party conference. \nThe Bill was amended in the House of Lords to remove this condition, but members were warned this could scupper the legislation when it goes before the Commons. And Labour MPs were unconvinced by the extent of powers being granted to local authorities by the Bill, saying it “does not offer meaningful devolution”. \nChallenging these views, Mr Mann pointed to Cornwall’s own “historic devolution deal” as proof of the Bill’s potential. \n“For years we have had nationalists in Cornwall calling for a Cornish Assembly, blaming central Government for mismanagement and complaining about decisions being taken in London,” he said. \n“I am proud to say that within weeks of securing a blue Cornwall and a Conservative majority Government we put together the largest devolution package Cornwall has ever seen. \n“I welcome every local authority in the UK having the same powers that Cornwall has had.” \n“There have long been calls in Cornwall to pull up the hypothetical draw bridge over the Tamar and cut us off from Plymouth and the rest of Britain,” he added. “But we’re doing ourselves a disservice... if we continue to naval gaze. \n“As Superman’s father once said on Krypton ‘with great power comes great responsibility’. The Cornwall deal asks leaders to deliver. \n“I say to the leaders of Cornwall Council, the local enterprise partnership and Cornwall’s clinical commissioning group: now is your time. Show us your skill, show us you can deliver for Cornwall and I give you my word devolution will not stop here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:54:24.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
