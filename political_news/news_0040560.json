Ideology is the root cause — but the stakes are rising and that demands a new approach,” Mr Cameron will say. \nThe launch of the latest counter-extremism strategy follows a speech made by the prime minister in July, in which he set out what he described as a “full-spectrum response” to terrorism. \nThat speech was partly a reaction to the hundreds of young British Muslims who have travelled to Syria to fight for Isis, as well as to the “ Trojan Horse ” case last year in which it was alleged that extremists were planning to take over school boards in Birmingham. \nIn July, Mr Cameron said he would introduce curbs on non-violent extremism, including banning some preachers from spreading their message and strengthening the role of telecoms regulator Ofcom to take action against channels that broadcast extremist content. We know that extremism is really a symptom. Ideology is the root cause — but the stakes are rising and that demands a new approach \n- David Cameron \nAnother part of Mr Cameron’s strategy — influenced by those such as justice secretary Michael Gove — is that the government should “build resilience” in institutions such as schools, universities, prisons and charities to prevent the growth of extremism. \nOn Sunday, the prime minister said the UK would spend £5m on a network of grass-roots organisations that seek to prevent Islamist extremism, such as the Active Change Foundation, a youth centre in east London. \nThe “new approach” to tackle the “poison” of extremism, Mr Cameron said, required the government “to vigorously counter the ideology that underpins it; to take on the violent and non-violent parts of the creed; actively supporting the mainstream voices to rise above those of the extremists; and tackle the segregation and feelings of alienation that can help provide fertile ground for extremist messages to take root.” \nThere were 338 arrests related to counter-terrorism in the past 12 months, of which 157 were linked to Syria and 56 were of people under 20 years old, according to Home Office statistics. \nAbout 25,000 foreign fighters are estimated to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join the jihad, and about 700 of these are thought to be from Britain. Roughly half of these people have now returned to the UK.
