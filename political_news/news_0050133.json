Marco Rubio, former technology executive Carly Fiorina, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\nCNBC will host an \"undercard\" debate at 6 p.m. for those who didn't place in the top 10 in recent national polls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:56:29.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
