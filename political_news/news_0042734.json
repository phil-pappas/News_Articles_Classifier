This special event is part of Bar Louie's month long campaign to raise money for breast cancer awareness.\nBeginning at 5 p.m. , the indoor / outdoor event will feature a multitude of festivities, revving it up at 6 p.m. with Zumba class along with raffles and goodie bags for breast cancer survivors and will feature The Think Pinkâ„¢ Martini ( $1 from each purchase will be donated to breast cancer research during the month of October). The evening entertainment includes DJ Cheeks starting at 7 p.m. and a memory lantern lighting at 9 p.m.\nThe cause certainly resonates with the team at Bar Louie, as their General Manager, Sylvia Clark , waged her own battle with breast cancer a few years ago. \"When going through something as unimaginable as breast cancer, it makes you recognize how imperative it is to support our friends and neighbors right in our own community that are fighting breast cancer. We are honored to help Ms. Rodriquez,\" says Clark. Bar Louie will donate 20% of sales on Saturday, October 17th during the event to Pilar Rodriquez for medical expenses. \"We are hopeful that the community will come out to support this amazing woman with us.\"\nFounded in downtown Chicago in 1990, Bar Louie is a bar and eatery with a casual, social atmosphere. Known for their handcrafted signature martinis, they also feature an exceptional selection of appetizers, flatbreads, salads, burgers and sandwiches. While beer and wine lovers will be impressed with the extensive selection of imports, beers on tap and 20 wines by the glass, cocktail drinkers will revel in the 34 signature martinis, mojitos, margaritas and sangrias made from premium liquors, fresh fruit and hand squeezed juices.\nBar Louie is open daily for lunch, dinner and late night dining from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Monday through Sunday with the entire menu available until last call.
