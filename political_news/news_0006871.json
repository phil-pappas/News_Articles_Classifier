More A bump in the road to improved ties \nThe prime minister believes the Leave campaign are peddling a false premise in an attempt to minimise the risks in the minds of voters contemplating voting for Brexit. \nIn a sign that Mr Cameron is gearing up to lead the campaign for Britain to stay in the EU - even before the outcome of his renegotiation - he permitted his aides to brief Sunday newspapers that there would only be one referendum. \nA senior aide to the prime minister put out a statement saying it was simply “not credible” to suggest that a majority of the electorate could vote to leave the EU, only for the government and EU to re-enter discussions to try to find a way to keep the UK in. \nAccording to the Observer the aide was speaking with the full authority of the prime minister. \nThe aide said: “Some of those advocating ‘leave’ are suggesting that the referendum is just the first half and that if the majority of the UK public voted to leave, then the UK government would have a stronger hand to embark on a second negotiation with the rest of the EU and hold a second referendum. \n“The prime minister is clear that is simply not going to happen. From the outset, he has been clear this will be a straightforward in/out choice. Leave means leave.” \nHe implied that those suggesting such an approach were trying to mislead people into thinking a No vote was not a risk, and accused them of lacking conviction about the merits of their own case. \n“Trying to muddy the waters as they are, and suggest that we can have a second chance if we vote to leave, suggests that the Leave campaign lacks confidence in its own case and is worried about the risks. Otherwise, it would unambiguously advocate a clean exit.” \nMr Cameron says he wants Britain to stay in a reformed EU but has “ruled nothing out” if he fails to get a better deal. His renegotiating efforts will come to a head at a Brussels summit in December. \nSome EU countries want to try to reach a deal with Britain at that summit. “Let’s just get it out of the way,” said the ambassador of one EU member state in London. “Europe has lots of other things to worry about.” \nLast week Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, gave a qualified vote of support for Britain’s continued EU membership, with the full support of Mr Cameron. \nThe governor said EU membership had helped to make Britain more “dynamic” and open, although he said it had also left the country exposed to more economic shocks and that close coordination of financial regulation was vital.
