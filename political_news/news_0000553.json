The 75-acre facility maintains as much “normalcy” as possible. That means no bars on the windows, kitchens fully equipped with sharp objects, and friendships between guards and inmates. For Norway, removing people’s freedom is enough of a punishment.\nLike many prisons, Halden seeks to prepare inmates for life on the outside with vocational programs: woodworking, assembly workshops, and even a recording studio.\nHalden isn’t an anomaly either. Bastoy prison is also quite nice .\nYouTube/John Stark The recording studio at Halden prison.\nAs Bastoy prisoner governor Arne Wilson, who is also a clinical psychologist, explained to The Guardian :\nIn closed prisons we keep them locked up for some years and then let them back out, not having had any real responsibility for working or cooking. In the law, being sent to prison is nothing to do with putting you in a terrible prison to make you suffer. The punishment is that you lose your freedom. If we treat people like animals when they are in prison they are likely to behave like animals. Here we pay attention to you as human beings.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmfHnbPz8ow", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g56susrNQY", "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/545102cfecad042f17f684de-1200-600/halden-prison-28.png", "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/migrant-28.jpeg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/tour-of-halden-prison-2014-10", "http://www.businessinsider.com/bastoy-prison-tour-2014-10"], "published": "2015-09-30T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:42:02.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
