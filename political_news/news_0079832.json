More May takes tough line on ‘mass’ immigration \nGeorge Osborne has been negotiating devolution deals with “city regions” — groups of councils in and around large cities. The Sheffield city region is the latest to sign a deal — which depends on it agreeing to an elected mayor — and there are talks with north-east England, Liverpool, West Yorkshire and the West Midlands. Some 38 areas have bid for deals. \n“There is no rationale for restricting devolution to the biggest conurbations, or for insisting on . . . new governance models in return for greater powers. After all, the fundamental belief underpinning devolution is that decisions are best made locally — not that decisions are better the larger you are,” the report said. \nThe 26 have a combined output of £163bn and a population of 7.9m, making up 11 per cent of the UK economy. Since 2008 they have grown 1 per cent a year, compared with 0.6 per cent for the 10 large cities that form the “Core Cities” group. \nPhilip Blond of Respublica , the Conservative-leaning think-tank that co-authored the report, said these smaller cities had “unique strengths” in sectors that are vital for UK growth. \nThey include biotechnology in Cambridge, engineering in Derby and business services in Milton Keynes. \nHe said they were also better placed to reform public services. \nThe report advocates for cities to receive five-year funding deals so they can plan and borrow. It also opposes the idea of elected mayors spanning local authority boundaries that Mr Osborne has said are a condition of regional devolution. \nThe 26 cities earned an estimated £50.7bn in revenues in 2012/13 with total spending exceeding revenues by £7bn, a deficit of 12 per cent, above the 9 per cent for England and Wales as a whole. Only nine generate more tax revenues than they spend. \nHowever, the report said that public service reform could save between £1.8bn and £3.5bn while devolution could add £1.6bn to their economies annually. \nMr Osborne’s plan to let cities keep business rates could also help. \nJim O’Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist who is now a minister, has argued that only boosting the 15 biggest cities would have a measurable impact on economic growth, about £80bn annually. \nHowever, Greg Clark, the local government secretary, said he was listening to their devolution demands and that the group of smaller cities was critical to growth. \n“I would encourage them all, individually and collectively, to ensure that they continue to influence negotiations to ensure they deliver the powers and flexibility they need to maximise their economic growth.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:24:20.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
