At the moment the Syrian forces is holding a full control of the village but the clashes are going in the neighbouring area.\nSeparately, the militants launched a counter-attack at the strategic town of Jubb Al-Ahmar in the Prophet Jonah (Jabal Nabi Younis) of northeastern Latakia, resulting in a series of intense firefights between them and the civilian-led (NDF) this morning. Unfortunately for the militants, the SAA were able to defend the town after a series of firefights and airstrikes from the Russian Air Force. This resulted in the death of over 20 militants from Harakat Ahrar Al-Sham, Jabhat Al-Nusra, and Liwaa Suqour Al-Ghaab.\nElsewhere, the Syrian Armed Forces have been continuing their advance inside the town of Salma, capturing more building blocks from Jabhat Al-Nusra at the southern district. As the clashes are going between the SAA and Jabhat Al-Nusra, both parties will strive to gain the upper-hand in Jabal Al-Akrad (Kurdish Mountains).\nA Russian airstrike killed a top al-Qaeda commander, Abdul Mohsen Abdallah Ibrahim al-Charekh, a Saudi better known as Sanafi al-Nasr, and two other fighters in Syria, reports said on Saturday. He was reportedly killed Thursday in an airstrike near the northern Syrian town of Dana, along with another Saudi and a Moroccan member of al-Qaeda’s local affiliate, known as Jabhat Al-Nusra.\nVisit us: http://southfront.org/\nFollow us on Social Media:\nhttp://google.com/+SouthfrontOrgNews\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SouthFrontENTwo\nhttps://twitter.com/southfronteng\nOur Infopartners:\nhttp://www.sott.net/\nhttp://thesaker.is\nhttp://fortruss.blogspot.com\nhttp://in4s.net\nhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaV1&#8230;", "http://www.globalresearch.ca/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BK5U7O13CRo", "https://twitter.com/southfronteng", "https://www.facebook.com/SouthFrontENTwo", "http://southfront.org/", "http://southfront.org/donate", "http://fortruss.blogspot.com/", "http://thesaker.is/", "http://in4s.net/", "http://google.com/+SouthfrontOrgNews", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaV101EM1QayFkP0E7zwXCg?sub_confirmation=1", "http://www.sott.net/"], "published": "2015-10-18T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:08:40.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
