Sadly, it’s easy ,” I had to check the date of the paper to be sure it wasn’t left over from the 20th century. Mr. Mathews’s support for “self-contained classes” — school-system-speak for segregation — for placement of a student with a disability ignored that special education is a service, not a place. Modern practice uses “ natural supports ” to help people with disabilities.\nMr. Mathews disregarded the years of effort at integration and inclusion of students with disabilities and perpetuated the archaic but still prevalent attitude that out-of-sight-out-of-mind is the best way to deal with people with disabilities.\nAlso, the lack of people-first language (“disabled student” instead of “student with a disability”) defines people by their disability.\nMike McLaughlin , Laurel", "external_links": ["http://www.arcind.org/supports-services/natural-supports-community-connections/"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:35:54.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
