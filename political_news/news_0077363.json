Working independently, the Second Screen can be set up as an “always on” display and this supposedly does not affect the battery life. Set the Second Screen to display the weather, time, date and battery icon when the main display is off. With the main display on, the Second Screen can be set to convert to a dedicated launching area for shortcuts or your favorite apps. While you’re enjoying a movie or game on the V10, the Second Screen will notify you discreetly without blocking your view when a call or text comes in.\nDual Front Cameras and Multi-view Recording\nThe LG V10 features 5MP Dual Front Cameras with two separate lenses to capture standard 80 degree selfies or perfect wide angle selfies of 120 degrees, without the need to pan the smartphone which increases the likelihood of camera shake. Multi-view recording can capture different angles utilizing all three cameras on the V10. Select and insert the version that looks best in your masterpiece. With its Manual Video Mode, you can easily create professional-quality videos by adjusting options such as shutter speed, frame rate, ISO, white balance and focus while recording. Videos can be recorded in three resolutions — HD, FHD or UHD — and two aspect ratios — 16:9 standard or 21:9 cinematic.\nSteady Record: Utilizes electronic image stabilization (EIS) optimized for recording video to neutralize shake, helping to capture sharper video footage when in motion Snap Video: Create one video by combining many shorter videos Auto Edit: create a short video highlight clip by automatically eliminating blurred frames and static scenes Quick Video Editor: easily trim or change the frame rate and add after-effects, such as colors and background music Quick Share: when finished recording, a pop-up appears on the display showing options of popular social networks to make video sharing even easier and faster Audio Monitor: adjust the sensitivity of the three microphones during video recording and directly monitor and control audio input, including directional recording capability to highlight sound from one particular location Wind Noise Filter: eliminate external wind noise for high-quality sound when shooting video outdoors V10 owners can shoot as much 4K video as they want. And with the 3,000mAh removable battery, you can always be ready with a second or third replacement battery to pop in if you ever run low on power while shooting. And with Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 technology built-in, it only takes 40 minutes to get a 50 per cent charge. ​ Durability and Design\nIts Dura Guard frame firmly secures the display to protect the phone from hard bumps and tumbles. The V10’s frame is composed of SAE grade 316L stainless steel, the same tough, hypoallergenic material used to make surgical tools and high-end watches. Because the edges and corners are the most vulnerable areas of a phone, the extra protection provided by the Dura Guard frame ensures maximum durability.\nOn the back and bottom of the display, resilient but soft Dura Skin offers added protection from direct impacts to the device. Dura Skin is soft to the touch but also is highly resistant to nicks and scratches. What’s more, the back grid pattern was designed specifically to offer a more secure grip, even when you’re on the go. Independent testing and certification firm MET Laboratories tested the LG V10 by dropping it from height of 48 inches repeatedly at different angles and found it to be “MIL-STD-810G Transit Drop Compliant” for shock.\nThe V10 features 32 bit Hi-Fi DAC by ESS Technology, designers of high-performance audio products for professionals. The LG V10 automatically detects connected devices and provides sound control options which can be customized. And the LG V10 is the first commercial device to utilize Qualcomm Technologies TruSignal antenna boost technology designed to intelligently optimize signal strength at all times for fewer dropped calls, faster data and better call coverage, no matter how the phone is held.\nAccess and Security\nAlong with the popular Knock Code, the LG V10 features a new fingerprint sensor to unlock the smartphone and turn on the display simultaneously. The sensor also works with Android Pay in the United States to make purchases as quick and easy as possible.\nKey Specifications:\nChipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 Processor Display: Main) 5.7-inch QHD IPS Quantum Display (2560 x 1440 / 513ppi) Secondary) 2.1-inch IPS Quantum Display (160 x 1040 / 513ppi) Memory: 4GB LPDDR3 RAM / 64GB eMMC ROM / microSD (up to 2TB) Camera: Rear) 16MP with F1.8 Aperture / OIS 2.0 Front) 5MP Dual Lens (80 o Standard Angle / 120 o Wide Angle) Battery: 3,000mAh (removable) OS: Android 5.1.1 Lollipop Size: 6 x 79.3 x 8.6mm Weight: 192g Network: LTE-A Cat. 6 Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a, b, g, n, ac / Bluetooth 4.1 / NFC / USB 2.0 Colors: Space Black / Luxe White / Modern Beige / Ocean Blue / Opal Blue technology Mobiles and tabs LG Also Read Google going where no search engine has gone before: Amit Singhal Update: Xiaomi Redmi 1S launch in India delayed, listed on Flipkart ASUS announces Strix GTX 980 Ti in India Air passenger pays $1,200 internet bill", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccanchronicle.com/151001/technology-mobiles-and-tabs/article/lg-uveils-new-phablet-dual-front-cameras", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/lg-new_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/lg-new_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:40:42.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
