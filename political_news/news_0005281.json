But speakers said the push against the practice is not over in New Mexico.\nPolice in Albuquerque, for example, are still confiscating cars from suspected drunken drivers under a city ordinance, and task forces of local and federal law enforcement officials can still seize property in federal court.\n“The Legislature has done nothing for the most egregious group,” Albuquerque lawyer Diego Esquibel said, referring to the city, one of several jurisdictions in the state that allow police to take vehicles from repeat drunken driving suspects. “They are not going to follow this state law. They just don’t care.”\nThe Charles Koch Institute hosted the forum on civil asset forfeiture with the ACLU of New Mexico and the Rio Grande Foundation.\nVikrant Reddy, a senior researcher at the institute and a panelist at the forum, said New Mexico’s law created momentum for stopping civil asset forfeiture. “That story is being told throughout the country,” he said.\nBut New Mexico’s amended forfeiture law doesn’t mean seizures have ended.\nIn addition to taking the vehicles used by suspected repeat drunken drivers, an Albuquerque ordinance also calls for police to take the vehicle when the driver’s license has been suspended or revoked because of a DWI.\nCelina Espinoza, an Albuquerque Police Department spokeswoman, said that the DWI seizure practice is allowed despite the recent changes to state law, and that police no longer participate in “federal forfeiture proceedings.”\nThe city made $1.2 million from the DWI seizure program in the 2015 fiscal year and $1.4 million the year before, according to city records. The money comes from either charging owners tow, administrative and storage fees to get their vehicles back, or taking ownership of the vehicles and selling them at auction. In the 2014 fiscal year, the city also received $1 million as a result of seizures in federal court stemming from cases Albuquerque police officers were involved in, according to city records.\nRep. Conrad James, R-Albuquerque, told the forum that more work has to be done with state and federal laws to ensure that property won’t be taken from people who haven’t been convicted of crimes and that money from seizures won’t be used to pad police budgets.\n“I do think public safety has to be first. Taking the vehicle of someone who has been convicted of a DWI is something we have focused on. But again, it requires a conviction,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:25:51.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
