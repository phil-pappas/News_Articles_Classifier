Lindgren will be joined for the event by fellow Expedition 45 crew members NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Kimiya Yui .\nMedia interested in covering the event at the school must contact John Torre at 571-423-1200. Robinson Secondary School is located at 5035 Sideburn Road in Fairfax . The time of the call is subject to change depending on real-time station operations and weather conditions in the Fairfax area. Media should confirm the event with the school before arrival.\nLindgren and Yui arrived at the space station on July 23 for a five-month mission. Kelly is halfway through a year-long mission on the station. During Expedition 45, the station crew will conduct more than 250 science investigations in fields such as biology, Earth science, human research, physical sciences and technology development.\nThis in-flight education downlink is an integral component of the NASA Education Office effort to improve science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teaching and learning in the United States . Linking students directly to astronauts aboard the space station provides them with an authentic, live experience of space exploration, space study and the scientific components of space travel, while introducing them to the possibilities of life in space.\nFor NASA TV streaming video, schedule and downlink information, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/nasatv\nFor education resources related to the International Space Station, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/education/stemstation\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/virginia-students-to-speak-live-with-space-station-crew-300152822.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nasa.gov/education/stemstation", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/virginia-students-to-speak-live-with-space-station-crew-300152822.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20081007/38461LOGO", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC17747&Transmission_Id=201510011349PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC17747&DateId=20151001", "http://www.nasa.gov/nasatv", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:39:53.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
