(Photo: AFP) Zurich : FIFA's ethics watchdog on Thursday suspended the two most powerful men in football, Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, for 90 days in a sensational new blow to the sport's scandal-tainted governing body.\nWhile it said the bans were \"provisional\", the action almost certainly signals the end of the reign of FIFA president Blatter and deals a major blow to UEFA leader Platini's hopes of taking over.\nOn another chaotic day for football, FIFA's independent ethics committee also banned South Korean tycoon, Chung Mong-Joon, also a candidate for the FIFA presidency, for six years. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke, already ordered to leave the world body over a separate ticketing scandal, was also suspended for 90 days.\nThe four football powerbrokers \"are banned from all football activities on a national and international level. The bans come into force immediately,\" said a statement.\nAs mandated by article 32 (6) of the FIFA Statutes, Issa Hayatou, as the longest-serving vice-president on FIFA’s Executive Committee, will serve as Acting President of FIFA.\nBlatter and French football legend Platini have faced mounting pressure since Swiss prosecutors started an investigation into the veteran FIFA president for criminal mismanagement.\nPlatini, who has run UEFA, has been named in the investigation because of a two million dollar payment he received in 2011. The Frenchman earlier demanded an inquiry into the circumstances of the investigation against him.\nThe suspensions can be renewed for another 45 days when they run out in January, which would take the exclusion until just before the FIFA election to be held on February 26.\nThat could rule out Platini, although it would be up to FIFA's electoral committee to decide whether he can stand. Chung, who was also fined 100,000 Swiss francs, would be automatically ruled out of the presidential race. The scion of the Hyundai family was found to have contravened rules while lobbying for South Korea's bid for the 2022 World Cup which was awarded to Qatar in a controversial 2010 vote. Chung has threatened to take legal action over the ban.\nFIFA's crisis has been mounting since May when US authorities issued charges against 14 FIFA officials and sports marketing executives over more than $150 million in bribes given for broadcasting and marketing contracts.\nSeven FIFA officials were detained at a Zurich hotel two days before Blatter was re-elected for a fifth term on May 30. As the storm grew, Blatter announced that he would stand down, but only when the election is held. Rivals have accused him since of seeking to cling to power.\nBlatter said in an interview with a German magazine this week that he was determined to stay until February 26. \"I am convinced that evil will come into the light and good will triumph,\" he said.\nPlatini and Chung have said they are victims of a campaign, which they suspect comes from within FIFA, to derail their bids to become FIFA president.\nMedia across Europe had predicted that the 90 days suspensions would be made. Platini called it an \"insidious\" leak that appeared to come from an official FIFA source.\nHe said it \"is essentially an attempt to damage my reputation\" and that FIFA has \"flouted\" its own rules.\nPlatini said he had still registered his official papers to be a candidate in the FIFA race on Thursday. The deadline for candidates is October 26.\nChung said on Monday at a London sports convention that he was the victim of a \"smear\" campaign by Blatter who he described as \"a hypocrite and a liar.\" He threatened legal action against Blatter for \"embezzlement\" by not declaring his salary and also in case he was stopped from running in the election.\nPrince Ali bin al Hussein, a former FIFA vice-president from Jordan, and Zico, a former Brazilian footballer and sports minister, are also in the election.\n football FIFA Sepp Blatter Michel Platini Chung Mong-Joon Jerome Valcke Who after Sepp Blatter? 7 men in race for FIFA’s top job, Indian-American amongst them Loading... Please Wait 1/7 Sunil Gulati, India/USA, 55: Allahabad-born Gulati, who has played a key role in the development of soccer in the United States in the past few decades, could be a potentially strong contender to replace Blatter, should the US have an interest in the position of FIFA chief. (Photo: AP/ File) 2/7 Michel Platini, France, 59: The current UEFA president was once close to Blatter but they gradually drifted apart. Platini is considered one of the greatest footballers ever, playing 72 times for France and leading them to victory in the 1984 European championships. (Photo: AP) 3/7 Prince Ali bin Al Hussein, Jordan, 39: Sepp Blatter said the 73 votes Prince Ali collected in the first round of voting proved to Blatter that he no longer had the backing of the world. Prince Ali may take another shot at the position but he is unlikely to run if his mentor Platini does. (Photo: AP) 4/7 Jerome Champagne, France, 56: The former French diplomat worked at FIFA for 11 years and rose to the position of deputy secretary general before leaving in 2010. He was the first to declare his candidacy for the 2015 race but had to pull out because he did not get the required five nominations. (Photo: AFP/ File) 5/7 Wolfgang Niersbach, Germany, 64: Now the president of the German Football Association, he was elected to the FIFA executive committee this year and would bring a modern reformist approach to FIFA while fostering global cooperation. He also made no secret that he supported Ali in the recent vote. (Photo: AFP/ File) 6/7 Domenico Scala, Italy/Switzerland, 50: If anyone from within FIFA was to stand a chance of a shot at the top job, it could be the authoritative Swiss-Italian businessman, who has been independent chairman of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee since May 2012. In 2004, he was named \"Young Global Leader\" by the World Economic Forum (WEF). (Photo: AFP/ File) 7/7 Jerome Valcke, France, 54: If Valcke thought he might follow Blatter into the presidential office in the way that Blatter followed Joao Havelange, he probably should think again. He is seen as too close to Blatter to be a credible alternative.
