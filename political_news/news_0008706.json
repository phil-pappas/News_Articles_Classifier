(AP Photo/Martin Meissner)\nAssociated Press Oct. 16, 2015 | 10:18 a.m. EDT + More BERLIN (AP) â€” The German government is under pressure to respond to reports that the country's intelligence agency spied on the U.S. and other allies.\nGerman media, including weekly Der Spiegel and public broadcaster rbb-Inforadio, reported that the BND spy agency eavesdropped on targets in the United States and Europe until the fall of 2013.\nThe claim is particularly sensitive because of Chancellor Angela Merkel's pronouncement in October 2013, following reports her cellphone had been tapped by U.S. intelligence, that \"spying among friends, that's just wrong.\"\nGerman government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters Friday that \"the chancellor's pronouncement is valid, and naturally it was also valid when she said it for the first time.\"\nHe declined to say whether the assertion was true before October 2013.\nOpposition lawmakers called for a comprehensive probe.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
