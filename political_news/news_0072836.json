He quotes Pope Francis' recent remarks to Congress about the arms trade being motived by \"money that is drenched in blood.\" \nCupich speculates the pope's comments could apply to domestic weapons sales too. The original intent of the Second Amendment, he says, \"has been perverted by those who, as Pope Francis recently commented, have profited mightily.\" \nHe says the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has consistently called for reasonable regulation of guns. \nInformation from: Chicago Tribune, http://www.chicagotribune.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:05:23.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
