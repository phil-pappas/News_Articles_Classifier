I won't let even PM (Modi) sleep peacefully,\" Kejriwal told reporters after meeting Lt. Governor Najeeb Jung, referring to the former Delhi chief minister.\n\"Why didn't he (Modi) visit the families of rape victims when he can go abroad?\" the Aam Aadmi Party leader asked.\nThe remarks came after a toddler and a five-year-old child were raped in two separate incidents here. Kejriwal announced a special meeting on Monday of the cabinet over women safety.\n \nALSO READ:  Capital shame: Two minors gangraped in Delhi Dikshit, who ruled Delhi for 15 years before being defeated by Kejriwal, faced public wrath over the gang-rape and death of a 23-year-old woman here in 2012.\nShe had then pleaded helplessness citing that Delhi Police was not under her control -- an issue which continues to be a sore point between Delhi's AAP government and the central government.\nKejriwal said Delhi Police, which reports to the union home ministry, had become ineffective because of which there was no fear among criminals.\n\"Give Delhi Police to us for a year and see how we fix it.
