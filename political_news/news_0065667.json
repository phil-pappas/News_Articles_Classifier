(HELM) £200,000. The company made more than six million calls as part of an automated campaign offering \"free\" solar panels.\nThe ICO's head of enforcement, Steve Eckersley, said: \"This company's ignorance of the law is beyond belief.\n\"It didn't even bother to find out what the rules were and its badly thought-out marketing campaign made people's lives a misery.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1030F/production/_86291366_coldcall.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:04:10.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
