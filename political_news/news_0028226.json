JACQUELYN MARTIN — AP Photo \nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday offered qualified praise for President Barack Obama's decision to reverse the withdraw of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. \nObama's decision, a change from his desired strategy of ending the country's longest ongoing military conflict before he leaves office, was well received by military leaders in the region, the Kentucky Republican told the Herald-Leader. \n\"I will give the president credit for finally getting to the right place on Afghanistan,\" McConnell said, adding that the president only got there after \"three agonizing years\" of trying to end U.S. involvement. \nMcConnell, who was in Afghanistan meeting with soldiers, military and Afghan officials the day Obama made the announcement, said that \"in Afghanistan, they think they've got it won and everybody's in favor of what the president announced Friday.\" \nJoined by U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, R-Lexington, and other lawmakers, McConnell visited Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan and Israel, and what he saw led him to continue his criticism of the Obama administration's foreign policy. \n\"I think the best way to sum it up is that we've got problems everywhere,\" McConnell said. \"There wasn't a single place that we went that was happy w¬¬ith American leadership.\" \nThe senator said he thinks leaving residual forces in Afghanistan is the only way to avoid a fate there like the \"meltdown\" that is happening in Iraq. \nMcConnell argued that \"the single biggest mistake the president made was not leaving a residual force behind in Iraq.\" \nWhen the Herald-Leader pointed out that the Bush administration agreed to the status of forces agreement that led to the pull-out from Iraq, McConnell acknowledged that \"there's a lot of finger pointing about that.\" \n\"What everybody agrees on  outside of the White House  regardless of the finger pointing, it was a mistake,\" he said. \nWhen asked if he favors an open-ended troop presence in Afghanistan, McConnell pointed to other countries where U.S. troops have remained following conflict, calling the decision to leave bases in those countries a \"proven tactic.\" \n\"How about we're still in Germany, we're still in Korea, we're still in Japan. It worked out pretty well,\" McConnell said. \"It doesn't mean that they're in an ongoing military engagement.\" \nMcConnell said the security situation in Iraq is \"not good, and \"as a result of our departure, Iraq's security force is not much of a force.\" \nBut McConnell said he is not advocating a return to Iraq, and restoring security to the country will be the responsibility of Iraqis. \n\"We're not going to refight the Iraq war,\" he said. \"These guys are going to have to get better in order to reclaim the country. I hope they can.\" \nMcConnell said U.S. and Afghan leaders have seen what happened in Iraq, and they are happy that Obama is not proceeding with his plans to complete the withdrawal in Afghanistan. \n\"They all want us to stay,\" he said. \"They don't want to throw away the gains that have been made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:00:37.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
