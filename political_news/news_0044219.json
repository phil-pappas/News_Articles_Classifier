I said, ‘Well, I think we should make one more pass with another [drone] to see if it is [bin Laden],’” Biden said Tuesday at a Washington event honoring former Vice President Walter Mondale, Business Insider reported. “And the reason I did that is I didn’t want to take a position to go, if that was not what [Obama] was going to do.” \nBiden then said he and Obama held a private discussion. \n“So as we walked out of the room, and walked upstairs, I told him my opinion. I thought he should go, but to follow his instincts,” said Biden. \nWhen it comes to goofy gaffes and dimwitted declarations, nobody does it better than America’s most beloved uncle figure, smilin’ Joe Biden. “Biden Time: Crazy Uncle Joe In His Own Words” chronicles his most memorably moronic or misfired quotes over the last 40-plus years \nThe vice president’s new version of events differs from what he told lawmakers in 2012. \n“Mr. President, my suggestion is, don’t go,” Biden told Democrats at a Cambridge, Maryland, retreat, the New York Times reported Jan. 30, 2012. \nBiden’s remarks also differ from his potential rival for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \nClinton told CNN moderator Anderson Cooper Oct. 13 during the Democrats’ first presidential debate from Las Vegas, Nevada, that she was one of a “few advisers” who gave a definitive answer on the bin Laden raid, the Hill reported Tuesday. \nThe former secretary of state also noted Biden’s reluctance to use SEAL Team 6 that night in her 2014 book “Hard Choices.” \n“I respected Bob [Gates] and Joe [Biden]‘s concerns about the risks of a raid, but I came to the conclusion that the intelligence was convincing and the risks were outweighed by the benefits of success. We just had to make sure it worked,” Clinton wrote, CNN reported. \nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest refused to get involved when pressed by reporters on Tuesday. \n“I am going to leave the dissection and the oral history of those days to those who were actually there. I don’t have any new insight to share with you about the president’s recollection of those events,” Earnest said.
