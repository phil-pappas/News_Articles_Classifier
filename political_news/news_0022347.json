While businesses may back their own company, they clearly aren’t backing National to pull the economy out of its slump. \n\"There is no lack of ideas and possibilities among the businesses of New Zealand. What they need is the government to be there with them as a partner. It’s time for National to come up with measures to stimulate the economy. Bringing forward infrastructure projects and kicking off a house-building programme like Labour’s KiwiBuild would give business more confidence in the future,\" Grant Robertson says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:53:30.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
