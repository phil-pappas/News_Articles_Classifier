(AP Photo/Burhan Ozbilici)\nAssociated Press Oct. 12, 2015 | 4:25 a.m. EDT + More ANKARA, Turkey (AP) â€” Developments relating to Saturday's deadly bombings targeting a peace rally in the Turkish capital of Ankara. All times local.\n___\n11:20 a.m.\nA newspaper close to the Turkish government says authorities investigating the twin suicide bombings at a rally promoting peace with the Kurdish were focusing on the Islamic State group, comparing DNA samples of suspected bombers with those obtained from families of extremists they suspect could have carried out the attacks.\nThe newspaper, Yeni Safak, reported Monday that investigators were testing DNA samples obtained from families of some 20 Turks they believe are IS militants and prepared to carry out suicide bombings.\nThe government, meanwhile, raised the death toll in Turkey's deadliest attack in years to 97 and said the victims included a Palestinian. A pro-Kurdish party has said that up to 128 people died in the attacks Saturday.\n___\n9:50 a.m.\nTurkey's government has raised the death toll to 97 from the bombing of a weekend peace rally. One Palestinian was reported to be among the dead.\nTurkish authorities say police have detained four suspected Islamic State militants in a raid in the southern city of Adana. It was not clear where the arrests, announced Monday, were linked to the suicide bombings at a rally promoting peace with the Kurdish rebels.\nNo one has claimed responsibility, but the attack bears similarities to a suicide bombing the government blames on the Islamic State group that killed 33 people at a town bordering Syria in July.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
