We will debate and argue over what this chapter should contain, how the story should develop. We will do that online and offline, in civil society and in Parliament. That's normal, and healthy.\nBut at the end we are all co-authors of the chapter. We all have to work together, and we all want the story to have a happy outcome.\nPM LEE, inviting Singaporeans to work with the Government to write the next chapter for the country\nThe exhibition is the last major SG50 event, said Mr Lee, who hoped it would \"launch us into the next chapter of our Singapore Story\".\nHe invited all Singaporeans to actively take part in these programmes, saying the Government welcomed all views and would engage widely as every voice counts.\n\"I also urge Singaporeans to go beyond making suggestions or discussing ideas or critiquing policies,\" he added. \"Commit to what you believe in, roll up your sleeves, get involved, and come together to make things happen.\"\nMr Lee said the Government was planning ahead as Singaporeans expected their leaders to do so.\nHe also pledged to live up to the trust voters had placed in his team at the Sept 11 General Election, when about 70 per cent of voters chose the People's Action Party to form the Government.\nHe asked citizens to have the same belief in their country, saying: \"Singapore is special not just because of what we have achieved today, but also because of what we can look forward to tomorrow.\"\n\"Singaporeans are not defined by the accolades we receive, but by our constant striving to always do better, whatever the circumstances,\" he added.\nSpeaking before Mr Lee, President Tony Tan Keng Yam noted that Singapore has continued to find strength in growing diversity, and the Government sought to engage citizens in shaping the future.\nBut much remains to be done, he said, noting that the world economy has hit a rough patch and at home, Singapore faces challenges of an ageing population and a shrinking workforce.\n\"If we fail to address these challenges robustly, our economy will falter, lose its vibrancy and we will find it harder to improve the lives of our people,\" Dr Tan added.\nHe presided over the ceremony to swear in what he called a \"bold, strong and forward-looking\" Cabinet with experience and new faces.\nThirty-one office bearers, starting with PM Lee, took their oaths, led by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, during the one-hour ceremony at the Istana's State Room.\nMr Lee said the new Cabinet aims to provide the most effective government to tackle complex challenges, and prepare the next team to take over. \"We are not done building Singapore, and we will never be done,\" he said. \"The Singapore Story belongs to all of us. If we have faith that Singapore will endure and thrive, and put our heart and soul into building Singapore, then we will prevail, and secure our place in history.\"\nSEE TOP OF THE NEWS, EDITORIAL & OPINION:\n'Steady hands and fresh perspectives' in new Cabinet\nA solemn ceremony, but one with a strong sense of family\nWork hard to deserve people's trust: President\nHallmark of top leadership in S'pore\nFresh, bold ideas to face complex challenges\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on October 02, 2015, with the headline 'Panel being set up to chart future of economy'.
