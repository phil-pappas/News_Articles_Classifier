Earlier, the two had been seen at a nearby KFC, eating what would be their last meal. During the coroner's inquest, witnesses described ​Celise McLean ​ as \"agitated\" and exhibiting strange behavior when she arrived at the train station. ​ ​\nMore From Cosmopolitan Celise McLean was overheard by a witness saying, \" ​ I have to get to Heathrow, I have to stop them.\" The mother and daughter had also asked how to get a train to the airport. A witness told the inquest she saw the mother put her bag down moments before walking across the platform with her daughter.\n​\"They linked arms before running towards the platform edge,\" the witness said.\nThe two were later identified from a bank card in the woman's bag. Police said Celise McLean also had a son, Devon. \" ​ When he came home from school at about 5 p.m on the back of a chair were taped various letters addressed to different people.\" ​ British Transport Police Detective Sergeant Andrew Nattrass said. \"From reading these letters they effectively amount to farewell letters.\"\nA coroner ruled both deaths a suicide. Family members present at the inquest declined to speak with media.\n​Follow Rebecca on Instagram .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/rebeccaburtrose/", "http://www.getwestlondon.co.uk/news/west-london-news/mother-daughter-killed-train-ealing-9520910", "http://t.co/56RJM0K7lm", "https://twitter.com/GadgetGirl_40/status/613478432488427520", "http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/609224/Mum-teenage-daughter-suicide-Ealing-Broadway-train"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:56:26.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
