He's passing one player, now the second. This is dangerous. He passes to Salem Muati. Where's the ball? Alla \n\"A penalty kick for Shuja'iyya! A penalty kick for the Lions of the East!\" \n\"House of War: Islam's Jihad Against the World\" conveys what the West needs to know about Islam and the violent, expansionary ideology that seeks the subjugation and destruction of other faiths, cultures and systems of government \nHe continued, according to MEMRI, \"It's dangerous! Alla Fadhl Qanita scores. He speaks in the language of the Lions of the East. All of Shujaiyya is with you, oh the West Bank. A knife stabbing the bodies of the cowards! An axe tearing the veins of the idiots! A car running over someone who plundered the land of the prophets! A bullet piercing the hearts of the evil ones! A stone humiliating the weak Zionists! Here are young men whose slogan is: Either we live in dignity, or we die alive [sic].\" \nMore: \"The ball goes to Mahmoud Al-Nirab. Hatem Nasser kicks… Allla !!!! Rami Al-Bayouk scores! Rafah… Rafah… A lot can be said about Rafah! Rafah is a name with a thousand meanings. It epitomizes the essence of sacrifice. The resistance has spoken beyond enemy lines. In the streets and the allies, an army of Zionists was crushed by our soldiers. At the Sufa crossing it was humiliated. A soldier was kidnapped and he screamed: 'I wish had never invaded a land whose soldiers show no mercy to oppressors.' This was Shalit, and more Shalits will follow, until the black box will talk.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:12:56.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
