(TCP) worked with the Arbor Day Foundation, a non-profit conservation and education organization, to further its mission to inspire people to plant, nurture and celebrate trees. TCP donated roughly $17,000 of energy efficient LED lamps to the organization's Lied Lodge & Conference Center in support of its extensive $9 million renovation.\n\"It was obvious the environment was a priority to the center throughout the renovations,\" Paul Phillips , director of product management for TCP, said. \"Our LEDs not only help the center to increase energy savings, but our lamps also help to bring awareness to guests looking for ways to conserve our natural environment.\"\nAs part of the full renovation, recycling bins and low-flow toilets were added to the center's rooms. Old carpet was recycled and furniture was donated to Keep Nebraska Beautiful. Timbers were also repurposed after guest rooms were converted to suites.\nTCP's donation gives Lied Lodge & Conference Center a longer-lasting, energy efficient light source. The center has reduced wattages after switching from incandescent lamps to TCP's LED A-lamps and LED decorative lamps. This switch will not only save energy, but will also save on overall maintantance costs due to the long life of the lamps. Overall, the center is estimated to save roughly $25,000 in energy savings annually.\n\"We are incredibly grateful for the partnership with TCP and their generous contribution of the LED lamps which now illuminate Lied Lodge & Conference Center. Because of the quality of the illuminations these lamps provide, the entire lodge seems incredibly warm and inviting to all of our guests,\" Doug Farrar , vice president of Arbor Day Farm, said. \"This partnership is valuable and a perfect fit with our goal for demonstrating sustainable practices within the lodge and across the 260 acres of Arbor Day Farm.\"\nLied Lodge & Conference Center is located on Arbor Day Farm in Nebraska City, a 260-acre National Historic Landmark and the former estate of the Founder of Arbor Day J. Sterling Morton. The center recently celebrated the renewal of this energy efficient location with a Vine-Cutting Ceremony on August 13, 2015 .\nFor more information about TCP and its LED lighting solutions, please visit www.tcpi.com .\nAbout TCP\nFounded in 1993 with its North America headquarters in Aurora, Ohio , Technical Consumer Products, Inc., a subsidiary of TCP International Holdings, Ltd.
