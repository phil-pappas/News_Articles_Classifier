The daughters of Dora Hancox from Nuneaton have spoken about the loss of a mother who dedicated her life to caring for others. One daughter said: 'Our mother will be sadly missed, not only by her family, but by friends as well. She will finally be able to be reunited with her husband, our father, who tragically passed away from dementia two years ago. 'This has been a horrible shock to all of us. 'Our mother dedicated many years of her life when my sister and I were growing up as a foster carer for Coventry social services; she was also a local school lollipop lady both in Coventry area and in Nuneaton for many years.' The other daughter added: 'My mum has struggled to come to terms with the loss of my dad as he suffered from dementia two years ago. This tragedy has cut short her life at the time she was just starting to live again. 'She will be sadly missed by all and her grandchildren and great-grandchildren will now not have the opportunity to gain memories from getting to know her.' Meanwhile officers investigating the crash have re-appealed for witnesses to come forward. The double decker bus crashed into a supermarket on Trinity Street around 6pm killing seven-year-old Rowan Fitzgerald, who was on the bus, and pedestrian Mrs Hancox, who was in her 70s. Inspector Paul Bennett, from the Collision Investigation Unit, said: 'We are in the process of taking in the region of 150 statements in relation to the collision and we believe that there may be more people who have not yet come forward. 'We have also identified hours of CCTV which is currently being scrutinised. 'Our priority is to ensure that the investigation is comprehensive and thorough to achieve a definitive cause for the collision and this could take several months. 'We have several officers and specialist staff from partner agencies conducting a thorough examination of the bus, which is being held in a compound, as is standard process in any investigation of this nature.' Inspector Bennett added: 'The families of Rowan and Dora have suffered a devastating loss and our deepest sympathies remain with them; we are continuing to support them and we ask that they are left alone to cope with their loss in peace. 'We have also offered our support to Sainsbury colleagues and staff and to Rowan's school who have also been deeply affected by this tragedy.' Rowan's eight-year-old cousin, injured in the collision, remains in a stable condition in hospital and is expected to have an operation on her leg this afternoon (6 October). Five other people also suffered injuries and received hospital treatment. Anyone who witnessed the collision and has not yet spoken to police should call the Collision Investigation Unit on 101 quoting log 1017 of 4/10/15. distributed by This content was issued by West Midlands Police on the 2015-10-06 and was initially posted on www.west-midlands.police.uk.
