The sale of the facility, considered crucial to the county's financial turnaround, fell through after the buyer, Sympaticare LLC, terminated the $32 million deal. \nIn addition to 288 full-time positions at the hospital that will be eliminated, the budget calls for an additional 38 job cuts across multiple departments — information technology, security, health, environmental resources, budget, finance, the Public Defender's office and the Youth Bureau. \nDay is also calling for selling off the Sain Building at 18 New Hempstead Road for $4 million. County employees would move to the 10-story Summit Park hospital once it is empty, he said. \nStarting Thursday night, the Legislature will have its turn at making changes. \n\"While we don't yet know the details, we do know, as in years past, that a careful review is needed to ensure a strong budget for 2016,\" Chairman Alden Wolfe, D-Suffern said in a statement. \"The Legislature will continue its role in addressing the deficit, Summit Park Hospital and Nursing Care Center and possible layoffs and in engaging conservative budgeting practices. At the same time, we also recognize that County Government exists to provide vital services to our residents.\" \nDay's proposal sets up several obvious budget battles ahead. \nHe is proposing to eliminate support staff — including blacksmith and veterinary services — for the Rockland Sheriff's department's mounted unit, for a savings of $156,000. Previous plans to cut the unit entirely were blasted by Sheriff Louis Falco back in 2015 and eventually blocked by the legislature. \nThe proposed budget also trying again to impose $1.8 million in community college \" chargeback s\" on Rockland's five towns — a partial tuition payment on behalf of local community college students who attend out-of-county schools. \nBack in 2012, as it struggled to handle its deficit, Rockland passed chargebacks for the first time in its history. In retaliation, local leaders started to bill county for streetlights, traffic signals and fire hydrants on county roads. The budget tool hasn't been tried since. \nThe county saw its deficit soar to a high of $125.6 million as of Dec. 31, 2012. It borrowed $96.4 million for deficit reduction but had to agree to oversight by the state Comptroller's Office to pursue the loan. \nNow Rockland needs to make roughly $17.5 million in deficit payments. \n\"The poor decisions, reckless spending and mismanagement of the past continue to weigh us down,\" Day said. \"Money we're saving is going directly to our mortgage.\" \nDespite the significant number of layoffs and a tax increase that exceeds the tax cap, Day claimed Rockland's financial conditions shows signs of improvement from his first year in office when the county's bank account, at one point, dropped to only $40,000. \nRockland has received two credit upgrades and a 20-point improvement in New York's most fiscally-stressed local government list . \nWith Summit Park off the books, total spending is projected to drop by $40 million from 2015 to 2016. \n\"We're not there yet,\" Day said, \"but we will get there.\" \nRockland County Executive Ed Day will host two town hall forums to discuss his proposed 2016 budget. They are: \n7 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 14 at Farley Elementary School, 140 Route 210, Stony Point \n7 p.m. Monday, Nov. 16 at Valley Cottage Library , 110 Route 303, Valley Cottage. 62 CONNECT 10 TWEET 4 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1KP34pR TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:27:25.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
