Hillary Clinton testifies before the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Capitol Hill on Thursday.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Oct. 22, 2015 | 1:53 p.m. EDT + More Republicans members of the Benghazi committee, who have been widely criticized for politicizing their investigation into the 2012 attacks that left four Americans dead, opened questioning of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Thursday seeking details of her communications with staff in the 18 months prior to the incident and of her responses to two attacks on the compound in February and June 2012.\nPointing out that Clinton sent and received nearly 800 emails on Benghazi in 2011, while only 67 were sent in 2012 before the attack, Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Ind., wondered if Clinton’s attention had not been distracted from a deteriorating situation.\n“I can only conclude by your own records that there was a lack of interest in Libya in 2012,” Brooks said.\nRELATED\nBenghazi Hearing Takes Center Stage With Stakes High Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Kan., pressed Clinton for answers on why repeated requests for additional security from Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the attack, and his team were rebuffed.\n“Some of those requests were approved, some were not,” Clinton said. “I think it’s fair to say Chris asked for what he and his people requested because he thought it would be helpful, but he never said to anybody in the State Department, ‘You know what, we just can’t keep doing this.’”\nThe line of questioning provided a sober start to what many believed would be a highly partisan affair. Clinton and other Democrats have long maintained that the committee is an attempt by Republicans to discredit her as she mounts a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nCommittee Chairman Trey Gowdy opened the hearing, which was expected to last as long as 10 hours, with a lengthy defense of the committee’s purpose against accusations that its work has gotten sidetracked by revelations that Clinton engaged in government communications from a privately hosted email account.\nFar from being a political venture designed to bring down Clinton’s campaign, the South Carolina Republican said, the committee needed to have access to Clinton’s emails and Stevens’ emails in order to create a definitive account of the events of the day.\n“This work is about something much more important than any single person,” Gowdy said. “It is about four U.S. government workers, including our ambassador, murdered by terrorists on foreign soil. It is about what happened before, during, and after the attacks that killed these four men. It is about what this country owes those who risk their lives to serve it. It is about the fundamental obligation of our government to tell the truth – always – to the American people.”\n[ READ: Trey Gowdy, Benghazi Committee Chairman, Denies Retirement Report ]\nClinton herself vowed in her opening remarks to “honor the courage of those four men … to talk about those we lost and those who serve us still.”\nThe former secretary of state, who often appeared bored and turned her attention to notes during the comments of the panel’s Republican members or during frequent squabbles between members on the dais, was candid and responsive when replying to Democratic members, at one point discussing the effect the attacks have had on her personally by saying, “I have lost more sleep than all of you put together.”\nFrequently referring to the distribution of responsibilities, she said with respect to the security requests that she did not deal with them personally – and that she would do those she was responsible for a disservice by overriding the advice of experts.\n“I was not going to second-guess them,” she said. “I was not going to substitute my judgment, which is not based on experience that they have in keeping people safe, for theirs.”\nTurning to the administration’s immediate response on the day of the attack, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, demanded an explanation for why members of the Obama administration, including Clinton and then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, initially blamed the attacks on an inflammatory video deriding Muslims that led to protests at the U.S. embassy in Cairo.\nRELATED\nGOP Delivers Self-Inflicted Wounds to Benghazi Committee\n“Everything points to a terrorist attack,” Jordan said. “And yet five days later, Susan Rice goes on five TV shows and says ‘Benghazi … was the consequence of a video.’”\n“Where did the false narrative start?” he said. “It started with you, Madame Secretary.”\nClinton defended her statements as “deliberate,” with the goal of preventing violence spreading to other countries as protests broke out in Tunisia, Yemen and other countries.\n“I needed to be talking about the video because I needed to put other governments on notice,” Clinton said. “I used those words deliberately, not to ascribe a motive to an attacker, but as a warning that there was no justification for further attacks.”\nBut Jordan accused Clinton of deliberately misleading the American people, saying she was discussing one thing privately and another publicly. He said the Obama administration was trying to shield itself from criticism in the weeks leading up to the 2012 elections that its supposed success story – the death of former Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi and the election of a moderate government – had, in fact, deteriorated into chaos.\n“You could tell the truth, like you did your family,” Jordan said, of Clinton’s options for statements following the attack. “You could say, ‘We’re not quite sure.’ But you picked the third option, you picked the video, because Libya was supposed to be a great success story.”\nBut Clinton denied what she said were Jordan’s “insinuations.”\n“There is no doubt in my mind we did the best we could that night,” she said. “I’m sorry that doesn’t fit your narrative, congressman. I can only tell you what the facts were, and the facts support this process that the intelligence community did the best job they could and we all did the best we could to then share that with the American people.”\nTAGS: Clinton, Hillary", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg396%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg396%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg396%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Clinton%20Defends%20Decisions%20Ahead%20of%20Benghazi%20Attack", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg396%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Clinton%20Defends%20Decisions%20Ahead%20of%20Benghazi%20Attack&summary=The%20former%20secretary%20of%20state%20said%20in%20highly%20anticipated%20testimony%20that%20she%20deferred%20on%20decisions%20regarding%20embassy%20security%20in%20Benghazi.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg396%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg396%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Clinton%20Defends%20Decisions%20Ahead%20of%20Benghazi%20Attack"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:29:51.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
