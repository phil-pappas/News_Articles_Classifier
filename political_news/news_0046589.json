The man charged in the killing was in the country illegally despite a long criminal record and multiple prior deportations. \nThe bill by Louisiana Sen. David Vitter would punish jurisdictions that prohibit the collection of immigration information or don't cooperate with federal requests, blocking them from receiving certain grants and funds. \nAngry Democrats accused Republicans of aligning themselves with Donald Trump and his anti-immigrant views.
