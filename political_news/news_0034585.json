Workers went on strike there in the spring because of unpaid wages and were compensated after appealing directly to Putin. The directors of three subcontractors were later arrested on corruption charges.\nPutin told officials during his visit to Vostochny that he will press investigators to look into potential crimes and misdemeanors connected to the construction. He also said he expects the first launch from Vostochny next year.\nThe construction of the space center will give Russia its own facility for manned space launches. Russia is now renting the Soviet-era launch pad in Baikonur in Kazakhstan.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
