Congress last year approved a debt limit increase with sweeping support from Democrats and a handful of Republicans. \nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew informed Congress on Thursday that it needs to act by Nov. 5. That is earlier than most on Capitol Hill has thought and means the issue probably needs to be dealt with before House Speaker John Boehner resigns.
