Trump tops his closest challenger Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, by five percentage points -- 21% to 16%, the poll by Texas Lyceum found. Ben Carson would receive 12%, Jeb Bush gets 10% and Carly Fiorina would take 6% of the vote, according to the poll. The poll also showed that in a general election match-up, Clinton would narrowly lose Texas to Bush, Cruz and Trump by single digits. \"Mrs. Clinton actually polls better in Texas right now than one might have expected,\" said Professor Daron Shaw, who oversees the Lyceum Poll. \"But this is primarily due to her greater name recognition and the divisiveness of the GOP contest at this early stage.\" The survey shows Clinton leading by double digits in the Democratic primary. Clinton would win 36% of the vote, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont takes 24%. Vice President Joe Biden, who is weighing a run for the White House, would get 15%. The Texas Lyceum, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group focused on identifying the next generation of Texas leaders, conducted a statewide telephone survey of 1,000 adults from Sept. 8-21. The overall margin of error for the poll is +/- 3.1 percentage points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:44:14.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
