As a British citizen, Waters can’t actually vote in a U.S. election. But the Pink Floyd co-founder, in an interview with Rolling Stone, said Sanders is the only candidate in the American presidential race “that I see with any credibility.\"\n\"He seems to speak the truth, far as one can tell at this point,” Waters said. “He seems prepared to stand up against big money and the banks and stand up for the predicaments of minorities, the middle class and the working class in this country.\"\nWaters dismissed fears that Sanders in the general election would hand a win to Republicans because he is too radical.\n\"It is true that people become marginalized if their politics appear too far to the left,\" he said.\nTrump gets it wrong on Ford plants in Mexico By Nick Gass\n\"That is why I admire Sanders.
