Ya Devi sarvabhuteshu chaitanya roopena samsthitha\nYa Devi sarvabhuteshu maya roopena samsthtitha\nBefore the manifestation of the world, there was only Shiva (the brahman), which existed in its formless state. Shiva — the formless, omnipotent and omnipresent — existed all alone in its static consciousness state. When the intention to create arose in Shiva, first His creative power emanated from Him. This creative power of Shiva, in its formless state, is called Shakti and the same in its form is called Durga. Creative powers are thus feminine in nature.\nWhen the feminine power of creation separated from Shiva, it first enveloped Shiva Himself, as otherwise delusion (maya) couldn’t have got created which is the basic principle to sustain the creation. Thus, Durga is also referred to as “mayavi shakti”. Shiva being inert, static and inactive cannot itself create anything. Hence, the active energies are required to create the universe and thus the Dynamic Consciousness (Shakti/Durga) from the static consciousness became necessary.\nIn order to sustain the universe and the living beings therein, nine types of shaktis were required. These nine shaktis became active to sustain the universe. The names of these nine devis are Jagadamba, Bhadrakali, Annapurna, Sarvamangala, Bhairavi, Chandi, Lalita, Bhavani and Mukambika. Each of these devis are bestowed with distinct powers: Jagadamba is bestowed with the power to create and procreate; Bhadrakali is the giver of fortune; Annapurna is the giver of food to all living and non living beings; Lalita is the love aspect in male and female beings; Bhavani is the giver of life force etc.\nWhen we are not in the same frequency as these shaktis, we suffer in the world and create impediments in our road to peace and harmony. During Navratri these nine devis are worshipped with the bhava of surrendering at their feet and seeking mercy, protection and peace.\n commentary OPED Durga Mystic mantra Also Read Mystic Mantra: The energy of Ganesh Tackling pornography The dictatorship of cultural bureaucrats Nepal: A country with no roofs", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151013/commentary-op-ed/article/mystic-mantra-unknown-durga", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/durga%20puja_0_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/durga%20puja_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:14:49.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
