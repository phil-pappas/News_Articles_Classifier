And I had no indication whatsoever that a defeat device could have been in our cars.\"\nHorn apologised for 'breaking the trust of customers and stakeholders', saying: \"We at Volkswagen take full responsibility for our actions and we are working with all relevant authorities in a cooperative way.\"\nVolkswagen, which submitted its plans and timetable to bring vehicles into compliance to German authorities on Wednesday, plans to begin recalling affected vehicles from January. But it admitted that it would only complete the refitting by the end of 2016.\nRelated Read: Volkswagen scandal: recall to start in January; complete fix by 2016-end\nThe group has set aside 6.5 billion euros in the third quarter over the affair, but that would only likely cover repairs of affected vehicles.\nIn the United States, Volkswagen faces up to $18 billion (Rs 1200 billion) in fines from the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as payouts from lawsuits and penalties from other regulators.\nSeeking to play down the matter, a VW spokesman told AFP that whether the defeat devices were activated in Europe was 'still being investigated'. He added that it remained \"legally unclear if the device was forbidden under European rules\".", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:54:36.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
