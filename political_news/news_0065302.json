He chalked it up to people not contributing the way they expected.\n\"Our latest budget is going to be lower because people aren't contributing as much,\" Koch told Kai Ryssdal in an interview with American Public Media's \"Marketplace” ON Wednesday.\nHe called the projected figure of $900 million “totally wrong.”\nEarlier this year the political network overseen by the billionaire brothers (Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch) announced plans to spend nearly $900 million on politics. Of that, approximately $300 million would be spent directly on 2016. Now that number is also slimmer, by about $50 million.\n“Probably the total budget over the two years I would guess would be 750 [million], and the amount in politics is 250 [million],\" Koch said.\nKoch made it clear that the majority of the millions they intend to spend weren’t coming directly from the brothers.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/04/21/charles-koch-republican-candidates-2016/26142001/", "http://www.marketplace.org/topics/business/corner-office/full-interview-charles-koch"], "published": "2015-10-21T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:37:50.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
