She apologized again but then turned to the issues. \n“Tonight I want not to talk about my emails but what the American people want from the next president of the U.S.\" Clinton said. \nHer closest challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders, agreed. \n“Enough of the emails, let's talk about the real issues facing America,\" he said \nClinton separated herself from Sanders, first on his self-labeled “Democratic Socialism.” \n\"We would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history of the world,\" Clinton said. \nYou can have all the growth you want and it doesn't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent,\" Sanders said. \nClinton and former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley both challenged Sanders on gun safety legislation. \n“It's time to stand up to pass gun safety legislation,” O’Malley debated. \nSanders said, “I come from a rural state and the views on gun control in rural states is different than in urban states whether we like it or not.” \nThe first debate was a chance for all five Democratic presidential candidates to introduced themselves to voters. \n\"I am very clear about my principles,\" O'Malley said. \n\"I have no scandals,\" Chafee said in his introduction. \nWebb said, \"I've also spent half my professional life away from politics.\" \nFour of the five candidates, all but Jim Webb, specifically mentioned climate change in their opening remarks.
