M, Westport \nwisconsinscaryland.com \nTwo years and an impressive pile of cash have been invested in Guy Kitchell’s Wisconsin Scaryland, and it shows like the crusted bloodstains on the walls. If there’s a genre that Kitchell and crew haven’t managed to pack into the former Westport convenience store, I don’t know what it is: It’s an asylum, a prison, a nuclear waste dump, a carnival and more. Among the complicated handmade props is the Hellevator, the claustrophobic and rickety lift box that gets your Scaryland experience off to an uneasy start. Elsewhere, there’s a creepy miniature carousel that proves a brilliant misdirect, and a truly inspired use of strips of white cloth and a strobe light. The experience goes on so long you may begin to literally feel like you’ll never escape — and of course, once you do, you find out you haven’t. Kitchell says managing the flow is one of the biggest challenges: “We don’t like when groups catch up with each other, but sometimes a group is so scared, they walk incredibly slowly,” he says. The 50 infrared cameras watching everything help, and allow walkie-talkie communication to deploy one of the 60 actors to scare things along. \nSchuster’s Haunted Forest \n1326 Hwy. 12/18, Deerfield \nschustersfarm.com \nDread descends as you jostle in the dark in the back of Don Schuster’s hayride truck, speeding through the quietly menacing rows of corn toward Schuster’s Haunted Forest. Zombies, last year’s theme, have given way to Camp Schuster, which means a certain hockey-mask-wearing maniac is holding court in the woods — and a lot worse. Forty-five actors lurk among the trees and dilapidated shacks in Schuster’s forest, but in some ways, it’s the quiet and eerie tableaux (a group of deserted pup tents with lanterns glowing beside them; the skull-laden altar and the clever signage) that disturb more than the jump scares. Schuster’s guiding philosophy: “You want to scare the hell of them at the beginning and at the end — that’s Haunting 101.” Between the strobed hallway and The Vortex, mission accomplished.
