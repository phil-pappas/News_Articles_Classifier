By Bloomberg News × Boehner postponed the vote for speaker of the house on Tuesday \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy dropped out of the race for U.S. House speaker on the day his party was poised to nominate him to replace John Boehner, lawmakers said. \nMr. Boehner, who is leaving Congress at the end of the month, postponed the election that was to have been held by House Republicans Thursday afternoon. The full House is scheduled to vote for speaker Oct. 29. \nRepresentative Peter King of New York told reporters that Mr. McCarthy’s announcement during a meeting of House Republicans left everyone “absolutely stunned.” It had become clear that the caucus needed to be united and “he’s not the one” to do it, Mr. King said. \nRepresentative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania told CNN that while Mr. McCarthy could have won the nomination within the conference he probably wouldn’t have been able to get the 218 votes he needed in the full House.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:51:44.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
