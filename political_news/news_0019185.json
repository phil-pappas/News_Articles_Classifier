The group is concerned about the long-term harm done to juveniles whose court records can be viewed by the public, including by those who do background checks for jobs, housing, and admittance to the military and some colleges. \nThe group is expected to recommend that juvenile court records be kept secret unless a judge orders otherwise. But it also broached going further by recommending that juveniles’ names be kept out of police reports. \nIowa law now requires law enforcement officials to release the “immediate facts and circumstances” of a crime or incident, including the names and ages of suspects and victims. \nRecommending only to keep secret juvenile court records “doesn’t accomplish what we have been told the problem is,” said group member Alan Ostergren, Muscatine County Attorney. “Law enforcement have to release certain information about an incident … that basic information could include a juvenile who got picked up for shoplifting.” \nThe meeting Thursday was the third of the Governor’s Working Group on Justice Policy Reform , a task force announced by Gov. Terry Branstad in August. The group is expected to make its recommendations by Nov. 6 on justice policy reforms. Branstad has said he would review the recommendations and pass some, if not all, on to the Iowa Legislature for consideration in 2016. \nThe committee is considering recommendations to improve Iowa’s criminal justice policies in the following areas: juvenile criminal record confidentiality; mental health and drug courts; jury pool selection; and telephone fee rates in prison and jails. \nThe state’s Juvenile Justice Advisory Council, in a letter to the working group, wrote that it supports keeping secret all juvenile court and arrest records. \nThe juvenile court’s goal is to rehabilitate and reintegrate delinquents into society, the council wrote. Therefore “it is vital that Iowa stop allowing public access to juvenile court records.” \nEven if records are sealed or expunged, the group wrote, “in the electronic age of the internet and data mining, those juvenile court records are still accessible.” \nGroup member Kevin McCarthy, who is with the Iowa Attorney General’s office, raised questions about whether a day care center has a right to know that when a potential employee was a young teen, he or she molested a younger sibling. \n“There’s unanswered questions for us,” said McCarthy, adding the attorney general’s office had not taken a stance on the issue. \nKeeping juveniles' names out of police records would require an amendment to the state's open records law, something some members were wary of doing. \nState public defender Adam Gregg, a group member, said recommending the state’s public records law be amended would likely cause an outburst in the Legislature and by open records advocates. “I think what we ought to do is remain focused on this recommendation the way it is focused on the actual court records themselves,” he said. \nThe group will likely recommend that juvenile court records remain confidential unless a judge decides it’s in the best interest of the child and public. The group will also likely recommend that the court can make the records public if the juvenile later re-offends. \nOther likely recommendations by the group, which meets again on Oct. 29, include: Providing dedicated funding for drug and mental health courts but not at the expense of existing programs that have been proven to work. In addition, developing consistent participant criteria that would allow the effectiveness of the courts to be measured. Adoption by the state’s judicial branch of new jury management software that would generate jury pools that reflect a fair cross-section of the community. In addition, requiring the judicial branch to collect and maintain statistics of the racial composition of Iowa’s jury pools. Requiring the state Department of Corrections to renegotiate its contract with the Iowa Communications Network in an effort to reduce the costs of telephone charges paid by prison inmates and their families.
