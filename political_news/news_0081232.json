Events run by the association have not been well attended and the links that the association has with internal and external bodies are minimal. I have watched some interesting execs over the last three years and I think it is time to lead the association to a better place” \nWhen asked about the key policies that Matua Wiremu would be campaigning for, he said “My campaign is one of inclusiveness, maintaining a good balance of experience around the exec table and ensuring that the views of all Maori students are embraced, reflecting a more whanau environment. \nWith this in mind, should I be fortunate enough to become president, I will be calling a series of whanau and exec hui immediately to start planning for 2016. The plan would be to work closely with the exec and our whanau to bring about an amazing 2016. \nMatua Wiremu wishes all of the other candidates running for presidency all the best and for those that would like to find out more about the “Vote Matua Wiremu for Te Akatoki President 2016” campaign go to his campaign website page where regular updates will be posted. \nIf you would like to join the campaign team feel free to private message the facebook page or send Matua Wiremu a private message on facebook. https://www.facebook.com/Matuawiremu \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:05:56.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
