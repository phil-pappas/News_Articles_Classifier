Related Raging for hundreds of years; new... \nEd Quatrevaux serves as inspector general and Susan Hutson serves as the independent police monitor. The two signed an agreement to separate their offices and will present the charter change Thursday to the City Council. \nThe separation of offices will require a two-thirds vote in a general election. Both offices want the issue on the April ballot. \nQuatrevaux hired Hutson in 2010, but the two have battled over how autonomous the independent police monitor's office should be in the city. A dispute over their offices began in September when Quatrevaux sent Hutson a letter seeking to fire her. \nA city charter approved by voters in 2008 specifies that the police monitor reports to the IG's office, but it does not outline the extent of control that Quatrevaux has over Hutson. \nSince Hutson received the letter, she has sought to become independent of the inspector general. She received the support of Councilman Jared Brossett. \n\"It is important that we have an independent police monitor that is allowed to perform responsibilities without interfering,\" Brossett said. \nBrossett introduced an ordinance earlier this month to give Hutson the independence that she had been seeking. The relationship between the two offices has been described as “rocky at best.” \nThe IPM has a history of investigating and uncovering police misconduct and publishing the findings. Quatrevaux said he is requesting that Hutson be fired for what he calls professional misconduct, which includes the long-delayed release of the Wendell Allen police report. \nFive members of the New Orleans City Council introduced an ordinance recently that clarified that the IG is not over the IPM, and gives a formula for independent funding and staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:42:02.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
