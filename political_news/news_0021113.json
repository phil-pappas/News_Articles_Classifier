Most attendees wear evening gowns and tuxedos but over the years we've seen more and more people come in elaborate period costumes, which is encouraged.\nTickets are for sale at $75 per guest per the event web site, but Groupon is currently offering two tickets for the price of one.\nCDH is a birth defect of the diaphragm and affects approximately one in every 2,500 babies, or about 1,600 babies in the United States each year.\n\"This is an incredible event. It's a lot of fun and everyone who attends comes back every year. We have even had 2 marriage proposals in past years. It's just a magical night for a great cause and a chance for us to tell local friends who we are, what we do, and why these children need our help,\" says charity president, Dawn Torrence Williamson . \"And as an adult, how often do you get to dress up for Halloween ?\"\nMedia contact:\nDawn Torrence\nCHERUBS\n919-610-0129\nhttp://www.savethecherubs.org\n releases/raleigh-halloween-masquerade-ball-helping-babies-born-with-birth-defect-300158103.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/raleigh-halloween", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.masqueradingangelsball.org/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/raleigh-halloween-masquerade-ball-helping-babies-born-with-birth-defect-300158103.html", "http://www.savethecherubs.org/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA25942&Transmission_Id=201510121456PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA25942&DateId=20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:10:21.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
