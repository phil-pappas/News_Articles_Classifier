More Turkey blames Isis for Ankara bombing \nAs regime forces have squeezed the rebels in the south, Isis militants have mounted their own push to retake territory to the city’s north — moves which threaten to exacerbate an already acute refugee crisis. \nWestern fears of a serious intensification in the conflict also grew as the officer in charge of the Russian military operation hinted at even larger deployments of troops, including ground forces, to bolster Russia’s presence in the country. Russia late last month began air strikes in support of the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. \nIn an interview with the pro-Kremlin newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, Colonel General Andrei Kartapolov of the Russian general staff said Moscow would set up a single base in Syria “which will include several components — naval, air and ground [forces]”. \nHe also said Russian ships based in the eastern Mediterranean could be deployed in the operation against opponents of the Assad regime. \nRussia has launched dozens of cruise missiles from its Black Sea fleet against targets in Syria but has so far avoided engaging its ships in the Mediterranean, primarily anti-aircraft vessels designed to complicate US air operations in the region. \nAny deployment of Russian ground forces would also mark a significant shift in Moscow’s position. Fearful of casualties, Russia has so far held back, leaving it instead to Iran to augment the Syrian army’s ground offensive.
