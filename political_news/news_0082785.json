They clearly aren’t living up to that. \n\"The Government needs to stop being soft on Serco. They’ve had second chance after second chance so the Minister won’t have to face up to reality. \n\"Privatising the prisons has been a disaster. Everyone can see it and it’s time National admitted it. \n\"This should be the last straw, Serco needs to go before more people are hurt,\" says Jacinda Ardern. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:51:57.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
