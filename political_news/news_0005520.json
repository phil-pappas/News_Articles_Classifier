A widening gender pay gap will result. \n“Many women are already opting out of community and family time because of employment contracts that impact on all aspects of their lives. If this trend continues it will weaken our families and our communities. \n“BPW NZ is calling on the Government to mesh together their policies on employment with those on beneficiary work and availability obligations to build a society where family and community cohesion is valued. \n“Data by age, gender and ethnicity needs to be collected to provide information on how many workers are living with the anxiety of yo-yoing hours of work, the need for “on call” child care and accompanying fluctuating pay packets. We cannot measure a trend if we do not have the data. \n“It is time to significantly improve employment contracts and to ensure the social cost is factored into renumeration,” says Mrs Swales. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:40:02.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
