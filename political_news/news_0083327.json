More Scioli powers to lead in Argentina polls \n“It would be delusional and a bit naive to think that a cabinet reshuffle is going to shift a centre-left government to the centre-right,” Mr Valdés said in an interview with the Financial Times. He was referring to his appointment in May during a political crisis triggered by corruption scandals that has seen Ms Bachelet’s popularity ratings sink to record lows . \n“I am not here to implement a counter-reform,” said the MIT-educated economist who has worked at the IMF, pouring cold water on hopes in the private sector where depressed confidence owing to doubt over the extent of Ms Bachelet’s reforms is freezing investment and holding back recovery. \nHowever, Mr Valdés recognised that the government’s reform agenda was overly ambitious given the “more complicated economic moment” — copper prices have fallen by half since Ms Bachelet was voted back to power in the world’s top copper producer two years ago after promising to tackle high inequality. Growth has plunged from an average of 5.3 per cent over the past 30 years to 1.9 per cent last year. \n“Countries are not built in [a presidential term], but many decades. So we have to proceed with due caution, taking into account the impact [of the reforms] on the markets. But we do want to change society, while recognising all the good things that have been done in the past 25 years,” said Mr Valdés. \nThere is broad consensus that education is the key to unlocking Chile’s growth potential and enabling it to escape the so-called “middle income trap”. Although Ms Bachelet’s education reforms are expensive, Mr Valdés said it would be a mistake not to invest in them because of the economic slowdown, which has caused revenues from copper exports to collapse. He argues that Chile’s low debt levels mean there is no need for “fiscal overkill”. It would be delusional and a bit naive to think that a cabinet reshuffle is going to shift a centre-left government to the centre-right \n- Rodrigo Valdés, Chile’s finance minister \nBut it is Ms Bachelet’s labour reforms that are causing the most controversy, with businesses protesting against plans to boost the power of trade unions. Although Mr Valdés admitted that “all of us have had to make concessions” in shaping the new bill — in a nod to the conflicting demands of the more radical leftwing of the ruling coalition — he insisted that reform was going ahead. \n“I would say to [the reform’s critics], welcome to the real world. Modern societies have unions, and they are going to have to learn how to deal with that. I can quite understand that some businesses might not like it, but [without the reform] our social contract is not sustainable,” said Mr Valdés. \nHe is upbeat about Chile’s ability to turn the corner. “We have been faced with calamities, political shocks and a big deceleration, but Chile is a sturdy country,” he said, pointing out that the scale of the political crisis that erupted this year was impressive given the relatively limited extent of the country’s problems. \n“Chileans are very intolerant of [economic] inefficiency or financial scandals, and that is a great asset,” he said. “We are a very sensible country.” Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
