In commercial vehicle segment, M&HCV segment would grow in double digits while light commercial vehicle segment would continue to be in negative territory,\" he added.\nSen said withdrawal of export incentives, high vehicle interest rates, and inclusion of certain items in the anti-dumping list, mostly concerning components, are some of the challenges facing the auto industry.\nDuring the month, market leader Maruti Suzuki India posted a growth of 7.94% in its domestic car sales at 87,916 units as against 81,447 units in the same month last year.\nRival Hyundai Motor India saw its car sales increase marginally to 35,193 units as against 34,906 units in the year-ago month.\nHonda Cars India's sales stood at 17,800 units as against 9,600 units in the same month last year, up 85.41%, SIAM said.\nHomegrown Tata Motors' domestic car sales were at 10,226 units as compared with 9,765 units in the same month previous year, up 4.72%.\nUtility vehicles major Mahindra & Mahindra saw its sales decline 4.73% to 18,717 units as against 19,647 in September last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:15.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
