They want to gerrymander next year’s Mayoral election in London by denying hundreds of thousands of Londoners their right to vote.” \nThe new Individual Electoral Registration (IER) process will particularly affect those in rented accommodation and urban areas, who are less likely to register, and students, because universities and colleges no longer 'block register' students living in halls of residence. \nCampaign groups have complained that in areas such as Hackney in London, one in four voters could lose their rights to be on the electoral roll. \nBut writing for Huff Post UK , Cabinet Office minister John Penrose said that the changes would bring Britain into line with 'every other serious democracy in the world'. \nIn its briefing note, the Electoral Commission makes clear that it would be wiser to stick to original plans to complete the reforms by December 2016 rather than December 2015. \n\"The earlier timetable puts the greater onus on electors as they will need to take action in order to ensure they are able to remain registered and participate in the May 2016 polls,\" it says. \n\"By contrast, the later timetable puts the greater responsibility on EROs (Electoral Registration Officers) to identify and take steps to remove redundant or inaccurate entries.\" \nMinisters usually accept the advice of the independent watchdog and in September decided to fully adopt its recommendations to change the question in the EU referendum .
