There are dark forces, like certain media barons, that would like to see the BBC diminished.\" \nMr Vaizey replied: \"I agree with the last Labour secretary of state who said we shouldn't make the BBC a political football. Promoted stories \n\"We're asking perfectly legitimate questions about the BBC but I note your comments about the UK being a creative hub.\" \nMr Vaizey then joked: \"I was concerned about your comments on the Bond movie this morning on Twitter. \n\"Your attack on the Bond franchise, which employs thousands of people in this country, whose producers make such a fantastic contribution to our cultural life, and I hope you'll stand up for James Bond.\" \nEarlier, Mr Davies (Shipley) asked Culture Secretary John Whittingdale: \"Do you not agree with me that it would be far better for subscribers to the BBC to determine the scale and scope of its services rather than the Government? \n\"Isn't it the case that if the BBC is as popular as it claims with the public, it's got nothing to fear from going to a subscription model? \n\"And given its international recognition, freed from the shackles of the licence fee, isn't it inevitable that the BBC's revenues would increase substantially if it went to a subscription model?\" Share article \nMr Whittingdale replied: \"I am, of course, familiar with your views on the BBC and you have made your case with your customary strength and fluency. \n\"But, as I say, we are still in the consultation period, or at least analysing the responses we have received, and of course your view will be taken into account - as will the other 192,000 we have received.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:02:25.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
