I had a chance to visit with him, and I invited him to play in a member-guest outing at the Country Club of Fairfax. He accepted, and we spent the day together and, although we did not win anything, had a good time.\nDenlinger shared a story from covering the Masters in Augusta, Ga., when officials allowed him and other reporters a once-in-a-lifetime chance to play the course on the Monday after the tournament.\nDenlinger’s handicap was 15 at the time. He said he was playing the eighth hole when he turned to his playing partner and told him, “I still have not seen this course from inside the ropes!”\nIt says a lot about the man that he would relate such a self-deprecating story. He was a good person.\nOwen V. Cummings , Lusby\n●\nKen Denlinger was a class act and displayed integrity in his columns.\nIn early 1977, The Post editorialized that the Report of the President’s Commission on Olympic Sports, of which I was executive director, had recommended an imitation of East Germany’s sports system for the United States .\nFive days later, Denlinger refuted his own paper’s editorial — with eloquence, facts and courage.\nHe will be missed.\nMike Harrigan , Darnestown", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:56:18.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
