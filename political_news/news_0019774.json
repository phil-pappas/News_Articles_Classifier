John Kitzhaber and his fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, dumping various large items at Bend's Knott Landfill, the Bend Bulletin reported. \nLaw enforcement officers are seen in another video looking through the pile the two left behind. \nThe FBI is investigating an influence-peddling controversy related to the couple. \nCounty leaders had declined to release the landfill video at the request of the FBI, citing the ongoing investigation. Legal Counsel David Doyle said Friday that the FBI recently told him he could release the video. \nIn response to the Bend Bulletin's repeated request, Doyle said \"recently I got a hold of them and said, 'Is there still an investigation or am I able to release it to them?'\" \n\"That led to (the FBI saying) 'Yeah, you can release it,'\" Doyle said. \nThe state held off on its own investigation into the controversy in February. Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum spokeswoman Kristina Edmunson says the state will not pursue its own investigation until the federal inquiry concludes. \n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:48:35.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
