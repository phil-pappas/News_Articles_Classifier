It was not ISIS’s invincibility, ISIS was defeated by women at the Battle of Kobani. It is because ISIS is needed to stay alive and well per U.S. political plans and now new evidence reveals that the U.S. was making mock attacks that were not targeting ISIS.\nThe story is told by Russian General Staff Andrey Kartapolov. He explains that photos of an area featuring bomb-destroyed buildings where there were no ISIS fighters\n. Who is doing these bombings and reporting “mission complete” as it appears is the U.S.\nTraces of airstrikes against household buildings have been found at the Syria-Jordan border, where Russian warplanes have performed no missions.\n“You can see on these photos that there are no signs of military activity around these cottages, there are no military hardware, not even signs of military hardware. These are regular gardens and fields with buildings to keep farming tools,” he said.\n“Why destroy these buildings? It looks like somebody’s pilots were just training their skills or dropped bombs to report to their command about completed mission,” Kartapolov answered adding ‘This territory has never been in the hands of the Islamic State”.\n“We have spotted ruins of household buildings destroyed by bombing near the settlement of Kherbet Ghazala at the Syrian-Jordan border,” he told a briefing for foreign military attaches and journalists.\n“Kherbet” is an Arabic word used for abandoned historic areas nearby that are usually uninhabited.\n“Russian warplanes have never performed any missions there and, as far as we know, the Syrian aviation has not been used there either,” he stressed. “This territory has never been in the hands of the Islamic State. Moreover, this area has been controlled by the Free Syrian Army since 2013.”\nAnd it even gets worse than that. Airstrikes of US-led coalition on civilian facilities o the Syrian territory lead to increasing refugee flows to the European Union, Kartapolov went on to say.\n“Over the last two weeks, we have provided enough video materials confirming the precision of [Russian] airstrikes. Our jets deliver airstrikes at facilities located outside of settlements,” Kartapolov said.\n“On October 11, near the settlement of Tel-Alam, the coalition’s jets destroyed by airstrikes a thermal power plant and transformer substation,” he added. As a result, hospitals and schools in Aleppo were left without electricity. Water pumping stations and sewage also stopped working which can be very harmful in the conditions of high temperatures.\n“I think that it is unlikely that our partners did not know that the thermal power plant worked only eight hours per day. Airstrikes were delivered for several days, and on October 11, the power station was completely destroyed. One might het an impression that someone is deliberately destroying infrastructure in settlements, thus making the life of local population impossible. Because of that, civilians leave these settlements after losing living conditions and increase the refugee flow to Europe,” Kartapolov noted.\n“On October 11, near the settlement of Tel-Alam, the coalition’s jets destroyed by airstrikes a thermal power plant and transformer substation,” he added.
