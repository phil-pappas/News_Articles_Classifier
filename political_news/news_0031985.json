The most I could get out of the two hour show was families are being broken up when mom or dad gets deported and in the 2012 election a lot of votes came from the Hispanic population. They made no point of how great these people as workers was. The talking point was immigration is broken and needs to be fixed. Funny it only broke when Obama needed to be elected as well as upcoming liberals like keeping this dream alive. Legal immigration worked fine for the last 240 years but now it needs to be fixed. I think Frontline and PBS also need to be fixed. No more funding from liberals. I'll tell you how to fix it. Send them all back to Mexico. Mom, Dad and kids can all be reunited back where they came from. Problem solved. Or is this part of the new USA? United Socialists of America?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:03:45.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
