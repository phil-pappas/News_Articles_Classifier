What's your best one ?? I asked the tech that did my study and he told me this story. A couple came in. They were on the verge of divorce. It was her contention his snoring was keeping her awake at night. She insisted the husband get the study. So they set him up, put him to bed, and he barely made a noise. Certainly not the window rattling snoring that was keeping her awake. They asked the woman to come in for a study. About every 30 minutes her snoring would get very loud, at which point she would wake up, punch the pillow next her (apparently thinking it was the hubby) and tell it to roll over. After which she'd fall back asleep for another 20 or 30 minutes then repeat the process. They told her was she needed to go home an apologize to her husband !!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:42:47.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
