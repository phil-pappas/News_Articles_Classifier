More Out means out in EU vote, warns Cameron \nBaroness Meacher, a crossbencher behind one of the amendments, says she has been “bullied” by Conservatives threatening to suspend the upper house or flood it with 100 new Tory peers if she does not back down. \nBehind the scenes, Mr Osborne is preparing measures in next month’s Autumn Statement to help 3m families on tax credits estimated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies to be facing average annual losses of almost £1,300 each. \nNicky Morgan, the education secretary, said that while the tax-credit policy would not change and that it was vital to reform the relationship between work and welfare, the chancellor was “in listening mode”. \n“We have a chancellor who in his statements and Budgets has been very clear about the need to help working families,” she told the BBC. \nMr Osborne has in the past raised personal tax allowances, increased free childcare or — most recently — created a national living wage to help low income households. \nThe chancellor is publicly refusing to retreat, knowing that any concessions now would make the Treasury appear weak just as it tries to extract another £20bn of public spending cuts from reluctant ministers. \nThe results of that spending review will be announced on November 25, which seems the most likely date for Mr Osborne to announce new help to “striving” families hit by the tax credit cuts. \nDavid Cameron’s allies admit the constant focus on the tax credit plan is damaging the Conservative claim to be “the workers’ party” while cabinet ministers are also voicing their concern at Mr Osborne’s refusal to budge. \nMeanwhile, Boris Johnson , a future leadership rival to the chancellor, has signalled his opposition to the tax-credit cuts, which he claims undermine “compassionate Conservatism”. I’ve said to him, ‘Look, if you can change your mind on this, we will not make any political capital out of this’ \n- John McDonnell, shadow chancellor \nThe issue will dominate at Westminster this week, with the initial focus on the votes in the House of Lords on Monday and a separate inquiry by the influential Commons work and pensions committee on the issue. \nTim Farron, Liberal Democrat leader, said his party would have no hesitation in challenging the convention that the Lords does not confront the authority of the Commons on tax and spending issues. \nA Labour amendment would stop Mr Osborne proceeding with the cuts for three years unless mitigating measures were put in place. On Thursday, MPs will hold another debate on tax credits, this time on the “distributional effect” of the changes, that take effect next April. \nFamilies affected will learn of the precise hole in their household finances only when they receive a letter from HM Revenue & Customs, with speculation it could be sent out just before Christmas. \nMrs Morgan hinted there might be a delay in sending out the unwelcome letters until after the festive period: “There are always complications in sending out mass letters,” she said. \nJohn McDonnell, shadow chancellor, made an unlikely offer of political clemency to Mr Osborne if he agreed to drop the tax-credit plan — part of a £12bn package of welfare savings announced in the Summer Budget. \n“I’ve said to him, ‘Look, if you can change your mind on this, we will not make any political capital out of this,’ ” Mr McDonnell told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show . \n“I’ve said to him, ‘If you change your mind, bring back a policy in which people are protected — not a political stunt but a real protection — we will not in any way attack you for that. In fact we’ll support you.’ ” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:06:57.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
