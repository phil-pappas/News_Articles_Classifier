He's 62. \nThe Port redevelops property in St. Paul. Current big projects are the Macy's building in downtown and the former Midway Stadium site. It operates 21 business centers and four river terminals. \nMayor Chris Coleman said in a statement: \nLouie has been integral to the revitalization and continued momentum and growth we are experiencing in St. Paul. We have a great deal to accomplish before he retires in February, and I am looking forward to that work together. \nThe Port will start looking for a replacement this month.
