The T and ELLE vet and O.G. street-style star is stepping down from her editor-in-chief position, per a release from the magazine. Lanphear has been in the job for a little over a year, and helmed its rebrand as a more fashion-centric title (not to mention its first male cover subject, Idris Elba .) Her last day is November 13.\nAt the time of the relaunch, Lanphear told the Cut that she was moving away from the title's pinup roots. \"My vision is to show women who will be a partner,\" she said. \"She’s not oiled up on a surfboard, she’s carrying the surfboard to the back of the truck you’re going to go to Montauk in together. That’s the fantasy and the aspiration.\"\nSaid publisher Kevin Martinez in a statement, “Kate has played an integral role in evolving the Maxim brand, and we would not be where we are today without her valuable leadership. We wish her all the best.”\n“Working at Maxim has truly been a rewarding experience,” Lanphear added. “I’m proud of everything all of us at Maxim have accomplished and how far the magazine has come in the past year.”\nAs for future plans for the magazine, they haven't been revealed yet, but COO Robert Price said, \"This fall, we are taking the next step in our evolution and will continue to upgrade the brand across fashion and luxury.” As for Lanphear's next move, that should be interesting to watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:06:43.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
