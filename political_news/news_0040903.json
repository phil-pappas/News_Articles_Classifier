The changes would force fuel distributors to purchase biofuel with a smaller carbon footprint. \nOil lobbyists, in turn, were met by environmental groups who urged the department to speed ahead as planned and launch the program on Jan. 1, 2016, calling for urgent action to combat climate change. \n\"With these changes proposed in this rulemaking, it actually gets worse,\" said Frank Holmes, a lobbyist for the Western States Petroleum Association. \"The ability for the industry to comply through the blending of low-carbon fuel gets very, very difficult.\" \nOregon's clean fuels program — passed by the Legislature this year and the subject of continued political wrangling — requires fuel distributors to cut carbon emissions by 10 percent over 10 years. \nThe changes in question would tweak how the department measures emissions, taking into account higher demand for cleaner fuel made with crops, called biofuel. Regulators are considering a new measurement that factors in additional effects on climate change, such as forests destroyed to make room for farmland. \nThat would effectively force distributors to seek out cleaner blends; domestic ethanol producers say their Midwestern corn ethanol would lose out to foreign blends made with Brazilian sugar cane. \nMost environmental groups are embracing the approach, saying it would more accurately measure emissions. \n\"Oregon can and must be a leader in solutions to climate change,\" said Chris Hagerbaumer, deputy director of the Oregon Environmental Council. \"The clean fuels program is one of those solutions and holds the oil industry accountable.\" \nBut oil industry advocates say they're constrained by a limited ethanol supply. \n\"Compliance is going to be difficult even in 2016 and 2017,\" said Miles Heller, director of regulatory issues to Tesoro, a Texas-based petroleum company. \"This is problematic right out of the gate.\" \nThe environmental quality commission is scheduled to vote on a final proposal Dec. 9. \n\"These emissions are real,\" said Jamie Painter, a lobbyist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group dedicated to fighting climate change. \"It would be a big mistake, for both technical and logistical reasons, not to follow through with the rules the DEQ has proposed.\" \nThe Renewable Fuels Association, a national coalition of biofuel producers, was notably absent at Monday's meeting. The group has threatened to join forces with an oil-backed ballot measure to repeal the clean fuels program in November 2016 if the new emissions rule is adopted, saying it unfairly targets ethanol manufacturers. \nGov. Kate Brown and a bipartisan group of eight lawmakers, seeking compromise on a transportation package, agreed on a proposal this year to repeal the clean fuels program and replace it with other carbon reduction measures. Brown's office has since said the two shouldn't be linked. \n— Ian K.
