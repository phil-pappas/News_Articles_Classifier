U.S. District Judge Leon Holmes recommended that she be imprisoned at Carswell, the federal correctional institute near Fort Worth that has the extensive medical facilities that might be needed by a prisoner who is starting her sentence at age 71. \nChuck Banks, the Little Rock attorney who defended Shoffner, confirmed last week that Shoffner plans to report as ordered and will not seek any delay. \nUnlike the state justice system, there is no parole in the federal system, although inmates can be released a few months early for good behavior.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:22:59.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
