The top 1 percent is made up of 1.13 million households with average incomes of $2.1 million a year, according to the Tax Policy Center. The New York Times estimates that increasing those households total tax burden from roughly one-third today to 40 percent would raise an additional $157 billion in revenue per year. To put that amount in perspective, the Times noted that Sanders plan to cover the cost of undergraduate tuition at a public college or university would cost the federal government $47 billion. Sanders intends to pay for his college plan, however, by taxing financial transactions. He has introduced Social Security legislation that expands benefits and extends the programs solvency by eliminating the cap on taxable earnings, which currently means millionaires only contribute to the program on the first $118,500 they earn. The senator told Maher he would pay for child care by closing corporate tax loopholes. The arithmetic on a single-payer health care system is a little bit trickier. Although Sanders has not yet released a detailed single-payer plan, a similar bill introduced by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) would be financed in part by payroll taxes on middle-income and wealthy earners. An analysis of the plan by Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, projects that Conyers bill would reduce overall health care costs by $592 billion per year, ultimately saving consumers money. It is also not clear how Sanders promise not to tax the middle class squares with his paid family leave plan. He backs a bill introduced by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), which would finance a proposed mandate for 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave with payroll tax contributions from all workers. . . . We've been so conditioned to not tax the rich, and to cut programs for the middle class and poor, we can't handle the idea of stopping this. But it's there. And it's coming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:20:30.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
