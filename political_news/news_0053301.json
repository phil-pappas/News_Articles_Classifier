Here are highlights of each proposal: \nELECTIONS BOARD: \n— The current six-member Government Accountability Board would be broken into two commissions, one in charge of elections and the other regulating lobbying, campaign finance and ethics. \n— The current board has an unlimited budget to conduct investigations. Under the bill, any investigation costing more than $25,000 would require approval by the Legislature's budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. \n— Six nonpartisan judges on the current board would be replaced. Each of the six-member commissions would have an equal number of appointees by Democrats and Republicans. They would serve five-year terms. \n— The six members of the Elections Commission would be appointed by the Senate majority and minority leaders, the Assembly speaker and the Assembly minority leader. Two former municipal or county clerks would be selected by Democratic and Republican legislative leaders, nominated by the governor and approved by the Senate. \n— Members of the new Ethics Commission would be selected the same as the Ethics Commission, except instead of clerks two members would be members of the public selected legislative leaders, nominated by the governor and approved by the Senate. \n— Administrators of each commission would be nominated by the boards and approved by the Senate for a four-year term. \n— Current staffers at the Government Accountability Board would retain their jobs. \n— Transition plans would be written once the bill is signed into law, but the new commissions would not officially start their work until July. \nCAMPAIGN FINANCE: \n— Coordination between candidates and third party issue advocacy groups that can accept an unlimited amount of donations without disclosing where the money comes from would be legalized. No other state allows such coordination, which the Wisconsin Supreme Court said in a July ruling was legal. \n— How much individuals can donate to candidates for office would double from $10,000 a year to $20,000, with the limit adjusted for inflation every five years. \n— In line with a federal court ruling, donations could be unlimited to political parties and legislative campaign committees, which work to get Republicans and Democrats elected to the Legislature. Corporate donations would be legal, but that money could not be passed on directly to candidates. \n— Donors giving more than $200 to a campaign would no longer have to disclose their employer, only their general occupation. \n— Groups and individuals that do use terms like \"vote for\" and \"vote against\" a certain candidate would be subject to regulation and have to disclose their fundraising and spending activity within 60 days of an election, but they could avoid disclosure in some instances more than 60 days from an election. \n— Political action committees and other independent groups could spend anonymously and not report its activity to regulators as long as it's less than 50 percent of the total budget for the group.
