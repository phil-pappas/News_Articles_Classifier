John Boehner gives a potentially premature exit interview. And Al Franken gets ready to go to bat for Ted Strickland. Read on in Ohio Politics Roundup.\nThe Kasich Express: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, looking to recharge his presidential campaign, begins a big four-day bus tour today in New Hampshire.\nThe road trip brings back memories of John McCain's Straight Talk Express tour in 2000 – McCain's strategist that year, John Weaver, now works for Kasich – and starts in Concord. It continues next week, with events Monday through Wednesday.\n'90s nostalgia: On Sean Hannity's Fox News program Thursday night, Kasich emphasized his work as the House Budget Chairman who helped deliver the last balanced budget. Kasich talks about those days often, but with chaos in Congress, he's hoping it will become a more appealing talking point. Watch the video here .\nNew message: \"John Kasich's political action committee is planning to position him as someone who has challenged the status quo, as the Ohio governor's polling slides while political outsiders Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina continue to lead national GOP presidential polls,\" the Cincinnati Enquirer's Chrissie Thompson reports .\n\"In a memo sent to donors and obtained by The Enquirer, strategists for the New Day for America PAC say they will shift from the experience-laden biographical ads that fueled Kasich's early rise in polls in New Hampshire, home to the nation's first 2016 primary. Kasich's polling has cooled since his quiet CNN debate performance last month.\"\nThe 'Phase II' memo, from New Day advisers Matt Carle and Matt David, reads: \"Messaging will share John Kasich's reputation as someone who has always shaken up the system to fix big problems. Unlike the other candidates in the field, whom Gov. Kasich has called 'speechmakers,' Kasich has challenged business as usual in Washington and Ohio politics and actually has something to show for it.\"\nExit interview: Outgoing U.S. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio sat down with home-state reporters Thursday in Washington. Boehner, reports the Northeast Ohio Media Group's Sabrina Eaton , is \"done performing like a windup monkey.\"\nBoehner said he is a \"big fan\" of both Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, but he has no plans to help either's presidential campaign. \"He also hasn't endorsed any of the candidates who want to take over his old congressional seat\"\nJust when he thought he was out ... \"Boehner had said he was 'confident' that [House Majority Leader Kevin] McCarthy would be elected speaker while talking to Ohio reporters,\" writes Jessica Wehrman of the Columbus Dispatch. But soon after the meeting, McCarthy withdrew and Boehner \"issued a statement assuring his colleagues that he would serve as speaker until the House Republicans could agree on a new one.\"\nSchool board president won't turn over records: \"State school board President Tom Gunlock says he doesn't see a need to give Ohio Auditor Dave Yost confidential records to find out if the Ohio Department of Education broke state law in a controversial round of charter school evaluations this year,\" The Plain Dealer's Patrick O'Donnell reports .\n\"The department already admits it. ... Some other board members disagree with Gunlock's position – one he openly acknowledges is his personal position and not the board's – and plan to seek a vote on the issue at its next meeting Oct. 19 and 20.\"\nAnother redistricting push: \"With voters deciding whether to change how Ohio draws legislative districts, a bipartisan pair of senators urged the Constitutional Modernization Commission on Thursday to recommend similar changes for congressional seats,\" the Dispatch's Jim Siegel reports . Democrat Tom Sawyer and Republican Frank LaRose \"are sponsoring a congressional-redistricting proposal that is similar to the legislative-redistricting proposal that is on the November ballot as Issue 1.\"\nFirst ad from Issue 3 opponents: \" The ad, described by Ohioans Against Marijuana Monopolies as a 'significant six-figure buy,' will appear on websites and in applications through Nov. 3,\" NEOMG's Jackie Borchardt reports . \"Curt Steiner, a political consultant working for the group, said the web ad will be seen more than a million times and the group plans to buy TV air time before Election Day.\"\nGood enough, smart enough, and doggone it ... Al Franken, the Minnesota senator known for playing Stuart Smalley on \"Saturday Night Live,\" will headline a Monday night fundraiser for Democratic Senate hopeful Ted Strickland.\nFormer Shaker Heights Mayor Judy Rawson and her husband, Bob, will host the event at their home, according to an invitation obtained by the Northeast Ohio Media Group. Others on the host committee include Geauga County Democratic Party Chairwoman Janet Carson and Cleveland-area attorneys John Climaco and Michael Wager.\nMore from the world of entertainment: Jerry Springer, the Cincinnati mayor-turned-celebrity TV personality known for trashy talk shows, headlined an Ohio Democratic Party fundraiser this week, the Toledo Blade's Lauren Lindstrom reports . For Springer, \"the Toledo stop is part of a six-day commitment to the Ohio Democratic Party, with stops planned in Bowling Green, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Columbus.\"\nPG's players: New Leadership for Ohio, a new independent political group backing Cincinnati City Councilman PG Sittenfeld's bid against Strickland in the Democratic Senate primary, \"says it took in $370,000 in its first two weeks, and expects to raise a lot more,\" NEOMG's Stephen Koff reports . \"By law, it doesn't have to disclose its totals until January. But the PAC's founders decided to release information about the initial haul in order to make a statement: Don't count Sittenfeld out.\"\nTeachers for Ted: The National and Ohio Education Associations' political arms have endorsed Strickland , the former Ohio governor, in the U.S. Senate race.\nThe Portman watch: Strickland and Sittenfeld are vying for a chance to unseat Republican incumbent Rob Portman. Koff reports that Portman is likely to vote against a potential gun control bill and for a new move to defund Planned Parenthood.\nBookmark the Roundup: Find each morning's roundup and past editions here .\nTips or links?
