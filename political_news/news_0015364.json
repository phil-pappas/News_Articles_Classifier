Bobby Jindal doubled down on earlier, critical comments aimed at the father of the mass shooter at an Oregon community college last week.\nIn an appearance on ABC's \"This Week,\" Jindal continued to blame the father of Christopher Harper-Mercer for the mass shooting his son carried out on a Oregon community college campus last week. Jindal was particularly upset the father had used the incident to advocate for gun ownership restrictions.\n\"He doesn't need to be lecturing us. He, by his own admission, didn't know how his son got those guns, didn't know how many guns his son had. By his own admission, wasn't involved in his son's life, hadn't been communicating with him,\" Jindal said during the interview .\nYou can watch the full interview on \"This Week\" here .\n. . . . .\nJulia O'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.
