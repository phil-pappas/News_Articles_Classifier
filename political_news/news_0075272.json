Dr. Desai has never been convicted and deserves his rightful place at the WMA.\nIn 2013, the Brazil General Assembly revoked his suspension. A council meeting at Japan set-up steps for his reinstallation in 2016, based on a communication sent by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), enclosing a CBI letter enlisting the status of seven cases against him that was ratified in South Africa WMA General Assembly in 2014.\nUnanimously elected three times to head the Medical Council of India , once Indian Medical Association, he was instrumental in reforming medical education, implementing a common entrance medical exam, making research compulsory for teachers and postgraduates; and stringent laws to prevent pharma-doctor nexus and hiring of fake doctors.\nHe was Professor and Head of Urology at the prestigious Government B J Medical College, Ahmedabad (1988-2015), and President of Gujarat Medical Council (1993-2010).
