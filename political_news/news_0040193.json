We certainly don't want to see that kind of thing happening in Scotland.\"\nShare article Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said the Bill could put an unreasonable burden on police.\n“These are issues I don’t think have been thought through by the UK government. The Scottish Police Federation have raised a very valid issue for the implications in Scotland.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-18T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:55:10.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
