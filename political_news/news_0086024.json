Many potential pet adopters overlook older animals - but there are so many reasons why dogs over the age of 6 or 7 make ideal furry family members and friends:\nThey tend to be less rambunctious than younger dogs. They're often already house-trained. They're a great fit for people with busy lifestyles. They're so grateful for a second chance. They love you unconditionally. \"It's heartbreaking to think about all the senior animals who had been cherished pets before they suddenly found themselves confused and alone in shelter kennels,\" said Dr. Robin Ganzert , president and CEO of American Humane Association. \"Far too often this happens to many older dogs through no fault of their own-after their human owners encounter financial troubles, illness, or other life upheavals.\"\nThis need is gaining attention across the country. Numerous stories are appearing on the news and a new book, \"My Old Dog: Rescued Pets with Remarkable Second Acts,\" by TODAY.com writer Laura T. Coffey and photographer Lori Fusaro highlights how much senior dogs have to offer. My Old Dog shares happy adoption success stories and celebrates the grand times that can be had with shelter dogs past the age of puppyhood.\n\"Senior dogs who get adopted from shelters just might be the most grateful dogs on the planet,\" said Coffey. \"And don't let their age fool you! It's amazing to see how much these dogs still have to offer and teach us.\"\nYour local shelter is the perfect place to find dogs of every type, size, age and personality – all waiting for a loving home. Or if you prefer a particular breed that isn't currently available at a shelter, go online to find a legitimate breed-specific rescue group in need of adopters like you. In fact, why not help build momentum and spread the word by adding your name to our pledge to make your next pet a rescue or shelter animal and \"like\" us on Facebook and Twitter.\nFind out what a shelter or rescue dog can bring to your life this October during Adopt-A-Dog Month. Here are some resources to get you started:\nAdoption Center For Dog Adopters & Dog Owners\nVisit our virtual Adoption Center to learn about dog adoption, behavior and care.\nShelters & Rescue Groups\nGet free resources to help you promote Adopt-A-Dog Month and increase dog adoptions.\nEducators\nDownload our free lesson plans to teach your students about choosing a dog , caring for a dog , and pet identification .\nAmerican Humane Association established Adopt-A-Dog Month® in October 1981 as an annual event to encourage people to save lives and enhance their own lives by adopting a dog from a shelter or rescue group. Thirty-three years later, that message is as strong, true and important as ever, as millions of dogs in shelters await adoption every year.\n\"With so many dogs in shelters all across our country available for adoption - and many of them never finding a safe, loving, forever home - adopting a dog will make you a hero, too,\" added Dr. Ganzert\nHere are a variety of ways to celebrate Adopt-A-Dog Month:\nAdopt from a shelter or rescue group\nWhen you're ready to open your heart and home to a new best friend, adopt from your local animal shelter or rescue group. Talk with shelter staff to find the perfect dog for you and your lifestyle, and remember that older dogs make excellent pets too.\nSpay or neuter your dog\nHave your dog spayed or neutered, thus preventing the possibility of unexpected, and potentially unwanted, puppies. Spayed and neutered animals have been shown to lead longer, healthier lives and have fewer of certain behavioral problems than animals who have not been spayed or neutered.\nID your pet\nBy putting identification on your dog, either in the form of a tag, a microchip or both, you will reduce the possibility that your pet will become one of the presumably \"homeless\" dogs that end up at your local shelter. Only 15-20 percent of dogs who enter a shelter are reunited with their owners. Make sure your dog is one of the fortunate few by outfitting him with proper identification! You may also wish to enroll your dog with mobiPET, a free new, high-tech, visual \"AMBER Alert\" for missing pets that helps reunite lost pets with their owners., but will help raise funds to help animals in need all across the country. Owners simply upload their pet's image and contact information at www.mobipet.me to register each pet and receive the web app for their phone. If the dog or cat runs off pet owners can text the word \"LOST\" to mypet@agm.tw . Smartphone owners can either text or open the web app and click on \"Lost a Pet.\" The basic registration is free and mobiPET will donate 10 percent of all premium service subscriptions to American Humane Association when pet parents include \"AHA\" on the referral line.\nSupport your local shelter\nShow the pets at your local shelter or rescue group that you care by donating time, money or supplies like pet food, leashes, beds and toys. Call the shelter to see what supplies or services are needed most. Even the smallest effort can make a difference.\nAbout American Humane Association\nAmerican Humane Association is the country's first national humane organization and the only one dedicated to protecting both children and animals.
