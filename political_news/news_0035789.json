This sweet dish was prepared by several mutts and temples in the state about 600 years ago,\" he said.\nPanigrahi said there were evidences supporting Odisha's claim over Rasagolla in epics like Mahabharata, the one written by Sarala Das, 'Dandi Ramayan' and also in Madala Panji, the ancient text used by the 12th century Sri Jagannath Temple. \"Even we have evidence regarding availability of Rasagolla in Odisha when Adi Shankaracharya visited Sri Jagannth Temple,\" Panigrahi said.\nBoth Odisha and West Bengal have been claiming that Rasagolla originated from their states. Both have been trying to get Geographical Indication (GI) tag over Rasagolla. The minister, however, said that the committees required one more month to submit their final report in this connection.\n\"We will take our next course of action after the committees submit their final report,\" the minister said. The state government last month set up three committees to prepare documents on the origin of Rasagolla. The first committee, comprising seven members, will submit facts on the origin of Rasagolla while the second four-member committee will study the contention of the West Bengal government to stake its claim over the origin of the sweet dish for getting GI status.\nThe six-member third committee will do necessary documentation in support of the Odisha government to place before the Centre to stake claim for patent over Rasagolla and GI tag for it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:18:31.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
