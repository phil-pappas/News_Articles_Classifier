Givi’s Headquarters at the New Terminal of Donetsk airport were shelled, as well as the populated areas of the city.\nOSCE’s comments on the matter were of the usual ‘hear no evil, see no evil’ format:\nAt 14:55hrs on 10 October at the Joint Centre for Control and Co-ordination (JCCC) observation post at the “Donetsk People’s Republic” (“DPR”)-controlled Donetsk railway station (8km north-west of Donetsk city centre), the SMM heard an explosion to the north, at least 3km away.\nAt 16:10hrs, a Russian Federation representative to the JCCC and a “DPR” member told the SMM that there had been a shelling incident involving casualties in “DPR”-controlled Vesele (9km north-west of Donetsk city centre).\nAt 16:30hrs, the SMM – on the way to Vesele – observed all floors in a nine-storey building on fire on Vzletnaia Street. (8.2km north-north-west of Donetsk city centre). The SMM noted an impact from an undetermined projectile on the north-north-west facing wall of the first floor of the building. The SMM noted no casualties.\nContinuing on towards Vesele, the SMM at 17:40hrs – 300m south of the destroyed “DPR”-controlled new terminal airport building (10km north-west of Donetsk city centre) – observed a projectile impacting on the new terminal building.\nAt 17:50hrs, the SMM observed what it assessed as a fresh mortar impact 3m west of Stratonavtov Street in Vesele. The SMM observed blood and human remains around the impact area and a small bone fragment embedded in a nearby tree. Armed “DPR” members present told the SMM that one person had been killed and two injured – all members of the “DPR” – in the incident, which they said had occurred between 14:10 and 14:20hrs. Following crater analysis, the SMM assessed that an infantry-type mortar round, possibly of a caliber of 60mm, had caused the crater, which had a 10cm depth and 35cm diameter. Due to the high incoming angle of the projectile, the SMM could not ascertain the direction of fire.\nThe SMM intends to follow up on the incident, including through visits to hospitals and the morgue.\nFort Russ\nThe real UAF: From a decrepit military to psychotic thugs\nOctober 10, 2015 -\nMaksim Stepantsov, Novorossiya –\nTranslated for Fort Russ by J. Arnoldski\n………………This is precisely why all the mobilizations of the UAF failed, and the self-defense units of Donbass, recruited on a voluntary basis from yesterday’s miners and tractor drivers, put up a heroic resistance.\nThe southern cauldron, Saur-Mogila, Ilovaysk, and the Debaltsevo cauldron were featured on television screens necessarily with backgrounds of wrecked T-64 tanks, destroyed BM-21 volley fire systems, burned army vehicles, and abandoned artillery positions from which nothing was taken.\nSimultaneously, Ukraine carried out several waves of mobilization and formed new military units, detachments of the National Guard, etc., which at times added more “worthless” units to the not so simple situation with troop equipment.\nIn one year, almost all combat aircraft and air-defense systems were destroyed, naval forces were in ruins, command was seriously disrupted, unprepared “mobilization waves” decreased the quality of land forces sharply, and the number of combat-ready equipment was sharply reduced due to large losses.\nAnd this is all true despite the boastful statements by representatives of the Kiev regime. In their report, “Global Firepower” experts cite such data. Under the previous administration, the UAF had a total of 4,112 tanks, and because of losses only 2,809 remain. If earlier the air force had 400 combat aircraft, today experts count only 222. As a note for experts and readers, the main losses occurred among the 200 sections which in 2011-2013 had undergone capital repairs and modernization. In terms of “air forces,” over the last year Ukraine has dropped from the 20th to the 45th position in rankings. …..\nNovorossia\nOne casualty and wounded person after shelling of the Kievskiy district of Donetsk by Ukrainian fighters\nOctober 11, 2015 No comments\nOne casualty and wounded person as a result of shelling of the Kievskiy district of Donetsk by Ukrainian fighters, it was reported to DAN by the Defen… Read more", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/zklEV/~4/p1vnk5X80Rs", "http://novorossia.today/novorossia/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGvWHyt8CtA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/r84_qxwOI_A", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlSafF4vbU4", "http://fortruss.blogspot.com/2015/10/the-real-uaf-from-decrepit-military-to.html", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgXxUtDZFHk", "http://fortruss.blogspot.com/", "http://novorossia.today/one-casualty-and-wounded-person-after-shelling-of-the-kievskiy-district-of-donetsk-by-ukrainian-fighters/#comments", "http://fortruss.blogspot.com/2015/10/escalation-in-donbass-multiple-uaf.html", "http://novorossia.today/one-casualty-and-wounded-person-after-shelling-of-the-kievskiy-district-of-donetsk-by-ukrainian-fighters/", "http://novorossia.today/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1114-190x122.jpg", "http://www.novorosinform.org/articles/id/2097"], "published": "2015-10-11T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:04:24.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
