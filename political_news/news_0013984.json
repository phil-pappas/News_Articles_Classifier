The contentious legislation signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in June is set to go into effect for the 2016 school year and allows individuals who possess a concealed carry permit to bring their firearms to campus although university presidents are able to make “reasonable” regulations.\n“The State of Texas has decided that it is not at all obnoxious to allow deadly concealed weapons in classrooms, however it does have strict rules about free sexual expression, to protect your innocence,” the event description reads. “You would receive a citation for taking a dildo to class before you would get in trouble for taking a gun to class. Heaven forbid the penis.”\nWhat else is there to say but that these people are bat guano insane?", "external_links": ["http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/09/30/anti-gun-professors-petition-to-keep-texas-classrooms-safe-from-guns-after-governor-signs-pro-campus-carry-law/", "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/10/11/college-students-plan-to-carry-sex-toys-around-campus-to-protest-campus-carry/", "http://www.thepiratescove.us//feed/https://www.facebook.com/events/1686524198249678/", "http://www.thepiratescove.us/2ea8a268/4a7d71b3/FeedBurner/1.0"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:45:49.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
