The 2016 Executive have said they will vote to re-affiliate at the earliest opportunity. Clearly they have the backing of Otago students to do just that.” \n“We have spent a year proving to students that when we work together we can have a clear, considered and articulate voice. I look forward to working with the OUSA team to get important issues like the miserly 7 EFTS cap on the political agenda.” \nKahlia Fryer, the Lincoln University Students’ Association President says she welcomes the decision at Otago. \n“It’s important that all student voices are heard on the national stage. Getting a solid recommitment from Otago is good for Otago students, - but actually good for all students too. We are better together.” she says. \nMcCourt says he hopes OUSA will now re-engage with the national student movement, especially as other associations look to join. \n“This result follows an equally impressive vote from Vic students last month, giving NZUSA a strong consolidated membership. Now is the time for us to take an effective and growing student movement to the next level.” \nOUSA’s membership of the national body expires on 1 December. NZUSA’s Congress, which elects the president, and sets the budget and strategic direction, will occur in mid-December. \nENDS NZUSA - New Zealand Union of Students' Associations \nServing students nationally since 1929 \nNZUSA is a national representative organisation that exists to advance the political, social and economic interests of tertiary students by providing a voice for students and through providing support for member students' associations.
