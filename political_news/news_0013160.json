Because of the unforgiving policies of the current regime in Iran and the fact that some still have family in that country, they are masking their identities. On the film's website, a-tranzlatur (a-tranzlatur.com), the filmmakers' faces are hidden behind masks and, on video, their voices scrambled electronically.\nAlthough Hollywood films, such as \" Sin City\" and \" 300,\" have combined animation with filmed action, this technology has never been used before for a film about the political and social state of Iran and its oppressive government.\nPre-production has been completed on a tranzlatur (a translator) and the Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for post-production will be launched on Oct. 30, 2015 . You can also access via this link the Kickstarter preview link . ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/700514888/2112053776?token=0e6c554a )\na tranzlatur is the tale of an English student, Hafez, who is translating an ancient Arabian myth of a dragon-king named Zahhak with two snakes on his shoulders. Zahhak's snakes must feed daily on human brains in order for Zahhak to survive. The film draws eerie parallels between Iran's Ayatollah Time and Zahhak's story. As Iran turns into a regular misery because of the ayatollah's diktat, Hafez re-imagines the devil incarnate of his translation, Zahhak, through the persona of the ayatollah. Hafez finally escapes the unbending Iranian regime, only to become a paperless, dislocated person in a foreign country.\nThe filmmakers (all with noms de guerre, as they must remain anonymous) include:\na.a. zann – Creator, art director, screenwriter. Founder of 53 Stairs studio.\nDrevey – Cinematographer. The thinking brain behind some of the most respected videos for Iran's most controversial contemporary singers.\nBen Edgefield – Illustrator, non-fiction.\nMarc Dunn – Motion designer, editor. Eminent for his surreal, neo-futuristic, highly dynamic and technologic taste in editing.\nChloe Hamburg – Illustrator, fiction.\nFor more information on this groundbreaking project, contact:\nTom Hadeed\nEmail\n(857) 600-8008\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iranian-ex-patriots-launch-kickstarter-campaign-for-innovative-anti-ayatollah-film-300165735.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151023/280137LOGO", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH37460&Transmission_Id=201510260830PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH37460&DateId=20151026", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/700514888/2112053776?token=0e6c554a", "http://a-tranzlatur.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151023/280136", "http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=293111", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iranian-ex-patriots-launch-kickstarter-campaign-for-innovative-anti-ayatollah-film-300165735.html"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:32:37.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
