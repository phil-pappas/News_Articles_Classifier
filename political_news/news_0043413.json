As part of the transfer, the training levy required by private sector institutions employing over 50 workers that totals 4% of the total salaries of foreign workers has now been cancelled. \nThe Decree has been issued by His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa under urgent notice and aims to complete the economic legislative infrastructure in the Kingdom by merging some government departments to avoid redundancy in public work, boost productivity and cut expenses resulting in a stronger economic climate. Under the decree, the responsibilities of the High Council for Vocational Training are transferred to \"Tamkeen\" in order to control expenditure, boost the national economy's sustainability and grant the private sector further growth.\nStemming from its commitment to provide support to Bahraini enterprises and individuals, Tamkeen pledges to work closely with the Ministry of Labour and concerned organisations and entities in devising an integrated action plan to ensure smooth implementation and transfer of duties. Over the coming period, Tamkeen will also work with the private sector to identify its training needs and provide the relevant training solutions for those needs. This plan will lay out solid foundations that will assist in boosting competitiveness and sustainable economic development in the short and long terms. This will in turn, help Bahraini citizens, companies as well as institutions operating in the Kingdom to fully realise their ambitions and goals.\nWith the cancellation of the annual 4% training levy paid to the Ministry of Labour, Tamkeen will be the leading entity for delivering training to private sector employees. Utilising its extensive experience in upskilling Bahrainis and preparing them for the labour market, Tamkeen will assume new responsibilities that include drafting of vocational training policies and formulating relevant plans. These will be added to the other current responsibilities of Tamkeen. These include investment in vocational training, research to identify training needs, revision and assessment of training programmes, and matching training providers with relevant businesses and institutions. \n-Ends- \nTamkeen is a semi-government organisation in Bahrain established in 2006 under Law Number (57) as part of the country's national reform initiatives, with the task of making the private sector as the key driver of sustainable economic development. \nUnderpinned by its 3 strategic pillars - enhancing quality, serving customers, and achieving results - the organisation provides an integrated range of programmes to create a solid foundation for a modern economy - such as SME financing, skills training, and entrepreneurship. \nAt the same time, these programmes address key challenges facing Bahrainis and businesses in the private sector at various stages of their development - from start-ups to mature companies, and from students to senior executives. \nTo date, Tamkeen's programmes have served more than 120,000 Bahrainis and businesses. \nMore information available at www.tamkeen.bh \nFor media inquiries, please contact:Tamkeen Marketing Communications Dept.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:32:30.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
