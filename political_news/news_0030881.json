Her strong debate performance last week dampened some of that talk.\nDurbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, was asked on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Monday whether Biden could win the nomination by jumping in now. Durbin said he was \"not sure ... I would say at this point he has not had the starting structure\" that Clinton has.\nDurbin said Clinton \"has a long history of controversy and I think that turns some people off.\" But he said Clinton is \"still the strongest candidate for president.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:54:57.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
