Ignoring the UN definition that refugees are people who have been forced to leave their country by actual or perceived threats, the Republican presidential frontrunner declared he would send back all Syrian refugees no matter their age, gender or faith. Indeed, at a rally in New Hampshire , Trump protested strongly against refugees entering the U.S. and warned: \"I'm putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of this mass migrationIf I win, they're going back.\"(1) The billionaire business man justified his policy by stating that he was worried the refugees, who have been fleeing their country after years of a civil war, might be Islamic State militants in disguise and \"the greatest tactical ploys of all time.\"\n\nRefoulment is a term that describes the involuntary return to their homelands of refugees who have a legitimate fear of either facing persecution or death. In addition, people who legally claim refugee status are protected by international laws from refoulment, a protection that was approved by the U.S. in the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Additional Protocol .(2) Consequently, not only would Trump's refoulment policy break international laws and treaties, but it would deny basic human rights afforded to refugees fleeing from Syria. Moreover, forcing Syrian refugees to return to their homeland would be an immoral \"push factor\" while denying them other rights, like seeking advice or protection from international groups.\n\nIronically, Trump and his followers might not realize or refuse to believe that millions of Syrians , many risking their lives in crowded boats and rafts or dangerous overland routes, were forced from their homeland by a failed U.S.-backed military coup which attempted to overthrow the Assad regime. At the same time, other refugee dislocations in southwest Asia and across north Africa are caused by U.S. foreign policies, policies that are now in panic mode after years of trying to establish U.S. hegemony through preemptive wars and military occupations. To be certain, America 's post-Soviet Order in the region was a power hungry scheme to not only impose more imperial and geopolitical control, but served as a money making racket to enrich a massive corporatized armaments industry.\n\nSince the U.S. is a primary actor in causing Syria's refugee crisis, it is reprehensible to either deny entrance or cry refoulment. In fact, International law also states that nations are obliged to provide shelter, food, and other vital resources to refugees and are prohibited from repatriating them so long as conditions remain unsafe in their countries of origin. For all intents and purposes, the U.S. is not only ethically obligated to provide shelter and food and employment for Syrian refugees, but should resist Trump's fear mongering and generalizations. To be certain, some of the refugees are young children, youth, women, or elderly, hardly ISIS militants. Furthermore, if the U.S. wants to stem the tide of Syria's refugees it will have to radically change its lethal policies.\n\nAnother important aspect about crying \"foul\" and refoulment is when political leaders protest strongly with imaginary wrongs or injustices. According to Trump, his \"Islamic State militants in disguise\" and \"greatest tactical ploy of all times\" is a 200,000-man army. Perhaps the U.S. would experience a vast improvement if it reserved refoulment for politicians that look for scapegoats during difficult times, or seek out targets to divert voter attention from their own reprehensible actions in preventing depraved wars.\n\nDallas Darling (darling@wn.com)\n\n(Dallas Darling is the author of Politics 501: An A-Z Reading on Conscientious Political Thought and Action , Some Nations Above God: 52 Weekly Reflections On Modern-Day Imperialism , Militarism, And Consumerism in the Context of John 's Apocalyptic Vision , and The Other Side Of Christianity : Reflections on Faith , Politics, Spirituality , History , and Peace .
