David Vitter, R-La., is the only one of the major four gubernatorial candidates who won't rule out closing a public college or university if elected this fall.\nPublic Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne and state Rep. John Bel Edwards have all gone on record as saying they wouldn't pursue closing one of Louisiana's higher education institutions if elected governor. Vitter has not been willing to make a similar commitment, though shuttering institutions is not part of his public plan for governing or an idea he talks about on the campaign trail.\n\"I don't think he's ruled anything out,\" said Luke Bolar, a spokesman for the Vitter campaign, in an interview.\nWhile he said he wouldn't consider a closure, Dardenne has acknowledged that he would be open to discussions of a merger of two higher education institutions. Dardenne said closures aren't really politically viable, but a merger would be something he could consider.\n\"I think that's something we can talk about. ... I'm trying not to take anything off the table,\" Dardenne, a Republican, said in an interview.\nThe issue of closing and merging public colleges and universities has come up a couple of times during Gov. Bobby Jindal 's tenure in office. Looming budget cuts and, perhaps more importantly, poor graduation rates at some of Louisiana's higher education institutions have prompted some calls for fewer campuses in recent years.\nJindal pushed to combine the University of New Orleans and Southern University of New Orleans back in 2011. But New Orleans legislators, the state's black caucus and higher education officials successfully beat back that merger. The SUNO-UNO plan failed to get the two-thirds support it needed in the Louisiana Legislature, despite being backed by a powerful team of Jindal and former House Speaker Jim Tucker, R-Algiers.\nMore recently, higher education officials argued that some of the budget cuts put on the table for higher education last spring would have effectively lead to campus closures . Concerns about institutions shuttering is, in part, what drove state legislators to take difficult votes to raise taxes and cut business incentives earlier this year.\nLouisiana's budget problems don't look likely to end anytime soon. The state is likely to face at least a $100 million shortfall in its current budget year. Next year's budget gap appears to be at least $700 million already.\nHigher education has traditionally borne the brunt of the state's financial shortfalls. Louisiana has cut more funding out of higher education since 2008 than almost any other state in the country as the state has faced a continuing budget crisis.\nThe financial woes have elected officials, including the men running to be governor, looking for ways to boost efficiency at public colleges and universities. But higher education closures and mergers -- in addition to being politically difficult -- don't actually save that much money in the short term. This might be why the idea of combining institutions has essentially been left off the table despite the state's ongoing financial problems.\n\"I just don't see it as a part of a serious discussion at this time,\" said Barry Erwin, head of the Council for A Better Louisiana.\nBut even if candidates are shying away from talking about a full blown merger of two different schools, many are floating the idea of cutting \"duplicate programs\" or possibly having two schools share physical space.\nVitter and Dardenne, in particular, have talked about cutting down on similar academic programs that exist at nearby institutions. Specifically, Vitter has mentioned consolidating the four public nursing programs at higher education institutions in the Shreveport-Bossier area.\nVitter has also said he wants more two-year and four-year institutions to share space with each other. When asked for details, the Vitter campaign said it would look to copy a space-sharing arrangement that currently exists between Southeastern University and the Northshore Technical Community College.\nThe Vitter campaign did not say what campuses he thought would benefit from sharing space. Dardenne -- who also wants institutions to share space -- also didn't give specifics about which campuses might be affected, saying he would leave such decisions up to the Louisiana Board of Regents.\n\"There is a lot of unused space that we could use better,\" Dardenne said.\nAngelle and Edwards have focused less on how to cut down on duplicative programs or space-sharing arrangements.\nAngelle, a Republican who serves on the LSU Board of Supervisors, has offered few specifics about his plans for higher education, other than a desire to increase funding for public colleges and universities.\nEdwards, the only Democrat in the race, has been more specific about targets for boosting higher education support. He said he wants Louisiana's colleges and universities to be funded half from tuition and half from state funding. (Currently, about 70 percent of higher education funding comes from tuition.)\n. . . . .\nJulia O'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge .
