From now until July 2017 [planned election], the country will be under reform and people should know what the government is doing during this critical period,\" he said. His messages have been delivered to people through Government Spokesman Maj-General Sansern Kaewkamnerd over the past few days. When asked why he did not deliver the messages himself, he said some necessary matters had to be officially announced. Prayut also called on those who have different views to not just talk about conflicts but also address the root problems. \"I am not blaming anybody, but this is the time to work together under reform,\" he said. 457 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:56:21.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
