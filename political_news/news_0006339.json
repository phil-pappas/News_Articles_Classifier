Why not add on breathing?\nMy husband and I are seriously considering moving out of the city, county and the state of Illinois. My husband is retired and I am disabled. If the government keeps adding all those taxes — don’t forget, property taxes are going up, too — we will be literally broke!\nOh, and our Social Security checks will NOT be getting a COLA because the cost of gasoline is down. Does Preckwinkle even realize if enough people move out, the revenue won’t go up, it will actually go down?\nKathy Banasiak, Hegewisch\nSEND LETTERS TO: letters@suntimes.com . Please include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes.\nMajor fumble\nSo now the news media is reporting that Barbara Byrd-Bennett is being investigated by the feds for millions of dollars of contracts that were awarded during her position as an $18,000-a-month executive at the Detroit Public Schools. Wow! The Rahmster sure fumbled this political football. In the inimitable words of USMC Pvt. Gomer Pyle: “Surprise, surprise, surprise.”\nLee J. Regner, Park Ridge\nAll Barbara Byrd-Bennett had to say was, “Sorry.”\nWhere was that sorry on a daily basis while she was planning with her friends to take the taxpayers for a costly ride? Where was that sorry when she blasted people for questioning her educational directions when they did not work in education? Perhaps Barbara needs to understand that education has nothing and/or little to do with stealing, lying, corruption, cover up and greed.\nThis again leads us to look at the vetting/hiring process of the city and, for that matter, the state. We can see that this network of hiring insiders, friends of friends, big contributors has not brought any returns to the city and state.\nBob Quinn, Crest Hill\nWorkers and job s\nWho’s responsible for erasing America’s shortage of skilled workers? That is the question posed by The Atlantic last month in a story on why our work force suffers from unemployment and underemployment while businesses say there is a shortage of workers with the skills needed to fill thousands of jobs.\nOctober is Careers in Construction Month, so let’s talk specifics about who will build the communities of the future. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says we will need 1.6 million new construction workers by 2022. Already about four in five members of Associated Builders and Contractors say there is a shortage of skilled labor, and a quarter of construction workers are expected to retire in the next 10 years. That’s a big challenge, but ABC is making headway in attracting talented people to construction. Our members invest $1.1 billion annually in training — that’s billion with a B! Our chapters offer more than 800 apprenticeship, craft training and safety training programs around the country. Collectively our members train 476,000 construction industry professionals a year. And we’re proud to support education initiatives like buildyourfuture.org that attract young people to careers in construction.\nWe have also made strides in outreach to groups traditionally underrepresented in our industry. For example, women now hold 21 percent of management/supervisory positions at ABC member firms. While veterans already account for 23 percent of trade and craft professionals at ABC member companies, we are committed to helping them translate their skills and leadership into jobs, and we recently joined in a pledge by industry groups to employ 100,000 veterans in the next five years. Perhaps most importantly, we recognize and honor the skills and talents of our workers through competitions and awards.\nAlicia Martin. president, Associated Builders & Contractors – Illinois Chapter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:06:45.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
