Sarah Wollaston, chairman of the health select committee, has questioned whether political pressure has been exerted to stop the release of a review by Public Health England (PHE).\nThe agency looked at the merits of increased taxes on sugary drinks and sweets and other measures, such as reduced portion sizes or action on discount deals.\nA tax is supported by many health experts , but ministers are believed to be resistant to the idea, preferring other methods of changing behaviour.\nThe review was originally expected to be published in July.\nPlay video \"'The Evidence is Piling Up'\" Video: 'The Evidence is Piling Up' Dr Wollaston wrote to Mr Hunt last month, asking him to publish the findings before a planned inquiry by the committee into childhood obesity.\n\"In keeping with the Government's stated policy of increasing transparency within the NHS and medical research, I believe that the department should lead by example and allow the public as well as members of Parliament full and timely access to the report,\" she insisted.\nHowever, Mr Hunt argued the review was \"integral to ongoing policy development\" and would be released later this year along with a government strategy on childhood obesity.\nUnsatisfied with that response, Dr Wollaston then wrote to Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, expressing \"deep concern\" and asking him to think about his own duties to the public.\nPlay video \"March 2015: Say No To Sugar\" Video: March 2015: Say No To Sugar \"Clearly it would have been best for all concerned if the evidence could have been made available with his support especially as this would have been in line with his expressed views on the importance of timely transparency of data and evidence,\" she wrote.\n\"It is my view, however, that the Secretary of State's disinclination either to publish the evidence, or to make it available to the committee, should not prevent Public Health England from responding positively to our request, which I make through this letter, for you to do so.\n\"I do not believe that the petitioners, or the wider public, will understand how the committee can complete its consideration of this issue if the review of the evidence, paid for with public money and for the benefit of the nation's children, is not made available.\"\nShe added: \"Delayed publication is as harmful as non-publication if this means that the public and health professionals wishing to influence the content of the obesity strategy do not have access to the data before the ink is dry on the obesity strategy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:35:31.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
