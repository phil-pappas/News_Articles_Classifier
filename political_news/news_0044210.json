More N Ireland paramilitaries ‘committed to peace’ \nLabour lost the non-binding vote after the debate on Tuesday but Jeremy Corbyn, party leader, told the Financial Times that he was “very hopeful” that the Lords would block the tax credit cuts. \nThat hope was a reference to talks led by Baroness Meacher, a crossbench peer, over a House of Lords “ fatal motion ” that would have killed off the legislation had it passed at a debate on tax credits on Monday. \nLate on Tuesday, however, Baroness Meacher dropped plans for the “kill” motion after coming under pressure to avoid what critics said would be a constitutional crisis — by convention, opposition parties in the unelected Lords do not oppose governments’ manifesto commitments. \nShe is expected instead to propose that the upper chamber delay a decision on the legislation until after MPs have had another chance to debate it. \nThat opportunity will come next week in a further, cross-party debate, following a proposal by Labour MP Frank Field and Conservative backbencher David Davis. \nIn a joint statement, Mr Field and Mr Davis said all the MPs that requested the debate wanted to help the government meet its fiscal targets “while supporting some of our most vulnerable constituents”. \nMr Osborne’s proposed cuts, estimated to save £4.6bn next year, have caused disquiet among Conservative MPs, with some observers comparing them to tax debacles such as Gordon Brown’s abolition of the 10p income tax rate and Margaret Thatcher’s “poll tax”. \nTuesday’s debate in the Commons encouraged some Conservatives to raise their concerns. Sir Edward Leigh, a veteran backbencher, called for “tweaks” to the cuts in the name of “compassion”. \nBut Ms Allen’s speech provided greater drama. It is rare for an MP to use a maiden speech to criticise the government and rarer still for one to take on a powerful chancellor. And yet she said the cuts were “too hard and too fast”. \nThe newly elected MP for South Cambridgeshire said: “I worry that our single-minded determination to reach a budget surplus undermines who we are.” \nBaroness Warsi, former Conservative cabinet minister, tweeted her support for Ms Allen on Tuesday, adding: “Family credits provided my parents the necessary buffer to allow us to study and work our way out of poverty.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:58:05.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
