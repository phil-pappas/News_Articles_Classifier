As the title suggests, the same panel had been hosted the year before and was brought back due to immense popularity because — surprise — men and women care about what women have to say in the comic and fandom industry.\nAlicia Grauso , founder and editor-in-chief of Moviepilot.com , a popular website dedicated to constructive writing about movies, was the panel moderator. She began by asking the panelists how they became involved in a career in geek media. The answers varied, but the ideal recipe seems to be a little geekiness, some fan fiction stories, a handful of Twitter, and tons of hard work.\nSam Maggs , author of The Fangirl’s Guide to the Galaxy and a writer for themarysue.com , credited her entire career to Twitter and hard work.\n“I was just unapologetic and shameless about promoting myself on twitter. I'm a very big proponent of social media and putting your work online and putting yourself out there and connecting with people,” Maggs said. “Twitter is how I got every single job in this industry.”\nMagg’s literary agent for The Fangirl’s Guide to the Galaxy found her through her Twitter account.\nJamie Broadnax , founder and creator of Blackgirlnerds.com , said that her career really began on Yahoo Answers.\n“I noticed when I was on the web that there wasn't really any spaces for geeks of color. One day I went on google, it was 2 a.m. in the morning and I typed in the term ‘black girl nerds’ on Twitter and nothing came up on Google. Black nerds came up, black girls came up, but the term didn't. When I was going through the searches and just kept clicking on and clicking on to the find the relevant searches and on the yahoo answers site — you know someone randomly asks questions and then random people answer — someone asked the question: Do black girl nerds exist?”\nThat very night Broadnax created a blogger account and gave it the name Black Girl Nerds.\npic.twitter.com/h6oE0Odidn\n— BlackGirlNerds (@BlackGirlNerds) October 7, 2015 For Catrina Dennis , senior editor at Moviepilot.com, writing was always a family affair and her interest really began with fan fiction — coauthored by her father.\n“I come from three generations worth of writers. My abuelo came over here and was a published poet, published about three books of poetry. Dad used to write. And when I came to about twelve I started writing fan fiction with my father. And we kind of like took off from there and fell into writing. I went into journalism in school, but it didn't really take off until I started coming to cons. I credit conventions with my entire career.”\nDennis was recruited by Moviepilot.com by attending comic conventions and writing and interviewing on her own.\nJody Houser ’s comic and anthology writing career really began with her failure to turn into a superwoman.\n“I was a superhero fan before I could even read. I remember being four years old and watching re-runs of Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman on TV and spinning around trying to turn into Wonder Woman until I almost threw up — and not actually turning into Wonder Woman unfortunately. I knew I wanted to write from a very young age. I started writing fan-fic when I was seven and decided I wanted to write professionally when I was eight. Those two just actually didn't come together until well into adulthood for me.”\nEven though she still has not been able to turn into Wonder Woman, she was able to land the job for writing the Orphan Black comic for IDW.\nDeb Akoi , who writes for Publishers Weekly and is the editor of Mangacomicsmanga.com , said that her success came from having a particular beat.\n“I never went into this thinking I was going to be a comics journalist. I went into this because I love manga. It kind of came out by accident. I've been reading manga all my life. I have a little bit of a journalism background, so I was able to draw upon that,” Akoi said. “The manga people are coming to me asking do you have time to interview this person? Because you're the only one who even covers this shit. I mean I'm exaggerating, there's a ton of manga bloggers, but I've got this sandbox pretty much to myself sometimes.”\nAkoi, who entered the panel late because she was interviewing a Japanese manga editor, likes to refer to herself as \"the Manga Chick.\"\nThe interests and methods differed among the panelists, but they all agreed that nothing could be accomplished without a little bit of sweat, even if just on your keyboard. Maggs said that though part of it is luck, working hard certainly helps.\n“I always like to say the harder you work the luckier you get. I think that's a good way to live. I think there's definitely a certain amount of luck in it, but I think you have to kind of just keep putting yourself out there.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ohcatrina", "https://twitter.com/SamMaggs", "http://t.co/h6oE0Odidn", "https://twitter.com/debaoki", "http://moviepilot.com/Alisha", "https://twitter.com/BlackGirlNerds/status/651826193445068801", "http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/comics/article/68061-tokyopop-returns-with-new-manga-self-publishing-app.html", "https://twitter.com/JamieBroadnax", "https://twitter.com/Jody_Houser", "http://moviepilot.com/ohcatrina"], "published": "2015-10-12T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:29:25.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
