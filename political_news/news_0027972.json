Yes LIVE: House Select Committee - Clinton/Benghazi hearing WASHINGTON (CNN) - \nDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton is in the witness chair for her long-awaited appearance before a congressional panel investigating the Benghazi attacks, setting up a confrontation with Republicans that could be one of the pivotal moments of her campaign.

The committee chairman, Rep Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, called the hearing to order at the start of what could be eight grueling hours of testimony. \nClinton, with a broad smile on her face, arrived in the hearing room in the Longworth Office building and greeted members of the committee before taking her seat in front of a gaggle of news photographers. She was sworn in privately before entering the chamber. \nThe hearing is the latest twist in a long-running political saga ignited by the attacks, with the GOP claiming Clinton has been negligent after security lapses that happened on her watch as secretary of state and led to the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. \nClinton's team has charged that the committee represents a naked political attempt by Republicans to derail her presidential ambitions and point to seven previous congressional investigations as they argue the current inquiry will turn up no new evidence. \n\"She will be prepared. It's questions she has all answered before, I presume, because she has testified on Benghazi before,\" Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said Wednesday on \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.\" \nBut she added that the former secretary of state took the hearing -- which is also expected to cover the private email account she used while at the State Department -- very seriously. \nAn aide said that Clinton would make the point that advancing American interests in a dangerous area of the globe would never be totally safe but that it would be against U.S. interests to always seek to use the military as a first option in a foreign trouble spot rather than deploying front-line diplomats like Stevens, who died as he sought to build a democratic future in Libya. \nAccording to excerpts of her testimony seen by CNN, it did not appear that the former secretary of state would directly attack the committee as a political exercise -- a charge that her campaign aides have made repeatedly in recent weeks. \nRepublicans clearly feel the hearing is an extremely grave event. \nRepublican Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who sits on the select committee, said on CNN on Wednesday that the Benghazi controversy was more serious than the conspiracy that felled President Richard Nixon. \n\"In many dimensions this is worse than Watergate,\" Pompeo said. \"Remember, we had four Americans killed here. Remember, too, we had a secretary of state who had a private server and then erased 30,000 of those emails without any third party having a chance to look at them.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
