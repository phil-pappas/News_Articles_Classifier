If legalized, it could jump to seven times that amount. \nIf Trudeau keeps his word, Canada would become the largest country in the world to fully support and regulate its recreational use. And that could have a ripple effect on the rest of the world. \nThe war on drugs has been a global effort since the 1960s when several countries, including the U.S. and Canada, agreed to combat drugs on a global scale. \nBut if Canada eschews the treaty by legalizing marijuana, it could prompt other countries — including the United States — to do the same. \nVox wrote that a move for legalization would \"send a big signal to other countries — that, at least when it comes to marijuana, these treaties no longer hold the weight they once held.\" \nWhile the Liberal Party certainly seems into the idea, they admittedly don't have solid plans on exactly how they'll implement any marijuana reforms. \nWhile campaigning, Trudeau said, \"We don't yet know exactly what rate we're going to be taxing it, how we're going to control it, or whether it will happen in the first months, within the first year, or whether it's going to take a year or two to kick in.\" (Video via Global News ) \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:10:42.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
