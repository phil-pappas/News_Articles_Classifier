These weapons are disproportionately used in crime, and particularly in criminal mass shootings,\" according to the ruling written by Circuit Judge Jose A. Cabranes. \"They are also disproportionately used to kill law enforcement officers.\" \nThe three-judge panel noted that the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting in December 2012 occurred when 154 rounds were fired in less than five minutes, killing 20 first-graders and six educators and renewing a nationwide discussion on the role of guns in America and how to diminish the threat of large-scale shootings. \nBut the court found Connecticut's ban on a non-semi-automatic Remington 7615 unconstitutional. And it said a seven-round load limit in New York could not be imposed even as it upheld other bans on magazines. \n\"Like assault weapons, large-capacity magazines result in 'more shots fired, persons wounded, and wounds per victim than do other gun attacks,'\" the court said. \nTom King, president of the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association and a lead plaintiff, said his group - the New York affiliate of the National Rifle Association - will appeal to the Supreme Court, which could take up the case with recent rulings on state gun control laws. \n\"It wasn't a surprise. We expected it,\" he said. \nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen praised the ruling. \n\"At a time when many Americans have abandoned hope of government's ability to address gun violence in our schools and on our streets, Connecticut's laws - and today's decision - demonstrate that willing states can enact meaningful reform to improve public safety without violating the Second Amendment,\" Jepsen said in a statement. \nThe plaintiffs were groups supporting gun rights, pistol permit holders and gun sellers. \nThe appeals court addressed several gun rights groups' arguments, including that mass shootings are rare events that would be minimally affected by gun control laws. \n\"That may be so,\" the 2nd Circuit said. \"But gun-control legislation 'need not strike at all evils at the same time' to be constitutional.\" \nThe appeals court said gun rights groups' claims that the ban on assault weapons will primarily disarm law-abiding citizens was \"speculative at best, and certainly not strong enough to overcome the substantial deference we owe to predictive judgments of the legislature on matters of public safety.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Michael Virtanen in Albany contributed to this story.
