The bottom line is that the first map showed the area as if it was a Palestinian state,\" he said. \"It looked as if it was all full of Arabs.

There was no Palestinian — there was no state called 'Palestine,\" he continued. \"In 1946, it was a British mandate land.\"\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ \"Britain was given control of the area by the League of Nations.

Drucker • 10/20/15 12:01 AM Snow and Fletcher conceded over the weekend that the maps in question painted an inaccurate picture of the mounting tensions between Israel and Palestine.\nWhen MSNBC first aired the misleading graphic last Thursday, Snow and Fletcher said supposedly shrinking land claims explain the recent wave of Palestinian violence that has washed over Israel.\n\"This is what it's all about,\" Fletcher said of the graphic. \"It's all about the land.\"\n\"The Israelis say, look, 'You know this is our homeland, too. And we're Jews. We have the right to live anywhere, same with anywhere else in the world. We should be allowed to live anywhere we like,'\" he added. \"And that's hard to argue about, except it's taking the land of a future Palestinian state, which, that's what the frustration and the violence is all about. For the most part, the occupation of their land.\"\nHowever, aside from the maps being factually inaccurate, this explanation ignores that much of the Arab-on-Jew violence appears to come at the behest of Palestinian government and religious officials.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner States ready to sue as Obama climate plan nears final stage Critics of the EPA plan say the administration is stalling publishing the rule in the Federal Register.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/20/15 12:01 AM \"Al Aqsa Mosque is ours.
