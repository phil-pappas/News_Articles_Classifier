The tapes come after a nearly three-year-long investigation organized by the group's founder, David Daleiden. CMP has also released more than 10 hours of uncut footage, as well as audio transcripts and several lengthy mini-documentaries.\nPlanned Parenthood maintains that the tapes have been doctored so as to give the impression that it is engaged in unethical and likely illegal behavior.\n  Poll: 85 percent of voters think the U.S. is on wrong track Additionally,     fragile.\"\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/25/15 5:46 PM Some reporters have responded to the scandal by giving Planned Parenthood a platform to accuse CMP of spreading falsehoods. Others have reported themselves that the videos are intentionally misleading.\nNone have said whether they've watched all of the videos.\nThe Washington Post , the Associated Press and the New York Times , for example, have given Planned Parenthood multiple opportunities to denounce the videos as anti-abortion propaganda.\nOthers in the press have gone a step further.\nMother Jones' Molly Redden reported that, \"a little-known anti-abortion activist named David Daleiden ignited a firestorm by releasing two selectively edited videos.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Christie breaks Amtrak's quiet car rule Christie was apparently talking loudly on his cell phone, and causing a commotion.\nBy Curt Mills • 10/25/15 3:04 PM The L.A. Times' Michael Hiltzik wrote that the, \"tapes have been conclusively discredited as heavily edited misrepresentations.\"\nMic's Gregory Kreig said CMP had released, \"secretly recorded and selectively edited videos.\" And for Salon's Sohpia Tesfaye , the videos are \"heavily\" and \"deceptively\" edited.\nThere are other examples .\nThough these reporters repeat the claim that the tapes have been deceptively edited, none of the 15 contacted this week by the Washington Examiner's media desk would say if they've actually watched all of the footage, and only one responded directly to inquiries.\nThe Huffington Post's Samantha Lachman, who specifically referred to the tapes as \" selectively edited ,\" would not say whether she had watched them. She instead directed the Examiner's attention to a Planned Parenthood-commissioned study claiming the videos have been doctored.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton's campaign chair takes jabs at two of her male opponents Podesta claimed that Sanders was going on the attack, and that a Clinton/Trump election favors Clinton.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/25/15 4:56 PM That study, which was done by the research firm Fusion GPS, also said that CMP's audio transcripts were incomplete.\nFusion GPS' study did not address questions surrounding one CMP video showing Planned Parenthood's Deborah Nucatola, who has served as the organization's senior director of medical services since 2009, discussing \"doing a little better than\" breaking even for donated organs. The commissioned study, which focused on only four of the ten CMP videos, also failed to address footage showing Planned Parenthood affiliates seemingly discussing performing partial birth abortions so as to keep specific organs intact.\nIt is illegal to profit from the donation of fetal tissue. It is also illegal under federal law to perform partial birth abortions.\nThe Examiner asked Lachman a second time whether she had watched all of the tapes.\nShe did not respond.\nTwo Washington Post reporters declined to comment, and instead referred the Examiner to the newspaper's spokeswoman.\nThe spokeswoman, Kris Coratti, defended reporters Sandhya Somashekhar and Abby Ohlheiser and their coverage of the scandal by telling the Examiner, \"The fact is, in their extensive coverage of this issue, they made repeated reference to both the edited and longer footage posted by the Center for Medical Progress. In addition, they reported on exchanges captured in the longer videos that did not make the shorter cut.\"\nThe CMP videos have sparked multiple investigations by Congress, and several states have moved to defund the \"women's health organization.\" Planned Parenthood's go-to defense in all that time has been to claim that the CMP videos have been grossly doctored.\n\"We know that the videos Mr. Daleiden has released were deceptively edited to smear Planned Parenthood. They omit exculpatory passages and splice excerpts together to create false impressions,\" the group's president, Cecile Richards, said in an August letter addressed to Congress.\n\"Our analysis of the videos released by Mr. Daledien documents numerous instances where the videos have been heavily edited to change the meaning of what Planned Parenthood staff said and deceive the public,\" she added, referring to Fusion GPS' commissioned study.\nThere does not appear to be anything in the hours and hours of uncut footage released by CMP that changes the context and spirit of Nucatola's remarks, or the remarks of affiliates who seemingly discussed performing partial birth abortions.\nTop Story Carson hits back at Trump's jab about 'low energy,' being asleep Carson responded   energy.\"\nBy Curt Mills • 10/25/15 10:23 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:03:02.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
