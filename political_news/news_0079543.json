Swing from Labour to SNP 12.9%.\nAt East (Irvine Valley), first-count voting was: SNP 1,797, C 865, Lab 860, Green 88. Swing from Labour to SNP 5.8%.\nIn a third contest, the SNP held a seat at Stirling (Stirling East), where the final vote tallies - after transfers - were: SNP 1,388, Lab 1,272, C 352, Green 152.\nFurther council by-election results are due later from Aberdeen (two seats), Moray and West Lothian.\nSwings of between 13% and 25% from Labour to the SNP were recorded in Scottish council by-elections in June and July after Labour was reduced to just one MP north of the border in May.\nBut local contests last month saw reduced swings of 6% and 8%, while Labour had a success in taking a council seat from the Greens in Edinburgh.\nShare article The latest by-elections include four that were prompted by the resignation as councillors of SNP MPs newly elected at the general election: at East Ayrshire, where former councillor Alan Brown is now MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun; Fife - Peter Grant (Glenrothes); Stirling - Steven Paterson (Stirling); and West Lothian - Martyn Day (Linlithgow and Falkirk East).\nThe first-round voting figures in the Stirling council by-election released later were: SNP 1,311, Lab 1,094, C 343, Green 152. Swing from Labour to SNP was 9.4%.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-02T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:57:37.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
