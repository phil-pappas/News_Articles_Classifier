Alexander Kwamina Afenyo Markin over his alleged involvement in the financial extortions of the Agriculture Development Bank [ADB] Initial Public Offer [IPO] brouhaha. \nThe Group have petitioned the Director General of the Criminal Investigations Department [CID] and copied the office of the Inspector General of Police including the Minister of Finance and others to deepen their investigations into Markin’s saga. \nAt a press briefing, Alfred Kojo Triddles, the Spokesperson for the Group express worry at the state in which the public offer of shares of ADB has been put on hold on three consecutive times, saying it can weaken the confidence of potential investors. \nAccording to the Spokesperson, the sole ranger position taken by Hon. Markin and the Minority in Parliament against the ADB stood firmly on their grounds that the IPO was unconstitutional. \nThe Minority initially had tried to get the ABD IPO to come to Parliament for approval but the Attorney General and the Chief Director of the Finance Ministry granted permission for the public listing of ADB shares stating that it did not require any parliamentary approval. \nConsequently, the Afenyo Markin decided to rethink its position on the matter and quickly ran to court to frustrate any attempt to list the public sale of ADB shares. \nShockingly, news reports and audio tapes went viral alleged that Hon. Afenyo Markin took money in the region of GHc250,000 before dropping the case against the bank. \nAccording to Alfred Kojo Triddles, they had information that Hon. Markin initially demanded something higher than that but was paid GHc250,000 through one Mr. Bonsu, an errand boy for Hon. Freddie Blay, the 1 st Vice Chairman of the NPP and Fomer 1 st Deputy Speaker of Parliament. \nHe alleged that Afenyo Markin had asked a top management staff member of ADB that he needed that huge sum to influence his colleagues Minority Members in Parliament who are members of the Finance Committee of the legislature. \nThe Spokesperson noted that Hon. Markin told an ADB top management staff member that Hon. Akoto Osei will take the first big bite of the lump sum of Ghc100,000 while he will share the remainder among himself, Hon. Osei Asibey Yeboah including the Minority Leader in Parliament. \n“If the allegations were true, it would tantamount to undermining the work of the August House of Parliament,” he stated. \nHe concluded that Hon. Markin sole motive for taking the ADB to court was not the so called desire to ensure propriety and accountability but had something more to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:04:50.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
