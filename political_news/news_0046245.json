The interview airs Sunday.\nCBS posted a clip of the interview and it’s stunning, not only what he says, but his facial expressions. He appears to be completely delusional.\nSteve Kroft: A year ago when we did this interview, there was some saber-rattling between the United States and Russia on the Ukrainian border. Now it’s also going on in Syria. You said a year ago that the United States– America leads. We’re the indispensable nation. Mr. Putin seems to be challenging that leadership. President Barack Obama: In what way? Let– let’s think about this– let– let– Excuse the interruption, but “IN WHAT WAY?”\nSteve Kroft: Well, he’s moved troops into Syria, for one. He’s got people on the ground. Two, the Russians are conducting military operations in the Middle East for the first time since World War II. President Barack Obama: So that’s– so that’s — Steve Kroft : bombing the people– that we are supporting. President Barack Obama : So that’s leading, Steve? Let me ask you this question. When I came into office– Ukraine was governed by a corrupt ruler who was a stooge of Mr. Putin. Steve Kroft : Right, right, right. President Barack Obama : Syria was Russia’s only ally in the region. And today, rather than being able to count on their support and maintain the base they had in Syria, which they’ve had for a long time. Mr. Putin now is devoting- his own troops, his own military, just to barely hold together by a thread his sole ally. And in Ukraine– Steve Kroft : He’s challenging your leadership, Mr. President. He’s challenging your leadership- President Barack Obama : Well– Steve, I got to tell you, if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in, in order to prop up your only ally is leadership, then we’ve got a different definition of leadership. What is he talking about? Russia has Iraq, Iran, Hizbollah and Syria as allies as well as China and there is an imminent danger of him taking leadership over the entire Middle East. Putin is poised to take over Ukraine.\nThe video clip can be seen on this link.", "external_links": ["http://www.independentsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Obama-delusional11.jpg", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-on-putins-military-mission-in-syria/"], "published": "2015-10-11T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:38:44.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
