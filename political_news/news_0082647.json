It was launched following the unprecedented election of 56 SNP MPs in May but Ms Thomson's suspension has reduced their ranks to 55 MPs.\nLast week, the Law Society said its director of financial compliance Ian Messer \"informally\" raised concerns about the Hales case during two separate meetings with prosecutors in December 2014 and April 2015.\nHowever, the Law Society did not \"formally\" submit its evidence to the Crown until July 2015, two months after Ms Thomson was elected SNP MP for Edinburgh West. It then took prosecutors just six days to launch a criminal investigation.\nLaw Society chief executive Lorna Jack gave an \"absolute and categorical assurance\" last week that the election played no part in the delay.\nShe said Mr Messer would have seen Ms Thomson's name in the unredacted Hales report but may not have been aware she was a Westminster candidate.\nPromoted stories The secretary to the Law Society committee that struck Mr Hales off, Sheila Kirkwood, is a personal acquaintance of Ms Thomson with close links to the SNP.\nMs Jack has pledged to look more deeply into Ms Kirkwood's links with Ms Thomson, but said she has received an assurance the secretary was unaware of the MP's links to Hales until she read about it in media reports.\nMs Thomson is linked to 13 transactions Hales conducted in 2010-11 where properties were bought cheaply from clients looking for a quick sale and sold at a huge mark-up the same day and where complicated \"cashback\" deals were used to artificially inflate property prices to secure bigger loans from lenders.\nMs Baillie said: \"Big questions remain unanswered about the role of the Crown Office in all of this.\n\"If the Presiding Officer does not select the question that would bring the Lord Advocate to Parliament, as she is entitled to do, he should volunteer to make a statement.\n\"The Scottish public deserve some transparency, something which has been lacking in recent days.\"\nShare article Commenting on the withdrawal of \"The 56\" merchandise, a Scottish Conservative spokesman said: \"It would appear the SNP's merchandise department has rather less confidence in Michelle Thomson than Nicola Sturgeon does.\"\nIn reference to the 55% of voters in the independence referendum who opted to stay in the UK, he added: \"Perhaps now we will see the unusual situation of the nationalists backing 'the 55' for once.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-05T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:54:24.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
