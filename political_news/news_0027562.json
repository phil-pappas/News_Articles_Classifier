Gov. Tate Reeves, one of the most powerful men in the state. Reeves has more than $3 million in campaign cash and could drown out Johnson's message if he needed to. Johnson has an easygoing demeanor, a full tank of gas in his pickup and a platform he says would sell if he could get the message out. But Johnson doesn't have the cash he needs to put up a statewide TV-ad blitz -- a little more than $54,000 in the last filing available on the Secretary of State's Office website. So he's doing it the old-fashioned way, driving around the state meeting with anyone willing to shake hands with a former Republican who's now backing Medicaid expansion and Initiative 42, the ballot measure that deals with education funding. \"It's about taking my experience as a state senator, a county supervisor and an alderman and applying it to the lieutenant governor's job,\" he said. \"I don't really know Tate, but I know his policies.\" Sunherald Posted October 5, 2015 - 5:00 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
