The Convening group of this bicultural branch, and many of its 120+ members wish to express their view on the proposed vist to NZ by Chris Brown. \n\"We do not support the suggestion that exceptions to the law should be made to allow Chris Brown to enter NZ. The basis for this opinion is the information that he has a history of violent assaults against women and men. The lyrics of many of his songs are also demeaning of women and glorify a destructive lifestyle with sad consequences that social workers see on a daily basis. We do not believe Chris Brown is an appropriate role model for young people in an environment where we already lead the world in violence against women and children. We are aware that such exceptions have been made for other entertainers in the past, and that issues of racism have been raised in regard to decison making about such issues. However we do believe it is time now to make a stand against all who use violence against others, regardless of race. The Minister of Justice is currently undertaking a welcome piece of work to make legislation against domestic violence in this country more stringent, and we believe that other Government departments, such as Immigration in this case, and political leaders, should be supporting her initiative.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:38:43.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
