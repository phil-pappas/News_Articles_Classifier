Which is what is happening to the United States. In every ﬁve-year period from 1945 to 2004, Americans had driven more miles than they did the half-decade before. In 2004, the average American drove 85 percent more than in 1970. But by 2011, the average American was driving 6 percent fewer miles than in 2004. Baby Boomers and Gen Xers were a small part of the reasonthey drove somewhat less in 2009 than in 2001but the big cause was the Millennials. What makes this even more dramatic is that, by 2009, only half the Millennial generation was even out of high school. If all eighty million Millennials retain their current driving habits for the next twenty-ﬁve years, the US population will increase by 21 percent, but total VMT will be even less than it is today, and per capita VMTthe vehicle miles traveled per personwill fall off the table.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:18:04.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
