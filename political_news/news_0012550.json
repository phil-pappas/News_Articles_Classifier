Reuters obtained a copy of the letter.\nTop Navy officials ordered the review of the RMS system and its core part, Lockheed's Remote Multi-Mission Vehicle, after it showed unacceptable reliability results in a technical evaluation, said Navy spokeswoman Captain Thurraya Kent.\n\"While the RMS has demonstrated the ability to meet operational requirements, reliability performance has not been acceptable during the most recent technical evaluation,\" she said. The independent review will look at possible alternatives.\nMcCain, a Republican, and Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee, wrote a three-page letter to Kendall and top Navy officials in August, saying \"too much is at stake to accept the status quo and permit systems with long documented cost, schedule, performance, and reliability shortfalls to get a free pass into the fleet and production.\n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by David Gregorio )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:44:59.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
