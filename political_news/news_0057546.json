The population of Canada: 34,834,841. \n“Between 2007 and 2011, new eligibility rules by themselves added 3.4 million people to SNAP enrollment and naturally tended to increase SNAP spending. At the same time, SNAP began to pay more generous benefits to people who enrolled,” Casey Mulligan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, told the Washington Free Beacon on Thursday. \nThe growing SNAP population is a far cry from the 2.8 million enrolled when the USDA began tracking such programs in 1969, the website reported. \nThe average SNAP-approved household received $256.62 in July 2015. USDA estimated a total cost to U.S. taxpayers of $5.8 billion for the month. \nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

It reached a high of 47,790,000 in December 2012. Text smaller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:09:52.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
