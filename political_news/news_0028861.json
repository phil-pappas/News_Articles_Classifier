Kevin McCarthy pulls name out of consideration for speaker of House POSTED: 10:10 AM CDT Oct 09, 2015 Tweet WASHINGTON - \nA Democratic congressman had some fun at the expense of House Republicans and their search to find a replacement for departing Speaker of the House John Boehner. Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., and his staffers posted a phony Craigslist job advertisement on their social media accounts for the speaker of the House position Boehner plans to vacate at the end of October.

Then this job is for you!\" the listing reads. \nThe mock ad came Thursday after Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the favorite to replace outgoing Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), abruptly withdrew his name from consideration. Takano's staff took a screenshot of the advertisement but didn't actually post it to Craigslist. \nDavid Axelrod, the former White House senior adviser to President Barack Obama, also joked on Twitter that Republicans take out a Craigslist ad.
