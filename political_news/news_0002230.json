The new payout policy takes effect Friday.\nHe said the agency has not contemplated suspending any of its betting games while the budget fight continues. The state is in its fourth month without a spending plan.\n(Editing by David Gregorio )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:02:18.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
