Momentum in hiring slowed in September and third-quarter gross domestic product growth is likely to decelerate to less than half the 3.9 per cent pace in the second quarter. Core inflation remains well below target. \nAlthough a pickup in wages is not a precondition for the Fed to move, officials are closely watching recent soggy numbers because they are indicative of the slack still in the labour market. With traders viewing the probability of a rise in December as well below 50 per cent, the data and Fed rhetoric will have to swing in a more positive direction to build expectations towards a rise on December 16. \nPolicymakers appeared sharply divided going into this week’s meeting. Two Fed governors — Lael Brainard and Daniel Tarullo — took the unusual step of publicly distancing themselves from Ms Yellen’s recent analysis, signalling they are uncomfortable with the idea of raising rates this year.
