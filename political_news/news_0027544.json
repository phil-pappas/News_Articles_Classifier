The move may increase the likelihood that the bank, dormant since July, will be reopened. But the effort will still face significant hurdles in the Senate -- where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) opposes the agency and would not put a standalone bill on the floor, which would take at least a week to process due to the chamber's procedural rules. The only way McConnell would allow an Ex-Im renewal is if it were attached to a must-pass bill, such as an upcoming highway measure with an end-of-month deadline.\n\"The Senate is not going to spend a week on a bill that the leader doesn't support,\" said Don Stewart, a McConnell spokesman.\nThe House move came as House Republicans began an emergency meeting to discuss their leadership elections after Rep. Kevin McCarthy dropped his bid for speaker. It adds to the drama of the day, and represents a revolt against conservatives in the House, who staunchly oppose reviving the government bank.\nThe Republicans included Reps. Renee Ellmers (N.C.), Mike Simpson (Idaho), Lou Barletta and Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania, Dave Reichert ( wash.), Frank Lucas (Oklahoma), Steve Stivers of Ohio and more. The crowd of Republicans lined up on the side of the floor.\nMany members of the House Freedom Caucus have pushed Speaker John Boehner to kill the bank.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:40:27.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
