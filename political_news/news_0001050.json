In another security measure, it banned vehicles with tinted windows and improper paperwork from the roads.\nSecurity has been beefed up on main roads since the coup and an attack last week in the town of Samorogouan, western Burkina Faso, in which three gendarmes and a civilian were killed.\nResidents of a nearby village found explosives that belonged to the attackers, said the government, which had earlier blamed leaders of the failed coup for the attack.\nSource: Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:16:48.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
