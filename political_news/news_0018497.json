(AP) - Wildfires burning on prairie land in five states from Wyoming to Iowa have killed pets and livestock and destroyed more than a dozen homes.\nWorst so far is a fire near Casper, Wyoming, that has burned almost 15 square miles of dried-out grassland.\nThe fire began at a landfill Saturday and spread rapidly Sunday and again Monday. A couple hundred people remained evacuated from their homes Tuesday.\nThe local Red Cross is asking people to donate shovels and rakes to help victims search the remains of their homes for any valuables. Other large and destructive prairie fires have been burning in the Dakotas, Montana and Iowa.\nNational Weather Service wildfire specialist Kelly Allen says ample rainfall last spring and summer helped to grow grass that is now fueling the wildfires.\n___\nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)
