A coalition of authors is concerned that Google Books will reduce their income and hopes the Supreme Court will overturn a Friday decision in the tech company's favor.\nBy Steven Nelson Oct. 16, 2015 | 2:37 p.m. EDT + More A federal appeals court ruled Friday that Google Books can continue to make public small digitized portions of copyright-protected books.\nThe ruling by judges on the New York-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit upheld a lower court decision, finding the practice is acceptable “fair use” and does not infringe on copyright holders’ rights.\nThe legal challenge led by the Authors Guild is almost as old as Google’s book-scanning project. The guild filed the lawsuit in 2005, shortly after the tech giant announced an ambitious digitization partnership with major libraries, claiming writers would lose money.\nJudges found that although copyright holders may indeed lose revenue from Google displaying some of their work with its “snippet view,” that was insufficient to rule against the company’s practices. Snippets show small sections containing search keywords in a copyrighted work.\n[ READ: Can Google Make Smart Visors Cool? ]\n“We recognize that the snippet function can cause some loss of sales,” the three-judge panel wrote. “But the possibility, or even the probability or certainty, of some loss of sales does not suffice to make the copy an effectively competing substitute.”\nThe ruling says “the type of loss of sale envisioned … will generally occur in relation to interests that are not protected by the copyright,” such as searches to confirm historical facts -- and copyright law “protects only the author’s manner of expression,” they wrote.\nThe judges based their decision in large part on the constraints Google places on snippet viewing, which they found as currently structured does not offer digitized works as effective substitutes for print editions that individuals or libraries would need to purchase.\nGoogle permanently blocks 22 percent of copyright-protected books’ content from public view, the ruling describes, and the conceivably accessible 78 percent is then sliced in such a way that users cannot acquire large sequential portions. Researchers employed by opponents could find only that 16 percent of text by searching for various keywords, the judges note.\n[ ALSO: Google Tops Reputation Rankings for Corporate Responsibility ]\n“Google’s division of the page into tiny snippets is designed to show the searcher just enough context surrounding the searched term to help her evaluate whether the book falls within the scope of her interest,” the judges wrote. “Snippet view thus adds importantly to the highly transformative purpose of identifying books of interest to the searcher.”\nThe judges brushed off concern that Google’s digital storage of books put the content within reach of hackers who would pirate the content.\n\"The long-term effects could be significant,\" said​ attorney J. Michael Keyes, an intellectual property expert, adding that the ruling \"could open the door for other similar types of digitization projects involving copyrighted works so that those works could be catalogued and searched.”\nThe Authors Guild said in a statement it hopes to bring the case before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n[ RELATED: Ben Carson: Others Can't Sell Shirts, Stickers Supporting My Candidacy ]\n“We trust that the Supreme Court will see fit to correct the Second Circuit’s reduction of fair use to a one-factor test – whether the use is, in the court’s eye, ‘transformative,’” the organization’s executive director, Mary Rasenberger, said.\n“Most full-time authors live on the edge of being able to keep writing as a profession,” Rasenberger said, “[and] a loss of licensing revenue can tip the balance, particularly in this era when advances and royalties for most authors are down.”\nGoogle presently removes copyright-protected books from snippet view on request, and the judges point out in a footnote that “some Plaintiffs appear to have had books removed from snippet view.” The company does not run ads on Google Books and it can legally post full copies of books published before 1923 that are in the public domain.\nTAGS: Google books", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9hjv%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Judges%3A%20Google%20Books%20Can%20Continue%20to%20Tease%20Student%20With%20Snippets&summary=It%27s%20fair%20use%20for%20the%20tech%20giant%20to%20display%20copyrighted%20content%2C%20appeals%20court%20finds.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9hjv%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Judges%3A%20Google%20Books%20Can%20Continue%20to%20Tease%20Student%20With%20Snippets", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9hjv%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9hjv%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Judges%3A%20Google%20Books%20Can%20Continue%20to%20Tease%20Student%20With%20Snippets", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9hjv%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/3dd6bcce-19f0-4df6-8f34-ac335cb4a1da/1/doc/13-4829_opn.pdf#xml=http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/3dd6bcce-19f0-4df6-8f34-ac335cb4a1da/1/hilite/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9hjv%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:44:38.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
