In his speech, Lincoln, who went on to become the nation’s 16 th president, said the legislation, which kept the door open to slavery in the territories, was “immoral.” Under the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the citizens of each territory could vote on whether to permit slavery within its borders. The act was widely seen as setting a precedent for determining the legality of slavery in other territories.\nAlthough Lincoln, an Illinois lawyer, found slavery to be morally abhorrent, he was not an abolitionist. However, he opposed the spread of slavery beyond where it then existed; he feared that to go further than that would precipitate a civil war. Lincoln hoped his approach would preserve the Union and slowly eliminate slavery by confining it to the South, where, he believed, “it would surely die a slow death.”\nAs Lincoln’s political career gained momentum, he would refer to the seeming inevitability of Kansas becoming a slave state as “a violence … it was conceived in violence, passed in violence, is maintained in violence, and is being executed in violence.” He was dismayed when Kansas voted in November to send a pro-slavery candidate to Congress.\nIn 1859, Lincoln ran for the Senate as a Whig. The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, “I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery.”\nAlthough he lost to the Democratic incumbent, Stephen Douglas, his campaign, which featured seven debates with Douglas, raised his political profile and brought him increasing support from Northern abolitionists. It was this constituency that helped him win the presidency in a four-way race in 1860.\nSOURCE: WWW.HISTORY.COM.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:19:39.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
