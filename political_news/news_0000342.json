Jakichand Singh scored the only goal of the match in the opening minutes of the match. The goal came in the second minute itself when Singh found the far corner with left footed finish deceiving a defender and giving the goalkeeper no chance. The floated cross from Ravanan Dharmraj caught the unsettled visitors unawares. Arata Izumi somewhat of a local boy here after playing for Pune FC earlier, made swift runs from the left for the visitors. He set up a good chance for striker Iain Hume but the Canadian lobbed straight to goalkeeper Steven Simonsen. sports football ISl 2 FC Pune City Atletico de Kolkata Also Read Fans, opponent player beat Argentine footballer to death Rahul and Pujara star for India 'A' on Day 1 Leander Paes prevails over Mahesh Bhupathi Pistorius: Runner to gunner", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BALL_0_0_0.png", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/BALL_0_0_0.png", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/sports-football/article/isl-2-pune-back-top-atk-win", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-18T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:38:58.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
