Also, a large number of land parcels throughout the Auckland region have been investigated for sale. \nAt a time when Auckland’s housing is become denser and gardens and backyard space is reducing or being removed, it is more important than ever for public reserve land to be retained for informal recreational enjoyment, or new cycling and walking links. \nAdditionally, reserve land which may be considered on paper by bureaucrats to be surplus to requirements may in actual fact be important parts of the North-West Wild Link, providing safe routes and refuges for native plants and animals. \nDevonport-Takapuna Local Board area \n- 4 Blomfield Spa: An essential pocket park that provides a welcome recreational area for Takapuna business staff, is identified for sale. \n- Eastcliffe Road/Castor Bay Road Connection: A strip of land that runs between 37 and 39 Eastcliffe Road and 89 and 91 Castor Bay Road, designated as \"Recreational\" space and could be developed into a cycling/walking connection. \n- Linwood Reserve: The non-signposted entrance to this reserve between 13 and 15 Linwood Avenue is identified for sale, even though it is gazetted as part of Linwood Reserve. This entrance could easily be connected to the current path, providing an additional cycling/walking link. \nKaipatiki Local Board area \n- Onepoto Domain: A strip of land between 39 and 43 Onewa Road (including the bus stop shelter) is identified for sale, even though it is gazetted as part of Onepoto Domain and is a potential scenic cycling/walking link to Rotary Grove. \n- Rangatira Road/Kia Ora Road Connection: A strip of land that runs between 121 and 123 Rangatira Road and 17 and 21 Kia Ora Road, designated as \"Passive Outdoor\" space and could be developed into a cycling/walking connection. \n- Rosie Bolt Reserve: The entire reserve on the corner of Alfred Street and Nelson Avenue is identified for sale. \nRest of Auckland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:21:38.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
