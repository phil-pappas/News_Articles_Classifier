There are no calls to ban the forceps that crush the life out of a baby. There is no threat of an Obama executive order to ban the suction device that separates the brain from the skull of a baby as it is just about ready to be born. The Nazis have nothing on Planned Parenthood and their financial backers from the Obama administration. However, if 10 people are tragically killed in a school shooting, Obama will threaten to invoke gun confiscation like they have in Australia and Great Britain.\nWhy is there the discrepancy between gun ownership and the forceps that crushes the last breath out of a baby? Simple, most Americans would only use their guns in self-defense. Against whom, you may ask? I defer to Thomas Jefferson as he was clear on his intent underlying the Second Amendment. We have more to fear from a tyrannical government than we do from our foreign enemies. Meanwhile, abortion is an example of the state sanctioning abortion (i.e. mass murder) as the state exemplifies its complete dominance over every citizen, even the young and the defenseless. If one thinks critically about this, there is not much difference between abortions conducted with federal funds and what can happen when to any American if and when they are snatched off of the street, without due process under the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The message is clear, the government can murder their own, but the people do not have the right for self-defense.\nThere Is Nothing More Evil Than the Murder of a Baby From the tens of millions of unwarranted abortions that have occurred in America’s genocide against babies to the illegal and heinous act of selling aborted fetus body parts for profit by Planned Parenthood, I have written scathing articles against this holocaust. The remainder of this article will further expose the satanic evil associated with the practice of abortion and how every American should be ashamed of their silent complicity in this genocide.\nOur dissent against these unholy practices is picking up steam. Even prominent members from Hollywood are beginning to have the courage to speak out including TV sitcom star, Kelsey Grammer.\n ANNUAL ABORTION STATISTICS In 2011, approximately 1.06 million abortions took place in the U.S., down from an estimated 1.21 million abortions in 2008, 1.29 million in 2002, 1.31 million in 2000 and 1.36 million in 1996. From 1973 through 2011, nearly 53 million legal abortions occurred in the U.S. (AGI). Based on available state-level data, an estimated 984,000 abortions took place in 2013—down from an estimated 1.02 million abortions in 2012. Twenty-one percent of all U.S. pregnancies (excluding miscarriages) end in abortion. (AGI). EDITOR’S NOTE: AMERICA MURDERS 1 OUT OF 5 OF ITS BABIES. HOW LONG WILL GOD CONTINUE TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY? In 2011, the highest number of reported abortions occurred in California (181,730), New York (138,370) and Florida (84,990); the fewest occurred in Wyoming (120), South Dakota (600) and North Dakota (1,250) (AGI). Mississippi had the lowest abortion rate in 2011 ( Wyoming had too few abortions for reliable tabulation), and New York had the highest (AGI). There were approximately 17.5 births for every abortion in Mississippi and approximately 2.3 births for every abortion in New York . The annual number of legal induced abortions in the United States doubled between 1973 and 1979 , and peaked in 1990. There was a slow but steady decline through the 1990’s. Overall, the number of annual abortions decreased by 6% between 2000 and 2009, with temporary spikes in 2002 and 2006 (CDC). In 2011, 17% of legal induced abortions occurred in California (AGI). The US abortion rate is similar to those of Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden but higher than those of other Western European countries (NAF). In 2005, the abortion rate in the United States was higher than recent rates reported for Canada and Western European countries and lower than rates reported for China, Cuba, the majority of Eastern European countries, and certain Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union (CDC).
