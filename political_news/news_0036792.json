Drivers use their own vehicles and set their own hours. They can be booted from the platform if too many riders give them low ratings. \nAvakian argued Uber drivers fit the state's definition of employees because they work for the company's benefit and they're economically dependent on the ride-hailing company. \nThe opinion wasn't prompted by any particular case, and it doesn't carry the legal force of an order or a ruling. But it signaled that bureau would likely rule against Uber if a case were brought against the company. \n-- Elliot Njus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:00:46.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
