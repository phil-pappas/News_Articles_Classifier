Two firefighters died. None of the four was immediately identified.\nFire Chief Paul Berardi told reporters that the firefighters who died had rescued two people.\n\"They did not die in vain,\" Berardi said. \"They saved two civilians, carried them out of the second floor on ladders, before the wall collapsed,\" Berardi told KSHB-TV.\nThe condition of the two injured firefighters wasn't immediately clear.\n\"Tonight's tragic loss is a reminder that Kansas City firefighters put their lives on the line for all of us every day,\" Mayor Sly James said in a statement. \"Our condolences go out to the loved ones of those who made the ultimate sacrifice today, and we pray for recovery of the injured.\"\nBerardi said at a press conference that firefighters were at a hospital consoling the families of the two who died.\nHe called it \"the worst day\" and added, \"It's going to be a difficult month.\"\nHours after the firefighters were injured, flames were shooting out of the rubble, the newspaper reported.
