Updated 2244 GMT (0544 HKT) October 15, 2015 JUST WATCHED Jeb Bush campaign reveals new fundraising totals 01:32 Story highlights Jeb Bush raised $13.4 million, has $10 million on hand Ted Cruz raised $12.2 million, has $13.5 million on hand Washington (CNN) It's put up or shut up time for presidential contenders. Thursday is the deadline for campaigns to file detailed financial reports telling the world how much they raised over the summer. The eye-popping stats are how many millions of dollars the candidates earned, but a second number may be more telling to judge the future of the campaigns: cash on hand, or the amount that each White House hopeful has right now to spend on TV advertisements and field organizing. It's an especially important figure for Republicans, as the top campaigns look to argue they are built for the long haul, to outlast candidates like Donald Trump. Candidates with more money in the bank are potentially better positioned, should the front-runner lose steam, rather than being forced to drop out early. The reports are especially important to answer pressing questions facing some top candidates: Has the Jeb Bush fundraising machine slowed during the traditionally tough summer months? Has Carly Fiorina been able to capitalize a pair of top debate performances into a top bank account? And is Trump spending the money to build a professional machine that can turn enthusiasm into votes? And everyone will be looking at the so-called burn rate - how quickly candidates are spending their cash. Read More Here's what we know about the third-quarter reports: Jeb Bush enters the winter with $10.3 million Raised: $13.4 million Cash on hand : $10.3 million Bush's haul is large, but given the expectations of what he could accomplish, not jaw-dropping. He does have the largest super PAC in the race to draw upon, but the $10 million in the bank isn't going to scare anyone away, especially rival Floridian Marco Rubio. The former Florida governor drew on the fundraising network organized by two former presidents -- his father and brother. But Bush's haul is only slightly more than the amount he raised in just the two weeks he was a candidate in the second quarter, meaning he is likely more touchable over the long term than might have been expected early this year. Ted Cruz has a ton of money on hand Raised: $12.2 million Cash on hand: $13.5 million Cruz's campaign said Thursday that it had $13.5 million entering the fall, thanks in part to a fundraising shop that marries big-time bundling with small contributions. The fundraising success of Cruz, who is known for his strained relationship with business-minded donors, has been one of the more surprising money storylines of 2016. Coming from Texas, Cruz has benefited from its donor-rich megacities, and Cruz handedly outraised his competitors for Lone Star State dollars last quarter. Marco Rubio is running a lean campaign Raised: $6 million Cash on hand : $11 million The Rubio campaign hasn't yet filed with the Federal Election Commission, but immediately after Bush sent out his figures, Rubio one-upped him. But the quarter could have been better than it was. His fundraising haul is underwhelming for a candidate as buzzed about as he is, but his campaign says it is running lean and doing more with less money. Bobby Jindal is on death watch Raised: $580,000 Burn rate : 140% The Louisiana governor has very little money and is bleeding fast. His campaign thus far has depended heavily on two independent groups backing his bid -- one of which is staging his events in Iowa. But there's only so far super PAC money can legally take a candidate, and his lack of hard dollars should raise questions about how long he can stay in the race. Ben Carson likely leads the Republican pack Raised: $20 million The retired neurosurgeon said earlier this month that his campaign planned to post a haul of about $20 million, powered by hundreds of thousands of small-dollar donors recruited online. He has not yet filed his report, so it is unclear whether he had to spend a large percentage of money to raise only slightly more -- as he did last quarter. His cash on hand figure will be heavily scrutinized. Why did Scott Walker drop out? Raised: $7.4 million Cash on hand : $1 million Scott Walker's abrupt departure from the presidential is made all the more unusual by the fact that he had $1 million in the bank when he chose to exit the race. His financial problems do not appear to have been imminent. He still obviously went over his skis a bit in terms of spending, which is tough to do given his fast rate of fundraising. During his ten weeks as a candidate, Walker collected a healthy $7.4 million. Buried deep in the report: the names of Alexander and Matthew Walker, the Wisconsin governor's sons, who appear to have been being paid by the presidential campaign. Rick Perry had $45,000 when he ended his campaign Raised: $300,000 Cash on hand : $45,000 Burn rate : 390% The Texas governor's fundraising numbers should make clear why he had to drop out of the race in September. Down to only $45,000 -- and with no clear sign that an uptick in cash intake was on the way -- Perry clearly was about to confront questions about whether he could pay the bills. His campaign chose to not take on any debt. His report will surely be unpacked to see whether the campaign wasted too much money in the opening stages. The top expense in the third-quarter: $200,000 to Abstract Communications, the firm run by Perry's two most senior advisers. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:58:17.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
