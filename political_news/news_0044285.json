When contributions from individual donors hit the halfway mark for select funding requests, Inspirus kicks in the rest. Having set aside $25,000 in matching funds, the credit union already has helped fully fund 43 DonorsChoose.org projects (some in as little as eight hours). Currently, 47 projects still qualify to receive matching funds. Requests are pending for art supplies, book bins, microscopes, and much more.\nIn addition, when credit union members take out an auto loan before the end of the year, Inspirus is giving them $200 to donate to projects on DonorsChoose.org. Those funds are eligible for the match, too, if the member selects a request from a high-needs school.\nInspirus (formerly School Employees Credit Union of Washington ) is open to anyone in the state who shares its passion for education. This is the credit union's first partnership with DonorsChoose.org.\n\"We're inspired by our members who not only give their hearts but their hard-earned dollars to ensure students in their classrooms get a chance for an A+ education,\" said President Scott Adkins . \"Partnering with DonorsChoose.org is a natural way for us to put our mission in motion. At the end of the day, we want to be valued most for what we give back to education.\"\nOne DonorsChoose.org project that's already received matching funds is \"Calculators for Sixth Grade Mathematics,\" a request from Park Orchard Elementary in Kent , a school where 85% of the students receive free or reduced lunch. Ms. Gray, who teaches science and pre-algebra, says the 30 calculators priced at $12.99 each \"will greatly impact the learning of integer multiplication and math involving decimals. We have been struggling to do some of the math without calculators, and I know this will make a huge difference!\"\nAbout Inspirus Credit Union\nFounded in 1936 by a Seattle math and journalism teacher, Inspirus serves about 80,000 members across Washington who share a passion for education.
