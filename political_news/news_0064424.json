The Ugly Charter School Scandal Arne Duncan Is Leaving Behind | Alternet Quote: On that day, Duncan rattled the education policy world with news of a controversial grant of $249 million ($157 million the first year) to the charter school industry. This announcement was controversial because, as The Washington Post reports, an audit by his departments own inspector general found that the agency has done a poor job of overseeing federal dollars sent to charter schools. Post reporter Lynsey Layton notes, The agencys inspector general issued a scathing report in 2012 that found deficiencies in how the department handled federal grants to charter schools between 2008 and 2011  in other words, during Duncans watch. Even more perplexing is that the largest grant of $71 million ($32.5 million the first year) is going to Ohio, the state that has the worst reputation for allowing low-performing charter schools to divert tax money away from educational purposes and do little to raise the achievement of students. A number of Ohio officials were shocked by the news. As a different article from The Post reports, Democratic Party Rep. Tim Ryan was alarmed by the Education Departments decision. Ryan called his states charter school sector broken and dysfunctional. Ted Strickland, an ex-governor and now Democratic candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in Ohio, wrote Duncan a letter telling him to reconsider the Ohio grant. Too many of Ohios charter schools are an embarrassment, he states. Strickland quotes from a recent study showing charters in his state perform significantly worse than public schools. He points to a recent scandal in which the person in the states department of education responsible for oversight of charters had to resign because he was caught rigging the books. True neoliberal. Give money to the corporations and steal it from social programs that are working and are for everyone.
