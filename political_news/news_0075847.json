The typical Swede, from experience is a very open and laid back kind of person. The society there tends to encourage that, fairly good standard of life, tolerant viewpoints, open border, generally nice people. The thing is while we get a few rough'uns over in the UK, Sweden has complete murderdeathkill nutjobs that cant fit into the stereotypical ways of day to day life, and they dont just drink Stella and knock someone out, they get all stabby on people. I've asked my colleagues in Sweden where these people come from and they initially dont know how to explain it and are all apologetic in kind of a German way, but 3 or 4 of them came out with the same things, there's no space to go a little bit nuts in society, it's just not expected so it builds and builds. Also, the Government are to blame for being Socialists, but I think that's a different problem", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:35:19.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
