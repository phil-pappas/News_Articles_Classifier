The Government needs to fully fund these sectors to provide a lasting solution to the issue of low pay.\" \n\"The Government’s willingness to negotiate on better pay for these workers is a good first step but there is still a long way to go to fulfil its obligations under the Equal Pay Act.\" \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:22:42.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
