(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)\nAssociated Press Oct. 1, 2015 | 11:27 p.m. EDT + More By SCHUYLER DIXON, AP Sports Writer\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) â€” The Texas Rangers clinched a wild-card spot and moved to the cusp of the AL West title, with Adrian Beltre's three-run double backing Derek Holland in a 5-3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday night.\nThe Rangers (87-72), in the playoffs for the first time since 2012 after a 95-loss season, are a win or a Houston loss away from their first division title since winning two straight and going to the World Series in 2010-11.\nThe Angels can't defend their AL West championship, but still have a shot at the second wild card with three games left. Los Angeles (83-76) is a game behind the Astros and tied with Minnesota, which beat Cleveland 4-2.\nHolland (4-3) allowed three hits and three runs in 6 1-3 innings for his first win since Sept. 5.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
