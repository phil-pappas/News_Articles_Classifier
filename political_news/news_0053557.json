Kiwi men called upon to sign up for a milestone Movember \nEach November, the Movember Foundation gives men a ‘free pass’ to grow a Mo, and with the month of moustachery just weeks away, Kiwi blokes are being called upon to prep their upper lips. \nMen around the country are encouraged to sign up to grow their moustaches to raise awareness – and funds – to help men live happier, healthier and longer lives. There’s no better time to do it than during this milestone year – the 10th anniversary of Movember in New Zealand. \nAnd the call for support is coming from the top. In a special video message , Prime Minister John Key has congratulated Movember on a decade of fundraising efforts that have reached $12 million, funding more than 40 local programmes for men’s health. \nWhile Mr Key isn’t growing a Mo this year, he is doing the next best thing by making a generous donation of $450 to the Movember Foundation, calling on other New Zealanders to match him. \n“We are extremely grateful of Mr Key’s support for the Foundation over the years, and even though his job won’t allow him to flash the ‘tache, he’s been a long-time advocate of men’s health,” says Robert Dunne, NZ Country Manager for the Movember Foundation. \nMore than 100,000 Mos have been grown in New Zealand since the initiative’s local launch in 2006, all contributing to Movember’s goal to have an everlasting impact on the face of men’s health. Funds raised go towards programmes focused prostate cancer, testicular cancer, poor mental health and physical inactivity. \n“This year we can reflect on all the milestones we’ve achieved to date and encourage Kiwi blokes to give growing a Mo a go. We’re reminding all Mo Bros to register early – because the preparation of a great moustache starts now,” says Dunne. \n“It’s time for men to set up their Mo space page, rally fundraising support, get their lady on side and book in to their favourite barber – ready for a clean-shaven start on November 1st.” \nTo register to participate in Movember, visit nz.movember.com . \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:43:48.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
