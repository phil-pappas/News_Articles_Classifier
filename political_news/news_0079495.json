Jeb Bush shouldn't be running the country if he can't even run his own campaign.\nTrump was in Jacksonville on Saturday, the day after the Bush campaign announced staff trims and 40 per cent pay cuts for those who remain. He said Bush, the son and brother of former presidents, is embarrassing his family.\nTrump said he's only spent a couple of million dollars on his campaign and is leading in the polls. He said spending less and getting more is what the country should be doing.\nThousands of raucous supporters cheered Trump in Bush's home state during a riverfront rally. Trump also made fun of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, saying he's out of money and \"sweating like a dog.\"\nRelated Stories 'We all support Paul Ryan': Republican moderates join hardliners backing would-be House leader Joe Biden announces he won't run for U.S. president Democrats debate: Clinton, Sanders spar on Middle East, guns, economy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:32:56.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
