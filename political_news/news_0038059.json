We’re on our knees with this.\nPromoted stories “My wife has struggled with her blood pressure and when the sheriff officers arrived she was in tears and said, ‘We can’t take much more of this’.\n“There’s been four years and about £260,000 spent on this and now we’re almost back at the beginning again. We were just about ready to start building. Now local contractors have been laid off. \"It’s been devastating. It would have kept people employed for a year.\n“It’s going to be an awful waste of money by the two governments. It’s a test case for the MoD against the Scottish Government and we’re caught in the middle of it.”\nThe Clarks’ windfarm would see £600,000 given to a local community trust over 20 years.\nHowever the MoD argue the “cumulative effect” of the 74m-high turbines and others nearby would create false alarms and other “anomalies”, making it harder to detect aircraft.\n“The strategic importance of Buchan is such that any degradation to the radar picture would … impact the MoD’s ability to protect the integrity of UK airspace,” the military warned.\nAberdeenshire Council refused the Clarks planning permission last year, but they won an appeal after a Scottish Government reporter said the radar issue could be resolved through a “mitigation scheme” – something the MoD dispute.\nAfter an initial legal hearing last month, another is due before the Inner House of the Court of Session next April, pending a £42,000 mitigation survey at Monymusk.\nClark, who keeps a herd of Aberdeen Angus, said he was inspired to start the windfarm after hearing SNP Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead urge farmers to diversify into renewables.\nHe said: “We would never have entered into this if we had thought there was any possibility of this happening. Farming is almost impossible. We try to diversify but what else is there to do? Our farm is up to 1000 ft. It’s 188 acres and 80 acres is hill.\n“It’s all politics. That bloody MoD with the Tory government behind them can spend what it takes and drag it out until the renewables certificates run out.\nShare article “We’ve written to every minister in the Scottish Government and the only one that’s been any support is [energy minister] Fergus Ewing. But Nicola Sturgeon never got back to us and Richard Lochhead, him that planted the bloody seed in our heads, never got back to us.”\nBoth the MoD and Scottish Government said it would be inappropriate to comment because of the ongoing legal proceedings.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-04T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:35:26.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
