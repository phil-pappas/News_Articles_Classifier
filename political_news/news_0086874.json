They had come from various parts of Accra somewhat composed. \nThe situation at the airport changed as soon as word came that the aircraft had landed. Hell broke loose somewhat and the airport security personnel had to depend on the support of some party persons to attempt restoring order. \nOther passengers aboard the Turkish Airline flight suffered massive inconvenience, weaving their way through the uncontrollable and frenzied crowd who were too anxious to set eyes on the new Alhaji and Hajia. \nWhile some passengers joined in the euphoria, others could not contain it, grumbling for going through an unexpected inconvenience as they pushed their luggage challengingly through a dense crowd. \nThe National Nasara Coordinator, Kamal-Deen Abdulai did not find his assignment easy, as he moved back and forth seeking to ensure that Alhaji Bawumia and his wife came out with little inconvenience; but that was not to be, as the frenzied crowd surged forward throwing everything overboard. It took the brawny intervention of the strong to get the couple out to a waiting car. \nNational Security operatives who were swarming the place did not make matters easy, as they refused to cooperate with the NPP personalities who sought to assist in the crowd control. \nPresent at the airport to receive the dignitaries were Sheikh IC Quaye, former Greater Accra Regional Minister and Central Ayawaso MP; National Nasara Coordinator, Kamal-Deen Abudulai; Henry Quartey, MP for Ayawaso Central; Alhaji Fusseini Maiga, former National Chairman for Nasara; Sheikh Damba and some executives of the NPP-USA among others. \nThe second segment of the arrival was the convoy of motorbikes, cars and buses which accompanied the couple to their residence at Kanda to a waiting batch of well-wishers. \nAlhaji Chackson, head of the Mamprusi community in the Greater Accra Region who was part of those waiting at Dr. Bawumia's residence, led a team of dignitaries and clerics to receive them. \nAt a point, it appeared the metal gate of the residence was going to be yanked off its hinges, as the crowd sought to force their way into the house. \nAlhaji Dr. Bawumia finally arrived in his residence. Inside his hall, he exchanged pleasantries with his excited guests after which he engaged the media. \nHe expressed gratitude to party faithful and the media for the spirit-lifting welcome they had accorded him and his wife. \nFor him, fulfilling the fifth canon of Islam, the performance of the Hajj, was exciting, as he prayed for the nation and those at the helm. \nErroneous decisions on the part of leadership would not be in the interest of the nation hence the need to pray for it, he explained, as he called on his compatriots to pray for the nation's welfare. \n'I have acquired a lot of experience which I believe would help me in my career as a politician,' he said. \nHe expressed condolences to families who lost their loved ones through the tragic eventualities during the pilgrimage. \nSheikh IC Quaye congratulated the couple on their arrival home and expressed his elation at the spirit of togetherness which was exhibited during the reception. \nHe said the lessons of the pilgrimage would manifest in the dealings of the couple. \nMany of the jubilant well-wishers at the Kanda residence were surprised to see two police patrol vehicles race to the place, with the cops in them claiming to have received reports about some gunshots in the direction of the house. \nThe police's claim surprised the well-wishers as they stood stupefied. \nBy Solomon Ofori", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:20:18.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
