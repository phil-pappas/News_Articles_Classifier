AFP PHOTOS In Summary The two main candidates — John Magufuli of the long-ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) and Edward Lowassa of the opposition alliance Ukawa – are the favourites to succeed outgoing President Jakaya Kikwete. Opinion polls have seesawed wildly throughout the campaign and there is little clarity as to who will take State House in a country that is Kenya’s biggest trading partner.

He recently defected from the CCM to the opposition Chadema, heading a coalition of parties. \n“Let us kick CCM out of office, the regime that has failed the nation for all the 54 years it has been in office,” Lowassa said. \n“This is going to be the toughest, but most exciting election in the country’s history,” said veteran politician Pius Msekwa, a former CCM party vice-chairman, and vice-chancellor of the University of Dar es Salaam. \nThere are six other candidates on the ballot paper but the election is expected to boil down to a contest between Mr Lowassa and Dr Magufuli. \nKenyans will monitor the outcome of the vote keenly because Tanzania is a regional heavyweight, although it has been a laggard on the integration project within East Africa, triggering, in the Kikwete years, the emergence of a “coalition of the willing” between Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya. \nBoth Mr Lowassa, who hails from Monduli in the Arusha region, and Dr Magufuli from the Chato district in northwest Tanzania, have drawn large crowds in the course of the campaign. \nThe pair are longtime members of the CCM, with Mr Lowassa having defected from the ruling party after he was locked out of the running during the party primaries. \nThe former prime minister, who was forced to resign because of a corruption scandal over an emergency power supply deal, had hoped to fly the CCM flag in the presidential race this year. \nLowassa is no stranger to Kenyans. As minister for Livestock Development, and even prior to that, he convinced the government to allow traditional livestock herders in northern Tanzania to sell their livestock directly to markets in Kenya. \nThis was aimed at allowing the herders to maximise earnings from their animals as well as make purchases of necessary veterinary drugs and agricultural inputs. His Monduli constituency as well as Longido and Ngorongoro constituencies in Arusha region share a long border with Kenya. \nDuring his campaign meetings, the former PM has repeated past calls for enhanced trade within East Africa, especially between Tanzania and Kenya. He promised during a recent visit to the Namanga border town that he would remove all bottlenecks which hinder economic co-operation between the two states once elected president. \nMr Lowassa has deep pockets and a wide network amassed during his long years in the ruling party and has attracted strong support among the youth.Extensive machinery \nBut Dr Magufuli is considered the favourite not least because he will be able to call on CCM’s extensive machinery. He has been in the cabinet since 2000 and prior to that was a deputy minister from 1995. For most of those years, he had been in charge of the Infrastructure docket, specifically the road sector. \nThe former chemistry teacher-turned-politician is regarded as a no-nonsense leader. He has been credited with improving road infrastructure from the sorry state it was in the 1980s and 1990s into one of the best transport networks in the region. \nUnlike Lowassa, he had not been a member of the inner circle of the ruling CCM but after his surprise emergence, he has campaigned on his record including the way he dealt with contractors involved in shoddy construction projects during his tenure. \nA few years ago, he ordered the 6km dual-carriage road in Dar es Salaam which had been completed by a Chinese company to be re-done because of the poor workmanship in the first phase. \nIt was during his long tenure in the Roads docket that Dr Magufuli, who hails from the southwestern shores of Lake Victoria, became a close friend of Cord leader Raila Odinga. Mr Odinga also held the Roads docket in the Narc years. \nThere had been apprehension in Nairobi’s power circles that once elected, Dr Magufuli would work closely with the Cord leader and overlook the Jubilee government of President Uhuru Kenyatta. \nBut the outgoing President Kikwete, during his recent official visit to Kenya, downplayed this, saying the friendship between Mr Odinga and the CCM presidential candidate was personal, and that Tanzania would continue with the normal government-to-government relations with the government. \nA tragic angle involving Kenya and the election in Tanzania emerged after a helicopter belonging to Cord co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka was involved in a fatal crash in the Njombe region. \nThe helicopter came down on October 14 on a flight from Dar es Salaam to the shores of Lake Nyasa, killing an ex-MP who was seeking re-election and three other people. It was one of the several choppers hired from Nairobi and South Africa by the competing political rivals to traverse the vast country. \nThe National Electoral Commission has promised to release presidential election results within three days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:10:57.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
