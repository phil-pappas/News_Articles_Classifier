So she was the driving factor for us to stop today.\" \nCarson said he isn't going to get \"overly excited\" about the latest polls indicating he's overtaken billionaire businessman Donald Trump atop the field of Republican candidates. \n\"I realize that the election is still 13 months away, but I'd rather be at the top than at the bottom of the polls,\" the former neurosurgeon laughed. \n\"He's a humble man that we'd like to see as president,\" said supporter Bruce Roberts, who calls Carson a man of the people. \"I think that's what the American people want right now is someone that is not in the political realm, where they'll actually do something positive for our country and make some real changes.\" \nRoberts' 1-year-old grandson, Josh, may have been wheeled away from the event with the most special memento â€“ the doctor's signature on his cast. \n\"They're gonna be pretty impressed at day care,\" his grandfather said. \n\"We'll definitely keep it after we cut it off,\" his mother, Lindsay Hernandez, said.
