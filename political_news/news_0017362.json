If tried and found guilty, he could face disqualification from office or up to one year in jail. Two associates are also under investigation.\nThe probe was opened after Catalonia went ahead with the Nov. 9, 2014 referendum, defying a ruling by Spain's Constitutional Court.\nIn the mock poll, less than half of those eligible took part, with some 80 percent voting in favor of breaking away from Spain.\nMas headed the \"Together for Yes\" pro-independence alliance that last month won the most seats in a regional election but fell short of a majority. The election was billed as a de facto vote on secession.\nThat alliance is negotiating with another pro-independence party to try to form a coalition majority, and Mas has promised to set Catalonia on a path toward independence by 2017 if he gets the majority.\nThe pro-independence groups garnered 48 percent of the total vote against 52 percent for parties opposed to independence.\nSpain has ruled out any possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.\nPolls show Catalans overwhelmingly support the right for a secession referendum but are evenly divided over independence.\n____\nGiles reported from Madrid.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
