This is setting a potentially fatal example of driving behavior as 82 percent of responding teens report they learn how to drive by observing their parents' driving habits and 65.4 percent of responding teens report that texting and driving is the worst habit facing teen drivers today. The findings reinforce not only the need for parents to set a positive example and put their phone down while they drive, but to also understand the tremendous positive and negative impact their driving habits can have on their teen. Parents can place their phone in a glove box before driving, or place their phone on silent and out of reach in the car to set a positive example for their teen.\nThe survey is released in advance of Teen Driver Safety Week ( October 18-24 ), raising awareness of motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of death for 14-18 year olds in the United States. In 2013, 2,614 teen drivers were involved in fatal crashes and an estimated 130,000 more were injured, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). In addition, NHTSA reports that nearly 40 percent of new drivers fail their written exams the first time they take them. The survey results are in-line with previous studies conducted by the National Safety Council and AT&T and shed light on the magnitude of the issue.\n\"We want to help teens become safer drivers and help parents understand their role in the process,\" said Andrei Zakhareuski, Founder of Driving-Tests.org. \"We are passionate about the need for and the importance of high quality online driver education to help lower the number of teen driver related crashes, injuries and fatalities.\"\nDriving-Tests.org fills a need concerning new driver safety education behind the wheel.
