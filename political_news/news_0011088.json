There were 59 votes against and 13 abstentions.\nThe bill had passed a preliminary vote on Sunday by a smaller margin, and will now be submitted to a clerical body for final approval and passage into law.\nMore about the Iran nuclear deal How the Iran Nuclear Deal Weakened AIPAC, Washington's Most Powerful Interest Group The American Israel Public Affairs Committee placed all of its chips on its multi-million dollar...
