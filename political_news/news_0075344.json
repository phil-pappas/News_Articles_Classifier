This followed a string of incidents where the corporation had \"fallen well short of the standards we expect\".\nHe cited \"editorial failures\" in the light of the Jimmy Savile revelations and the level of severance payments as sources of \"disquiet\".\nHe also made reference to the BBC's failed Digital Media Initiative, which cost licence fee payers Â£98.4m.\nThe paper asks whether the BBC Trust should be scrapped or reformed. The government sets out three options.\nA model based on the Trust- with stronger powers to censure the BBC, \"for example by giving the Trust the ability to withhold funding\". A new standalone regulatory organisation - such as the Public Service Broadcasting Commission. Moving more regulation to Ofcom. The minister said the Green Paper would ask \"hard questions\" about the size and ambition of the BBC and said a decision had to be made on whether the BBC should try to do \"all things\" or become more \"precise\".", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9F42/production/_84307704_a24b807b-ce43-4858-994f-e899215422fb.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/entertainment-arts-34133829", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/05D2/production/_85909410_johnwhittingdale_getty.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:02:30.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
