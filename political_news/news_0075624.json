It's used to limit Westchester from getting credit for units that were already in the development pipeline before the accord was struck. \nThe pact only allows such pre-settlement units to be counted if “the development is no longer viable and the county can resuscitate the development…by providing financing or other specified means with the county’s control.” \nThat’s the argument made by the administration of Westchester County Executive Rob Astorin o to federal housing monitor James Johnson in an Aug. 20 letter obtained by Tax Watch. Westchester asked for permission to “resuscitate” the 149-unit luxury condominium project called the Cambium , on the edge of downtown Larchmont, along Interstate 95, in Mamaroneck. \nThe Cambium is currently obligated to provide 10 affordable rental apartments, with no public subsidy, as part of its land-use agreement with the town. \nThe defibrillator’s juice to resuscitate the Cambium would be $2.8 million in taxpayer dollars. Astorino, that renowned fiscal conservative, would buy the 10 units for $275,000 each, and include $9,000 more per unit for marketing them through the Housing Action Council. Then the county would resell the one-bedrooms for $145,000 and the two-bedrooms for $172,000 so that a family of four earning up to $84,000 could afford to live there. \nThe net taxpayer cost would be $1.3 million - for affordable apartments the developer has agreed to build for free. \nAstorino’s Cambium gambit comes as Westchester scrambles to meet its 2015 benchmark in the settlement while defending against US Justice Department allegations that it missed its 2014 benchmark, with yet-to-be ratified penalties rising to as much as $570,000 by October. \nTax Watch visited the construction site last week to see just how bad things were at the seven-story project on the edge of bustling downtown Larchmont, where you can walk to the Larchmont Playhouse , Anderson's Book Shop , several restaurants, and the Larchmont Metro-North station. \nA project near death was not to be found. \nConstruction crews were cranking to complete the project’s Phase 1 by Nov. 20, when closing for 40 pre-sold units will begin. Finished by Thanksgiving will be the spacious two-story lobby, downstairs catering kitchen and room for that lavish dinner party for 12, as well as a common room with an ample fireplace where you could settle in a snifter of brandy to chat with your Cambium compadres. \nThe Cambium Phase 1 features 85 apartments, including eight of nine affordable units that the project’s original developer promised Mamaroneck he would build to win approvals in 2006, three years before the settlement was signed. \nA 10th affordable unit was added in 2012 after the developer won permission to add an additional floor with 10 sprawling penthouse units. \nJohn Myers is managing the Cambium’s construction for Byron Place Associates, LLC, the company established by William Neville & Sons, one of Ireland’s leading construction companies. \nMyers told Tax Watch the project’s finances were in fine fettle, with $50 million in equity, and a $28 million construction loan that has yet to be fully drawn down. With Cambium condos fetching from $595,000 to $1 million, income from the 40 closings will cover a good chunk of the construction loan. And then the developer had 110 more units to sell. \n“I’ve heard rumors about financial problems, but they are unfounded,” Myers said. “We’ve got $50 million in equity. Those are big numbers.” \nProspective buyers thronged open houses last weekend that were “crazy busy,” said Susie Joyce of Douglas Elliman Real Estate. \nAdrienne Byrne, vice president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, said the bullish pre-construction sales bode well for the project, with almost half of Phase 1’s units under contract. \n“We feel positive to be halfway through sales during construction,” she said. \nMyers sounded surprised when told of his project’s reported near-death, and its need for resuscitation by Westchester taxpayers. \nHe said Westchester Deputy Planning Commissioner Norma Drummond never mentioned that his project needed to be in financial disarray to qualify for the infusion of Westchester tax dollars. The county plan was approved by the county Planning Board on Sept. 1, and “is now being resuscitated with County financing,” the meeting minutes said. \n“If that’s the case, the deal is dead,” Myers said. “No one ever mentioned that it needed to be in financial difficulty.” Buy Photo \nDeputy Planning Commisioner Norma Drummond told the county Planning Board in September that the county was resuscitating the Cambium development, according to meeting minutes. (Photo: David McKay Wilson/The Journal News) \nDrummond brushed off questions about her role in the deal Tuesday morning, after she made a presentation before the county Planning Board. It was to meet that day in special session to approve amendments to the housing pla n, including a request to add $20 million to the $50 million already authorized in borrowing to meet the housing settlement. \nThe panel, however, failed to muster a quorum, so the meeting was rescheduled for later this month. \nShe referred Tax Watch to the office of Astorino communications director Ned McCormack, which declined to make the county executive available for an interview. Instead, McCormack detailed the county’s position in a three-page response that noted the developer’s original agreement to provide the affordable apartments for free Buy Photo \nNobody could find Planning Board Chairman Jeremiah Lynch on Tuesday morning when the panel failed to muster a quorum. (Photo: David McKay Wilson/The Journal News) \n“Compelling evidence” detailing how the project was no longer viable, as required by the settlement, was in short supply. \nMcCormack argued that because the developer has shifted the building’s ownership from rental to condominium ownership, the intervention of Westchester taxpayers would benefit all parties. He also said that because the county and developer had a handshake agreement earlier this year regarding the taxpayer subsidy, Westchester has had a financial stake in transforming the affordable rentals to affordable condominiums. \n“The town and county get affordable units that qualified under the Settlement and the developer turned his project into full ownership, which is beneficial from a sales and marketing perspective,” he wrote. “Buyers prefer developments where all the residents have equity in their homes.” \nAnti-Discrimination Center founder Craig Gurian, who brought the Fair Housing case, said Westchester’s Cambium gambit was another attempt to cheat on its obligation to create units that expands the affordable housing stock. \n“The main point was to make sure there wasn’t cheating where affordable housing was already in the pipeline,” he said. “The decree contemplated a situation where affordable housing that been in he pipeline, died, and needed to be resuscitated. But this project didn’t die.” \nTwo months after Westchester made its waiver request for the Cambium condos, housing monitor Johnson has yet to act. He told Tax Watch he’s still waiting for an analysis from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development before making his decision. A HUD spokesman said a response was \"imminent.\" \nIf Johnson rejects the waiver request, the Cambium still needs to make good on the 10 affordable units to receive its certificate of occupancy from the town of Mamaroneck. They are still approved as affordable rental units. \nThey are affordable to taxpayers too because the developer built them with no public subsidy so he could win permission to build his well-appointed complex by Interstate 95. \nThey cost taxpayers nothing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:09:44.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
