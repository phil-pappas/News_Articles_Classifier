He has called for ideas from the Senate crossbenchers, universities, students and business groups as he works to develop new legislation over coming months.\nPalmer United Party senator Zhenya \"Dio\" Wang says the government could trial deregulation at select universities. Photo: Philip Gostelow\nUniversity vice-chancellors rallied around fee deregulation earlier this year but the sector is now fragmented, with many different options being proposed.\nAdvertisement Palmer United Party senator Zhenya \"Dio\" Wang is calling on government to take a \"step by step\" process to introduce more competition into higher education sector. He said the government could conduct an experimental trial by allowing, for example, one capital city university and one regional university to set their own fees and see how they behave.\nAlternatively, Senator Wang would be interested in a system allowing universities to opt in or opt out of fee deregulation. Universities that deregulate their fees would receive a 20 per cent funding cut while those staying in the current system would not.\nSenator Simon Birmingham, Minister for Education and Training.

The architect of the HECS repayment system, economist Bruce Chapman, has backed this approach as a way to give universities more control over their fees while preventing massive price hikes.\nUniversity of Newcastle vice-chancellor Caroline McMillen said she was \"very cautious\" about fee deregulation.\n\"In the absence of funding cuts, it's not something that would particularly be on our agenda,\" she said.\nLeading expert Peter Noonan, who advised the Hawke government on higher education policy, said Senator Birmingham should set up an expert panel to advise on reform options.\nThis should include guidelines on how universities would spend the extra money from increased fees.\n\"Substantial increases in student fees to pay for university research is not good policy,\" Mr Noonan, a professorial fellow at the Mitchell Institute for health and education policy, said.\n\"The government should be very clear that fee increases are to be used primarily for teaching an learning.\"\nIndependent senator Nick Xenophon said he would support a short-term increase in what universities can charge students while the government undertakes a comprehensive review of the sector.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-02T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:24:06.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
