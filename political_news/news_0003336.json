Would any of us have heard of this issue had he not done so? I had, but then it was something I'd been aware of for a while.I think I may have previously related on PH, but my own Damascene moment with the BBC was the story, presented by the BBC flatly as \"striking miners shot by police in South Africa\" a few years back. Suffice to say, an alarming headline and one I was keen to understand more about (I have a great fondness for S.A.) so I browsed other news channels and soon found a fairly different story to the one portrayed; long story short, the miners had attacked police previous day with machettees and the shot miners had advanced into the line of fire the police were laying at ground level to prevent their advance. The police action was highly controlled and disciplined. Both Al Jazeera and RT (neither had any horse int he race) showed clear, unbiased footage and facts. I lost a lot of faith in the BBC that day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:28:51.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
