This is possibly the single most important thing Syrians have learned from their experience; it is also a gateway to regional credibility and in convincing the international community that the Syrians are able to unite, and thus, manage their political affairs in a way which ensures domestic stability and preserves regional security.\"\nThe Former Syrian Prime Minister stressed that the previous differences have had a negative impact on the international community's handling of the Syrian crisis. He commented that: \"national unity is the best way to refute claims of a divided opposition, which some parties have used as an excuse to refrain from providing support, or in turn, prevent those who intended to provide support ... This bitter experience proves that international support cannot simply develop from charity or sympathy to a just cause; quite the reverse, it will stem from full awareness that the Assad regime has crossed all the red lines and is threating the stability and security of the region and the entire world. Support will come out of a serious desire to find an alternative government able to achieve stability, combined with an ability to preserve peaceful, civil co-existence. \"\nDr Hijab called on: \"all opposition institutions and groups, and at the forefront, the National Coalition , the Free Syrian Army, the national Islamic factions, and all genuine opposition groups and individuals with consistent moderate positions in support of the revolution should work with a unified voice and further augment coordination and cooperation amongst them, and take measures to further enhance political integration and solidarity throughout, with a genuine commitment to a unified, national message which reflects Syria's , culture, history and collective identity.\" Addressing all Syrians, he said: \"All of us Syrians, no matter the affiliations, must take serious positions in order to achieve the goals of the revolution, both at the level of the individual, parties and organisations; both personally and professionally.\"\nThis statement comes in light of the escalating Russian military campaign in Syria , and its targeting of opposition sites in the provinces of Homs, Hama and Aleppo; at a time when various Arab and Western countries diverge in the face of the continuing Russian military escalation.\nTo read the full communiqué, please go to the following link: https://www.scribd.com/doc/284120393/Ex-Syrian-Premier-English-Communique\nContact: syrianassembley@gmail.com\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275653\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/syrias-former-prime-minister-serious-steps-must-be-taken-for-a-comprehensive-national-project-300157240.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LN24507&Transmission_Id=201510090830PR_NEWS_USPR_____LN24507&DateId=20151009", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151009/275653", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/284120393/Ex-Syrian-Premier-English-Communique", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/syrias-former-prime-minister-serious-steps-must-be-taken-for-a-comprehensive-national-project-300157240.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151009/275653"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:46:36.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
