The state government, reacting swiftly to the verdict, removed Yadav from the post. Yadav held the post for 2 year. \nThe Allahabad High Court , while hearing a public suit by the Bhrashtachar Mukti Morcha, said there were a number of questions surrounding Yadav’s appointment and that he was unfit to remain in the job. The court also said that fresh petitions may be filed for CBI probe against Yadav. \nAnil Yadav was earlier appointed as a member of the UPPSC in 2006. He was principal of Sri Sri Chitragupta PG college in Mainpuri and has been close to the Mulayam Singh Yadav family. \nHis tenure was marred by allegations of openly siding, promoting and patronizing Yadavs during the selection process of various posts in the state. \nIn many parts of the state, students had many allegation against Anil Yadav’s work style and police had to resort to cane charge on many instances in Allahabad to disperse angry mobs. \nYadav also courted controversy when the paper of the PCS-Pre exams of 2015 was leaked. An RTI query was earlier filed before the HC seeking to know the qualifications of Anil Yadav but the state government soft-pedalled the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:55:22.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
