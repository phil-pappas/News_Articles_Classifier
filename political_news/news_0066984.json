Photo: Andrew Meares\nWhen Chris Bowen has 10 minutes between meetings, the shadow treasurer seeks out his economic adviser Hugh Hartigan, aka his \"study buddy\". But instead of crunching the numbers on key budget figures, they spend the time sounding out numerals in Bahasa Indonesia.\n\"We need a broader, less transactional relationship with Indonesia that needs to have mutual respect, and one way we show interest and respect is learning the language,\" Mr Bowen told Fairfax Media on Thursday. \"Even if your interlocutor can also speak English, it sends a very important signal.\"\nMr Bowen said he \"bit the bullet\" and enrolled in a three-year online course through the University of New England when Hugh, like 1.1 million Australians , returned from holidaying in Indonesia.\n\"He came back, he said, 'You've been talking about learning Indonesian; if you do it, I'll do it with you.' So we're study buddies.\"\nAdvertisement Bowen said learning another language is \"doable\", even if you are on the \"wrong side of 40\", raising a family and holding down a busy job.\n\"It's not that taxing, to be frank,\" he said.\n\"It doesn't matter how old you are; you can do it. Is it easier if you're 18 to learn a language? Sure, probably, but it doesn't make it impossible because you happen to be on the wrong side of 40.\"\nMr Bowen said it was vital politicians led by example in urging younger Australians to seize the opportunities involved with the dawn of the so-called Asian Century.\n\"As a nation we need to be embracing Asian languages much more and, frankly, those of us in Parliament can't lecture young people and say, 'You must study an Asian language' if we haven't bothered to do it ourselves.\n\"Why is this so important? I ask a genuine question: can you think of any two countries in anywhere in the world so close geographically and so different culturally?\"\nHe said that with few cultural common understandings between the two countries and the change of government in Indonesia, Australia had to be proactive in initiating deeper engagement.\n\"I think I'm right in saying there's no cabinet minister in Indonesia as we speak today who studied in Australia. That wasn't the case under [former president] Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.\"\n\"It's not automatic; they've got all these calls on their attention, they don't have to think about us.\"\nHe said Indonesia's economic potential had been overlooked in favour of India and China. The Department of Foreign Affairs puts Indonesia's burgeoning middle class at about 50 million people, out of a population of around 253 million. The US Department of Agriculture predicts Indonesia's economy will overtake Australia's and become the world's 13th largest by 2030.\n\"2030 is not that far way [and Indonesia] is right on our doorstop,\" Mr Bowen said.\n\"The Indonesian middle class is burgeoning, just as much as India and China. We're all talking about India and China for reasons I understand, but here's Indonesia â€“ it gets overlooked in the middle.\"\nHe described the level of Australia's economic engagement with Indonesia as \"way underdone\" when it came to exports, investment and international students.\n\"There's this huge market there for us, whether it is protein and food exports or whether it's international students coming to Australia, and we've got to work harder at it.\"\nMr Bowen is one year into this three-year course. He said he could conduct a basic conversation in Bahasa Indonesia but wouldn't be able to give a complex speech on economics.\n\"I'm not suggesting that it makes everything perfect; I'm not suggesting that I could ring up the Indonesian finance minister if I were treasurer again and have a conversation in Indonesian and that would fix whatever we were talking about, but it counts for something.\"\nIndonesian language studies has been a part of the national curriculum since the 1950s.\nThe Labor Keating, Rudd and Gillard governments all introduced policies aimed at boosting Asian language studies in schools. When in opposition, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop promised a Coalition government would work with the states and territories to make it compulsory for school students to learn a second language.\n\"Indonesia is one of our closest neighbours, yet as I noted in a speech to the Australia Indonesia Association last year, a recent audit found that 99 per cent of high school students who study Indonesian have dropped it by their final year,\" Ms Bishop said at the time.\n\"This trend is matched at the tertiary level. According to reports, enrolments for Indonesian courses across the nation have plummeted by 30 per cent between 2002 and 2009.\"\nOn Thursday a spokeswoman for the Foreign Minister said: \"Part of the New Colombo Plan is encouraging students to undertake a language course.\"\nShe added: \"Questions on curriculum should be directed to the Education Minister.\"\nFollow Latika Bourke on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.juliebishop.com.au/making-the-case-for-languages/", "http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/products/961B6B53B87C130ACA2574030010BD05", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax", "http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/international-macroeconomic-data-set.aspx", "https://www.facebook.com/Latika-M-Bourke-132583706779458/"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:26:07.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
