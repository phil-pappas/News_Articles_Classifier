To imply this is a circus is disrespectful to the Americans who died there. I don't believe asking your queen Hillary questions about her actions during this time is a circus. I would like to know why she didn't respond to the ambassador's request for help. She says she didn't see the e-mail. Are you kidding me? Do you really believe that she didn't see it or that one of her senior aides did not tell her? If you do, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you.
