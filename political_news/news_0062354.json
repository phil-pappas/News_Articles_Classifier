Robert C. \"Bobby\" Scott, D-Newport News, is pushing for stiffer sanctions when companies violate federal law by firing employees trying to organize unions. (Daily Press File Photo) Dave Ress Contact Reporter dress@dailypress.com Bobby Scott is going to bat for unions. \nSticking up for unions isn't the usual thing for politicians, particularly when they come from a state where the percentage of workers in unions is about as low as it gets and at a time when the governor of one union stronghold briefly became a presidential contender largely on the strength of his anti-union stance. \nBut U.S. Rep. Robert C. \"Bobby\" Scott, D-Newport News, is still a fan of unions. \nHe's introduced legislation to stiffen the penalties dramatically when employers violate the law by firing employees for trying to organize a union. \nThat happens in roughly one of every three organizing campaigns, even though it's against the law, Scott said, citing a study by the Economic Policy Institute of data from the National Labor Relations Board. Business groups dispute that analysis. \nThe problem, Scott says, is that the penalty for breaking that law is a wrist slap. \nIf, months afterward, the labor board finds that an employee was fired for trying to organize a union, the sanction is ordering the company to write a check for back pay, minus anything the employee may have earned in the interim, Scott said. \nScott's proposal has three key elements to make companies think twice about firing people involved in organizing. \nHis bill proposes triple damages for an illegal firing — lost wages times three. \nIt would bring the National Labor Relations Act into line with practice with federal labor law on race, gender or age discrimination by allowing people to sue in court, in addition to going the labor board. \nAnd it would set stiff fines for violating the law about firing people for trying to organize a union. \n\"We're talking about a basic right,\" Scott said, noting that U.S. trade negotiators insist that other nations have fair labor practices and that the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights says the freedom to organize a union must be protected. (Travis Fain) \nGrowing up in Newport News, and going on to represent the city in Congress, Scott says he's seen what a union has done for shipyard workers in terms of pay, benefits and safety on the work site. He still hears that today, from people like United Steelworkers Local 8888 member Herbert Porter, a seven-year veteran at Newport News Shipbuilding. \n\"They fight for you,\" Porter said. The union stepped in when he ran into a jam, accidentally forgetting to turn off a torch when taking a 15-minute break. When he realized his mistake, he quickly scrambled back to shut off the torch, but was already being written up. \nIt was a big deal. The consequence for leaving a torch unattended for more than 15 minutes is possible dismissal, he said. Having a union rep speak up for him helped him show that it was an accident, that he was hastening to fix his error and that he hadn't exceeded that 15 minute time frame. He still was sanctioned, but he kept the job he, his wife and kids rely on. \n\"A lot of times, people just see the union dues check-off and think I'm not going to get in trouble, I don't need it,\" he said. \n\"But there's a lot going on in the background they don't realize,\" like the protection of having a contract, and having formal processes to handle disputes and safety issues, he said. \nBusiness groups see unions, and Scott's initiative, differently. \n\"Representative Scott's legislation is aimed at increasing union bosses' power in the workplace at the expense of independent-minded employees,\" Greg Mourad, vice president of the National Right to Work Committee, said in an emailed comment. \nMourad said Scott's bill would expand the use of card check organizing, which allows union organizers to collect cards from employees indicating support for a union, instead of holding votes with secret ballots. He said the approach allows organizers to harass and intimidate workers. \n\"This one-sided legislation would only increase penalties for businesses that break the law, and altogether fails to address union lawlessness,\" he said. \nScott says he knows arguing for measures others see as boosting unions is tough in a House of Representatives dominated by Republicans and at a time after Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker rose to prominence by attacking government employee unions. \n\"But I want to start the conversation,\" he said. \nHe's hoping a new study by staff members of Democratic House members on the Education and Workforce Committee will convince Congress to take a fresh look at union rights. \nThat study found: \n•Workers represented by unions earn $207 more per week than those who are not. \n•Unionized worker have more access to paid holidays, sick leave, medical and retirement benefits. \n•Business benefits because there is less turnover of skilled workers. \nScott said he believes unions are good for the economy as a whole, too. \n\"This is a consumer-based economy,\" he said. \"Henry Ford saw this 100 years ago — if you pay your workers more, they'll be able to buy your products.\" \nRess can be reached by phone at 757-247-4535.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:01:25.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
