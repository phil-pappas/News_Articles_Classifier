Paul X. Kelley on May 31, 1984, and well, it’s classic.\n“I regret that I must decline the attached invitation to enlist in the United States Marine Corps,” Reagan writes on official White House letterhead. “As proud as I am of the inference concerning my physical fitness, it might be better to continue as Commander-in-Chief. Besides, at the present time it would be rather difficult to spend ten weeks at Parris Island.”\nWith his trademark wit, Reagan noted the Democrats would probably appreciate it if he left The White House, but had to pass since his wife Nancy loved their current residence and Reagan himself was “totally satisfied with his job.”\n“Would you consider a deferment until 1989?” Reagan wrote. (It’s worth noting that Reagan served stateside in the U.S. Army Air Force’s first motion picture unit during World War II).\nMore from WeAreTheMighty.com:\nNavy SEAL vet looks to break wing suit distance record\nHere’s how the US planned to invade Canada\nChuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, now tweets about it\nMel Gibson’s next movie is about a soldier who earned a Medal of Honor despite his refusal to fight", "external_links": ["http://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/navy-seal-vet-looks-to-break-wing-suit-distance-record", "http://www.wearethemighty.com/", "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/share/source/we-are-the-mighty.png", "http://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/hacksaw-ridge", "http://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/heres-how-the-us-planned-to-invade-canada", "http://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/chuck-yeager-broke-sound-barrier-now-tweets"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:06:21.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
