Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nTurnbull was talking about the TPP or Trans-Pacific Partnership - an unnervingly vague, 12-country trade liberalisation pact covering 40 per cent of the global economy which was finally sealed in the US overnight .\nAdvertisement The devil will be in the detail with the keenly anticipated \"text\" of the agreement still months away.\nThe hard-won breakthrough followed years of posturing, false dawns, and a marathon eyeball-to-eyeball contest in which the US eventually yielded to Australia in a key intellectual property stand-off over biologic drugs .\nWhile Tony Abbott undersold his government's considerable achievements in trade liberalisation, preferring to talk about what he had stopped - boats, taxes, waste, etc - Malcolm Turnbull is determined to frame the TPP in a glowing light.\nFor the new Prime Minister, it dovetails neatly into his optimistic narrative which, in case you missed it, emphasises the opportunities for Australia in the 21st \"Asian\" century, rather than merely a defence of the status quo.\nAnd luckily for him, good ol' \"Dr No\" as the former PM was known, had several positive announcements coming in the pipeline to help Turnbull off to a good start.\nIn less than a month in the job, Turnbull has already unveiled popular initiatives on: domestic violence with a widely applauded $100 million-plus program; defence procurement, via a job-creating $1.3 billion contract for Australian-made land vehicles; and now he has presided over the successful conclusion of the elusive TPP.\nSuch is the luck and irony of politics that not only is Turnbull successfully projecting himself as the visionary antidote to the withering negativity of the Abbott years, but he is doing so with the aid of Abbott's own initiatives. Announcements that Abbott would shortly have made himself, had he not pointlessly tested his colleagues' patience to breaking point, have been tumbling out.\nThe TPP breakthrough is merely the latest positive development, and will presumably not be the last.\nTrade was Abbott's real strength. It was Abbott who licensed Andrew Robb to get cracking on stalled bilateral trade talks in 2013 and who then pushed through to conclusion historic deals with Japan, Korea, and China - all three in 2014.\nAnd it was Abbott who insisted on the tough but constructive line Robb then took in the TPP negotiations even as he was also dispatched to Delhi to revive an Australia-India agreement stat.\nIt may be little comfort to Abbott but his successor's progress is being fanned by the favourable trade winds of past hard work.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:11:21.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
