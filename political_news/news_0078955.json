Given that politicians like Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson and Donald Trump have pegged this shooting epidemic to a broken mental health system, Oliver obliges and examines the issue in depth. \nBut there's a catch: \"The aftermath of a mass shooting might actually be the worst time to talk about mental health,\" he argues. \"Because, for the record, the vast majority of mentally ill people are non-violent. And the vast majority of gun violence is committed by non-mentally ill people.\" The host cites a February 2015 report by the American Journal of Public Health , which states that \"fewer than 5 percent of the 120,000 gun-related killings … were perpetrated by people diagnosed with mental illness.\" \n\"In fact, mentally ill people are far likelier to be the victims of violence rather than the perpetrators,\" he continues. \"So the fact we tend to only discuss mental health in a mass shooting context is deeply misleading.\" [...] \nSome police departments have implemented \"crisis intervention programs\" intended to help direct those with mental health issues into treatment rather than prison. Unfortunately, only 15 percent of police agencies have utilized them. \"Our whole system needs a massive overhaul,\" Oliver says. But that won't be easy because of the \"clusterfuck\" of American agencies devoted to mental health. \n\"We, as a society, have to figure out how to fund [these programs],\" he says. \"Not just because it makes fiscal sense but because it would save lives. And if I remember rightly, there are some politicians who claim to be pretty motivated to address this problem … If we're going to constantly use mentally ill people to dodge conversations about gun control then the very least we owe them is a fucking plan.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:09:59.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
