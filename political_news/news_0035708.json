The running and rebounding were there. The energy was there. The defense was there.\nEven the jump shot -- yes, the jump shot! -- was there.\nKenneth Faried's 22 points and 12 rebounds in the Nuggets preseason win over Golden State underscored one important point about this year's training camp, his fifth. It has been the best camp of his career.\n\"Hands down,\" he said. \"Just overall.\"\nThis is how Faried breaks it down.\n\"My first one was cut short for me as a young guy,\" he said. \"My second one I thought 'Oh, I know the game.' I came in with kind of a big head, but I still came out and performed early and did what I had to when we won a lot of games.\nGet sports news and updates right in your inbox Sign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.\n\"My third one I was hesitant because of a new coach (Brian Shaw), I didn't know what was going on. My fourth one, I just came right off of World Games, I thought this is going to be easy.\"\nAnd now?\n\"Now I'm like, 'Hey I've got to get back to being who I was,' and that's humble, appreciative and thankful,\" Faried said. \"Once all of that tied into one I was able to go out and do what I can to help my team win.\"\nFaried is counting on having a breakout season, and the signs are good early in training camp. To the pleasure of Nuggets coaches and teammates, defense has been arguably his best, most-improved, trait.", "external_links": ["http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-14T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:13:44.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
