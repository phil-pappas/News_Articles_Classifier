And this Sunday, \"Face the Nation\" is multitasking.\nFirst we'll talk with real estate magnate Donald Trump in an interview at Trump Tower in New York City. We'll ask Trump about his plans for the campaign and his agenda for the presidency, and we'll also get his take on McCarthy's surprising exit. Plus, we'll get the latest numbers on the 2016 election from a new CBS News poll, and we'll ask Trump for his reaction.\nWe'll also sit down with retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson, who's emerged as Trump's strongest rival for the affection of anti-establishment voters among the GOP. We'll ask Carson about some recent controversial remarks , and discuss how he plans to put himself in the driver's seat of the rollicking Republican primary race.\nTurning to the upheaval on Capitol Hill, we'll talk with Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney about how the GOP caucus reacted to McCarthy's departure and what's next in the race to succeed outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, including the question on many minds in D.C. - will Rep. Paul Ryan seek the speaker's gavel?\nAnd as Russia's military incursion in Syria scrambles the U.S. approach to the Syrian civil war and the fight against extremists in the region, we'll get some analysis from former National Security Adviser Tom Donilon and Washington Post's David Ignatius.\nFinally, we'll turn to an illustrious panel of political experts -- including Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus, National Journal's Ron Fournier, The Federalist's Ben Domenech, and the Washington Post's Robert Costa -- to help us unpack the busy news week.\nWe hope you can join us this Sunday!
