Spokesman Andrew Arulanandam said it is the group's policy \"not to comment until all the facts are known.\" \nState Sen. Jeff Kruse, a Republican from Roseburg and one of the chief opponents of this year's background-check law, said it was too early to know how the shooter obtained his weapon or weapons. \nBut Kruse, coming from an area that has always strongly opposed gun control, said new laws restricting firearms don't solve the problem. Instead, he said, the state should focus on providing better community health treatment. \n\"I would submit that if somebody wants a gun bad enough, they're going to get it,\" he said, adding that new gun laws \"don't get at the element we're after.\" \nAt the White House, President Barack Obama angrily spoke Thursday about the shootings as he once again tried to push the Republican-led Congress to expand background check laws nationally. \n\"Our thoughts and prayers are not enough,\" said Obama, urging voters to judge candidates for their stance on gun violence. \n\"We are not the only country on earth that has people with mental illnesses who want to do harm to other people,\" the president said. \"We are the only country on earth that has these mass shootings every few months.\" \nBack in Oregon, gun-control supporter Jenna Yuille said: \"I would be incredibly disappointed if we didn't see some action from our legislators coming out of this.\" Yuille became an advocate for more gun restrictions after her mother, Cindy Yuille , was fatally shot at Clackamas Town Center in 2012. \nPenny Okamoto, executive director of CeaseFire Oregon, said she is focused on what help and comfort her group can provide for people directly affected by the violence at the community college. \nHowever, she added, \"we always will be coming back to the policy discussion\" and would look at additional steps. \nOregon voters in 2000 approved expanding background checks to cover gun shows. The latest background check bill was approved this year after national groups – including one financed by New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg – helped expand the Democratic majority in the Oregon Senate. \nOregon was the sixth state to adopt tighter background checks after the mass shootings of children at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, according to Everytown For Gun Safety, the group backed by Bloomberg. \nEverytown and other groups have several possible legislative avenues. They've talked about legislation that would make people criminally liable if they fail to secure their firearms against theft. \nSome also talked about limits on the size of ammunition magazines. Everytown also pointed to a 2011 court decision that prevents Oregon colleges from banning guns on campus. \nAny new legislative drive on firearms laws – whether it occurs in 2016 or in the next long session in 2017 – could well meet strong opposition from Roseburg and surrounding Douglas County. \nSixty percent of the county's voters opposed the 2000 background check bill, a higher percentage than in any county west of the Cascades. \nSheriff John Hanlin – in the forefront of responding to the Umpqua Community College shootings -- testified against the background check bill this year, saying he thought it was \"nearly impossible\" to enforce. \nIn 2013, Hanlin wrote a letter to Vice President Joe Biden , joining with other Oregon sheriffs who said they would not enforce any additional gun laws they believed were unconstitutional. He quoted Linn County Sheriff Tim Mueller as saying that politicians \"are attempting to exploit the deaths of innocent victims\" by impinging on the rights of law-abiding citizens to purchase \"certain firearms and ammunition magazines.\" \n--Jeff Mapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:16:57.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
