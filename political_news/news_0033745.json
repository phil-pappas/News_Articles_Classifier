However as this investigation has progressed, extra verification has been required and this has resulted in delays in some cases. \n\"Immigration officials have acted decisively to deal with this situation by introducing extra safeguards to ensure that all documents submitted in support of new and existing visa applications for work in the dairy industry are genuine. \n\"I am confident that these additional measures will prevent the occurrence of any similar offending. \n\"In addition, the Labour Inspectorate is leading an operation to audit a number of farms in the Waikato, Canterbury and Southland to check compliance with labour and immigration laws.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:27:08.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
