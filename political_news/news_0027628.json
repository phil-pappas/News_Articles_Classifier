It's double what Florida Sen. Marco Rubio raised during the same period. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul brought in $2.5 million between July and the end of last month. \nHowever, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson's campaign amassed $20 million in that time. \nThe Associated Press learned of Cruz's figures from a campaign aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity to share fundraising numbers before they're officially released.
