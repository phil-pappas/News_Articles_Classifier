Greg Abbott on Sunday evoked border security as he took to social media Sunday evening to vent about the Dallas Cowboys' overtime loss to the New Orleans Saints.\nAfter Saints kicker Zach Hocker missed a short 30-yard field goal in the final seconds of regulation, leaving the score tied at 20-20, the game moved into overtime. Two plays in, a short pass from Saints quarterback Drew Brees to teammate C.J. Spiller turned into an 80-yard touchdown and ended the game.\nAbbott, a Republican who moved into the governor's mansion in January after the exit of Rick Perry, reacted to the conclusion of the football game by tweeting that the Cowboys' defense is \"More porous than the Texas border.\"\nAbbott was one of the lead figures in the lawsuit that blocked President Obama's executive order on immigration in November 2014 that would have protected millions of immigrants from deportation and allowed them to work in the United States. A court injunction stopped Obama's order from taking effect, and that ruling is currently being appealed.\n  Report: Obama to meet families of Oregon victims Last week after the shooting took place, the president repeated his call for gun control.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 10/05/15 10:01 PM twitter-tweet\" width=\"520\"#%>¥! @Cowboy defense.
