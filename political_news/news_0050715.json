For anyone, let alone a prominent Maori leader to support a man who has been convicted of violence against women and continues to sing about such acts is absolutely ludicrous.” \n“New Zealand has enough problems and we certainly don’t need Chris Brown! Our call is for the Minister of Immigration to stamp his special visa application with a big X!
