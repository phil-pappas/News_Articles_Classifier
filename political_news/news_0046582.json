TD is one of only three organizations nationwide to receive a Sustained Excellence in Green Power Award, which recognizes EPA Green Power Partners that have distinguished themselves with a continued commitment to, and support of, green power over a period of years.\nTD Bank is currently using more than 255 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green power annually – equivalent to the electricity use of more than 24,000 average American homes annually according to the EPA. This is enough to meet 100 percent of the bank's overall electricity use. TD accomplishes this by buying renewable energy certificates and by generating electricity from on-site solar energy systems. TD Bank's sustained leadership in green power procurement sends a powerful message to other organizations that green power should be a core component of their energy portfolio.\n\"Our consistent use of green power is not only a smart business decision, but it is the smart thing to do to help reduce our carbon footprint, which is smart for the communities in which we live, work and play across our footprint,\" said Jacquelynn Henke , Innovation and Transformation Director at TD Bank. \"We are proud to receive this award from the EPA.\"\nEPA's annual Green Power Leadership Awards recognize the country's leading green power users for their commitment and contribution to helping advance the development of the nation's voluntary green power market. EPA presented TD Bank with the award at the 2015 Renewable Energy Markets Conference today in Arlington, Va.\nIn addition, TD Bank ranks No. 19 on EPA's National Top 100 list. Each list highlights EPA Green Power Partners using the most renewable energy annually as of July 6, 2015 . EPA updates its Top Partner Lists quarterly at www.epa.gov/greenpower/toplists/ .\n\"EPA applauds TD Bank for its continued, distinguished commitment to expanding its use of green power and thereby reducing its climate impacts,\" said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy . \"The Sustained Excellence in Green Power Award is indicative of TD Bank's environmental leadership and is a well-deserved honor.\"\nGreen power is zero-emissions electricity that is generated from environmentally preferable renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, eligible biomass and low-impact hydro. Using green power helps accelerate the development of new renewable energy capacity nationwide and helps users reduce their carbon footprints.\nTD Bank is committed to energy efficiency and is proud to be carbon-neutral – any carbon emissions that can't be eliminated are offset through renewable energy investments and credits. TD Bank's Net Zero branch in Florida is 100 percent powered by solar energy, and solar panels help power an additional 105 stores across TD Bank's Maine to Florida footprint.\nAbout TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank\nTD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank, is one of the 10 largest banks in the U.S., providing more than 8 million customers with a full range of retail, small business and commercial banking products and services at approximately 1,300 convenient locations throughout the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Metro D.C., the Carolinas and Florida .
