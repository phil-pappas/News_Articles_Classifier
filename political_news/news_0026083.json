On the other hand, she is effectively denying Christ and grudgingly proclaiming Sodom as Lord.\nThe half-assed, mealy-mouthed way in which she's rationalizingly doing so, though, will probably not be sufficient for Judge Bunning OR the State of Kentucky:\n[Rowan County] Kentucky clerk Kim Davis indicated Monday she would not interfere with her deputies issuing “marriage” licenses to [homosexual] “couples,” but that she did not want her name on them.\n“If any of them feels that they must issue an unauthorized license to avoid being thrown in jail, I understand their tough choice and I will take no action against them,” Davis said in a statement read outside the courthouse.\nThus sinning every bit as much as the hand that, as it were, guides the killing blade. Because Miss Davis is, after all, in charge of the Rowan County Clerk's office and thus it is her ultimate responsibility.\n“However, any unauthorized license that they issue will not have my name, my title or my authority on it,” Davis added. “Instead, the license will state that they are issued pursuant to a federal court order.”\nThat sounds nice, in an “out of sight, out of mind” kind of way. But according to Kentucky law, those “marriage” licenses will be neither legal nor valid without her name and signature on them, at least until such time as the Kentucky legislature amends that law to accommodate this “work-around”. And that means that, in effect, the Rowan County Clerk's office will still not be issuing “marriage” licenses, Kim Davis will still be in violation of Judge Bunning's illegal, unconstitutional “order,” and her ass is still headed back to political prisoner status. So the only thing she has really accomplished by this waters-muddying el foldo is to compromise her figurative martyr status when she does.\nIt also renders her appeal to the Sixth Circuit superfluous, since the whole purpose of that appeal is to allow her to continue embargoing “marriage” licenses altogether, which she has now agreed to stop doing.\n- Me, a month ago\nTold you she wasn't going to deflect her persecutors by this gimmick or even buy herself any time, because those persecutors are upping the ante – drastically :\nAttorneys for Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis argued Tuesday that a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union that seeks to enforce previous court orders requiring her [ specifically ] to issue “marriage” licenses to [homosexual] “couples” would create undue hardships if the directives were imposed while she appealed them in federal court.\nWhich is the whole point. They're maliciously punitive, intended to punish her specifically for her Christian beliefs – the very epitome and definition of persecution.\n“The plaintiffs are showing their true colors in this latest filing,” said Mat Staver, Davis' attorney and chairman of Liberty Counsel. Staver's response was filed Tuesday in a U.S. District Court in Ashland, Kentucky.\nIndeed. Especially since four of the plaintiffs comprise two homosexual “couples” that have, in fact, already receive their (invalid) “marriage” licenses, and are still trying to destroy Miss Davis anyway.\n“It has never really been about a “marriage” license — Rowan County has issued the licenses….\nWhich, remember, are neither legal nor valid without Miss Davis's name and signature on them, no matter what Kentucky's governor and attorney general say.\n….it is about forcing their will on a Christian woman through contempt of court charges, jail, and monetary sanctions,” he said.\nYep. And she's the first of many, many to come.\nAnd here's the escalation:\n“Kim wouldn't give up the job she loves….\nWhich is an elective office, recall, and one to which she was elected less than a year ago for a four year term.\n….so the plaintiffs are asking the court to put the county office into receivership — removing Kim from doing her job ,” Staver said. [emphasis added]\nIn essence, the federal court would seize control of the Rowan County Clerk's Office and subsequently terminate Miss Davis, and THEN she would be thrown back in jail indefinitely and without charge. Presumably until she agreed to convert to lesbianism, or to undergo “gender reassignment surgery” (otherwise known as an addadicktomy).\nMr. Staver is exactly right: It has never been about “marriage” licenses. It has always been about a less violent variation of what Chris Harper Mercer did to those Christian students at Umpquah Community College in Roseberg, Oregon ten days ago by shooting them in the head execution style. Kim Davis will “only” rot in jail for the rest of her life, but the reason is identical: adhering faithfully to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\nIt also goes to illustrate beyond any possible doubt that there is no possible compromise or deal or even modus vivendi that can be struck with the Gaystapo. They will not tolerate us, they will not live and let us live, they will not allow any “diversity of thought”. Everybody MUST be “gay,” and those that refuse will disappear and never be heard from again.\nTotal domination, in short. Or having a floor lamp rammed up your ass. Same basic idea.\nIronic that it removes any practical objection to open resistance against this perverted tyranny, huh?", "external_links": ["http://politicalpistachio.blogspot.com/2015/09/kim-davis-caves-will-allow-marriage.html", "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/19/03/2C4D6A7D00000578-3240804-image-a-50_1442629871577.jpg", "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/kim-davis-lawsuit-aclu-clerk/2015/10/13/id/696043/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:36:51.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
