The amount showed the ex-military ruler and minister of petroleum had been living a simple lifestyle. \nMr Buhari is the first opposition candidate to win a national election in Nigeria. The former military ruler was elected in March largely on a promise to tackle corruption and insecurity. \nNana Akufo-Addo belives that the NPP will be able to - if voted into power – turn around the misfortunes of Ghana and make things work just like President Buhari. \nHe said Mr Buhari's show of transparency and commitment to deliver on his promises alone is causing changes in Nigeria. This is something he and his party is willing to emulate, he noted. \n\"The fear factor of the arrival of Muhammadu Buhari in power has brought the generation of power back on track in Nigeria…where power cuts have become institutionalized in Nigeria, today it’s working. God willing we may be able to produce the same results here in Ghana”, he said. \nThe former Attorney General indicated that he will also set up an independent office to deal with corruption. \nHe was however quick to add that it will be difficult to completely uproot corruption from the society, but added that measures must be put in place to ensure that corrupt practices are not encouraged. \nStory by Ghana | Myjoyonline.com | Naa Sakwaba Akwa | [email protected]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:03:29.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
