Yet the predominance of college and university leaders and boards are ill-prepared to respond to – or prevent – the broad array of crises that can devastate them today,\" says Temin.\n\"For example, sexual assault has probably always existed on campuses, but today, both because of the changing expectations and activism of students, and their ability to band together over social media, they are finally calling the question at a national level: they are forcing attention to be paid and changes to be made. The power and immediacy with which information – and misinformation – catch fire during a crisis are unprecedented, and they change everything.\"\nAn adviser and leadership coach to college presidents and boards on crisis and reputation management, she will also address the following topics at the conference:\nStrategies institutions should adopt before, during, and after a crisis Managing social media around crisis How Title IX is changing the game around campus violence against women How highly effective college presidents and boards prepare for crises before they arise To speak with Davia Temin about \"Crisis Watch: The Top 12 Most Volatile Issues Facing Colleges and Universities Today,\" or on any topic regarding college or university crisis, please contact Trang Mar or Lily Rossow-Greenberg of Temin and Company at 212-588-8788 or news@teminandco.com .\nAbout Davia Temin\nDavia Temin is the founder and CEO of Temin and Company.
