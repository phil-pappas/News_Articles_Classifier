The report said the proposal would include a rotation of 260 Secret Service agents. Aides to Carson and Trump met with the Secret Service, the report added. \nCarson has reportedly received an increasing number of threats against him. A Carson campaign spokesman declined to confirm to CBS News the request for protection, saying the campaign won't comment on security matters, and declined to confirm any threats.\nA request for comment from CBS News was not immediately returned by Trump's campaign and the Secret Service only said to refer to DHS's statement.\nPresidential candidates rarely receive Secret Service protection this early in a cycle. In early May 2007, more than a year away from the general election, however, then-Sen. Barack Obama received Secret Service protection on the campaign trail .\nDuring the 2012 presidential campaign, the Secret Service began gradually ordering protection detail in November 2011 -- a year before the general election -- for GOP candidates Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, according to a Congressional Research Service report.\nDemocratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton has continued to receive Secret Service protection since she served as first lady.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:28:33.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
