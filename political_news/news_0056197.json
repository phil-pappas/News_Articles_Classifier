Wendy Davis is endorsing Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.  //kvue.tv/1FGl9aT   Endorsing Clinton, Davis says Cruz 'not fit' to lead Mark Wiggins, KVUE 9:06 p.m. CDT September 30, 2015 CONNECT TWEET   \nAUSTIN -- Former state Sen. Wendy Davis is endorsing Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. \nDavis, who lost the Texas governor's race to then-state attorney general Greg Abbott in 2014, spoke about endorsing a nominee who could understand the middle class, especially struggling women. \nDavis made the announcement at a popular South Austin coffee bar Wednesday evening along with Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt and former state land commissioner Garry Mauro. Out of all the candidates in the Democratic field, Davis called Clinton the best-equipped to immediately step into the role of the nation's chief executive. Endorsing Clinton, Davis says Cruz 'not fit' to lead \n\"I think that Hillary has demonstrated for many years her exemplary ability to lead in the face of real challenges,\" Davis told KVUE afterward. \"We need someone like that in this country who's going to be willing to take on some pretty tough times and hopefully knit this Congress back together and bring forward as the primary part of their agenda the things that really matter to American families.\" \nDavis also labeled the plan led by a handful of Republican lawmakers to cut federal funds to Planned Parenthood under the threat of a government shutdown \"political theater,\" claiming cuts would threaten 2.4 million women who rely on Planned Parenthood for basic health care. \n\"The idea that we are playing with people's lives, that we are willing to shut the government down in order to make a political point and to score political points with an extreme base in the Republican party, shows that Ted Cruz and others who are in agreement with him are absolutely not fit to lead this country,\" said Davis. \nThe Republican National Committee countered that Davis' unsuccessful campaign for governor embarrassed Democrats nationally. \n\"Wendy Davis fought her campaign on a single issue and Texans overwhelmingly rejected, and that goes to show where Texans are in their values and that's out of touch with Wendy Davis and Hillary Clinton,\" RNC spokesperson Ruth Guerra told KVUE. \n\"She's seeking the endorsement of Wendy Davis, who was a candidate just last year and who Texans overwhelmingly rejected. She lost her race and I just think it shows how extreme and how out of touch Hillary Clinton is,\" said Guerra. \nAsked whether she would consider another run for office at some point, Davis left the door open. \n\"I hope that that opportunity presents itself to me again, because I loved being in public service and I loved fighting for the things that I was fighting for,\" said Davis. \"It may or may not happen in my future. If it doesn't, I'm going to keep my voice out there. I'm going to continue to work to make sure that we are electing people who will represent the values that I and so many others in this state and in this country hold dear.\"  //kvue.tv/1FGl9aT TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:56:45.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
