As a leader you must not openly panic even when it calls for certain radical measures. \n“Rawlings is not the last in the sense that he has the worst leadership style…errrm it is difficult so I would leave it at that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:54:23.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
