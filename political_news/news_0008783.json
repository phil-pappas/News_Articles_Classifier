Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill/The Irish Times \nFri, Oct 16, 2015, 01:00 \nFirst published: Fri, Oct 16, 2015, 01:00 The Dáil Public Accounts Committee has agreed to invite Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness to answer questions on the sale of Project Eagle. Mr McGuinness had written to the committee asking to appear to answer questions on his knowledge about the sale of the National Asset Management Agency’s Northern Ireland loan portfolio. The TDs have now agreed to accept his request and a meeting is to be scheduled within the next two weeks. Robinson rejects conflict of interest claims over Nama deal Committee chairman John McGuinness said Mr McGuinness had a right to respond to the documents released by the Department of Finance. He said: “Documents released by the Department of Finance pointed the finger at Martin McGuinness and his knowledge of the sale of Project Eagle. He has a right to reply and the committee will facilitate that.” The departmental documents showed he was part of a conference call with Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party Peter Robinson. The records show a telephone log from January 2014 where the sale of the loan portfolio was discussed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:44:57.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
