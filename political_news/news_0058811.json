The problem is that Russia and China will veto any action on Iran. The other problem is that the administration really doesn’t care:\nPresident Barack Obama ordered the US government Sunday to take steps towards lifting sanctions on Iran, in accordance with the historic nuclear deal struck between six world powers and Tehran.\nObama’s directive comes 90 days after the UN Security Council endorsed the accord signed in Vienna in July, a milestone referred to as “Adoption Day.”\n“I hereby direct you to take all necessary steps to give effect to the US commitments with respect to sanctions,” Obama said in a memorandum addressed to the US secretaries of state, energy, commerce and the treasury.\nNot only is the administration glossing over the violations of the ballistic missile agreement, they are equally ignoring violations of the very agreement they are now moving to implement:\n#Iran cooperation with @iaeaorg probe into alleged nuclear weapons work not “prerequisite” for #IranDeal moving toward, says US official.\n— Jay Solomon (@WSJSolomon) October 18, 2015\nIt seems that the Obama administration has been taking lessons from Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) 46% and Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) 54% on Failure Theater. Obama is going to demand unspecified action against Iran, which he knows he can’t get, while at the same time he is going ahead and helping them build a nuke.\nThe post Obama rewards Iran despite breach of ballistic missile agreement appeared first on RedState .", "external_links": ["http://www.redstate.com//feed/https://twitter.com/WSJSolomon/status/655727554544832512", "http://www.redstate.com//feed/https://twitter.com/hashtag/IranDeal?src=hash", "http://www.redstate.com/uploads/2014/11/Italian-Surrender.jpg", "http://www.redstate.com//feed/https://twitter.com/iaeaorg", "http://www.redstate.com//feed/https://twitter.com/hashtag/Iran?src=hash", "http://www.redstate.com/2015/10/18/obama-rewards-iran-despite-breach-ballistic-missile-agreement/"], "published": "2015-10-18T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:02:18.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
