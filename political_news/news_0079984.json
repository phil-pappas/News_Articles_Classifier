What could go wrong? Stung by the campaign finance probe into a \"John Doe\" criminal investigation into potentially illegal coordination between Governor Scott Walker and independent secret money groups, the Koch-ALEC cabal is on the warpath. They want to dismantle the last remnants of the post-Watergate campaign finance system which placed limits on campaign donations and required transparency for donors, large and small. Welcoming Secret Money into Elections The first bill, AB 387/SB 292, authored by ALEC members Robin Vos and Scott Fitzgerald, retroactively decriminalize much of the illegal coordination at the heart of the \"John Doe\" investigation of Governor Walker. By allowing candidates to directly coordinate with so-called \"issue ad\" groups, donors and corporations will have a new avenue for giving unlimited money, with the full knowledge of the candidate, but with no disclosure to the public or the press. Further, almost any spending by outside groups like the Koch brothers' Americans for Prosperity can remain secret, even if the group is running ads expressly calling for the election or defeat of a candidate. As long as a group declares that express advocacy is not its \"major purpose\" it can keep its sources of funding hidden from the public. Groups engaging in express advocacy within 60 days of an election will need to report their spending, but can continue keeping their donors secret. This is full blown plutocracy with an oligarchy economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:26:02.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
