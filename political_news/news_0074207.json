More UN proposes unity government for Libya \nA spate of knife attacks by Palestinian assailants across Israel and the West Bank this week has unsettled Israelis and challenged the government of Benjamin Netanyahu . \nIn the latest violence on Saturday, a 16-year-old Palestinian stabbed two Orthodox Jews returning from Sabbath prayers near Jerusalem’s Old City, wounding them before he was shot and killed by police. \nHours later another assailant stabbed and wounded two police officers near the Old City. A third officer was accidentally wounded when the attacker was fatally shot, police said. \nA 24-year-old Palestinian shot during a clash with police in the Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem died of his wounds, the second man killed in the camp this week. A police spokeswoman said he had fired on border police officers during a violent street protest. \nLate on Thursday, the Israeli prime minister pledged to suppress what he branded a “wave of terror”, while Moshe Yaalon, his defence minister, called for the use of lethal force. \nThe proper response, said Mr Yaalon on Thursday, was to “bring about the liquidation of the terrorist stabber or attacker, the stone-thrower and the like, immediately and on the spot”. \nFriday’s deaths, near a border fence between Israel and Gaza, came a few hours after Ismail Haniyeh, leader of the Hamas militant group in Gaza, declared “the start of a new intifada” (or Palestinian uprising). \n“Gaza stands beside the battle in Jerusalem,” he said in his mosque sermon during Friday prayers. “Gaza is fully ready.” \nJerusalem: City of ruins \nRead more \nAccording to an Israeli military spokeswoman, about 200 Palestinians hurled stones and rolled burning tyres at the border fence, while soldiers responded with gunfire at “the main instigators to prevent their advance and disperse the riot”. \nHealth officials in Gaza said six Palestinians were killed and dozens more wounded. Witnesses said the shots were fired by snipers at Israeli guardposts along the fence, where Israel enforces a 100 metre-wide no-go zone inside Gaza. \nThe Israeli spokeswoman could not explain why troops had not instead used non-lethal crowd control weapons, such as tear gas and rubber bullets, routinely used by Israeli forces against violent protests in the West Bank. \nMeanwhile, the spate of Palestinian knifings triggered a revenge attack on Friday, when a 17-year-old went on a stabbing rampage through the streets of the southern Israeli city of Dimona, wounding two Israeli Arabs and two Palestinian workers. The attacker said after his arrest that he “thought all Arabs are terrorists,” according to a police spokeswoman. \nStabbing attacks on Israelis also continued, with a first reported assault by an Israeli Arab. Police said a woman pulled out a knife and tried to stab a soldier in the northern city of Afula before she was shot and wounded. It was the second knife incident in Afula in as many days. \nSeveral of the Israeli victims in the past week have been Orthodox Jews, recognisable by their distinctive garb, or soldiers and police in uniform. Two Israelis have been killed and 14 wounded in the rash of stabbings since Saturday. Four of the assailants were shot dead by security forces. Gaza stands beside the battle in Jerusalem. Gaza is fully ready \n- Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas leader in territory \nThe latest unrest was triggered by clashes last month between Israeli police and Palestinian youths at al-Aqsa mosque compound, a contested holy site in Jerusalem’s Old City, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. \nPalestinians have voiced alarm at attempts by Jewish activists and rightwing Israeli politicians to promote a greater Jewish presence in the hilltop compound, and al-Aqsa has become the rallying cry of the current wave of violent protests and attacks. \nIn an attempt to reduce tensions, Mr Netanyahu has barred his cabinet ministers from visiting the holy site and ordered police to prevent entry by both Jewish and Arab parliament members. “We don’t need more detonators to ignite the area,” he said. \nThe prime minister has repeatedly declared that there are no plans to change arrangements at al-Aqsa compound, where only Muslim prayer is allowed, calling assertions that Israel wants to divide the area between Muslims and Jews “wild and false incitement”.
