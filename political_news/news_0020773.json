Citi News' Franklin Badu who has been reporting from the party's headquarters in Accra said, the decision was taken in a meeting called on Friday October 23, by First National Vice Chairman, Freddie Blay. \nFriday's NEC meeting was marred by violence in the morning when members of the party's private security, Invincible Forces, burnt a motorbike and destroyed the windscreen of a taxicab at the party office. \nAccording to them, a youth group they suspect were members of 'Bolga Bull Dog' who are allegedly loyalists to Mr. Afoko had attempted to disrupt the meeting. \nThe Disciplinary Committee took the decision first, after the National Council of Elders in September, wrote to it, demanding amongst others, that the National Chairman Paul Afoko, be made to step aside until after the 2016 elections. \nThe council in the letter enumerated amongst others, the many challenges the party has been facing in recent months and the failure of the Chairman to restore order. \nMr. Paul Afoko was recently criticized for making public comments on the party's finances, a practice against laid down rules. Mr. Paul Afoko and his colleague, Kwabena Agyepong, the General Secretary, have been under pressure to leave the party following the death of the party's Upper East Regional Chairman, Adams Mahama. \nThe two leaders were accused of having a hand in the death of the late NPP stalwart, an allegation they have flatly denied. Coincidentally, Paul Afoko's brother, Gregory Afoko, is one of the suspects on trial for the murder of Adams Mahama, who he suffered severe burns after acid was poured on him. \nThe NPP is yet to fully recover from the internal strife that hit the party in recent months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:05:51.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
