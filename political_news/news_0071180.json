The Liberals have listened to the Canadian Federation of Students' recommendations and announced an additional $3.3 billion investment to federal student grants.\n\"The Canadian Federation of Students has been calling for investment in up-front grants from government and political parties for many years,\" said Bilan Arte , National Chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Students. \"Students are graduating with mortgage sized debts and the Liberal's plan will lessen that burden on students and their families.\"\nHigh tuition fees continue to be the greatest barrier to accessing post-secondary education. In 1982, government funding made up almost 83% of university operating revenue, with tuition fees accounting for less than 14%. In 2012, government funding had dropped to just 55% of university operating revenue.\n\"Students have been organising through the 'It's No Secret' campaign to ensure student issues are addressed in this election,\" said Arte. \"This announcement shows us that our movement is being heard.\"\nStudents have begun voting at special Elections Canada polling stations on 39 campuses that run Monday to Thursday. Students on these campuses can cast their ballot for any riding in Canada .\nThe Canadian Federation of Students is Canada's largest student organization, uniting more than one-half million students across Canada . The Canadian Federation of Students and its predecessor organizations have represented students in Canada since 1927 in their call for fully accessible public post-secondary education.\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C5839&Transmission_Id=201510051338CANADANWWEB______C5839&DateId=20151005", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:51:13.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
