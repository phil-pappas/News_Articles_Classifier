Conrad Appel , R-Metairie, is suing John LaBruzzo , the Republican challenger for Appel's 9 th District seat, over \"false and misleading\" statements in a mailer. Titled \"Conrad Appel is one bad apple,\" the mailer says Appel:\n\"Bought stocks in a Common Core company that received state contracts,\" causing his shares to double in value \"Invested thousands of dollars in a company that got a state technology contract to implement Common Core.\" Appel said those statements are untrue. \"There is the potential for irreparable harm to my reputation and business because of the allegations he has made,\" Appel said Monday (Oct. 12). He seeks a temporary restraining order in 24th Judicial District Court against LaBruzzo's campaign releasing similar statements.\nThe dispute seems to have begun Thursday, when the Appel campaign released a mailer reminding voters that LaBruzzo voted for a controversial legislative pay raise in 2008 , shortly after he was elected to the 81st House District. \"John LaBruzzo likes being a politician ... because it's the only job where he can vote to raise his own pay,\" the mailer said.\nThe LaBruzzo campaign fired back the next day with its own mailer. It cited a March 2014 blog post in The Louisiana Voice , which asserted that Appel bought stock in Discovery Communications a week before Louisiana adopted a \"Discovery Education Science Techbook\" for use in elementary and middle schools. The post said Appel's investment in Discovery doubled over the next three years.\nAppel said Discovery Communications is a television company that sells some of its video products to local school systems, not to the state. \"This blogger says that the only thing that happened in 2010 was that a science book was approved!\" Appel wrote. \"Science is not part of Common Core; only English and math\" are.\nAmy Barrios, a spokeswoman for the LaBruzzo campaign, said, \"We stand behind what we put out and feel it's a frivolous lawsuit.\"\nA hearing on Appel's suit is scheduled Tuesday.", "external_links": ["http://louisianavoice.com/2014/03/27/senate-education-chairman-appel-purchases-discovery-stock-week-before-company-enters-into-state-techbook-agreement/"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:25:15.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
