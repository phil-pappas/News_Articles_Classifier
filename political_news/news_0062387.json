FROM FACTCHECK.ORG: We found several falsehoods and misleading claims in the Democratic candidates' first debate: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton revised her earlier statement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, claiming that she said she \"hoped\" it would be a \"gold standard.\" At the time, she said it was a gold standard. Sanders wrongly said that the U.S. had \"more wealth and income inequality than any other country.\" The U.S. ranks 42nd in income inequality and 16th in terms of wealth held by the top 1 percent. Read More Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley claimed that \"70 percent of us are earning the same, or less than we were 12 years ago.\" Not true.
