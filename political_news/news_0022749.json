If political parties are serious about ensuring women across all workplaces are paid more and given the opportunity to take on senior roles, then political parties should start by getting their own houses in order. \n\"A Government with 70 percent of its Ministers men isn’t good for women and it isn’t good for New Zealand. \n\"Unions like the New Zealand Nurses Organisation and the Service and Food Workers Union, who backed Kristine Bartlett to fight for equal pay for rest home workers, have fought for years for better pay and conditions for women who work. It’s time for political parties to show leadership on gender equity too. \n\"This year the gender pay gap increased. Men are now paid nearly 12 percent, or nearly $3, more an hour than women, in terms of median hourly pay. \n\"The idea that people are paid on merit, or appointed to senior roles like Government Ministers based on their abilities, doesn’t stack up. Women are paid less largely because they’re working in professions that are dominated by women, and they’re often not appointed to senior positions because of barriers that have nothing to do with ability. It’s time to drop the idea that women are worth less once and for all. \n\"Around the world countries are realising that gender inequality is holding them back and they’re committing to greater representation by women in many positions of power in business and politics. \n\"There are at least 28 countries which have a greater proportion of women in cabinet than New Zealand, including France, Canada, Germany, Israel and South Africa. \n\"By committing to a gender balance in Cabinet, the Green Party won’t immediately fix the inequalities women are forced to deal with at work every day, but it will show that we are committed to gender equality everywhere, staring with where we work ourselves,\" Mr Shaw said. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
