He said he didn't know how seriously she was hurt.\nThe suspected attacker, a man apparently aged between 30 and 40, was arrested.\nPolice said the incident happened at a campaign stand set up by Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats at a market. They said that two people were seriously injured and three lightly in a scuffle.\nReker is running as an independent candidate in Sunday's election but has the backing of the conservative Christian Democrats and two other parties.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
