Scott Walker's slide in his home state continues, even after leaving the presidential race.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 09/30/15 7:01 PM A Russian general walked across the street to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Wednesday morning to say the Russians would begin flying strikes, the official said. The general also requested that the U.S. remain clear of the airspace over all of Syria.\nThe U.S. disregarded the request and is flying anti-Islamic State missions over Syria on Wednesday as far west as Aleppo, the official said. The Russians have spent weeks building up their military presence in Syria, flying equipment, including combat jets, and advisers to bolster Assad's regime.\nThe U.S. has said it would welcome Russian participation in the coalition striking the Islamic State in Syria, but President Obama has maintained that any long-lasting political solution to the civil war in Syria is dependent on Assad's removal from power. The U.S. is training and equipping moderate Syrian rebels who reject Assad's rule, but has made them promise to fight only the Islamic State, not Assad.\nRussia, on the other hand, has said it will support Assad's regime and help defend it against those moderate Syrian rebel groups trying to strip him of power.\nAsked about the safety of U.S. pilots continuing to fly over Syria, the official said deconfliction isn't necessary now since the U.S. is flying missions over Islamic State-controlled areas in eastern Syria, while the Russians are striking in Assad's territory to the west. Future operations, however, may make it necessary to talk to the Russians to keep planes from getting too close.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton: Israelis 'always sound cocky' Clinto replied to an email thread by saying Israelis \"always sound cocky — in the air and on the ground.\"\nBy Ariel Cohen • 09/30/15 6:49 PM \"Certainly we recognize going forward the need to have something in place to deconflict our operations,\" the official said.\nObama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday in New York during the United Nations General Assembly.

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the Russian airstrikes will only prolong the civil war that has killed and displaced hundreds of thousands of Syrians by keeping Assad in power for longer.\n\"The use of Russian military force in Syria adds a troubling new development to a war effort already plagued with problems,\" said Schiff, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\nFirst #video of #Russia \nAlso from the Washington Examiner House GOP bolts from spending bill funding Planned Parenthood A majority of House Republicans on Wednesday rejected a leadership-proposed bill to fund the government.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 09/30/15 5:02 PM n airstrikes in #Homs today provided by Defence Ministry.. #Syria #ISIS pic.twitter.com/sSOwD4StlB — Rami (@RamiAlLolah) September 30, 2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:19:08.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
