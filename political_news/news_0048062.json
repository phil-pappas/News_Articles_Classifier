Jim Webb holds a news conference in Washington to talk about a possible third party run Lindsey Graham finally hits 1%, will get to be in next debate (Jim Cole / Associated Press) \nIt doesn't really seem like that high a bar to get into a debate -- hit 1% support in any one of nine polls over a month -- but several of the men seeking the GOP presidential nomination have had trouble clearing it. \nThe 1% standard is the threshold for being in the early debate when the GOP candidates meet next week in Boulder, Colo. To get on the main stage, candidates must average 2.5% support -- a test that 10 appear to have met. \nFour candidates -- Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, former Gov. George Pataki of New York, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- were destined for the undercard, although they each scored below 1% in several surveys. \nUntil today, Graham was at risk of not making even that contest. Seven polls in a row showed him with less than 1%. \nBut when he appears at next week's debate, Graham can say, \"thanks, CNN.\" This morning, that network's survey showed him making the grade. A Washington Post/ABC poll, which will be the ninth of the surveys used to determine positions in the debate, will be released later this week. Fiorina fades, Trump, Carson maintain lead in GOP race (Sean Rayford / Getty Images) \nCarly Fiorina's moment in the sun in the race for the Republican presidential nomination appears to have faded quickly, new polls indicate. But Donald Trump and Ben Carson have solidified their positions atop the field. \nThe latest evidence comes from a CNN poll released this morning. Fiorina dropped to 4% support, down from 15% in a CNN poll last month. \nUntil she gained attention with strong performances in the first two GOP candidate debates, the former Hewlett-Packard executive was little known to most voters outside California, where she lost a Senate race in 2010. The debates sent her on a quick rise, but she fared poorly in the scrutiny of her record that followed and has ridden the down escalator almost as promptly. The CNN survey is among at least a half dozen recent public polls that have shown sharp drops in her support. \nNot that the rest of the GOP is doing a whole lot better. After Trump at 27% and Carson at 22%, the next tier of GOP candidates consists of the two Floridians in the race, Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, at 8%. Several other candidates are bunched behind those two with 4% or 5% backing. \nA flurry of polls in the runup to next week's GOP debate in Colorado have each shown the same basic pattern, with a strong lead by Trump and Carson and the rest of the field grouped closely together with single-digit support. \nThe CNN poll was conducted Oct. 14-17 and has a margin of error for its Republican sample of +/- 4.5 percentage points.
