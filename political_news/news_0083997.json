(Andrew Harnik/Associated Press) October 2 at 6:12 PM The Sept. 29 front-page article “ Obama, Putin clash over Syria crisis ” highlighted key questions that should have been debated and resolved by Congress long ago.

The lack of debate on Capitol Hill and the simplistic overuse of the label “terrorism” by the media contribute to this lack of understanding.\nIronically, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s points regarding attempts by Western nations to impose democracy resulting in “violence and social disaster,” whether intervention in Syria violates international law and what a stable Syrian end state would look like should already have been weighed by Congress, the president and the American people.
