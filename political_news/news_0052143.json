Ingram of Australian National University describes what analysis of the Islamic State’s media strategy keeps missing , and why the organization’s strategy isn’t new; Lisel Hintz of Cornell University writes about political polarization in Turkey and examines how the recent terrorist attacks have only encouraged a culture of fear and hatred; Michael Robbins of the Arab Barometer argues that the Arab uprisings had a surprisingly small effect on attitudes of ordinary citizens towards democracy , likely because the uprisings were not really about democracy in the first place. \nOther Reminders \nPOMEPS is accepting proposals for our 7th Annual Conference on the contemporary politics of the Middle East. We look forward to receiving all proposals by December 11, 2015 . \nAlso, if you’re planning to attend MESA in Denver next month, make sure to RSVP to our reception Sunday, November 22 . \nImage courtesy of Marwa Morgan , via Creative Commons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:06:35.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
