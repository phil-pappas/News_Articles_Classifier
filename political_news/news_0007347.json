The one-off 'catch up' for the 2015/16 year would be an increase of around $6.5 million. \n\"The Bill provides for the catch-up funding to be sustained and for inflation and population adjustments to occur annually. It is the first step in a broad strategy by Labour to improve the quantity and quality of New Zealand voices in broadcasting. \n\"Public service broadcasting is gradually being eroded in New Zealand. Despite the population of New Zealand growing ever larger and more diverse, the range of voices in broadcasting is narrowing. \n\"This bill is a stake in the ground on the importance of public interest media,\" says Clare Curran \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
