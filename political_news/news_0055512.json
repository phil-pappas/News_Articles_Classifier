He says it strengthens U.S. with a vital region, while keeping countries such as China from writing \"the rules of the global economy.\"\nCongress will have 90 days to review the agreement before voting on it. Obama says he looks forward to working with lawmakers from both parties as they consider the pact.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:38:55.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
