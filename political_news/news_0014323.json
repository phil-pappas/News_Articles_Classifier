It was taken down by the Maunga Authority in June this year. \nIn late May, the PuketÄpapa Local Board passed an urgent resolution supporting dialogue around the issue and a move back to fixed dates. \n\"For the past six months we have played a constructive role in getting this sensitive issue resolved. We’ve brought the Maunga Authority and the Mt Roskill Ministers’ Association together to talk through the issue and understand one another’s perspectives. We’re thrilled that an outcome has been reached that respects both the role of the Maunga Authority and the deeply felt connection that the local community has with the cross and star structure,\" says PuketÄpapa local board chair Julie Fairey. \n\"The Maunga Authority made the decision yesterday, agreeing to allow placement of the structure for fixed periods for Christmas 2015 and Easter 2016, with a review afterwards to consider ongoing arrangements. While the proposed time periods do not align exactly with those requested by the local Ministers Association, the Chair and Deputy Chair of the Authority have been authorised to consider the possibility of altering the time periods. \n\"The most important thing is that a fundamental agreement has been reached to allow the star and cross to be displayed and we are confident that further details can be resolved by further good-faith discussions. We commend all parties for their constructive approach to resolving this important local issue.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:02:10.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
