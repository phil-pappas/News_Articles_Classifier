But the job is not done yet.’’ Marco Del Grande Share on twitter by James Chessell As far a political role models go, Iain Duncan Smith is an unlikely candidate.\nA failure as leader of the UK Conservative Party in 2001-03, the former Scots Guardsman was destined for the political scrapheap. For a while, it seemed his contribution to British public life would be confined to a universally-panned political thriller titled The Devils Tune , and a much-ridiculed speech that attempted to make a virtue out of his lack of charisma with the warning \"do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man\".\nYet slowly IDS, as he is sometimes known, has rehabilitated his career. He studied up on welfare and founded the Centre for Social Justice , an influential centre-right think tank that has tried to reclaim the notion that the Tories are interested in the topic. Then, in 2010, newly-elected Prime Minister David Cameron surprised almost everyone by installing him in cabinet as work and pensions secretary.\nThe promotion put Duncan Smith in charge of what the new PM promised would be \"the most fundamental and radical changes to the welfare system since it began\". First-term policies included cutting the maximum amount of benefits a household could receive each year by £3,000 ($6,000), down to £23,000 ($48,000) a year, introducing the so-called \"bedroom tax\", which obliges public housing tenants to pay extra if they live in a home that is deemed to be too large for their needs, as well as a \"universal credit\", which combined six tax credits and benefits into a single payment calculated so that people were better off working than on welfare.\n\"We will ensure that work always pays better than welfare – we are bringing to an end Labour's something for nothing culture,\" Duncan Smith told the annual Conservatives conference in Manchester this week. \"But the job is not done yet.\"\nThe drive to curb welfare in the wake of the global financial crisis became an electoral asset for the Conservatives. While the changes are regularly described as \"heartless austerity\" by critics including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who called for Duncan Smith's resignation in August when statistics were released showing more than 3000 people died after being found fit to work in disability benefit tests, opinion polls suggest the majority of voters have backed Duncan Smith. \"I think when the full history of this period of government is written, he will be seen as one of the central figures,\" says Peter Snowdon, author of Cameron at 10: The Inside Story 2010-15 .\nNoticeable achievements Duncan Smith's achievements have not gone unnoticed in Australia. Scott Morrison, the former social services minister and now Treasurer, is full of praise for the 61-year-old. Describing the UK system as \"excellent\", Morrison backed initiatives that avoided the \"poverty trap\" where low-paid employees are discouraged from staying in work because they could earn more from tax credits and other benefits.\n \"In the UK, Iain Duncan Smith has done some excellent work in looking at those sorts of systems,\" he told ABC radio on Wednesday. \"What you want is a tax system and a payment system that locks together.\n\"[And then you need] a labour market system that links in with that to ensure that you're better off working than being on welfare [and] when you are working you're not going to be taxed out of existence.\"\nBut while the Conservatives' welfare agenda may be smart politics, its does raise questions that are not easily answered. Have the changes actually contributed to the fall in the UK unemployment rate, which now sits at 5.6 per cent? Just how successful can they be in helping Cameron end what he described in Manchester this week as the \"ridiculous merry-go-round\" of taxing low-income earners and then handing them money back in benefits? And will they create a rift between Tory hardliners and their more moderate counterparts?\nIt is important to note the Conservatives' flagship welfare scheme, the universal credit, cannot have helped reduce unemployment because it is running years behind schedule. With only 50,000 out of 7 million potential claimants covered and Treasury not expected to give its final \"ok\" until at least the middle of next year, it is yet to have a meaningful affect due to a series of problems associated with the vast IT system needed to handle the policy. Similarly, most experts agree the bedroom tax and welfare cap have had less to do with reducing the jobless rate than the UK's solid economic growth.\nWriting about the positive performance of the UK labour market since the financial crisis, which \"has astonished almost everyone\", former cabinet office chief economist Jonathan Portes argued \"this has little or nothing to do with new reforms introduced under this government\".\nHowever, there is more optimism about the future effectiveness of universal credit. Ryan Shorthouse, chief executive of the liberal conservative think tank Bright Blue, says the combination of universal credit and tougher rules for those receiving unemployment benefits will make a difference.\nBest route out of poverty is work \"It is really saying the best route out of poverty is work and we are going to incentivise that,\" he says. \"Conservative means are achieving progressive ends.\"\n\"In principle, [universal credit] is a simpler system and as you transition from unemployment to work your benefits don't get withdrawn as quickly so I am in favour of it\".\nAnother critical mitigating factor in assessing universal credit is other Conservative policies that will affect low-wage earners. As part of chancellor George Osborne's election promise to cut £12 billion out of Britain's £220 billion welfare bill, the government will press ahead with deep cuts to tax credits claimed by 4.5 million people. Among the changes are rules that prevent a family, which has a third child born after April 2017, from qualifying for the child tax credit, which amounts to up to £2,780 a year per child.\n\"That's what the limit on child tax credit for more than two children is about – bringing home to parents the reality that children cost money and if you have more kids you have to make the choices others make and not assume taxpayers money lets you avoid the consequences of such choices,\" Duncan Smith said in Manchester . \"That's taking responsibility, and that's fair.\"\nThe changes to tax credits have sparked opposition from some Tory MPs including high-profile London Mayor Boris Johnson, who worry it will leave poorer constituents worse off and end up discouraging the unemployed from seeking work. Johnson used his speech at the party conference to warn Osborne, who is his main rival to take over from Cameron, that \"as we reform welfare and we cut taxes that we protect the hardest working and lowest paid\".\nProjects prepared by the House of Commons library suggest the overall impact of the tax credit and other budget changes could reinforce poverty by leaving the average family £1,300 worse off. Another forecast produced by the Institute for Fiscal Studies argued the lowest-earners will be £750 worse off.\nNine out of 10 families will be better off For his part, Osborne argues nine out 10 families would actually be better off once increases in personal allowances, improvements in childcare and the government's surprise budget announcement in April to increase the national minimum wage were taken into account. He argues that welfare spending was out of control under the previous Labour government and needs to be reigned in. Osborne cites the cost of tax credits – which has ballooned to £30 billion – as one of the main reasons the UK accounts for an \"unsustainable\" 7 per cent the world's welfare spending compared with its 4 per cent contribution to global GDP.\nYet even if Osborne's defence adds up, it exposes several contradictions within the Tory policy. First, because he does not want to upset a critical block of voters Cameron refuses to touch age pensions – a trait he shares with political leaders in Australia – despite good policy reasons to do so. Second, the universal credit is what Shorthouse refers to as an \"uber tax credit\".\n\"This sort of allergy among Conservatives about tax credits is misplaced,\" he says. And third, the decision to raise the minimum wage from £6.70 to £9 ($19) an hour by 2020 was not greeted with unease by many Tory MPs as you might expect, but widespread enthusiasm.\nDuncan Smith was so excited about the increase – which Osborne did not share with most cabinet ministers before it was announced – that he punched the air on the floor of the House of Commons. \"I know lots of purist Conservatives say this is not something the Tory party should do,\" he told the Guardian last week. \"I just thought that was madness. I do not need any lectures from these theoretical Conservatives that have never run anything in their lives.\"\nYet not everyone is convinced. Steve Nickell, a former economics professor at Oxford University and one of the three members of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said in July that \"raising minimum wages as a means of reducing poverty is completely hopeless\" because many people on low pay are secondary earners in households that have relatively high incomes.\nHaving managed five years of post-GFC austerity during his first term, Cameron wants to frame his second as a period of opportunity for Britain. His speech in Manchester was an attempt to reclaim a more liberal agenda by promising to tackle \"deep social problems\" such as discrimination, \"finish the fight for real equality\" and launch \"an all-out assault on poverty\".\nWith the Labour party moving to the left under Corbyn, observers such as Snowdon say the Conservatives can occupy the middle political ground even if the mechanics of Duncan Smith's welfare agenda do not quite match the prime minister's progressive rhetoric.\n\"[Duncan Smith] has introduced some very, very radical reforms at a time of budget cuts,\" Snowdon says of the once forgotten man of British politics. \"It's been a hugely controversial area of government policy but I suppose he's now seen as one of the senior members of government\".", "external_links": ["http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/welfare-reform-and-jobs-miracle#.VhcFRxNVhHz", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3242959.stm", "https://twitter.com/jameschessell", "http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/about-us", "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/02/iain-duncan-smith-interview", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11915653/Child-tax-credit-reforms-will-teach-parents-that-children-cost-money.html", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/iain-duncan-smith-should-resign-over-disability-benefit-death-figures-says-jeremy-corbyn-10475017.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:55:20.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
