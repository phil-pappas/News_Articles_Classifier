Share article \nIn comparison, job seekers allowance accounts for £4.9bn, or just three per cent of the total welfare budget and disability living allowance costs £12.6bn, which is a mere eight per cent. \nWhere in the south is the UK's benefits capital?

While people are working they pay contributions through PAYE to pay for their retirement. It is not a benefit you claim ,it is an entitlement you have paid for. So this article is not even worth publishing in it's current form. It should be published MINUS the state pension then you would get some idea of where in the south is the UK 's REAL benefits capital. So if you take off the 46 per cent paid in state pension you might come up with much more realistic findings Such a one sided story.
