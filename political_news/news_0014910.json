The vast majority of his activity on the social media site consisted of re-tweets saying how boring Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee were on stage. \n“All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage,” Trump tweeted. “The hardest thing Clinton has to do is defend her bad decision making including Iraq vote, e-mails etc. Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight!” \nThe Republican’s most animated Tweet came in response to a question buy Cooper asking if “black lives matter” or “all lives matter.” \n“Sanders said only black lives matter – wow! Hillary did not answer question!” Trump tweeted. Candidates get ready to begin the first Democratic debate of the 2016 campaign, Oct. 13, 2015. (Image: CNN screenshot) \nTrump’s decision to offer commentary on CNN’s debate caused almost as much buzz as the debate itself. The social media monitoring website Topsy reported “Donald Trump” was searched 60,000 times in 24 hours compared to 92,000 times for the hashtag #DemDebate. \nA Fox News poll released Tuesday shows Trump remains the most popular candidate among Republican primary voters at 24 percent. Dr. Ben Carson is close behind at 23 percent, followed by Texas Sen. Tex Cruz at 10 percent.

The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus five points for Republican primary voters. \nTwitter users can follow Trump’s live tweets here .
