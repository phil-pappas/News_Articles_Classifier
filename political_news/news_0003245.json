I haven't paid attention to politics in a long time,\" Brady said. \"It's actually not something that I really even enjoy. It's way off my radar.\"\nThe clarification comes after Brady displayed a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat from the Trump campaign in his locker while speaking with reporters on Sept. 16, the same day as a Republican presidential debate. When asked whether he thought Trump has what it takes to win the presidency, Brady said: \"I hope so. It would be great. There would be a putting green on the White House lawn, I'm sure of that.\"\nBrady and Trump have golfed together, according to the quarterback, who said Trump is competitive: \"You don't want to be against him — you don't want to be on the other team with him.\"\nTrump mentioned the comment during a town hall in New Hampshire the next day, saying: \"Tom is this incredible guy, total champion. And didn't even want to tell me about it — he endorsed me yesterday.\"", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1L2fn3x"], "published": "2015-09-29T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:25:39.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
