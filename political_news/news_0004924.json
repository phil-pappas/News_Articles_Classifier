Photo: Chris Lane\nOn October 19, officials from the Department of Immigration confirmed what lawyers know to be the case. That is, the Australian government is accountable for the operation of immigration detention centres and, as of July 1, \"the ultimate accountability for the operation of the centres sits with the Australian Border Force\", to Quote: one official giving evidence to a Senate committee.\nThe inhumane treatment over the past 10 days by the Australian government of a 23-year-old Somali woman known as Abyan​ needs to be seen in this context, as does the refusal of Immigration Minister Peter Dutton and his department to defer to the clinical judgment of health professionals who refuse to send children back into detention.\nIn the politicking that accompanies Australia's dealings with asylum seekers, the legal framework is often missing. Yet when one sees it in that legal context, it is clear that the government is liable for any failure to properly care for asylum seekers, such as Abyan and the 80 children whom the Department of Immigration confirmed this week were subject to a return to Nauru after medical treatment in Australia.\nThe law is that the Commonwealth government owes a non-delegable duty to detainees in immigration detention, and the Commonwealth can be held liable \"for the negligence of others who are engaged to perform the task of care for a third party – no matter whether the person engaged to provide the care is a servant or an independent contractor\", as the High Court stated in a landmark 2003 decision called NSW v Lepore​.\nAdvertisement This means if medical service providers or detention centre operators are negligent, then the Commonwealth taxpayer is exposed to a claim for damages.\nWhat is the content of the duty of care the Commonwealth owed to Abyan, who is 14 weeks pregnant as a result, she alleges, of being raped on Nauru? Abyan was offered no counselling or support on Nauru. Last week she came to Australia unwell, both physically and mentally. She did not have a termination procedure last Wednesday because of her ill health, and on Friday the Department of Immigration had her transferred back to Nauru. Dutton made the extraordinary decision (so much for the right to privacy about one's health records) to release this week information on the \"care\" given to Abyan in Australia last week. He said it consisted of a mental health nurse, general practitioner, and a primary health nurse. Sometimes an interpreter was present and on other occasions not.\nIf we accept the veracity of this information, it shows the Commonwealth failed to exercise an appropriate level of care for Abyan. This is a young woman who has suffered trauma – she has been accepted as a refugee from war-torn Somalia. She is pregnant in the most awful of circumstances, and English is not her first language. To simply give her access to nursing staff and a GP is well below what a woman in her position is entitled to as a patient.\nBut it gets worse. Abyan is sent back to Nauru, still pregnant, and finds a journalist from The Australian newspaper wanting to interview her. Surely the Commonwealth would understand that to fail to protect Abyan from further mental health deterioration and exposure to the media is not just morally but legally wrong.\nThe treatment of Abyan is symptomatic of the Australian government's cavalier attitude to its legal duty of care to asylum seekers.\nThere are about 80 children in Australia at the moment who are having medical treatment, or who are with another member of their family who is having medical treatment. The Department of Immigration says these children will be returned to Nauru. Dutton says they have to be returned because to do otherwise would show Australia is a soft target for asylum seekers.\nAs we know, many doctors – including some at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital – are refusing to release children back into the \"care\" of the Department of Immigration. To do so, these doctors say, would be a breach of their ethical and legal duty to ensure their patients are not exposed to more physical and mental harm.\nAgain the legal position is clear. If the evidence of a treating doctor and his or her professional colleagues is that to send a child back to Nauru would be to expose them to a high risk of physical and mental harm, then the Commonwealth, as the carer of these children, must abide by that decision. To do otherwise would be negligent and run the real risk that a court would force the Commonwealth to pay what are termed exemplary or punitive damages for what the High Court in a 1998 decision has termed \"conscious wrongdoing\" or behaving with \"contumelious disregard of another's rights\".\nThe law relating to detainees of the state is clear and should be the only consideration when it comes to ensuring that detainees remain safe and secure. It is rare, however, that we hear politicians from the major political parties and many elements of the media focusing on this question when considering the plight of asylum seekers.\nGreg Barns is a barrister and a spokesman for the Australian Lawyers Alliance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:30:34.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
