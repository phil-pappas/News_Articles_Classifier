(AP Photo/Paul Vernon)\nAssociated Press Oct. 17, 2015 | 11:46 p.m. EDT + More By RALPH D. RUSSO, AP College Football Writer\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) â€” J.T. Barrett played finisher for Ohio State, running for two red-zone touchdowns in the first half and then taking over full-time for Cardale Jones in the third quarter, as the top-ranked Buckeyes played another round of quarterback roulette in a 38-10 victory against Penn State on Saturday night.\nWearing black uniforms for the first time, the Buckeyes didn't look like themselves, though they did look a lot more like the dominant team many expected the defending national champions to be this season.\nOhio State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) still doesn't have a definitive answer at quarterback, but the Buckeyes have a 20-game winning streak.\nBarrett added two fourth-quarter touchdown passes to make it 38-10 and draw chants of \"J.T.! J.T.!\" from the blackout crowd of 108, 423 for Dark Night in the Shoe.\nJones started, as he has all season, but was only 9 for 15 for 84 yards. Barrett, as he did last week, entered when the Buckeyes got inside the 20 in the first half and helped Ohio State complete three trips there with touchdowns. After two unproductive third-quarter series, Jones was benched.\nFreshman Saquon Barkley provided most of the offense for Penn State (5-2, 2-1) with 194 yards rushing.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
