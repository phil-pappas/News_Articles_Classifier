Rick Snyder's office. \"... The governor's office has been in full coordination in reporting and bringing to light concerns with appropriate state and federal law enforcement agencies.\" \nEAA officials couldn't be reached for comment. \nThe FBI investigation was first reported by the Detroit News , citing unnamed sources, who said the probe involved contracts that may have been awarded to vendors who paid kickbacks. \nWilbourn-Snapp resigned as principal of Mumford High School last year. \nShe was known as a former Army reservist who wore a military uniform while walking the halls of Mumford, where she was placed after making improvements at Denby High School and developing a reputation as a \"turnaround specialist.\" \nThe state created the EAA in 2011 by taking over 15 low-performing Detroit schools, including Mumford, and implementing alternative education strategies. \nProposals to expand the district to other parts of the state were stalled by dismal test scores and other complaints. \nVeronica Conforme, who was named new chancellor of the EAA in June 2014, announced a restructuring earlier this year that would have all 15 schools run autonomously, would be run autonomously with decisions on programs, personnel and professional development directly on school leaders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:15:32.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
