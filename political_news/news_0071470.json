Sign up here for the DC Inno Beat. \nGoogle ( GOOGL ) has been quietly working on using drones to provide Internet access since even before it bought Titan Aerospace and brought that company's high-flying drone tech in-house as Project Titan. New papers filed with the FAA suggest that it could happen sooner than you might think, at least if Google (or technically the Access and Energy section of Alphabet) gets permission. \nThe FAA is running quite late on coming up with commercial drone regulation. The agency has been allowing more and more exemptions from the official ban on using drones for commercial purposes, letting real estate agents, movie companies and other groups test out and apply new ways of using drones. As helpful and interesting as the photographic and delivery use of drones, including medical deliveries may be, they can't compare to how fundamental a change it would be to simply offer Internet access in places that don't have any right now. \"Google hasn't been shy about pouring resources into projects to provide Internet access to remote parts of the world.\" \nGoogle hasn't been shy about pouring resources into projects to provide Internet access to remote parts of the world. Not only has Google invested in drones , but with balloons via its Project Loon, or through satellites placed into orbit. There are obvious reasons why Google would want to make Internet access as universal as possible, but it's been facing plenty of potential competition from the likes of SpaceX and Facebook. Using drones instead of satellites makes that kind of system a lot easier to put into place. \nGoogle started lining up the regulatory dominoes for drone-based Internet even before the FAA filing. The company has asked the FCC for permission to use some bandwidth to test communication with drones. That's not the same thing as the kind of access it would need for full-on Internet service, but it's a key step that, and if it works, will make it easier to get the next permission from the federal agencies it is dealing with. \"Each new kind of drone exemption that the FAA issues takes time for the agency to examine before assenting.\" \nWhether it can get the FAA permission in a timely manner is a debatable question though. Each new kind of drone exemption that the FAA issues takes time for the agency to examine before assenting. The agency was so slow in giving Amazon permission to test its delivery drones that by the time the exemption came out, Amazon said it had already moved on to a new generation of drones that would need its own exemption. \nThe drones Google is planning to use to beam the Internet fly much higher and stay in the air much longer than any delivery drone. The idea is that they could use solar power and gliding to stay in the air as close to indefinitely as possible. And that means using monitoring and guidance systems somewhat different from the direct piloting by licensed pilots that the FAA is moving toward as necessary for lower-flying drones on shorter-term missions. At the same time, the FAA could make a lasting impact by issuing that exemption to Google, giving it, and presumably any other company that jumps in, a chance to change the world in a bigger way than any aerial delivery.
