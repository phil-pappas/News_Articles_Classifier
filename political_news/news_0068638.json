(AP) - Louisiana voters Saturday whittle down the list of candidates vying to follow term-limited Gov. Bobby Jindal into office and to inherit leadership of a state mired in deep financial problems. \nNine candidates for governor are on the ballot, but the race comes down to four major contenders: Republican Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle, Republican Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne, Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards and Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter. \nMonths ago, Vitter was atop the polls, flush with millions in campaign cash and running like an incumbent. \nBut amid continued talk of his 2007 prostitution scandal and a drumbeat of criticism from opponents about his attack-heavy campaign tactics, Vitter’s poll numbers have slipped and his negatives have spiked among voters. One PAC is running an “Anybody But Vitter” campaign. \nPolls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday. \nSix other statewide races - including competitive races for lieutenant governor and attorney general - are also on the ballot, along with four constitutional amendments, state legislative seats and local elections. If, as expected in the governor’s race, no candidate tops 50 percent of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a Nov. 21 runoff. \nEdwards appeared certain to make the runoff in the governor’s race, leading in most recent polls with a base of Democratic Party support. The three GOP contenders were battling for the second spot, as Angelle and Dardenne tried to cobble together enough undecided voters disenchanted with Vitter to leapfrog the senator onto November’s ballot. \nAt least $21 million has been spent so far by candidates and super PACs on the race. \nThe men have largely shared similar positions on repairing Louisiana’s financial crisis and balancing the budget. They support a rewrite of the state’s tax structure to scale back spending on tax breaks and a lessening of budget protections that leave colleges at most risk for cuts. \nThe most striking disagreements are on the Common Core education standards and the minimum wage. All but Dardenne oppose Common Core, and all but Edwards oppose raising the state’s minimum wage. \nWith few policy differences, the race largely came down to personalities - and a referendum of sorts on whether Vitter’s eight-year-old prostitution scandal still resonated with voters. The senator apologized in 2007 for a “very serious sin” after he was linked through phone records to Washington’s “D.C. Madam.” \nAn Ivy League-educated Rhodes Scholar from the New Orleans suburbs, Vitter returned to a campaign style that has worked for him in previous races. He ran on conservative values and described himself as a political outsider. \nHe and a super PAC supporting him attacked his GOP competitors as tax-and-spend liberals, suggested Dardenne wasted tax dollars in office and criticized Angelle for resigning as state natural resources secretary only days after a massive sinkhole opened on his watch. \n“Baton Rouge is broken and dysfunctional, and there are no adult leaders there taking on the big challenges,” Vitter said in one of only two TV debates he attended. \nAngelle, a French-speaking native of Breaux Bridge with a thick Cajun accent, positioned himself as the conservative candidate without a prostitution scandal, saying he wanted a strong economy with “more people pulling the wagon and fewer people riding.” His critics reminded voters that Angelle was Jindal’s chief legislative lobbyist, tying him to the unpopular governor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:47:42.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
