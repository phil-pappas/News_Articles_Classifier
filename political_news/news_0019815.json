Promoted stories \nMr Grayling said that the issue could be branded 'England-only', despite the significant impact on the rest of the UK. \nUnder Evel, the Speaker will be required to judge if a Bill is ‘England only’ or ‘England and Wales only’. \nThis certification will trigger a new stage in the Bill in which only English MPs will be allowed to vote. \nMr Grayling said that it was right that laws could not be imposed on England without the consent of English MPs. \nThe UK Government previously pulled a planned vote on Evel in the face of potential parliamentary defeat. \nSine then it has accepted a number of changes at the suggestion of a powerful Commons committee, including to allow the Speaker to set out why he judges a Bill English only. \nEstimates resolutions, which decide public spending, will also be outside of the new rules, which Mr Grayling said should avoid problems with so-called Barnett consequentials. \nThese govern the amount of money transferred to the Scottish Parliament as a result of decisions in England. \nMr Grayling said that the proposals would “bring fairness to our devolution settlement and it is fairness that will secure the future of our Union\". \nHe rejected accusations that Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish MPs would be excluded as “nonsense”. \nBut the SNP’s Pete Wishart described it as a “dark, dark day for Scottish members of parliament”. \n\"The Tory government claims this is about saving the union,\" he said. \n\"The truth is all Evel does is enhance the case for independence.’’ \nHe also warned that the move would set Scottish MPs against the Speaker and could lead \"all the way to the Supreme Court\". \nFellow SNP MP Tommy Sheppard accused Tory ministers of \"pandering\" to the English nationalism of Ukip. \nHe also claimed that Evel was “payback” for the SNP’s success north of the border in this year’s General Election. \n“Just because it is in your manifesto it does not make it right,” he urged Tory MPs as he warned the reforms would “will drive a wedge between our two countries greater than any that I would drive between them”. \nLabour’s shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray denounced the changes as \"an incomprehensible mess\". \nHe accused the Tories of taking \"a wrecking ball to parliament\". \n\"David Cameron always puts his party before the country and, today, he's put his party before parliament,\" he said. \nChris Bryant, the shadow leader of the House, warned the move was a \"charter for breaking up the Union\". \nLabour’s Gerald Kaufman, the Father of the House, declared it “a day of shame for the House of Commons”. \nHe attacked the debate as “one of the nastiest, most unpleasant I have attended in 45 years”, by “a government with no respect for the House of Commons”. \nBut Tory backbencher John Redwood said that the plans delivered “justice” for England. \nEnglish MPs must give their 'consent' to any Bill deemed England-only, but Scottish MPs could still have the power to veto Bills as all MPs will get a final vote on legislation. \nIn the past couple of months Conservative ministers have pulled a number of votes, including on fox hunting, for fear they would lose because of the votes of Scottish MPs. \nOn Heathrow, Mr Grayling said that votes on flight slots or airspace capacity would be done \"on a UK-wide basis\". \nIf, however, the vote on a third runway was presented in parliament as an issue about a planning application \"it might be very different\", he warned.
