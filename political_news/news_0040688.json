You could argue that the lying is proof of his goodness: He does it to keep from hurting his friends’ feelings. He always insists it’s innocent, but I’m starting to wonder. \nFor example, we frequently drive from Madison to Chicago to see friends or family. We can’t see everybody every time we go, and my husband doesn’t want people to know we’ve been there without contacting them. So if it ever comes up with them later, he lies. A Chicago couple recently asked us to come down and see a musical with them, but we’d already seen the show with a different couple. My husband didn’t tell them that, instead skillfully steering them toward another activity. \nThat might sound like a harmless white lie, but they start to pile up, leading to more elaborate fibbing. He’s a genius at keeping all these fabrications straight, remembering what he’s told to whom. But I find myself getting lost in the tangled webs he weaves. I keep worrying I’m going to say the wrong thing to the wrong person and expose us both. As a result, I find myself clamming up in social situations. I’m constantly making eye contact with him to be sure I don’t misspeak. \nHow normal is my husband’s lying? I’m starting to wonder if I have a deeply screwed-up dude on my hands. \nHonest to Goodness \nDear Honest: You certainly have an anxious, insecure person on your hands, but my guess is he’s not “deeply screwed-up.” The scary kinds of liars do it to achieve a self-serving goal: covering up a murder, stealing from a workplace, etc. Your husband, by contrast, wants to keep everyone happy — or, looked at from another perspective, wants to keep everyone from being disappointed in him. \nA problem with his approach is that lying will keep him at a distance from friends and family. Now it’s even distancing him from you. \nEven worse, lying has likely distanced him from himself. I’m guessing that his compulsive social fibbing has not done wonders for his self-image. \nSo here’s what you can do, Honest to Goodness: Assure your husband your Chicago friends will not hate him if he sees a show with someone else. Assure him that being more honest with others will reduce his stress and increase his happiness. Assure him that excessive white lies are hurting his life, not helping it. \nIn other words, tell him the truth. \nDo you have a question about life or love in Madison? \nWrite Tell All, 100 State St., Madison, WI 53703.
