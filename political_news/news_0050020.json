Obama doesn't intend to nominate King or another candidate for education secretary before his presidency ends in early 2017, said a White House official, who wasn't authorized to comment by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The program became a flashpoint in the fight over federal involvement in education. Critics argued it encouraged states to adopt the Common Core, a controversial set of curriculum guidelines that become symbolic of federal overreach.\nEducation in America: Degrees of cost Duncan says he has not yet started talking about what he'll do next, although it's likely to involve expanding opportunity for children.\nCBS News' Arden Farhi contributed to this report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:12:29.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
