Yes, you heard me right; $10 million. And yet we are barely able to scrape together $10 million as a down payment on our debt to Nigeria for the supply of a truly essential product – gas,” Akufo-Addo said. \nBut in a response on his facebook wall, Kwakye-Ofosu who described the claims as outrageous also clarified that the NDC government has always ensured that corporate sponsorship is used to finance the printing of limited quantities of diaries. \nHe added that Akufo-Addo’s lack of attention to details is the cause of his party’s internal wrangling. \nBelow is the unedited version of Felix Kwakye-Ofosu’s post: \n\"So the flagbearer of the NPP has decided to dabble in a campaign of disinformation by claiming that a whopping US $ 10 million was spent on the printing of Presidential diaries. It would have been expected that the media would hold him to strict proof but alas they won’t. \n\"Unless the diaries are draped in gold or diamonds, surely it should have occurred to him that the figure he quoted was spectacularly outrageous. \n\"He may want to take note of the fact that if given their lavish taste in government between 2001-2008, it was the practice to spend such huge amounts on diaries, we in the NDC are not given to such ostentation. \n\"We have adopted a process that ensures that corporate sponsorship is used to finance the printing of limited quantities of diaries. \n\"This lack of thoroughness and attention to detail which leads him to make unfounded claims against government explains why his party is in tatters at the moment and in its worst shape ever.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:43:11.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
