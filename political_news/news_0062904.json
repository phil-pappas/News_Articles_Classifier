These constructive conversations are a big step in the right direction, and I am confident that we can reach an outcome that is beneficial for all parties involved.’ \nMinister of State Services Paula Bennett and Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety Michael Woodhouse say the group will recommend agreed principles on pay equity that could be applied in all sectors of the economy. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:22:21.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
