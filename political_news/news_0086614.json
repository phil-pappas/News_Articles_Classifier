Jeb Bush speaks during a campaign stop Wednesday, Sept. 30, 2015, in Bedford, N.H., in this file photo. Presidential candidate Jeb Bush drew a rebuke from the president for comments he made Friday about the university shooting that left nine people and a gunman dead in Oregon the day before. Speaking at a campaign stop in South Carolina, Bush urged caution on the government's reaction to the Umpqua Community College shooting, using the phrase \"stuff happens\" in reference to crises. Portrait of Oregon Gunman Emerges; Family 'Shocked' \"I resist the notion -- and I had this challenge as governor -- 'cause look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis and the impulse to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do,\" Bush said. Bush called the shooting \"heartbreaking,\" but was speaking about the larger issue of how to set rules in the face of tragedy. \"We're taking people's rights away each time we do that and we're not necessarily focusing on the right challenge,\" he said. He said \"the best laws\" are usually at the state level. Baby Can't Crawl After Drinking Mom's Methadone President Barack Obama was asked to respond to Bush’s comments at a news conference Friday afternoon. \"I don’t even think I have to react to that one. I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgment based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting. And they can decide whether they consider that 'stuff happening,'\" Obama said. Michigan Declares Health Emergency Over Flint Water Bush, pressed by a reporter in Greenville about the phrase \"stuff happens,\" said the choice of wording was not a mistake but about tragedies in general. He cited as an example an \"impulse\" to pass a law about fencing after a child drowns in a pool.
