Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, told his colleagues on Tuesday night that he would \"gladly serve\" as speaker if the conference met several conditions and that the major GOP caucuses endorse him by this Friday. \n\"What I told the members is, if you can agree to these requests, and I can truly be a unifying figure, then I will gladly serve. And, if I am not unifying, that is fine as well. I will be happy to stay where I am, at the Ways and Means Committee,\" Ryan told reporters at a press conference after that meeting. \nRyan, however, faces an uphill battle convincing the 40-plus members of the House Freedom Caucus that he should be the next speaker. \nThe chairman of that conservative group, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters on Wednesday that the Freedom Caucus hopes to meet with Ryan later in the day. A handful of members of the conservative group also met with him a day earlier, before he revealed his decision to run.\nRep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, another leader of the group, left open the possibility of supporting Ryan. \nHe said \"it's fair to say\" that a number of its members could support him, but added that \"it's presumptuous to say that he's the only candidate.\"\nThe caucus had officially backed Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Florida, for speaker , when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, and Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, were still in the race. \nOn Tuesday night, Webster said he'll remain in the race.\nRyan's conditions included converting the GOP from being \"opposition party\" to a \"proposition party,\" updating conference rules, unifying House Republicans and having time to spend with his family. \nWhile Boehner has said he plans to resign from the speakership and from Congress on Oct. 30 , he has also pledged to remain as speaker until his successor is chosen.\nCBS News' Walt Cronkite contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:13:46.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
