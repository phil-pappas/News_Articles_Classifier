Show Caption Previous Next \nORLANDO, Fla. - Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants a $20 million boost for the state's technical centers. \nScott on Monday will announce he's seeking extra money for the centers from the Florida Legislature. The $20 million request will be part of Scott's budget recommendations for 2016. \nThe governor wants technical centers to use the money for a \"rapid response\" grant program. The grants would allow the centers to quickly set up work training programs that respond to job demands. The programs would be aimed at helping train students within one year. \nScott last January asked for $20 million for technical centers but his request was not funded by legislators. \nThere are technical centers across the state run by school districts or colleges. They offer job training for various occupations and industries. \nCopyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
