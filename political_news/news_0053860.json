For example China’s emissions reduction plans will save 75 lives per million people per year because of less air pollution, but stronger targets would lead to larger gains. \n“The emerging international research is beginning to demonstrate that New Zealand’s weak targets not only fail to make a fair contribution to protecting health by maintaining a healthy climate, they also mean New Zealanders are missing out on huge health and wellbeing benefits that could be gained through climate action,” says Dr Macmillan. \n“The ‘ Our Climate Our Health ’ campaign is another clear message to governments, the health sector, and society that health is at the heart of climate change.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:57:57.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
