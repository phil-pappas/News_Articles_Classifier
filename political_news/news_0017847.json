The court argues that the agreement violates Europeans’ privacy because their personal information may exposed to U.S. government surveillance. \nTop international companies, such as Apple, use the agreement, which allows customers’ personal information to be transferred between the two continents. \nIt’s unclear how the ruling will affect trans-Atlantic commerce, but Mr. Earnest said the administration is concerned. \n“There is concern about the economic consequences of this particular ruling,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:39:31.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
