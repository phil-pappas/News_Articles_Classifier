While NZ Super is affordable, the Cullen Fund was a wise move to reassure Kiwis that they will have a pension. \n\"National is refusing to contribute to the NZ Superannuation Fund (Cullen fund) over 10 years, yet it is borrowing heavily and making huge cuts to government agencies, just so it can create a farcical surplus. \n\"Had National contributed to the fund, ranked the worldâ€™s best performing sovereign wealth fund over five years, it would now be worth $47.8 billion, $18.2 billion more than it is now. While Finance Minister Bill English scoffed at these figures in Parliament today, the Cullen Fund was about planning for the future which this government has failed to do in any way. \n\"Mr English is only too happy to take tax off our superannuation savings, at about $1 billion a year. \n\"National should be ashamed that of the $14.5 billion of capital contributions made National is responsible for just 2 per cent,\" says Mr Tabuteau. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:40:02.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
