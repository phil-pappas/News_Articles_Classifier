Mitt Romney, the establishment favorite in 2012, raised $14.2 million during that time, while the most popular outsider, former pizza chain CEO Herman Cain, brought in $2.8 million. \nBennett estimated the campaign had at least $12 million in the bank as of Wednesday. Overall, the campaign received more than 600,000 donations since launching in May from a total of 353,000 individual donors. \nThe Carson campaign declined to detail how much money it spent to raise that cash. Those details will be included in its financial report to federal regulators, which is due in two weeks. \nBut as of June, the Carson campaign was burning through donor money faster than almost anyone else's in the race. He'd spent more than half of the $10.6 million he collected between the beginning of the year and June 30. \nIn the three-month period beginning April 1, Carson's top five expenses all were fundraising-related — for direct mail, phone calls and online marketing, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. \nIn a comment aimed at the GOP establishment, Bennett said, \"Sooner or later, they'll have to realize there's a new reality or they'll pay the price,\" and added, \"The outsiders are not going away.\" \n--- \nRamer reported from Exeter, New Hampshire.
