Then, along with partner UPS, the fresh soap will be distributed to those who have been impacted by recent disasters, such as the flooding victims in South Carolina .\nThe soap drive collection point is located at 300 1 st St SE, in front of the Capitol Hill Club. To donate soap, please keep in mind:\nThe soap can be new or gently used. Leftover soap from hotels and gift baskets are perfect examples. Place the soap in gallon or quart-sized zip top bags and bring them to the collection point. Financial donations are also welcome, and will help underwrite the cost of the soap distribution and hygiene programs. Ask your friends, neighbors and family to contribute soap or money. You will be surprised with how much soap goes to waste on a daily basis. According to Shawn Seipler , CEO of Clean the World, something as simple as donating soap can have a great impact on the lives of those who need it the most.\n\"There are nearly 6,000 preventable hygiene-related deaths that occur each day around the world, mostly due to a lack of access to soap,\" explains Seipler. \"What we are hoping to do here in DC is raise awareness of the impact that we can make by collecting and recycling used soap, and working with our partners like UPS to deliver it to those who need it the most.\"\nFor more information on how to become involved with Clean the World or to make a monetary donation, visit www.cleantheworld.org .\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clean-the-world-and-ups-host-washington-dc-soap-drive-on-friday-october-30-300163108.html\n ", "external_links": ["https://cleantheworld.org/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/clean-the-world-and-ups-host-washington-dc-soap-drive-on-friday-october-30-300163108.html", "http://www.cleantheworld.org/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=FL33432&Transmission_Id=201510201326PR_NEWS_USPR_____FL33432&DateId=20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:19:17.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
