Bradley Podliska before firing him in late June.\nThe former staffer had reservations about a partisan investigation focused on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. The panel's chairman, South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, said he was unaware of the man's concerns.\nThe lawyers also said they sent a cease-and-desist letter asking Gowdy to stop talking about confidential settlement discussions with Podliska.\nPodliska plans to file a lawsuit contesting his dismissal.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:34:22.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
