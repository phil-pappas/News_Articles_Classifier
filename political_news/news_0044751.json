I want to make sure that anybody who is objective will sign off the Bill as meeting the Smith Commission in full, in word and spirit.\n\"I don't actually expect the First Minister to say that, but our pitch is to people who are not part of the political establishment, it's to the wider public and to people who will look at it objectively, and I'm confident they will be able to say the Bill meets the Smith criteria in full.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-08T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:46:55.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
