This move has drawn criticism from the West, which believes Russia should work with the coalition targeting the Islamic State, not rebel groups, some of which have been trained by the U.S.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Bush prepares for general election fight with Clinton \"I would have taken her to task for that and if she wins the nomination and I win the nomination.\"\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 10/14/15 8:14 AM \"There may come a time in the future when Russia perceives that its approach isn't going to work. But that time has not arrived yet, so for now, our work with them is specifically focused on air safety,\" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Tuesday.\nOther than letting U.S. officials know that operations were beginning, there has been no military-to-military coordination between the two countries conducting strikes in the same area.\nResponding to criticism of this lack of cooperation, Putin said he has asked the U.S. for coordinates of either groups Russia should strike or should avoid, and hasn't received a response to either request.\n\"Recently, we have offered the Americans: 'Give us objects that we shouldn't target.' Again, no answer,\" he said, according to a New York Times report . \"It seems to me that some of our partners have mush for brains.\"\nThe lack of coordination presents a risk for pilots. There have been \"several\" incidents in which U.S. and Russian aircraft passed within miles of each other, including one where the American plane had to change its route to avoid the Russian jet, Col. Steve Warren, a spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, said Tuesday .\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Violence in Israel a story of Israeli retaliation for the press Many news reports on the actions of Israeli security forces downplay the violent acts of the Palestinians.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/14/15 9:00 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:09:14.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
