They will receive a credit on monthly bills based on electricity that's generated at Solar Gardens locations for the life of the projects – about 25 years.\nThe program is open to Consumers Energy's residential and business electric customers, and participants will choose between four flexible payment term options. A participant subscribing to a SolarBlock over 25 years will pay $10 additional per month. Some of that cost will be offset by the solar energy credit.\nTo enroll, go to www.ConsumersEnergy.com/solargardens .\nConsumers Energy is working to develop two Solar Gardens locations in West Michigan , with the option to build more based on customer demand.\nGroundbreaking for the first Solar Gardens facility – a 17-acre location that would be Michigan's largest community solar project -- took place this month at Grand Valley State University in Allendale . Consumers Energy is working to develop another location at Western Michigan University .\nConsumers Energy, Michigan's largest utility, is the principal subsidiary of CMS Energy (NYSE: CMS), providing natural gas and electricity to 6.6 million of the state's 10 million residents in all 68 Lower Peninsula counties.\nMedia toolkit\nSOLAR GARDENS: Learn about, and enroll in, Consumers Energy's community solar program: www.ConsumersEnergy.com/solargardens\nFor more information about Consumers Energy, go to www.ConsumersEnergy.com .\nCheck out Consumers Energy on Social Media\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/consumersenergymichigan\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/consumersenergy\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/consumersenergy\nFlickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/consumersenergy/\n releases/consumers-energy-encourages-customers-to-participate-in-new-community-solar-program-300163423.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DE33861&Transmission_Id=201510210600PR_NEWS_USPR_____DE33861&DateId=20151021", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.youtube.com/user/consumersenergy", "http://www.consumersenergy.com/", "https://twitter.com/consumersenergy", "http://www.consumersenergy.com/solargardens", "https://www.facebook.com/consumersenergymichigan", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/consumers-energy-encourages-customers-to-participate-in-new-community-solar-program-300163423.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:23:19.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
