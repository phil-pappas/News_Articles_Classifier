When my wife was training a 100hr week was a good week. I remember one \"shift\" that began 9.00am Friday through to 5.00pm Monday. No sleep and then another full week with waking on call. Nobody, not involved in medicine, would believe the workload. Things have improved a bit since the early '90's but Hunt is trying to turn to clock back to those days. Would you guys who refused to sign really be happy to have your loved ones treated by a Junior who had not slept for three days. A Junior is a Junior until they become a Consultant (if they do) in their 30's. When my wife was training her basic pay for 40 hours was bad, the next 50 were paid less than hospital cleaners, and the rest were not paid at all.Sign or don't sign, but don't cry when the same privatised service increases admin costs massively (see US experience) which will be picked up by you the patient. There are problems in the NHS, largely due to mediocre management, political interference and underfunding. As a nation we invest less than the EU average in our health service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:51:10.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
