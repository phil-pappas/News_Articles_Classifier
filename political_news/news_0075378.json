The Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed Trump leading in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, while Biden and Carson are the best general election candidates in the three swing states. Clinton remains in the lead among Democrats, but is losing ground.Quinnipiac University polled the three states because since 1960 no candidate has been able to win the White House within winning at least two of the states.In Pennsylvania, Trump has 23 percent of the vote, down from 24 percent compared to August, the poll found. Carson is second with 17 percent and Rubio in third with 12 percent.Among Pennsylvania Democrats, Clinton dropped to 36 percent from her 45 percent in August, with Biden at 25 percent and Bernie Sanders at 19 percent. Ten percent of Democrat voters, however, remained undecided, according to the recent poll.Fifty-four percent gave Clinton an unfavorable rating, with 61 percent saying she is not honest. Trump was viewed by 56 percent of voters as unfavorable and 54 percent say he is not honest and trustworthy.Quinnipiac University polled 1,049 PA voters with a +/- 3 percent margin of error. The survey included 427 Republicans and 442 Democrats, both with a +/- 4.7 margin of error.
