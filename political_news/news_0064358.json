It’s similar to his guns and bibles comment years ago. That one word is very damaging in the sound bite blogosphere.\nThis is the question he asked Robinson:\n“How do you reconcile the idea of faith being really important to you and you caring a lot about taking faith seriously with the fact that, at least in our democracy and our civic discourse, it seems as if folks who take religion the most seriously sometimes are also those who are suspicious of those not like them?” Obama asked during the interview, which was published Monday in the New York Review of Books.\nRobinson replied that those “turning in on themselves — and God knows, arming themselves” against an “imagined other,” are not “taking their Christianity seriously.”\nBig Government Obama is labeling religious people – especially Christians obviously – as “suspicious.” Throwing doubts on religious people, Christians, anti-illegal immigration proponents and promoting his dangerous Big Government agenda all in one paragraph demonstrates more of the slippery handling of reality he has engaged in for nearly seven years.\nHe wants them all discredited.\nObama said Americans take the nation’s remarkable achievements for granted, a mindset that fuels deep skepticism of government. In other words, he is denigrating limited government people, painting them as the radicals when he is the radical.\n“Whenever I hear people saying that our problems would be solved without government, I always want to tell them you need to go to some other countries where there really is no government, where the roads are never repaired … or kids don’t have access to basic primary education,” he said. “That’s the logical conclusion if, in fact, you think that government is the enemy.”\nWhat the hay is he talking about? No one is demanding “no government”, people are complaining about his lawless government and his refusal to follow the rule of law.\nThe president added that it’s natural to be suspicious of government “as a tool of oppression” but “it can also be paralyzing when we’re trying to do big things together.”\nTogether? Is he kidding?\nAt the National Prayer Breakfast in February, Obama was able to attack Christians and tie them in with racism in one creative sentence. “In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ,” Obama outrageously claimed.\nObama has also blamed Christians for the Crusades and told them to get “off their high horse” while pretending he is somehow above the fray and superior morally.\n“Humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout human history. Unless we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ. In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ,” the president said.\nWeren’t radical Islamists also involved in this long war?\nFor Easter, he bashed “less than loving” Christians.\n“On Easter, I do reflect on the fact that as a Christian, I am supposed to love. And I have to say that sometimes when I listen to less than loving expressions by Christians, I get concerned. But that’s a topic for another day.” The audience responded with laughter and applause. “Where there is injustice,” the president continued, “I was about to veer off.” The crowd laughed. “I’m pulling it back,” he said.\nWhen will he say radical Islamists are less than loving in the name of Mohammed? He won’t even call them by name, he calls them a death cult. Obama has ignored Christian genocide throughout the world. He never responds to it and when the Oregon shooter made his victims tell him if they were Christians or not before shooting them, Obama made no mention of it and deflected attention to his gun agenda.\nOnce he gets rid of the Christians, his Socialist agenda can move forward. It’s not only Christians he is attacking, he is attacking anyone who remotely supports traditional America.\nSource: the hill", "external_links": ["http://www2.nybooks.com/articles/s3/2015/nov/05/president-obama-marilynne-robinson-conversation.html", "http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/256685-obama-those-taking-religion-seriously-are-often-suspicious-of-others"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:14:52.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
