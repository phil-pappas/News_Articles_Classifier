It is the DCE that champions developmental projects in the district. In our case, we don't have one; and our developments are at a standstill,”- said Prince Fiagadzi, one of the assembly members. \nThe Assembly members have pledged to approve who so ever the President shall nominate, regardless of where the nominee hails from. \n“We the assembly members are ready to approve the nominee whether he comes from the district or not,” -said Prince Fiagadzi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:43:05.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
