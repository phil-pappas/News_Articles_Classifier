(Mike Blake/Reuters) October 22 at 5:55 PM The Oct. 18 editorial “ Time off that works ” rightly argued that all U.S. workers deserve guaranteed paid leave to address a serious health condition or to care for a family member or new child. Unfortunately, the editorial misrepresented my bill, the Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act, or Family Act.\nThe implication that wealthy people would disproportionately benefit is false.
