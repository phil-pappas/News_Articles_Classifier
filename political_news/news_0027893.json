KPNX Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio (Photo: 12 News) \nPREVIOUS : Arpaio continue testimony in court \nArpaio was questioned more than a dozen times about whether he remembered his attorney's advice on how to obey a a federal judge's order to stop enforcing federal immigration law. \nThe sheriff's answers ranged from \"I don't recall,\" used several times, to \"I don't understand sometimes what lawyers say and their legal terms.\" \nLast week, former Arpaio attorney Tim Casey testified that he told Arpaio he couldn't turn illegal immigrants over to anyone -- he could either arrest them or release them. \nArpaio came up with a so-called \"backup plan\" of dropping off illegal immigrants with the Border Patrol. \nThe sheriff faces potential criminal contempt charges for ignoring that court order and others stemming from his 8-year-old racial-profiling case in federal court. \nMORE : MCSO employee: Arpaio pet project was \"odd\" \nArpaio has already admitted to disobeying the judge's orders. The question before Federal Judge G. Murray Snow is whether he did it intentionally. If that's the case, the sheriff could face criminal contempt charges. \nAlso Thursday, Arpaio again denied the most explosive revelations during the contempt hearings -- that Arpaio investigated Judge Snow. \nCourt testimony and documents suggest Arpaio used a reputed con artist named Dennis Montgomery to get information that could toss Snow off the case. \nArpaio's attorney, John Masterson, quoted the sheriff Thursday as having said, \"Even the worst guys come up with the best information.\" \nBut Arpaio testified that he believed Montgomery's information showed the U.S. Department of Justice or the CIA was tapping his phone as well as others' phones. He also said it showed activity related to identity. \nUnder questioning by Masterson, Arpaio repeatedly denied he had ordered any subordinates to investigate the judge. \nThe hearings resume Friday morning and then next Tuesday and Wednesday. Snow said he hoped to wrap up the hearings by the end of the month.  //12ne.ws/1Rx6G2a TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:32:29.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
