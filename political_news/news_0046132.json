I said that the younger Jim Webb’s defense of his father’s comments in the debate was an apt puncturing of America’s chickenhawk mentality. This reader says:\nThe reason the young Webb needs to be put over somebody's knee is that his op-ed is the kind of ridiculous huffy how-dare-you bullshit that military officers produce like crap these days.  I challenge this douchebag to produce one civilian who talks as if his time in the Marine infantry was just a jaunt in the sand. There's almost none of that being said out there.\nOn the contrary, there's vastly too much hero-worship and deference to the military, and lack of willingness to criticize.  You go out in a uniform and decent people come up to you and thank you and try to give you discounts and stuff, and fat little kids bang out half-assed salutes with solemn faces, and it's embarrassing as hell but you try to respect them.   That is the experience military have with ordinary Americans nine-tenths of the time.\nSo for Webb to pull out the idea that people are laughing at his father because they don't respect his service experiences, is naked dishonesty from a boob trying to sell you something.  This kid is trying to breed chickenhawks.  The Senator gave a dumb answer at the wrong time, people are laughing at it, and that's all that is.  Pulling out the military honor card at that, is the action of an ass.\nAfter the jump, a contrary view of Webb and his implications.\nA reader on the East Coast, who supports Bernie Sanders and is in his early 20s, explains what he also likes Jim Webb: \nI want to share my opinion on Jim Webb, because I've come under a lot of fire recently for my views (no grenade story pun intended). Like the majority of white, upper middle class, liberal arts college students/recent ex-students I associate myself with,\nI consider myself to be pretty darn liberal. I donated $50 of my graduation gift money, which is unfortunately still a decent chunk of change for me at this stage of my post-graduate life, to Bernie Sanders' nascent campaign back in May. I've been fired up that Bernie has been speaking my language ever since he jumped in the race in April, long before the rise of the \"Bernie-bro\".\nAnd yet, I love Jim Webb.\nI try to tell this to people my age who usually align pretty closely with my political views. And they respond with either laughter, shock, or disgust. The laughter I can understand, as their only experience with Webb is the not-so-hot debate performance last week. The shock I can get because Mr. Webb is clearly out of step with my usual feel-the-Bern liberal nature. The disgust, however, I find appalling and disturbing.\nIt's one thing to realize that Mr. Webb faces a steep climb to the Presidency, and that's probably the most generous thing I could say about his odds of winning. But it's a wholly different to reject a man's presence in the Democratic primary, especially after us Democrats spent an entire summer laughing off the presence of Trump, Carson, Huckabee, Santorum, etc etc in Republican field… I'm saying that Webb is analogous to John Kasich, in the sense that people say Kasich stands no chance because of how sane he sounds on stage next to everyone else.\nAgain, I love Bernie. And I don't think one can fairly compare him to Mr. Trump. But you have to admit, their insurgencies do reflect how bitterly polarized our country is right now. As does the chaos in the House leadership vacuum. And I think same for the fact that there's no clear mandate for Biden to jump in, despite the fact that he's the VP for a scandal-free President with 50+% approval rating and an improving economy.\nInstead, both parties rush to the ideological extremes of their party spectrum and demand sweeping, fundamental change, and they demand it NOW before its too late….\nWhat's concerning for me, and what I'm struggling to clearly express to my liberal friends, is that our country is far too politically polarized for me to feel confident that the best way for the modern progressive movement to move the country forward is by having Bernie occupying the the presidency right now and being the leader of a bitterly divided country. If Republicans can obstruct a President's agenda solely because he's black, you better believe they're going to obstruct a socialist's agenda…. I'm unenthused by a Clinton presidency because of her willingness to ride the Democratic base of identity-driven liberals to the White House without any desire to unify the American people....\nI worry about this current progressive movement because I don't think we are united behind a coherent brand of populism. And the rejection of Jim Webb proves that to me. Jim Webb IS an economic populist. He IS a leader who wants to unify the country. He unequivocally wants , to put it in Hillary-speak, to \"even the odds\" for downtrodden Americans.\nHe simply wants to do it for people who typically fall into Republican constituencies as well. Just like John Kasich expanded Medicare for people of color and the disabled, people who fall into the modern Democratic constituency. How ridiculous is it that those are the reasons they're being discredited as candidates in this election cycle?\nWhen I told a group of liberals my age this past weekend that I respect Jim Webb's presence in the primary despite my appreciation of the Sanders campaign, the response was alarming. One kid said \"I will only vote for a candidate who centralizes race (as in the plight of Americans of color) in his or her platform.\"…  Another responded with, \"Well, I don't want those people in my party anyway.\" I told them they sound like the Republicans we love to laugh at. And the debate ended there.\nThe exchange and my further reflection on Webb's candidacy made me realize something: we deserve to have Donald Trump as our president. If people on both sides want to ignore voices of reason, moderation, and pragmatism in the face of ugly polarization, then we deserve to have someone like Trump force his way into the vacuum we are creating for ourselves. A Trump victory would prove that the main problems aren't necessarily the big banks, Citizens United, corporate media, the gays, the NRA, abortions, religion, Fox News, ISIS, George Bush or Barack Obama - the problem is ourselves and our utterly hypocritical patriotism.\nWe love America, but not the guy on the other side of the aisle. We love America, but not the guy in my own party who wants to compromise and win more voters than merely the core base at which we throw red meat political rhetoric. We love America, but not the liberal intellectual elites. We love America, but not the rural rednecks who think homosexuality and abortion are sins.\nIt's infuriating because I genuinely believe its going to take a legitimate crisis for our country to unify again, to actually genuinely love America for what it is and for who we are again. And the problem is, I'm not sure which crisis I'm more scared of - an attack similar to or worse than 9/11, or a Donald Trump presidency….\nMore Notes From The Atlantic Not a Single Care in the World Oct 20, 2015 Quoted Oct 20, 2015 Who Owns the Copyright on 1921?

And what people are forced to do is go to payday lenders who charge outrageously high interest rates. You go to check-cashing places, which rip you off.

Spencer Kornhaber and David Sims A discussion about the new Star Wars trailer’s throwback imagery, its seemingly chaotic worldview, and the surprising neo-conservative approval for the Galactic Empire\nOn Monday the new trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens dropped, and predictably, the Internet freaked out. There was a mad rush to buy tickets ; wild fan theories emerged on just what might be up with the conspicuously absent Luke Skywalker ; and perhaps more surprisingly, Bill Kristol offered a neo-conservative defense of the Galactic Empire . Fevers are running high as the film’s December 18 U.S. release date draws ever-closer, but there’s still so much we don’t know. Including this question: How original can the movie actually be? \n\r \r David Sims: Spencer, in your analysis of the trailer , you hit on the intense waves of nostalgia coming off The Force Awakens already . The chief villain, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), literally worships Death Vader’s melted helmet. Han Solo talks about the days of Jedi fighting the Dark Side like it’s ancient mythology. There’s all this chatter about the Death Star-like base glimpsed on the poster capable of blowing up whole solar systems. You’ve worried in the past that things look almost too familiar . But maybe that’s the meta-point J.J. Abrams is trying to make. Here’s a franchise inexorably scarred by George Lucas’s underwhelming prequel trilogy, ravaged by overuse of CGI, wooden acting, and those gosh-darn midi-chlorians. So might the only recipe for success be a return to that old-time religion? \n\r Continue Reading Alfaguarilla / Shutterstock The Sexism of School Dress Codes Li Zhou These policies can perpetuate discrimination against female students, as well as LGBT students.\nMaggie Sunseri was a middle-school student in Versailles, Kentucky, when she first noticed a major difference in the way her school’s dress code treated males and females. Girls were disciplined disproportionately, she says, a trend she’s seen continue over the years. At first Sunseri simply found this disparity unfair, but upon realizing administrators’ troubling rationale behind the dress code—that certain articles of girls’ attire should be prohibited because they “distract” boys—she decided to take action.\n\r \r “I’ve never seen a boy called out for his attire even though they also break the rules,” says Sunseri, who last summer produced S hame: A Documentary on School Dress Code , a film featuring interviews with dozens of her classmates and her school principal, that explores the negative impact biased rules can have on girls’ confidence and sense of self. The documentary now has tens of thousands of YouTube views, while a post about the dress-code policy at her high school—Woodford County High—has been circulated more than 45,000 times on the Internet.\n\r \r Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What Happened to Carly Fiorina? David A. Graham After she took the Republican field by storm in September, two polls show her slipping back into the second tier of candidates.\nRemember Carly Fiorina? It now seems forever ago, but in late September she was being heralded as the next big thing in the Republican primary field—the outsider candidate who could marshall establishment support, and finally slay the Trump dragon.\n\r \r Now look at the polls. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll Monday has her at 7 percent, running behind the much-maligned Jeb Bush. That’s down from 11 in late September . A CNN poll released Tuesday is even bleaker . She comes in fourth—tied with also-ran Chris Christie and behind Rand Paul, who’s on campaign deathwatch. That’s even worse than it seems, because in mid-September she was at 15 percent in the same poll, good for second place.\n\r \r \r Continue Reading Jeff Christensen / Reuters Trump Is Right About 9/11 Peter Beinart George W. Bush didn’t do all he could to prevent the attack—and it’s time Republicans confronted that fact.\nDonald Trump utters plenty of ugly untruths: that undocumented Mexican immigrants are “ rapists ,” that Syrian refugees are committing “ all sorts of attacks ” in Germany and represent a “Trojan Horse” for ISIS. But he tells ugly truths too: that “ when you give [politicians money], they do whatever the hell you want them to do .” And that “ the Middle East would be safer ” if Saddam Hussein and Muammer Qaddafi were still in power.\n\r \r His latest ugly truth came during a Bloomberg TV interview last Friday, when he said George W. Bush deserves responsibility for the fact that “the World Trade Center came down during his time.” Politicians and journalists erupted in indignation. Jeb Bush called Trump’s comments “pathetic.” Ben Carson dubbed them “ridiculous.”\n\r \r Continue Reading Patrick Kovarik / AFP / Getty Images The Dos and Don’ts of Cultural Appropriation Jenni Avins Borrowing from other cultures isn’t just inevitable, it’s potentially positive.\nSometime during the early 2000s, big, gold, “door-knocker” hoop earrings started to appeal to me, after I’d admired them on girls at school. It didn’t faze me that most of the girls who wore these earrings at my high school in St. Louis were black, unlike me. And while it certainly may have occurred to me that I—a semi-preppy dresser—couldn’t pull them off, it never occurred to me that I shouldn’t .\n\r \r \r This was before the term “cultural appropriation” jumped from academia into the realm of Internet outrage and oversensitivity. Self-appointed guardians of culture have proclaimed that Miley Cyrus shouldn’t twerk , white girls shouldn’t wear cornrows , and Selena Gomez should take off that bindi . Personally, I could happily live without ever seeing Cyrus twerk again, but I still find many of these accusations alarming.\n\r \r Continue Reading Christopher Griffith The Planet-Saving, Capitalism-Subverting, Surprisingly Lucrative Investment Secrets of Al Gore James Fallows The former vice president has led his firm to financial success. But what he really wants to do is create a whole new version of capitalism. \n“When i left the White House in 2001, I really didn’t know what I was going to do with my life,” Al Gore told me this summer, at his office in the Green Hills district of Nashville. “I’d had a plan”—this with a seemingly genuine chuckle rather than any sign of a grimace—“but … that changed!” After the “change,” via the drawn-out 2000 presidential election in which he won the vote of the populace but not that of the Supreme Court, for the first time in his adult life Gore found himself without an obvious next step. He was 52, two years younger than Barack Obama is now; he hadn’t worked outside the government in decades; and even if he managed to cope personally with a historically bitter disappointment that might have broken many people, he would still face the task of deciding how to spend the upcoming years.\n\r \r Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters The Anti-Free-Speech Movement at UCLA Conor Friedersdorf Administrators and student activists at the university are attacking core First Amendment rights in a bid to punish expression that offends them.\nA half-century ago, student activists at the University of California clashed with administrators during the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, a series of events that would greatly expand free-speech rights of people at public colleges and universities.\n\r \r Today, activists at UCLA are demanding that administrators punish some of their fellow students for expressive behavior that is clearly protected by the First Amendment.\n\r \r In the past, free-speech clashes have turned on whether Americans have the right to criticize their own government during wartime, to march as neo-Nazis past the homes of Holocaust survivors, to submerge a crucifix in urine, or to burn the United States flag. \n\r \r All of those things, the courts have ruled, are protected speech.\n\r \r Continue Reading Stephanie Keith / Reuters The NYPD Is Using Mobile X-Ray Vans to Spy on Unknown Targets Conor Friedersdorf New York City won’t reveal how often cops bombard places, vehicles, or people with radiation—or if there are health risks for residents.\nDystopian truth is stranger than dystopian fiction.\n\r \r In New York City, the police now maintain an unknown number of military-grade vans outfitted with X-ray radiation, enabling cops to look through the walls of buildings or the sides of trucks. The technology was used in Afghanistan before being loosed on U.S. streets. Each X-ray van costs an estimated $729,000 to $825,000.\n\r \r The NYPD will not reveal when, where, or how often they are used.\n\r \r “ I will not talk about anything at all about this,” New York Police Commissioner Bill Bratton told a journalist for the New York Post who pressed for details on the vans. “It falls into the range of security and counter-terrorism activity that we engage in.” \n\r \r He added that “they’re not used to scan people for weapons.” \n\r \r Continue Reading Andrew Harnik / AP Paul Ryan Makes His Move for Speaker Russell Berman It comes with a big caveat: He must have total support from Republicans.\nPaul Ryan will bow to the growing Republican calls that he run for House speaker—but only on one big condition.\n\r \r The 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee on Tuesday night told House Republicans in a private meeting that he would agree to serve only if he has near-unanimous support from the party. It’s an important condition given the rebellious nature of the GOP conference, in which a few dozen of its most conservative members have demanded significant concessions in exchange for their support.\n\r \r “I’ll leave it up to my colleagues to decide if I am that unifying person,” Ryan told reporters after the meeting.\n\r \r Ryan, 45, has previously insisted he had little interest in serving as speaker and that he preferred to stay in his current job atop the House Ways and Means Committee. But after the resignation of John Boehner and the sudden withdrawal of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Republican leaders and rank-and-file lawmakers from across the country have virtually begged him to change his mind. Boehner was among them, and he made his case for Ryan ’s leadership in an appearance on Fox News just before the party meeting in the Capitol. He even drew support from Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who reasoned that a Republican with Ryan’s clout and willingness to deal would be the best they could hope for in the speaker’s chair. \n\r \r Continue Reading Latest Notes Not a Single Care in the World Quoted Who Owns the Copyright on 1921?
