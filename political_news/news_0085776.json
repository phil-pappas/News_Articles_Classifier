Masses of Pyongyang citizens have for weeks been out in public plazas across the city practicing their roles for a torchlight parade in the evening.\nFor the finale, a stage has been set up on a river running through central Pyongyang for a late-night concert featuring North Korea's most popular musical group, the all-female Moranbong Band. Tickets for foreigners hoping to attend the concert were going for 100 euros ($114) a pop.\nThe spectacle promises to be the most elaborate since Kim assumed power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011, and the satellite imagery suggests the military parade could be the country's biggest ever.\nIt's not known if Kim himself will speak at any of the day's events.\nKim has yet to make a state visit abroad and although his visits to various farms and factories around the country are featured daily on North Korean news broadcasts, he rarely speaks at public events.\nThough military parades were out of fashion until about a decade ago, North Korea's leadership often uses anniversaries to rally the nation behind the military or the party, while at the same time reinforcing the primacy of the leader himself.\nOn Friday, senior state officials led a mass gathering in Pyongyang singing the praises of the party and the leader.\nAlso on Friday, Kim met with the Chinese delegation led by Liu Yunshan, the Communist Party's No. 5 leader, where Liu delivered a message by Chinese President Xi Jinping, KCNA said.\nChina's official Xinhua News Agency reported that Liu told Kim that China was willing to work with North Korea for a quick resumption of six-party nuclear talks. The talks, which aim to end the North's nuclear program and also involve the U.S., South Korea, Russia and Japan, stalled seven years ago.\nSome foreign analysts believe the particularly strong emphasis this year on making the anniversary of the party's foundation such a lavish fete is a sign that Kim is trying to build up his own stature along with that of the party relative to the military.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:30:25.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
