Trump took 28 percent, followed by 23 percent for Carson. Trump's numbers are statistically unchanged from the last NBC survey in which he took 29 percent. But it's a 9-point jump for Carson, who placed second with 14 percent in the September poll.\nAmong white evangelicals, Carson prevailed over Trump 33 percent to 23 percent, a reversal from the previous month, when Trump led 25 percent to 20 percent. The gap is also narrowing between the two among those who identify as very conservative. In September, Trump drew 24 percent to Carson's 16 percent, but this time around, Trump had a smaller lead, at 28 percent to 25 percent.\nCarson's gain of 9 points comes as former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina experiences a 5-point drop from last month's survey, when she was riding high in third place after a well-received debate performance.\nHillary Clinton has whopping $33 million in cash By Gabriel Debenedetti\nFollowing Carson are Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (9 percent, up 2 points), Fiorina (6 percent, down 5 points), Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (6 percent, down 1 point), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (5 percent, down 3 points), former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (3 percent, up 1 point), Ohio Gov. John Kasich (3 percent, up 1 point), New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (2 percent, down 1 point) and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (2 percent, down 1 point). Other candidates drew less than that, with 7 percent who would not vote or do not know for whom they would cast their ballot.\nThe poll was conducted online by SurveyMonkey from Oct. 13-15, surveying 1,881 registered Republican voters or those who lean Republican. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.scribd.com/doc/285352517/NBC-SurveyMonkey-methodology"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:16:21.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
