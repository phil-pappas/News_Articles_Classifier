The Ifoghas clan is in the main separatist group. The Imghad clan is a part of the government-allied militia group GATIA.\nThe two clans have clashed several times since the initial accord was signed between the government, separatists and government-allied groups in late June.\nAg Mohamed said the recent accord is among several others being worked on among smaller groups which the government is also helping to negotiate.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
