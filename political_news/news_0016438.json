Over the next two years, we intend to diversify LawCast into numerous practice areas of law, such as civil and criminal litigation, intellectual property law, tax law, and basically every other legal specialty in existence.\"\nIn its current form, LawCast features news segments with a runtime of five to eight minutes. One particular segment, \" E*Trade Capital Markets Violation ,\" aired on November 6, 2014 and went viral. To date, it is one of the most popular LawCast episodes.\n\"I watched the E*Trade installment of LawCast and thought it was great,\" said Lenny Sokolow , securities industry veteran. \"I was already familiar with the E*Trade story, but this was the first time it was summed up so succinctly.\"\nLegal & Compliance, LLC focuses on going public transactions, complex corporate transactions and ongoing legal support for both private and public companies.
