Companies may be more likely to give you a raise in the form of richer benefits than higher pay, because it’s a better value. And the federal government spends a lot more money, in the form of lost taxes, to help rich people buy health insurance than it does to help middle-income people.\nWhen you ask economists to name their least favorite part of our health care system, the employer tax exclusion comes up a lot.\n Jeb Bush Offers Health Plan That Would Undo Affordable Care Act OCT. 13, 2015 Health Policy: The Cadillac Tax: Why Economists, but Few Others, Love It OCT. 5, 2015 Health Care Tax Faces United Opposition From Labor and Employers JULY 21, 2015 Buried in Obamacare is a provision meant to reverse some of those weird incentives: The so-called Cadillac tax would tax expensive employer health plans, making spending above a certain threshold more like ordinary wages. The idea is to reshape the kind of insurance that employers offer, and to drive down the overall cost of health care, as my colleague Josh Barro wrote recently . But many people who are not health economists hate this idea , because it means they end up with either higher taxes or less generous insurance.\nPhoto Jeb Bush is promising to repeal Obamacare. But there’s one thing he would keep: a way to tax high-cost health plans. Credit Jeff Swensen for The New York Times This idea has a new and somewhat surprising defender: Jeb Bush. In recent weeks, Democratic presidential candidates have been lining up to reject this Obamacare provision. Both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Rodham Clinton have promised they would repeal it if elected.\nIn a new health care proposal released Tuesday , Mr. Bush promised to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act. But there’s one thing he would restore: a provision to tax high-cost health plans.\nThe details are slightly different from those of Obamacare. Starting in 2018, the Affordable Care Act imposes a 40 percent tax on any health benefits costing more than $10,200 for an individual, and $27,500 for a family. The Bush plan would simply impose normal payroll and income taxes on plans that cost more than $12,000 for individuals and $30,000 for families. But the effect would be close to the same: pushing employers to offer less expensive health plans by taxing them like wages.\nMr. Bush (and Marco Rubio, who has a similar proposal ) argues that replacing the tax exclusion with a universal tax credit to help uninsured people buy their own coverage is a fairer and more efficient way to give benefits: It will mean that people who don’t get insurance from work can still get tax incentives when they buy health plans. Mr. Bush argues that the current exclusion encourages people to buy more generous health plans than they really need. The economists will nod along with this thinking.\nBut the reason the employer tax exclusion has survived all these years is that it’s a broad benefit that is very popular among voters. Those health plans that politicians and economists call too rich are the ones that let many people with employer coverage get medical care without huge out-of-pocket costs or strict limits on what doctors or hospitals they can use. In 2008, John McCain’s presidential campaign proposed eliminating the employer tax exclusion altogether; it was not a crowd pleaser.\nThat’s why Republicans in Congress have consistently pointed to the Cadillac tax as one of Obamacare’s more problematic features. Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter to the White House this year calling the provision a “draconian policy.” Legislation to repeal it was recently introduced in the Senate by Republicans.\nThe political risks of the policy reflect the ways that costs in the health care system are often hidden. In a world without the tax exclusion, economists argue, people would have fewer dollars in health benefits and more in wages. More of their health care spending might be in cash, but the overall level might actually go down.\nGetting to that economic utopia, however, would require changing the health insurance arrangements of people most satisfied with the current system and most skeptical of any health reform. Mr. Bush may need to do some work to convince members of his own party that the Cadillac tax has merit.", "external_links": ["http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-brown-and-senate-democrats-introduce-bill-to-stop-cadillac-tax", "https://jeb2016.com/backgrounder-health-care-plan/", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/13/upshot/14UP-Tax/14UP-Tax-superJumbo.jpg", "http://nyti.ms/1LsjZQy", "http://kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-september-2015/", "https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/2045/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22cadillac+tax%22%5D%7D&resultIndex=1", "http://www.finance.senate.gov/newsroom/chairman/release/?id=ece23ba9-5a46-43c2-b469-7f7b248e3cf5", "http://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/cadillac_tax_letter.pdf", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/06/upshot/06UP-Cadillac/06UP-Cadillac-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/13/upshot/14UP-Tax/14UP-Tax-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/21/business/21healthtax-web1/21healthtax-web1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/14/us/14health/14health-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:55:13.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
