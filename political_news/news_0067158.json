Republicans have pushed the measure in the wake of a scandal over chronic delays for veterans seeking medical care and falsified records covering up the waits. \nDemocrats blocked his effort. \nRubio cast a vote Tuesday on legislation that would crack down on cities that shield residents from federal immigration authorities — the first vote he has made since Sept. 24, according to the Senate's website. In the end, Senate Democrats blocked the bill. \nThe Florida senator has missed more votes than any of the other senators competing for the GOP nomination — Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. His rivals have made it an issue in the campaign. \nRubio missed a key vote on defunding Planned Parenthood last month, campaigning at a Florida retirement community. After calling out the Obama administration for not doing more to free Americans held in Iran, he skipped voting on a Senate resolution demanding the Americans' release and went to a fundraiser instead. \nRubio has said he hasn't missed any votes where the outcome would have been changed had he been present. His argument is that no progress can be made in Washington until Republicans retake the White House. \nAnd he's hardly the first senator to miss votes while on the presidential campaign trail. Graham missed the immigration vote Tuesday. \nRubio took advantage of his brief time in the Senate to argue for the veterans' bill, saying Veterans Administration officials who were doing their jobs would be better served by the legislation. \n\"It isn't fair to them that there are people on the payroll taking up seats, taking up slots, taking up money and taking up time that aren't doing their jobs and they literally cannot be fired,\" Rubio said.
