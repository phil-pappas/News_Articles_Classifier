It’s incredible. CNN puts us at 27%. In New Hampshire we are at 28% – over a dozen points ahead of 2nd place. We are beating everyone – even in their home states.\nWe are gaining momentum and gaining support. 8,000 people came to Anderson, SC to hear our message. It broke the all time venue record. The crowd was incredible – veterans, students, parents, and great Americans from every kind of background joined us.\nAttendees in Anderson, SC\nTomorrow evening I’ll be at the Burlington Memorial Auditorium in Iowa.
