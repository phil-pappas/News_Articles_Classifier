But when, on Wednesday evening’s Channel 4 news, I asked Richard Burgon what the UK deficit was set to be this year , the real shadow economic secretary to the Treasury found that the numbers eluded him. “Well…” he began. \nHis mouth started to move but no words emerged. “I’m not an economic… erm…,” he finally ventured, before remembering his full title . As he paused, I could sense the cogs turning furiously before he settled on: “I’m not somebody that’s going to put a figure in a crystal ball of what exactly the deficit is going to be at the end of the year.” No crystal ball was required, of course. The figures are in the official Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts – something perhaps he might have been expected to read up on since being appointed last month. \n“Car crash” political interviews can make for compelling viewing. Voters have long wearied of soundbites, so anything that forces an MP off the script is always going to be more interesting. So it was with Jeremy Paxman’s humiliating encounter with Chloe Smith , the junior Treasury minister who found herself unable to answer simple questions about her boss’s deferral of the fuel duty rise. There was a certain amount of sympathy for Ms Smith, with one Conservative MP reflecting that it was like sending a lamb to the slaughter. \nPaxo admitted afterwards that he’d wrecked her ministerial career. Should he have held back? Believe me, it’s not always easy judging the tone right on the other side of a car-crash interview. But it is a dereliction of duty to go easy on a Minister of the Crown. \nYou certainly can’t blame Nick Ferrari for quietly tormenting the Green Party leader, Natalie Bennett , whose “brain fade” interview on LBC Radio earlier this year degenerated into coughs and splutters when she hadn’t the first idea how to cost her party’s housing policy. Mr Ferrari was persistent but always courteous – devastatingly so. An iron fist in a velvet glove allowed him to press the point, without losing the sympathy of his listeners. \nThat was the same technique used by Eddie Mair when he accused Boris Johnson, ever so politely, of being “a nasty piece of work”. The London mayor doesn’t use a car if he can help it, so let’s call it a bicycle-crash interview. Either way it was impossible not to watch, even if you ended up squirming in embarrassment. \nI knew Mr Burgon was starting to struggle when I noticed him at one point apparently wiping something out of his eye. It’s what a poker player might call a “tell”. The fictitious Ben Swain on The Thick of It betrayed his own discomfort when he started puffing and blinking furiously during his own innumerate answers. \nThat’s when your natural empathy for an interviewee – a reluctance to feed a clearly floundering fellow human being into the mincer – collides with a professional duty to slice through the pre-spun answers to the unvarnished truth. \nSo I pressed on. \nI look forward to inviting Mr Burgon back into the Channel 4 News studio. Next time, no doubt, he’ll be able to give me deficit statistics – to the last decimal place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:07:09.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
