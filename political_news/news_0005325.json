(NYSE: VOYA), announced today that it has awarded the first in a series of scholarships to help veterans and their spouses further a career in financial services. The scholarships, which are awarded through The American College of Financial Services , are available to all qualified applicants but have a specific focus on helping to advance diversity in this field.\nGraziella Panetta , a financial counselor for military families, is the first to receive the Voya scholarship, and will pursue the college's Certified Financial Planner® (CFP®) and Chartered Financial Consultant® (ChFC®) designation programs. The scholarships are funded through Voya Foundation, the charitable giving arm of Voya Financial.\n\"Through this grant, Voya reinforces the importance of financial literacy, one of the foundation's giving priorities.

She shares Voya's commitment to educating and helping clients establish a secure financial future.\"\n\"The American College is thrilled to partner with Voya in supporting veterans, active duty personnel, and their spouses in education and second-career opportunities,\" said Ted Digges , executive director of The American College Penn Mutual Center for Veterans Affairs. \"These scholars represent a bright and fresh infusion of talent possessing unique soft skills and a sense of service that translate very well into the financial services industry.\"\nPanetta teaches financial readiness classes and provides one-on-one counseling at the Military and Family Support Center (MFSC) for Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii .
