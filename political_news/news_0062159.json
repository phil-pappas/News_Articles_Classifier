Teens who were prescribed antibiotics seven or more times during their childhood weighed about three pounds more compared to those who weren't.\nBy Samantha Costa Oct. 22, 2015 | 11:00 a.m. EDT + More Antibiotics are great for nipping that nasty infection in the bud. However, new research published this week in the International Journal of Obesity suggests that the bacteria-battling medicines may also influence childhood weight gain .\n\"Your BMI may be forever altered by the antibiotics you take as a child,\" Dr. Brian S. Schwartz, study leader and professor of environmental health sciences at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in a press release . \"Our data suggest that every time we give an antibiotic to kids they gain weight faster over time.\"\nSchwartz and other researchers looked at the electronic health records of 163,820 children ages 3 to 18 treated at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania, between January 2001 and February 2012.\nBy age 15, children who were given antibiotics seven or more times during their childhood weighed about 3 pounds more than children who didn't take antibiotics. The researchers also found that 21 percent of the children in the study were indeed prescribed seven or more antibiotics during childhood.\n\"While the magnitude of the weight increase attributable to antibiotics may be modest by the end of childhood, our finding that the effects are cumulative raises the possibility that these effects continue and are compounded into adulthood,\" Schwartz said in the release.\nThe largest weight gain was associated with macrolides, a class of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections . Common generic names for these medications include erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin.\n\"Systematic antibiotics should be avoided except when strongly indicated,\" Schwartz said in the release. \"From everything we are learning, it is more important than ever for physicians to be the gatekeepers and keep their young patients from getting drugs that not only won't help them but may hurt them in the long run.\"\nParents' Questions About Vaccines: Answered\nWhen Your Child Has Obesity: How to Tackle Weight Loss as a Family\nTAGS: obesity children's health antibiotics", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefwu1%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefwu1%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/vaop/naam/abs/ijo2015218a.html", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefwu1%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Antibiotics%20May%20Influence%20Childhood%20Weight%20Gain", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefwu1%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Antibiotics%20May%20Influence%20Childhood%20Weight%20Gain", "http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2015/children-who-take-antibiotics-gain-weight-faster-than-kids-who-dont.t.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefwu1%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefwu1%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Antibiotics%20May%20Influence%20Childhood%20Weight%20Gain&summary=Researchers%20blame%20excessive%20antibiotic%20use.&source=U.%20S.%20News"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:05:06.161+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
