However, neither Russert nor Snell knew of Dorman's employer, or what his name even was, when they commented on his exchange with Pelosi. Yet, they both responded by assuming he was either a conservative or just some anonymous protester.\n  With GOP split, Pelosi wields power on budget Republicans control majorities in the House and Senate, but Pelosi may matter most in the budget talks.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/02/15 12:01 AM Dorman asked Pelosi, \"Is an unborn baby with a human heart and human liver a human being?\"\n\"Why don't you take your ideological questions … I don't know who you are, and you're welcome to be here and freedom of this press,\" the California congresswoman responded.\nThe CNS reporter continued, pressing Pelosi to explain \"what species\" is a fetus.\n\"I am a devout, practicing Catholic. A mother of five children. When my baby was born, my first child, my oldest child, was six years old. I think I know more about this subject than you, with all due respect,\" she said.\nPelosi's non-answer comes at a time when Republican and Democratic lawmakers are battling over whether Planned Parenthood should be stripped of its federal funding. Democrats, most especially Pelosi, have vigorously opposed all such efforts.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Defiant Paul says he can still grow GOP \"I want people to know that I'm a different kind of Republican.\"\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/02/15 12:01 AM Top  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:33:53.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
