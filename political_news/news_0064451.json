So the Bunso-Koforidua road is one of the roads I promised to construct and it is under the cocoa road projects,' he said. \nThe Chief of Kukurantumi, Daasebre Boamah Darko, on his part, thanked President Mahama for cutting sod for the Bunso road and encouraged him to continue with the good work. \nThe chief further assured President John Mahama of victory in 2016 for doing a good job during his tenure. \nFROM Daniel Bampoe, Akyem - Kukurantumi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:33:38.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
