The additional operators are expected to start next month, when another class of five to 10 operators will begin training. \nRawlings-Blake has said adding operators will address what she sees as the biggest problem facing the system, a 20 percent increase in the number of emergency calls. The call volume is a result of surging violence in recent months. \nOversight of the 911 was system was shifted to the information technology office in what was billed as an efficiency measure, under a plan to create a centralized emergency operations command center. \nBut Libit said that transition was never fully implemented. Fire dispatchers have remained in the Fire Department while police dispatchers and all 911 operators, or call takers, were moved to the information technology office. The operators are the ones who interact directly with the public while the dispatchers communicate directly with police officers and firefighters. \n\"The staffing shortages with 911 call takes has exacerbated some of the issues,\" Libit said. \"It's forced us to focus on it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:26:45.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
