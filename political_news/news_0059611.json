First, Clinton will likely increase her lead: In our latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Clinton's lead over Sanders was 20 points with Biden in the race, but 25 points when Biden was left out. Also in the same poll, just 30 percent of Democrats said they wanted Biden to run, while 38 percent said they would prefer if he stayed out of the race. Interestingly, the *only* group who were a net positive on that question were non-white voters -- a group that, at least so far, Clinton is winning with flying colors.\nAnd/but: In some ways, Biden's move - just a day before Clinton's Benghazi testimony on Capitol Hill - makes the stakes for Clinton that much higher in the short term. Now that her chances of getting the general election nod have gone up, her performance at the hearing will be seen as a key indicator about whether she can assuage independents' concerns and not be saddled with the controversy well into next year. If she does well, Clinton will have had nearly the best October possible for the secretary of state - between Biden's exit, her strong debate performance and a not-insignificant boost in the polls. But if she has a bad performance, expect a new round of commentary and Democratic handwringing that maybe Joe Biden made a mistake.\nadvertisement POPPING ON NBC POLITICS\nThe vice president made it official on Wednesday, announcing in the Rose Garden that he will not run for president in 2016, one of us(!) wrote. A major factor in that decision was Clinton's decisive victory in the so-called invisible primary, NBC's Perry Bacon notes. NBC's Leigh Ann Caldwell rounds up reaction to Biden's decision from the 2016 field. If Republican presidential candidates were cartoon characters, who would they be?
