Ted Cruz, R-Texas, introduced legislation Tuesday asking the State Department to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization, and to explain in testimony to Congress why if it decides against making that designation.\nSimilar legislation was introduced in the House by Congressman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\"For more than three decades, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has been a leading proponent of radical Islamic terrorism around the globe,\" Sen. Cruz said in a release.\n\"The IRGC is connected to multiple terrorist attacks killing American military personnel and our allies, including the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, the 1994 attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, and the bombings of the U.S. Embassy … in Beirut in 1983 and 1984,\" the release said.\n  White House claim: We've got Putin right where we want him \"Right now [Russia's]   south.\"\nBy Charles Hoskinson • 10/01/15 12:01 AM The timing of the bill is motivated by the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran. Though that deal unwinds sanctions on Iran related to nuclear proliferation, legislators like Cruz and McCaul want to ensure continued pressure on Iran in the areas of terrorism and human rights, said McCaul's legislative director Andy Taylor.\nIran is officially still listed as a state sponsor of terror along with Syria and Sudan, and will remain so after the nuclear deal is implemented. But the IRGC has escaped being designated as an foreign terrorist organization.\n\"The president claims that sanctions against Iran for its support for terrorism will continue to be enforced in spite of his deal to lift sanctions on the Ayatollah's nuclear program,\" McCaul said in a release. \"Designating Iran's IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization would go a long way in demonstrating that the President is truly committed to combatting Iranian terror.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:30:52.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
