So if the Bergdahl ( Bowe Bergdahl deserted, pervert father stalks twins ) invite did not bring embarrassment to the White House, let’s try Sudanese Clock boy and his Muslim loving, hating America family and bring them in. So the clockmeister is now a hero in the Muslim world. I can’t wait for the tens of thousands of Syrian to pour in. Here we go:\n“Clock boy” Ahmed Mohamed made it to Mecca for umrah , the Arabic word for pilgrimage, the portion of his Middle Eastern tour sponsored by the Saudi government. The trip also included the 14-year-old’s parents and other relatives, including one uncle who pushed the Islamophobia narrative.\nThe uncle, identified by Arab News as Moussa Al-Hassan, asserted: “The ordinary American citizen lives in a state of fear of Arabs because of the American media’s portrayal of him as an extremist terrorist.\nEarlier this month, Ahmed visited Qatar, invited by the Qatar Foundation (QF) for Education, Science and Community Development, founded by Al Jazeera creator Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, who is closely associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and opposes what he calls the “Judaization of Jerusalem” in referencing the Jewish Holy City and Israeli capitol. In late 2012, the New York Times reported Al Thani pledged $400 million to fund Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Last week, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, family patriarch, shared 9/11 truther posts on his Facebook wall. More at Breitbart on this little tidbit. But we are not done yet.\nMohamed Elhassan Mohamed, father of ‘Clock Boy’ Ahmed, shared another 9/11 ‘Truther’ Facebook post, only this time in Arabic, claiming that the clock incident will lead to spreading Islam in America.\nBreitbart Texas reported that the family patriarch, a former Sudanese National Reform party candidate for president of that country, managed a Sudanese reform party Facebook group and posted 9/11 ‘truther’ conspiracy theories on its wall. Last week, Mohamed removed the National Reform page, perhaps in response to Western media sifting through the content. Prior to it shutting down, Breitbart Texas captured an Arabic language National Reform post that Mohamed shared on Sept. 28 and it appears he wrote it.\nThe post also alleges that the United States created 9/11 to manufacture the “war on terror.” Translated, the words read: “The events of September 11 th were planned precisely to launch the war on Iraq, and 50% of the American people are becoming aware of that.”\nAccording to the English translation, he instead writes: “Moreover, what happened to Ahmed Mohammed would not have occurred were he not Muslim and Sudanese.” He insists that it “shocked the West, and made Obama seek to honor him, rather than his terrorizing his fellow students.\nFull Story at Breitbart\nFiled under: Religion Tagged: Ahmed Mohamed , Clock boy , Islam , Muslim , Obama , Sudan , Sudanese", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BunkervilleGodGunsAndGutsComrades/~4/b5oCRJ8ER2M", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/bunkerville.wordpress.com/25139/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/tag/ahmed-mohamed/", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/13/clock-boy-ahmed-makes-mecca-saudi-funds-pushes-u-s-islamophobia-narrative", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/15/clock-boy-ahmeds-dads-arabic-post-incident-will-spread-islam-america/", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=bunkerville.wordpress.com&#038;blog=9096376&#038;post=25139&#038;subd=bunkerville&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1", "http://mattersindia.com/2015/09/19/white-house-invitation-for-arrested-clock-boy/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/tag/sudanese/", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/29/ahmed-mohamed-next-stop-qatar/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/tag/clock-boy/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/tag/muslim/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/world/middleeast/pledging-400-million-qatari-emir-makes-historic-visit-to-gaza-strip.html", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/tag/sudan/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/tag/islam/", "http://www.arabnews.com/featured/news/816821", "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2015/10/08/clock-boy-ahmeds-dad-shares-911-truther-posts-facebook/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/bowe-bergdahl-deserted-pervert-father-stalks-twins/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/tag/obama/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/bunkerville.wordpress.com/25139/", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://bunkerville.wordpress.com/category/religion/"], "published": "2015-10-16T12:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:11:21.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
