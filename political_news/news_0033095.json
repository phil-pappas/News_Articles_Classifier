(Melina Mara/The Washington Post) By Sean Sullivan and Matea Gold October 15 at 3:42 PM Follow @WaPoSean Follow @mateagold Jeb Bush, whose early fundraising proficiency quickly became a defining feature of his campaign for president, collected contributions at a drastically slower pace during the third quarter of the year, bringing in just $13.38 million between July and September.\nThe total marks a new cause for concern for a sprawling campaign operation that has failed to gain traction in early voting states and is struggling to keep up with its outlays.\nAmong those who have released their third quarter totals, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson raised more than $20 million, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) amassed $12.2 million, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina collected $6.8 million, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) pulled in $6 million and Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) raised $2.5 million.\nJust as important is how much candidates have in the bank as they headed into the crucial fall stretch. Bush started October with $10.3 million on hand after spending about $11.5 million for a burn rate of nearly 86 percent over the summer.\nRubio issued a press release Thursday boasting about “smart budgeting and fiscal discipline” that allowed him to have nearly $11 million cash on hand despite raising less overall than Bush. The two are considered key rivals for the GOP establishment vote.\nCruz started October with $13.5 million cash on hand, while Carson will report $11.5 million in his campaign account. Fiorina had $5.5 million and Paul’s balance was $2 million.\n[ It’s make or break time for Jeb Bush ] \nBush’s campaign announced his numbers Thursday afternoon, just hours before the deadline for candidates to report totals to the Federal Election Commission. His campaign released the numbers as part of a broader disclosure that included his tax forms, bundler names and medical records — an apparent effort to dampen the impact of his disappointing haul.\nIn his first quarter as a candidate, Bush raised $11.4 million in two weeks, pulling in donations at the hefty rate of $760,000 a day — the fastest pace of all the 2016 contenders, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.\nBut the money slowed down considerably over the summer, with contributions coming in at an average of $147,000 a day. \nThat’s despite the busy schedule of fundraisers that he and three generations of Bush family members kept up, headlining at least 58 events that ranged from a luncheon in tony Montecito., Calif., to a breakfast reception in Oklahoma City, according to news reports and invitations compiled by Sunlight’s Political Party Time . Bush’s father and older brother -- both former presidents — lent a hand, as well: George W. Bush did at least three events and George H. W. Bush did two.\n[ How Jeb Bush’s campaign ran off course before it even began ] \nHeading into the fall, Jeb Bush is making a big push for more campaign dollars. He already has 29 fundraisers scheduled just in October, according to a list obtained by The Post. Many of them featuring his family members. Former president George W. Bush kicked off the month with a luncheon reception Friday in Rogers, Ark. Former first lady Laura Bush is headlining a lunch in Winter Park, Fl., on Oct. 8. George P. Bush, Jeb’s oldest son, will be in Fresno for a lunch on Oct. 22.\nAt the end of the month, George W. Bush is scheduled to headline a fundraiser at the Washington home of asset management executive Paul Horvath, according to an invitation obtained by The Post. Among the co-chairs, who have been asked to raise $32,400 each, are Bush’s two former White House chiefs of staff, Josh Bolten and Andy Card.\nAs surveys show Bush heading into the fall trailing political outsiders like Donald Trump in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, there will be immense pressure on a super PAC supporting his candidacy to help him turn things around. Right to Rise, an organization that can collected unlimited donations, raised more than $100 million during the first six months of the year. Super PACs don’t have to report their numbers again until early 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:27:26.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
