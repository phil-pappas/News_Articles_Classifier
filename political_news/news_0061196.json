American Sealcoat was ordered to pay a $10 million fine.\nChattahoochee Riverkeeper Jason Ulseth examines the toxic discharges The landlord, M&K Warehouses, will remediate the site under a settlement agreement with the Chattahoochee Riverkeeper reached this week. The riverkeeper credits M&K for working “diligently,” and spending $500,000, to reverse the environmental damage caused by American Sealcoat.\n“This case sends a clear message to other industrial operators and property owners that compliance with water quality laws is not optional, and hope that it encourages them to follow M&K’s example of cooperation and compliance,” Jason Ulseth, the riverkeeper, said in a statement.\nBob Norman, an attorney for M&K, said: “This was an unfortunate situation that M&K inherited from its tenant, American Sealcoat. … The company is glad to have all of this behind them.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/20/20/c6/Jason_stained-soil.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:20:16.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
