He cited prior work the medical researcher performed for drug companies.\n\"It is about time that the FDA and Congress started listening to the overwhelming majority of the American people who believe that medicine is too expensive,\" the senator said.\nSanders cited a report from the New York Times saying that Califf ran a multimillion-dollar clinical research center at Duke University.

This includes reviewing the \"safety, efficacy and appropriate use of both new medical products and those already on the market.\"\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that from 2009 to early 2015 Califf got more than $200,000 from drug makers in consulting fees. The report said that Califf donated all of his consulting fees to nonprofits.\n\nSanders isn't the only lawmaker to raise concerns about Califf and the agency.\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently told the Washington Examiner that he wants to know if the next commissioner will not \"go rogue\" on opioid approvals.
