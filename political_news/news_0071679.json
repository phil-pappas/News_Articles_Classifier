As a result, the facility will close effective in 30 days to ensure an orderly transition for the children currently served at the facility.\nDHS, the facility's licensing agency, received reports of sexual abuse via its ChildLine program and then conducted investigations in coordination with law enforcement.\nThere were several violations found including, but not limited to: inadequate supervision of the children, failed policy and procedure implementation; failure to report missing children; staff members sleeping during their shifts; and insufficient staffing levels.\n\"Our number one priority must always be the health and safety of the children that we serve,\" said DHS Secretary Ted Dallas . \"We will never hesitate to act when child safety is at risk and today's actions are a reminder that we must always remain vigilant.\"\nThe 56-bed Butler County residential treatment facility serves children and adolescents diagnosed with a mental health condition. This level of treatment typically becomes necessary when the child can no longer function safely in the family or community setting. There are three other child residential facilities on this campus that will retain their licenses.\nGlade Run has the right to appeal the department's decision.\nFor more information visit www.dhs.state.pa.us .\nMEDIA CONTACT : Kait Gillis , 717-425-7606\n releases/pennsylvania-department-of-human-services-revokes-glade-run-lutheran-services-license-300156729.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.dhs.state.pa.us/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-department-of-human-services-revokes-glade-run-lutheran-services-license-300156729.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC23835&Transmission_Id=201510081211PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC23835&DateId=20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:52:33.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
