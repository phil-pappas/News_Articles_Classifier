(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)\nAssociated Press Oct. 5, 2015 | 11:50 p.m. EDT + More By TIM BOOTH, AP Sports Writer\nSEATTLE (AP) â€” With one big punch, Kam Chancellor showed his importance to the Seattle Seahawks.\nAnd once again, the Seahawks may have received another Monday night break from the officials in the same end zone where the infamous \"Fail Mary\" took place.\nChancellor knocked the ball free from Detroit wide receiver Calvin Johnson at the 1-yard line when it appeared the Lions were going to take the lead, and Seattle held on for a 13-10 win.\nWith Detroit on the verge of capping a 91-yard drive with the go-ahead touchdown with less than 2 minutes remaining, Chancellor came from the side and punched the ball from Johnson's arm as he was being tackled by Earl Thomas.\nThe ball bounded into the end zone where it was guided over the back line by K.J. Wright for a touchback and Seattle's ball at the 20.\nWright could have been called for illegal touching for hitting the ball out of the end zone, which would have given the ball back to Detroit. But no flags were thrown and on the ensuing possession, Russell Wilson found Jermaine Kearse for 50 yards on third down. With Detroit out of timeouts, the Seahawks (2-2) ran off the final seconds of their second straight win.\n\"We can't change it now,\" Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \"It is what it is. We won and we're going to move on.\"\nDetroit fell to 0-4 for its worst start since 2010 when the Lions also started 0-4 on their way to a 6-10 season, and with a schedule that offers little relief going forward.\nIt was an ugly performance by the home team, filled with offensive mistakes and two fourth-quarter fumbles by Wilson, the second returned 27 yards for a touchdown by Caraun Reid to pull Detroit to 13-10.\nBut in the end, Seattle's defense came through.\nStarting on their 9 with 6:23 remaining, the Lions converted a big third down on Golden Tate's 22-yard catch-and-run and reached the Seattle 46 with 3 minutes left on Ameer Abdullah's 9-yard run. Matthew Stafford then zipped a pass to No. 3 tight end Tim Wright down the seam for 26 yards to the Seattle 20 with 2:30 remaining, placing it in-between Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas and Chancellor.\nThe Lions reached the Seattle 11 and on third-and-1, Stafford passed to an open Johnson. As he stretched for the goal line, Chancellor came across and knocked the ball free.\nSeattle has not allowed an offensive touchdown in the two games since Chancellor ended his holdout and has forced 18 punts during that stretch.\n\"It was big time,\" Wagner said of Chancellor's return. \"He just made us a whole defense.\"\nWilson was forced to be an escape artist as Seattle's offensive line continued to struggle with protection. Wilson threw for 287 yards and rushed for another 40 yards. Wilson's most memorable play was spinning free of two near sacks and finding Kearse for 34 yards in the second quarter, and then hitting Doug Baldwin on a 24-yard TD on the next play.\nSeattle was without Marshawn Lynch for the first time since Week 7 of the 2011 season against Cleveland when Lynch had back problems flare up during pregame warmups. Thomas Rawls rushed for 104 yards last week in relief of Lynch, but could not get started against a better Lions defense. Rawls finished with 48 yards on 17 carries.\nStafford was 24 of 35 for 203 yards for Detroit, which lost starting tight end Eric Ebron and both starting defensive tackles Haloti Ngata and Tyrunn Walker to injuries.\nEbron suffered a knee injury in the first half after having two early catches, while Ngata and Walker both went out in the second half. Ngata suffered a calf injury while Walker was taken off on a cart after suffering a left leg injury in the fourth quarter.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
