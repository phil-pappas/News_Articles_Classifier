Trying to end a championship drought that dates to 1908, they remained four wins from capturing their first pennant in seven decades.\nGame 2 in the best-of-seven set is Sunday night, with Cubs ace Jake Arrieta facing rookie Noah Syndergaard.\n\"If Harvey wasn't pitching, it would have looked a lot better. He was outstanding tonight,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"His stuff is always good, but the command was outrageous tonight.\"\nHarvey pitched into the eighth for the first time in more than two months, brushing aside all that hoopla last month about his innings limit.\n\"I talk to this guy every day. I know exactly what he's made of,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"He wants the baseball.\"\nJeurys Familia got four outs for his third playoff save and New York jumped ahead in its first NLCS since 2006 by beating the Cubs for the first time all year. The Mets went 0-7 during the season series and had dropped nine in a row to Chicago overall.\nNew York is looking to reach the World Series for the first time in 15 years, the longest absence in franchise history but one the Cubs and all their pained, loyal followers would certainly scoff at.\nMurphy connected off losing pitcher Jon Lester for his fourth homer of the playoffs and made a diving play at second base for the final out.\n\"I freaked out when I caught it — and then you've got to make the throw,\" Murphy said. \"I was in the right spot.\"\nYoenis Cespedes threw out a runner at the plate, Curtis Granderson drove in two runs and Travis d'Arnaud homered off the giant, red Mets apple in straightaway center field.\n\"I've never seen that before,\" Murphy said.\nKyle Schwarber was the only one of those rookie boppers who showed off his power for the Cubs, hitting a mammoth homer that chased Harvey with two outs in the eighth and pulled Chicago to 4-2.\nMurphy finished off the Dodgers in the deciding game of their Division Series with an all-around offensive performance that inspired a \"Mr. October\" nod in a tweet from the New York original, Reggie Jackson.\nTwo nights later, the free-agent-to-be was at it again, getting the Mets off to a rollicking start against Chicago.\nMurphy, who set a career high this season with 14 homers, launched another one into the second deck in right field for his fourth of the postseason. By taking Clayton Kershaw (twice), Zack Greinke and Lester deep, the 2014 All-Star has tagged $517 million worth of pitchers in these playoffs.\nIt was Murphy's third homer against a left-hander in the playoffs — he had one during the regular season. And by connecting in his third consecutive postseason game, he matched a Mets record set by Donn Clendenon in 1969, the year he was World Series MVP.\n\"Saving the homers,\" Murphy joked. \"If I knew what I was doing I would have hit more homers during the regular season.\"\nGranderson's soft RBI single on an 0-2 pitch from Lester put the Mets up 2-1 in the fifth, and d'Arnaud hit a 431-foot drive to center in the sixth. Juan Lagares stole third against Lester in the seventh and scored on Granderson's sacrifice fly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:18:37.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
