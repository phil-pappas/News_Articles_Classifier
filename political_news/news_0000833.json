A couple of races this November will likely determine if they keep it. \nFive seats are unopposed and four have tough-to-beat incumbents. So that leaves voters in two districts – covering parts of Amherst, Cheektowaga, Lancaster and Alden – most likely to determine the balance of power this year. The incumbents in these districts – one a Democrat, the other a Republican – square off against strong challengers. \nIn the 5th District in Amherst, Democratic incumbent Thomas A. Loughran faces Republican Amherst Town Council Member Guy R. Marlette. \nAnd, in the 8th District, Republican incumbent Ted B. Morton of Depew is running against Debra S. Liegl, the former president of the Cheektowaga Chamber of Commerce. \n“These are two showcase districts this year,” said Erie County Democratic Party Chairman Jeremy Zellner. \nDemocratic leaders say retaking control of the 11-member County Legislature would mean more public input in the legislative process and aggressive policies to protect public interests. \nRepublican leaders say a GOP-controlled Legislature ensures checks and balances and discourages a Democratic county executive from submitting big-spending budgets. \nDemocratic County Executive Mark Poloncarz has had a civil and productive working relationship with the current Republican majority. \n“I’m certainly not going to sit here and say I have not been able to work with them, unlike what you see in Washington,” he said. “We have been able to work together and get stuff done.” \nBut he’s helping the Democrats, providing both face time and more than $2,000 to help Liegl defeat Morton, a freshman lawmaker. \n“I feel that Deb Morton is a far superior candidate than Ted Morton,” Poloncarz said, “Truthfully, I’ve been able to work with people across the aisle, and Mr. Morton is someone who has not shown a propensity to want to work with anybody.” \nThe challenge for Democrats: raising the public profile and affinity for Liegl, a political newcomer running against an incumbent who has locked up every ballot line but one. They also have to defend Loughran’s seat against what many consider his strongest challenger since he took office a decade ago. \nThe challenge for Republicans: trying to unseat Loughran, who has won re-election over and over despite being outspent by large margins. As for Morton, he has to overcome financial ethics issues and mistakes on which Democrats have eagerly pounced. \nThree other district races feature Democratic and Republican contenders. In the 3rd District race in North Buffalo and Kenmore, incumbent Peter J. Savage III faces a Green Party challenge from Anthony Baney. \nMorton vs. Liegl \nMorton’s victory in the 8th District two years ago enabled Republicans to win the Legislature majority through elections for the first time since 1977. He chairs the Energy and Environment Committee. Since January he has introduced resolutions for a property tax cap and for term limits, though neither has been adopted. He also voted with fellow Republicans to lower county property taxes his first year in office. \nBoth Morton and Liegl offer similar platforms of low taxes, better roads and more jobs. But the similarities end there. \nLiegl runs as a business- and community-friendly Democrat who spent nine years as branch manager for First Niagara Bank and then served for 14 years as head of the Cheektowaga Chamber of Commerce. She’s raised twice as much money as Morton, but her name recognition among voters remains low. “She’s collected a lot of dollars from Mark Poloncarz and the Democratic scenery, but she’s gained no traction,” said Erie County Republican Party Chairman Nicholas Langworthy. \nLiegl said she’s knocked on thousands of doors since July. \n“I give them my background – my business background, my economic development background, my finance background, and they’re very pleased to hear that,” she said. \nShe also takes aim at the old and new financial ethics controversies that have dogged the incumbent. \n“My opponent has some real baggage,” she said, “and the voters, quite frankly, they need somebody that they can trust.” \nAs a financial planner with a struggling business during the recession, Morton borrowed about $315,000 from seven of his clients – with their permission – between 2009 and 2012. The Financial Industry Regulatory Agency considered that an ethical breach, fined Morton $5,000 in 2013 and suspended him from acting as a financial planner for six months. Morton also was fired as a contractor with LPL Financial. \nMorton also misstated the amount of debt he owed to creditors after he was elected to office. He said he misunderstood the directions on his 2013 financial disclosure ethics form and wrongly stated he had no more than $25,000 in outstanding debts to a single creditor when, in fact, he owed about $90,000 to three different creditors. \nHe has since paid off the creditors with interest, he said, pointing out that he didn’t file for bankruptcy but instead sold his house and business, cut his living expenses, and paid cash to buy and move into an 1,800-square-foot mobile home so he could honor his financial responsibilities. \n“My wife and I are current on every single obligation we have,” he said. \nZellner, the Democratic Party chairman, described Morton as “fatally flawed” as a candidate and Poloncarz referred to him as beset with issues that make him unfit to serve. \nMorton responded that he’s been an independent voice for taxpayers and constituents. He broke with Legislature colleagues by voting against most spending from the county’s $19 million surplus from last year. And, he has introduced legislation requiring a 2 a.m. bar-closing time. \n“I’m not afraid to be the lone person out if it goes against what I believe in,” he said. \nMorton has raised $27,700 in campaign funds from individuals, local businesses and Republican sources. That includes a $6,600 personal loan he made to his campaign. \nLiegl had raised nearly $36,000, according to her last campaign finance filing, but she said she has raised $50,000 as of earlier this month. The bulk of her contributions appear to come from unions, other Democratic campaigns and organizations, and individuals with political ties. \nLoughran vs. Marlette \nLoughran, owner of Loughran’s Bar and Restaurant in Snyder, has been the Democratic legislator in Amherst’s 5th District for a decade. \nHe’s been a swing vote in several instances, and he said his stances highlight his independence. He claims perfect attendance at Legislature meetings, supported Legislature downsizing, and broke with his party to vote against a property tax increase sought by the county executive in 2013. \n“I think I’ve been re-elected because I represent the people’s interest and I stand with them,” he said. “I’ve provided leadership when it counts.” \nHis last two Republican challengers, former Amherst Highway Superintendent Robert Anderson and Shelly Schratz, a former town council member, couldn’t beat him despite outspending him 4-to-1. \nMarlette – expected to outspend Loughran by 4-to-1 – is considered a strong opponent. As a Town Board member, he introduced numerous resolutions that won bipartisan support. As deputy supervisor, he’s been the right-hand man for Town Supervisor Barry Weinstein. He considers his top achievements to be reducing town taxes while improving services, negotiating $20 million in cost savings without layoffs through department mergers and other efficiencies, and reinvesting in parks, recreation and youth services. \n“I’ve put forward resolutions that changed the way the town conducts business,” he said. “Simply voting doesn’t take a lot of effort.” \nMarlette said he’s committed to bringing greater accountability to the Legislature and has introduced a “reform agenda” that would push for a cap on county spending, a gift ban for all county employees and term limits for legislators. \nBoth men have detractors. \nMarlette’s critics say he’s been cozy with developers and sympathetic to large-scale, controversial developments over the objections of local residents and neighborhoods. Marlette said most of Amherst’s growth occurred before he took office, that he established a Building Height Review Committee to limit out-of-scale development projects, and that the most controversial developments in town never came to the Town Board for action. Marlette has raised about $80,000, more than $17,000 of which came from developers and home builders this year. \nLoughran’s critics point out that he has introduced no resolutions of substance within the past two years and is considered fairly inactive compared with other legislators with busier public and legislative schedules. Loughran responded that he’s been vigilant in his oversight of county affairs. Loughran has received much of his $19,000 campaign contributions from unions and other Democratic campaigns and organizations. \nIf re-elected, Loughran has pledged to keep “acute oversight” of the county budget and financial transactions, promote the use of alternative energy and work to eliminate causes of “zombie housing” in which homes remain vacant because of incomplete foreclosures. \nHardwick vs. Potter \nThe race for the 4th District features a young Democratic challenger, who many see as a promising up-and-comer. \nTodd J. Potter Jr., 24, is a Kenmore-Town of Tonawanda School Board member, participated in the district’s reorganization and sought to create a student board member position. His platform includes reforming where local industrial development agencies are located, expanding Erie Community College into the Tonawandas/Grand Island, investing in roads and high-speed broadband, and fighting the drug epidemic. He said his energy and time commitment make him a strong candidate. \n“I see many problems with simple solutions – but no advocate to push for the needed reforms,” he said. \nHardwick touts his record of improving cooperation between the County Department of Public Works and town officials, and also his work to encourage the development of ECC’s capital investment campaign. He chairs the Legislature’s Community Enrichment and Government Affairs committees. \nHardwick lists his top priorities as securing the future of ECC, ensuring a “just transition” for the community if NRG’s Huntley Station power plant shuts down, and keeping property taxes down while maintaining roads, parks and libraries. \nRath vs. Wannas \nSixth District Republican incumbent Edward A. Rath III is running for his fifth term against a young, four-year Amherst resident who has not raised money for her Democratic campaign. \nRiyam Wannas, 21, came to Buffalo as an Iraqi refugee in 2009. She’s currently a senior majoring in biology and political science at the University at Buffalo. She works at a translator at Journey’s End Refugee Services and is a member of the several community and immigrant groups. She wants to keep the tax rate level, focus on cultural organizations and libraries, promote diversity and reject industries that harm the environment. \n“Before living in Amherst, I never had a place to call home,” she said. “Therefore, I will work endlessly to make home a better place.” \nRath, 48, heads the Legislature’s Economic Development Committee, serves on the Erie County Industrial Development Agency, supported Legislature downsizing, and introduced “silver alert” and anti-cyberbullying laws. He said he wants to focus on policies that encourage business growth, pursue public-private partnerships, invest in infrastructure to improve public safety and advocate for law enforcement and firefighters. “I have a proven record of pushing for smaller, more efficient government, and lower taxes,” he said. “I have successfully advocated for the needs and priorities of my entire district, from children to seniors.” \nDixon vs. Hawrylczak \nLynne Dixon, an independent candidate who caucuses with the Republican majority, seeks to extend her six years as the 9th District legislator. Challenging her to the seat is Democrat Dan Hawrylczak, who runs a local insurance agency and served as assessor for the City of Lackawanna in the 1990s. \nHawrylczak said his work as assessor gave him firsthand experience working with people struggling to pay property taxes. His experience as a business person gives him the skills to build relationships among lawmakers. He wants stronger oversight and consolidation of IDAs. He calls for more advocacy and support for homeowners, including foreclosure counseling. And, he wants the former Bethlehem Steel site to be remediated. \n“I am a business person, not a career politician,” Hawrylczak said. “I will work with all parties for the betterment of my district and the county at large.” \nDixon, a former broadcast journalist, said she has worked to reform the Department of Social Services as head of the Health and Human Services Committee. She supported a property tax cut last year. Dixon, who has raised three times as much money as Hawrylczak, said she wants to continue trying to lower taxes and further reform Child Protective Services. She also wants to increase infrastructure investment. \n“I believe I have a proven record as being an independent voice that aggressively tackles issues involving the district head on,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:48:06.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
