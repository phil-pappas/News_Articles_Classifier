I think it’s great.”Varney, however, then pressed the 2016 Republican front-runner, asking again: \"Can you close a mosque? I mean, we do have religious freedom.\"\"Well, I don't know,\" Trump responded in an apparent backpedal. \"It depends on if the mosque is, you know, loaded for bear, I don't know.
