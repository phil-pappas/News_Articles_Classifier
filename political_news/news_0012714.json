By David Catanese Oct. 13, 2015 | 12:01 a.m. EDT\n+ More Poor Martin O'Malley couldn't even get his mug in the promo.\nCNN's rolling advertisement for the first Democratic presidential primary debate Tuesday night essentially bills the occasion as a binary battle royale between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, with the names of the other three candidates flashed on the screen as an afterthought.\n[ READ: 5 Things You Won't See in the Democratic Debate ]\nIt's inevitable that most of the attention during the two-hour affair at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas will be heaped upon Clinton – the establishment front-runner, dynastic political icon and most captivating woman in American politics – and Sanders , the crotchety but animating Senate upstart who has parlayed a broiling progressive movement into a surprisingly viable candidacy.\nBarring an inexplicable belly flop on center stage by either, the two dominant campaigns will roll into Wednesday with their legions of supporters in tow regardless of who is declared the victor.\nFor O'Malley, though, the stakes are considerably higher. He needs a breakout moment, a dazzling exchange, a rousing rebuttal – anything that will propel him into the lasting conversation among media elites, donors and party activists that will define the contest going forward once the dust settles in Sin City.\nIn short, he needs to replicate what Carly Fiorina did on the Republican side.\n\"There are very limited opportunities for a candidate who is in O'Malley's position right now to break through,\" says Mike Feldman, a senior adviser to Vice President Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign. \"He has the most riding on this, because this is a platform of unequals.\"\nO'Malley's venture has been stalled from the start, overwhelmed by the unprecedented coalescing of party loyalists around Clinton and disrupted by the unlikely ascent of Sanders.\nSince launching his bid on the final weekend in May, his peak national poll number in the Democratic primary has been 5 percent. But that appeared to be ephemeral. Recently he's barely reached 1, leading NPR to produce a story on the former governor topped with the headline \"A Day In The Life Of a 1 Percenter.\" Public Policy Polling didn't even bother to track O'Malley's favorability in its last read of the race, finding it more worthwhile to test 1988 Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.\nO'Malley's diminished place in the primary is not for a lack of drudgery.\n[ RELATED: O’Malley Chastises DNC: ‘We Need Debate.’ ]\nHe's made more trips to Iowa and New Hampshire than Clinton, his press aides incessantly push out advisories on his 15 goals for the presidency and he's become increasingly comfortable sketching out substantive contrasts with his rivals.\nNothing's worked. The zeitgeist has escaped him.\nSo Tuesday's grand stage before millions of viewers and potential voters will be even grander for him – and his allies know it.\n\"For guys like me talking to people, trying to raise money and campaign finance folks, sure he needs to break through and be sharp,\" says Damian O'Doherty, the head of the Generation Forward super PAC bolstering O'Malley. \"He's also going to have to be the fighter Martin O'Malley that we all know because he's going to have to fight for his time.\"\nThat means strategically picking a point of interjection – when CNN attempts to foment the Clinton-Sanders faceoff – without looking too eager or desperate.\nO'Malley's current campaign team is mum on its strategy heading into the debate, but past aides and top supporters predict he won't be shy to raise policy differences, whether it be on trade, Wall Street reform or gun control. But the unifying theme he's expected to return to repeatedly is being a proven vehicle for action, not just talk.\nHe's fond of reminding audiences that he has the most executive experience – eight years as governor, eight years as Baltimore mayor – of any of his Democratic competitors. He's also the only one who hasn't served in the U.S. Senate, an institution largely defined by its filibustering and partisan bottlenecking.\nWhen Clinton or Sanders lay out a plan of what she or he would do, O'Malley can retort that, \"He's already done it,\" says Iowa state Sen. Rich Taylor. \"Most everything he wants to do federally, he's already done in the city of Baltimore and the state of Maryland.\"\nTaylor, who endorsed O'Malley last month, says he expects a fiery O'Malley to sell himself and draw Clinton and Sanders into exchanges that crystallize distinctions. The ultimate goal, of course, being that elusive O'Malley polling bump.\n\"I look for his percentage points to double after the first debate at least,\" he says.\nGiven O'Malley's averaging less than 1 percent nationally and just 3 percent in Iowa, that movement would be almost unnoticeable.\n[ PHOTOS: The Big Picture – September 2015 ]\nMore important to him is to own a moment that gets replayed on television and radio in the aftermath, one that is hailed by liberals and appreciated by conservatives, one that defines him as a contender with conviction and spurs Google searches about him, Twitter and Facebook mentions of him and a spate of online contributions for him.\nThat is momentum he could harness heading into what will be a critical four-week juncture in the primary that includes the highly anticipated Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Des Moines, Iowa, on Oct. 24 – where each candidate, including former Sens. Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, will speak – and the second debate on Nov. 14 in the same city.\nIt won't be easy.\nFor all his good looks, musical talent and everyman approach, it must be bedeviling to O'Malley that his plan to be the insurgent to Clinton has been upended by a bespectacled, balding socialist with decades of time planted in Washington. What's more is that Sanders' crowds and polling numbers are only growing.\nA bad debate for Bernie won't bury him whereas O'Malley can't even just settle for a good night.\n\"Clinton and Sanders could get through this debate no harm no foul, without a moment,\" says Feldman. \"I'm not sure O'Malley can live on if he can't generate enthusiasm for his candidacy. He has to make an impression. It only takes one exchange, it only takes one potential issue. He has got to show why people should care about his candidacy.\"\nThe Report Thank you, your email has been submitted.\nSubscribe to our\nNewsletter Stay informed with exclusive content sent\ndirectly to your inbox.\nTAGS: O'Malley, Martin 2016 presidential election Democratic Party debates", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1ubd%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=The%20Democratic%20Debate%20Is%20Martin%20O%27Malley%27s%20Last%20Chance&summary=Clinton%20and%20Sanders%20will%20draw%20most%20of%20the%20attention%20in%20Tuesday%20night%E2%80%99s%20debate%2C%20but%20the%20stakes%20are%20highest%20for%20the%20slumping%20former%20Maryland%20governor.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1ubd%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1ubd%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1ubd%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=The%20Democratic%20Debate%20Is%20Martin%20O%27Malley%27s%20Last%20Chance", "http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/09/24/443191776/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-1-percenter-1-percent-in-the-polls-that-is", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1ubd%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe1ubd%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=The%20Democratic%20Debate%20Is%20Martin%20O%27Malley%27s%20Last%20Chance", "http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_NationalDems_100615.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:13:22.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
