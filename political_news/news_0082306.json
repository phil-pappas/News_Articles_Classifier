Someone isn't listening. —Emma Thompson\nI often ask this question. A parent or a loved one is feeling low and they call you. In how many minutes do you figure out that something is wrong? The answer is always right in the first couple of seconds. Then what happens? You dial down the talk mode and dial up the listening mode. You zone out of everything else. You are 100% present in the conversation. The connection is being strengthened.\nUnconditional listening precedes unconditional love.\nHowever, most of our listening is not like that. It is more like a Mumbai local train during rush hour. It is a feat of courage. Even before passengers alight, anxiety fuelled boarders rush aboard.\nOur communication styles mimic the local train. Before someone completes what they have to say, we rush in to present our perspective, voice our views, demonstrate our dissent and with rapidly higher decibels.\nThe need for talking outscores the need to listen.\nTraditionally, companies have focused their resources on 'talking budgets' where they talk to employees and customers. Resources allocated towards 'talking' to employees and customers dwarfs the resources allocated to 'listening budgets' to employees and customers.\nThe impact is being felt. Employee surveys show that marginal improvement, if not declines, in employee engagements scores. Many customer satisfaction surveys are not showing dramatic increases in traditional scores. A few loud extroverted voices might get heard, but God bless the introverts who anyway might be uncomfortable speaking up but have very important ideas and information. Progressive organisations are moving into the real listening mode.\nThe LinkedIn profile of a Human Resource professional in a newly licenced bank reads, ‘Creating a Magic Experience for employees’. It is clearly a sign of the times.\nNot listening has stepped out of corporate offices and into homes, schools and communities. It shows up in various forms. Road rage, divorce rates, gender discrimination and shows no sign of abatement. Clearly our listening skills seem to be narrowing down the number of perspectives we lend to broaden our minds.\nLarry King I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening.\nWhy is listening important?\nListening is a skill with which humans progressed. It is because of our skill to listen that we spread the skill of making fire, creating a wheel, writing and printing books and curing people of disease. We listened to our teachers for knowledge. We listened to our families for cultural values. We listened to cries of help when forces of nature struck us. We listen to our role models. We listen to people who inspire us.\nListening is a core to nurturing. Listening is a tool for progress.\nSo then why is it diminishing? A perspective arose, last week, in Oregon.\nWe woke up to Barack Obama, delivering a statement to the White House press corps, talking about the latest shooting in a school in Oregon. With apparent anguish, he said gun violence has become routine. “The reporting is routine. My response is routine….We have become numb”. How have we stopped listening to the voices taking about violence against our children?\nCloser home, we woke up to yet another ‘routine’ incident of mob violence. Open our newspapers and switch on our news channels, even our community leaders are not listening. It is a Mumbai local train. Arguments are being presented, but not heard. When arguments are not being heard, it leads to resentment, frustration and then perhaps unilateral and maybe even harmful action. This is when positions get polarised.\nMind you, there are arguments that have spanned centuries, and still tend to polarise us. The India–Pakistan partition is a polarising force where any discussion about our neighbours, spills out to the sports field and more often than not, battlefields. If we would just listen to the citizenry on both sides and not just a few media reportage, you might find common ground of peace and culture.\nPerhaps to some extent our reducing attention span to seek out deeper explanations for a seemingly illogical step; like wearing a short skirt in public, or smoking or eating a certain cuisine, prevent us from accepting the person’s perspective and smother what one would consider a fundamental freedom and responsibility.\nLed by Emiliana Simon-Thomas and Dacher Keltner, The Greater Good Science Center at the University of Berkeley is running a very interesting course on The Science of Happiness. They talk about a very interesting concept called Active Listening.\nThey posit that when we truly listen to someone, we create an opportunity to make a true connection.\nBryant H McGill One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.\nOn the other hand, when you talking to someone have you ever felt like that person was not mentally there? How did that make you feel? I bet you felt disrespected. You felt that your views or issues were not valued. You felt a little bit diminished. It made you want to withdraw. In the words of John Gottman, who researches marital relationships and communications, you wanted to ‘turn away’ or ‘turn against’ instead of ‘turn towards’.\nActive Listening is perhaps a tool to use when you want to turn towards someone.\nSo how should you actively listen?\nFirst, set the environment and conditions. Find a place where a conversation can take place without any disturbance. Shut your laptop and keep your cellphone away. Let the person start talking. Remember you are here to listen. Maybe offer the person some water. One very important condition is that you must explicitly agree to take turns.\nSecond, be there. Simply be there. Face the person and make meaningful eye contact. Your body language and symbols should show that you are here to listen.\nThird, be mindful, of non-verbal communications. It is very easy to slip into an “I told you this will happen” smile. Or a slow side to slide disapproving shake of the head saying, “what were you thinking, bro”?\nFourth, avoid judgment. Absorb the words and feelings of the speaker. There is a high chance that the person may have said something or done something that you do not approve or gone against your explicit instructions, or maybe it even goes against your core value system, like cheating on her husband or buying that latest expensive FIFA 2016. Do not judge. Just listen, carefully.\nSimon Sinek There is a difference between listening and waiting for your turn to speak.\nFifth, paraphrase. Once you have finished listening, try and paraphrase what you heard in a couple of sentences. You can start your sentence with; “If I understand you correctly…” or “What I hear you saying is…” It gives the person the assurance that they have been understood, which is great foundation to make a deeper connection. If need be you can ask a question to clarify any doubts, but start by saying, “I would like to clarify, when you said ___ did you mean ____”. Needless to say, the question should not be loaded with judgment.\nSixth, show empathy and concern. A simple statement like, “I understand how you feel about this issue” helps deepen the connection.\nAt this stage do not jump into offering advice or challenging. Remember, you need not have a solution for every problem. The best solution is found when the person “discovers” the solution on his or her own. Only when you have heard the person it is time for you to speak and offer a perspective.\nSeventh, offer your perspective, however, think before you speak. Remember the condition in step one? Now it is your time to speak. It is ok to be silent for a few seconds. It is absolutely fine to say, “Give me a moment to think over something”. Sometimes, it just makes sense to mentally rehearse what you are going to say. You need not be a know-it-all. More often than not, you might just need to be a listening board and not a solutions architect.\nIf the person is asking for advice, help them explore answers themselves. “What do you think you should do?” “What are some of the options that you have explored?” “What does your gut tell you”?\nIf you wish to challenge something, ask for permission to challenge. You can even start the sentence by saying, “If you do not mind, I would really like to challenge that assumption. Is it okay with you?”\nWith this technique, the ‘speakers’ or ‘talkers’ would have the satisfaction that they said what they have to say and they have been understood. This in itself is a big step forward.\nDean Rusk The best way to persuade people is with your ears - by listening to them.\nI know what you are thinking: Who has the time for such a long drawn out conversation?\nIn my experience, Active Listening is actually a time saver. If you wait for the speaker to finish, you will get a chance to say your piece. If you are a really active listener, you might realise you did not need to even say anything.\nActive Listening is like boarding a train. You first wait for passengers to get off then you board the train. A disciplined queue moves faster and is less stressful; all you have to do is rein in your instinct to rush into the train door. The difference is that this train does not leave anyone on the platform. Everyone gets a chance to say his or her bit and be heard.\nWith Active Listening, you seek to understand and to be understood. The environment you create prevents any escalation of decibels or use of words that you might later repent. With Active Listening, you make a deeper connect.\nTo conclude, as I type this article, we are being pounded with unseasonal showers, which we might call signs of climate change and global warming. Or is it nature’s of talking to us and asking us to listen?\nKelsey Grammer Prayer is when you talk to God. Meditation is when you're listening.
