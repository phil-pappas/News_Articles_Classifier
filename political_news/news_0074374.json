I believe that I was helping victims have their voice heard, and I don't want to cause more distress than has already been caused.\n– Tom Watson MP Asked whether he would speak to Lord Brittan's family, Mr Watson said: \"I'm not entirely certain whether that would be productive.\"\nPressure on Mr Watson was further increased with the release by the BBC of details of a letter obtained by the Panorama programme which he wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, complaining at the way Lord Brittan's case was being handled.\n\"I am driven to the unpalatable conclusion that the identity of the alleged perpetrator, Leon Brittan, may in some way have influenced treatment of the case,\" he was Quote: d as writing.\n\"I hope I am wrong, but in my view the case demands your personal attention.\"\nMr Watson said he had simply \"helped amplify\" the voice of the alleged victim who felt they were not being listened to.\nIt's not unreasonable for me to demand that the criminal justice system does its job, and I've got some experience of trying to make sure that it does do that.\n– Tom Watson MP Tory Sir Nicholas Soames described Mr Watson as \"the witch-finder general\" and said the debate over historic sex abuse by Westminster figures was \"running out of hand\".\nLord Brittan's brother Sir Samuel Brittan called on Mr Watson to resign.\nOf course he should apologise for unfounded allegations.\nBut I think he should do more, he should apply for a good job as steward of the Chilterns hundreds. That is an office which was (for) anyone incompatible with being an MP - it's the way many MPs use to resign.\nI don't think he knew anything about my brother. I think he was just looking for scandal because he's not intelligent enough to do his proper job as an Opposition MP.\n– Sir Samuel Brittan speaking to ITV Newd Last updated Tue 13 Oct 2015 Read more 6 updates MPs ponder call for Watson to give evidence on sex claims Politics Leon Brittan Tom Watson MP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:47:45.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
