Their solution for robber-baron-level income inequality is not the obvious: Give workers raises. They dont want to increase the minimum wage, which would eventually push up pay for everyone else as well. They dont intend to provide paid sick leave or decent pensions or fewer unstable contract jobs. They have no intention of strengthening unions so workers can collectively bargain for better wages and working conditions. Ah, yes, those right wing lunatics sure do love their fascist corporations. What a crock. Spend YOUR money to improve your business. Anyone else convinced this \"Free Market\" is nothing more than a corporate welfare queen scam of a few to take from the poor to pay the rich. Redistributing money from the poor to give to the rich. What a crock. Time to enforce strict anti-trust laws.

Wow....you really don't have a clue do you?? How about them greedy Lawyers?? I don't have a clue and you bring up lawyers here? Fascism; if you don't know what it is, try to refrain from the urge of proving yourself clueless and post. Quote: This rich guy, Peter Georgescu, chairman emeritus of the PR firm Young & Rubicam, said in a New York Times op-ed in August that he feared the current grotesque level of income inequality would provoke major social unrest or oppressive tax levies on the rich  unless the rich did something about it right away. To avert restoration of the higher income tax levels that the rich paid from 1935 to 1985, Georgescu recommended that the federal government give money to businesses to raise the wages of workers earning less than $80,000 a year. Thats right. He says the government should subsidize corporations. The government should give them free stuff. Welfare. The government, in his estimation, should pay corporations rather than simply requiring them to use some of their massive profits, now at the highest level in 85 years, to adequately compensate the workers whose labor created those profits. Making the government pay is a popular position among Georgescus wealthy peers and GOP politicians. They dont want the government to protect the environment or negotiate for lower pharmaceutical prices for senior citizens on Medicare or provide 16 million Americans with insurance through the Affordable Care Act. They do want the government to hand money to corporations, though. OMG anyone else ready for a change of thought in this nation? Let's abandon the ol' NIV god of the rich, shall we?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:23:22.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
