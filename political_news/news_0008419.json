It presents summary results of the FY 2014 allocation amounts.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 merged the discretionary Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Program with the formula-based Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program to establish the JAG program which provides funds to support program areas such as law enforcement, prosecution, indigent defense, courts, crime prevention and education, corrections, drug treatment and enforcement, technology improvement, and crime victim and witness initiatives. The Bureau of Justice Assistance administers the program and BJS calculates the formula grants. JAG funds are distributed to states, localities, and tribal jurisdictions based on resident population and violent crime data reported to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program. In total, approximately $255.8 million was allocated for the FY 2015 JAG awards.\nTITLE: Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program, 2015 (NCJ 249105)\nAUTHOR: Alexia D. Cooper and Shelley S.
