White, who is running for re-election, bitterly opposes the measure as an attack on the treasurer’s independence.\nState and private-sector auditors have criticized White for failing to prepare timely and accurate financial statements for the Council.\nThose duties would be shifted to the appointed finance director, Scott A. Schrader.\nThe city will pay Micro Graphics $3,050 for 8,000 of the 6-by-9-inch cards. “It’s educational. It’s not advocacy,” Mayor Anne E. McCaffrey said. “The school district does it all the time.”\nCorporation Counsel John J. Ottaviano said the proposition is on the back of the paper ballots now used for elections, and election inspectors are not allowed to call voters’ attention to it.\n“It’s my position that if you don’t educate the public, very few, if any, will know to turn it over,” Ottaviano said.\n“My personal opinion is, I don’t think we should spend the money,” said Alderwoman Anita Mullane, D-2nd Ward. As a former election inspector, she said, “I’m telling you, the first thing they do is flip it over to put it in the machine.”\nIn other matters at last week’s meeting, McCaffrey presented the Council with proposed water, sewer and refuse budgets for 2016.\nShe said that there will be no change in refuse or sewer charges but that there will be “a small increase in water only.” She said the amount has not yet been determined because water revenues are still being analyzed.\nThe Council had already received the general fund budget, which contains a 1.81 percent increase in the property tax levy. The Council scheduled a public hearing on the budget for 6 p.m. Nov. 4 and a budget vote for Nov. 18.\nThe Council also voted to spend $40,000 on a special antenna so that signals from the new countywide emergency radio system can be received in the basement of City Hall, where the Police Department garage is located. It’s one of the few places in Niagara County where the new radio network doesn’t work.\nThe Council also agreed to pay Medicare Part B premium reimbursements for five retirees who were not parties to the union lawsuits that the city settled over the issue earlier this year.\nMcCaffrey said Part B costs about $104 per retiree per month.\nAlso, the Council purchased a “correlator,” a machine designed to detect leaks in underground pipes, for $18,995 from Matchpoint Inc., of Wilmington, N.C.\nMcCaffrey also announced that Dennis McNamara will be promoted to chief water-treatment plant operator after Peter S. Degnan retires at the end of this month.\nemail: tprohaska@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:45:29.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
