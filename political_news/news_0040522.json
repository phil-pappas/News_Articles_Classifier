Unofficial mascot Boltman holds a sign with that message, March 2, 2015. \nThe NFL on Monday announced it will hold a public hearing in San Diego — part of an effort to include fans and the general public in on its assessment of the potential relocation of the Chargers to Carson in the L.A. area. The meeting is set for 7 p.m. Oct. 28 in the Spreckels Theatre. \nThe NFL said in a news release that tickets will be free and available on a first-come, first-served basis. Online registration begins at 8 a.m. Tuesday at nfl.com/sdhearing . The meeting will also be streamed online at nfl.com/publichearings . \nThe statement added that members of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's executive staff would be available to answer questions from attendees. Further public comments can be submitted via e-mail to sd.hearing@nfl.com from Tuesday until Nov. 13. \nThe meeting is one of three the NFL scheduled in cities where teams are considering relocating to Los Angeles. Hearings are also set in Oakland on Oct. 27 and St. Louis on Oct. 29. \nThe city of San Diego and the Chargers last month missed a deadline set by Mayor Kevin Faulconer. The mayor wanted to set a referendum on public funding of a new stadium for the Chargers, which could persuade the team to stay in San Diego . \nThe Chargers have been asking for a replacement for aging Qualcomm Stadium since 2002. With momentum growing for the league to return to Los Angeles, Chargers officials have acquired property in Carson on which the team could build a stadium — possibly in conjunction with the Oakland Raiders. \nStan Kroenke, owner of the St. Louis Rams, has plans to build a stadium in Inglewood, near the Los Angeles International Airport. \nOfficials in San Diego and St. Louis have proposed building new stadiums in an effort to prevent their teams from moving, and have presented them to league executives. \nNFL owners are expected to begin making decisions about which teams, if any, will move at the end of this year or early next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:51:24.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
