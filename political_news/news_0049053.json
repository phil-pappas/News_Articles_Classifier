Published 10:18 PM CDT Oct 13, 2015 \nDrake University students held a bipartisan watch party Tuesday night for the Democratic presidential debate. Other Stories \nWatch video \nIt's the first time students have had a chance to see the Democratic presidential candidates on the same stage, debating the issues. About 70 students watched from start to finish. \n“I would say Sanders is getting eaten up out there. I honestly was expecting more out of him. I would say Hillary is honestly being the winner as much as it pains me to say that. I would say she's probably pulling the majority of the wins right now,” said Logan Kentner, a Republican. \n“Especially since the Democratic field is not as crowded, we need five strong candidates that we all get behind because that's how issues and challenges to issues come out, and that's how we really refine what the Democratic Party stands for,” said Bri Steirer, a Democrat. \nWhen asked about the almost invisible Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, they said it was good to see them on stage, but that it's hard to believe anyone but Hillary Clinton would be the eventual Democratic nominee.

WE ASKED ONE REPUBLICAN AND ONE DEMOCRAT IF THE BACK AND FORTH ON STAGE IN LAS VEGAS GAVE THEM ANY DIRECTION ON VOTING FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT. I WOULD SAY SANDERS IS GETTING EATEN UP OUT THERE. I HONESTLY WAS EXPECTING MORE OUT OF HIM. I WOULD SAY HILLARY IS HONESTLY BEING THE WINNER AS MUCH AS IT -- AS MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY THAT. I WOULD SAY SHE'S PROBABLY PULLING THE MAJORITY OF THE WINS RIGHT NOW. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE DEMOCRATIC FIELD, SINCE IT IS NOT AS CROWDED WE NEED 5 STRONG , CANDIDATES THAT WE ALL GET BEHIND BECAUSE THAT'S HOW ISSUES AND CHALLENGES TO ISSUES COME OUT AND THAT'S HOW WE REALLY REFINE WHAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY STANDS FOR.
