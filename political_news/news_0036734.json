(Rich Schultz/Associated Press) October 20 at 5:57 PM Regarding the Oct. 17 news article “ Jeb Bush fires back at Trump for criticizing brother about 9/11 ”:\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made outlandish comments about how then-President George W. Bush handled the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, both before and after.\nThen-Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet “ knew in advance there would be an attack and he said so ,” Mr. Trump said. Before 9/11 there was definitely “noise” about possible attacks, just as there was before Pearl Harbor. But in both instances, discerning useful signals from the noise beforehand proved to be no easy matter. Hindsight is, of course, 20/20, and it is never that difficult to connect the dots after the fact; but 9/11, just like Pearl Harbor, was a genuine strategic surprise. I believe history will judge Mr. Bush on the effectiveness of his response to that catastrophic attack.\nAs someone who served successively as U.N. permanent representative, ambassador to Iraq, first director of national intelligence and finally deputy secretary of state during the Bush administration, I witnessed the intelligence, courage and decisiveness with which the president dealt with the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and the ensuing consequences.\nI believe that comments such as Mr. Trump’s debase the level of political discourse that is badly needed at a time when there is a dramatic resurgence of terrorism in the Middle East and the level of political instability there is dramatically greater than it was when Mr. Bush left office.\nJohn D. Negroponte , Washington\n●\nWould that there was a WASPish equivalent for the Yiddish word “chutzpah.” That term would nicely apply to Jeb Bush’s grossly tone-deaf claim that his brother George W. Bush “kept us safe” during the course of his presidency.
