MSNBC ' s Rachel Maddow will serve as host. \"I'm just so excited that it is here, and I'm excited that it's happening at all, \" Hayes said. \"This is going to be an event where candidates get more in depth on the issues.\" It ' s an exciting event for political junkies, but that excitement has turned to frustration for many. \nHundreds of people who signed up for a ticket were put on a wait list. Voters have voiced their concerns on the South Carolina Democratic Party Facebook page. Wyatt Bryson wrote, \"There wouldn't be a wait list if they left it at the original venue. I wish Facebook had a dislike button because I dislike the SCDP and how they incompetently handled this. \" Porsche Hill said, \"Move it back to the coliseum and release more tickets to the general public! Why was the venue changed last minute to begin with?\" \nBut according to Hayes, that wouldn ' t have solved the problem. \"If it had been at the Coliseum, and if we had charged $100 a ticket, I think it would have sold out in 10 or 20 minutes instead of 5.\" \nShe sees the overflow of interest as a positive sign. \"Not only are democrats enthusiastic about this primary nationwide, but we're enthusiastic in the south, and I think that's going to be the story that the nation hears.\" \nHayes says there will be fewer tickets available than first thought, but perhaps not as few as people think. \nThose on the waitlist have been told they ' ll be notified by October 30 th whether or not they ' ll receive a ticket. \nThe forum will take place on Friday, November 6.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/2015/10/18/winthrop-dem-forum-wait-list/74200272/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:23:59.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
