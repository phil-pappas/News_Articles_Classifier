I believe that Britain is stronger in Europe,” Lord Rose said.\n“The choice in the coming referendum is between remaining stronger, safer and better off inside Europe, or taking a leap into the unknown - risking our prosperity, threatening our safety, and diminishing our influence in the world.”\nLord Rose was widely credited with turning around the fortunes of M&S during his seven-year spell as chief executive between 2004 and 2011.\nGetty Background: Lord Rose is credited with reviving M&S\nHis appointment is a major coup for the ‘In’ campaign, which launches formally on Monday.\n“He brings unparalleled experience of business and enterprise to our board,” beamed the campaign’s executive director Will Straw, son of the former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack.\n“He knows the value that Britain’s membership of the EU brings to businesses right across the UK, and what would be at risk if we left.”\nThe appointment of Lord Rose - who was made a Tory peer last year - is a blow to the various ‘Out’ campaigns which say leaving Europe would be good for British business.\nIt also a boost to David Cameron , who is almost certain to campaign for Britain to stay in the EU.\nReuters Tensions: Angela Merkel is said to be frustrated with Cameron’s vague negotiations\nThe PM has pledged to hold the In/Out referendum before the end of 2017 following a renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Europe.\nTo that end Mr Cameron hosted German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Chequers for dinner for crunch talks on EU reform.\nMrs Merkel is understood to have grown increasingly frustrated at the PM’s failure to spell out his exact demands for a new-look Europe.\n“Germans like to know exactly what the details are. Then we can tick the boxes – we’ll do this, this and this,” a source close to the Chancellor said.\n“But the British are remaining vague, and we’re not making any progress. Soon the UK Government will have to make up their mind.”\nPoll loading …\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/Jack_Blanchard_", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics"], "published": "2015-10-10T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:03:41.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
