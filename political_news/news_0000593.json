So, he spoke of a “new politics”, indeed a “New Left”, and the great divide in society between the rich, powerful few and the rest of us. \nTalking about property and power, class and capital, he said: “Labour is the voice that says to the many, at home and abroad: ‘You don’t have to take what you’re given.’” Share article \nOf course, Mr Corbyn’s personal appeal to a large extent is his unstructured authenticity; so there was no Jeremy the Movie, no suit, yes, there was a tie but it was skewed and, apparently, borrowed. There were misspoken words and unfinished sentences but this, for some, just adds to his unfinished appeal. \nPolitics, however, is a ruthless pursuit. David Cameron and the Tories, who gather in Manchester at the weekend for their conference, will believe they have little to fear from the hairy Leftie, who might appeal to a certain section of society, disgruntled and disengaged from slick message politics, but they know they are not the ones to decide who will win power in 2020; Middle Britain will and Mr Corbyn has a long way to go to win it over.
