But his performance was widely panned, prompting questions about whether he will continue his campaign.\nChafee, a former Republican who became an independent before joining the Democratic party, has said he would carry on his campaign as long as he can keep raising important issues.\nChafee raised just $11,000 in the most recent fundraising quarter. Most of his money has come from more than $360,000 that he has loaned his campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:46:30.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
