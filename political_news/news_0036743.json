Gen. Michael K. Nagata, is stepping down as commander of American Special Operations forces in the Middle East, which made him responsible for the training program that ultimately produced only a few dozen fighters. That was a far cry from the 15,000 fighters that the program was going to train over a three-year period when it was formally started in December.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Qaeda Cell Leader Killed in Airstrike in Syria, Pentagon Says OCT. 18, 2015 Syrian Government Forces, Backed by Russian Jets, Strike at Rebel-Held Towns OCT. 15, 2015 Turkey Expresses Concern to U.S. and Russia Over Help for Syrian Kurds OCT. 14, 2015 Wary of Escalation in Syria, U.S. Is Waiting Out Putin’s Moves OCT. 8, 2015 U.S. Aims to Put More Pressure on ISIS in Syria OCT. 4, 2015 In Battle to Defang ISIS, U.S. Targets Its Psychology DEC. 28, 2014 The Obama administration this month abandoned its efforts to build up a new rebel force inside Syria to combat the Islamic State, announcing that it will instead use the money to provide ammunition and some weapons for groups already engaged in the battle. The shift in the program made for a logical time for General Nagata to move on, said the American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the action has not yet been formally announced.\nContinue reading the main story Graphic Untangling the Overlapping Conflicts in the Syrian War What started as a popular uprising against the Syrian government four years ago has become a proto-world war with nearly a dozen countries embroiled in two overlapping conflicts.\nOPEN Graphic General Nagata has been in the Special Operations job for more than two years and was overdue to switch assignments as part of the military’s regular rotation of senior officers, the American officials said. The setback in training Syrian rebels does not appear to have derailed his career as one of the Army’s rising stars.\nHe is in line to be awarded a third star, to lieutenant general, and take a senior position at the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington, said officials who emphasized that the decision was not yet final.\nSpokesmen for the military’s Central and Special Operations commands and the National Counterterrorism Center declined to comment.\nGeneral Nagata has fought in the shadows for most of his 33-year Army career, serving in Special Operations forces and classified military units in hot zones such as Somalia, the Balkans and Iraq.\nContinue reading the main story Graphic How Syrians Are Dying Over four years of war has forced more than four million to flee the country, fueling a migrant crisis in the Middle East and Europe.\nOPEN Graphic Colleagues say he has displayed bureaucratic acumen in counterterrorism jobs at the C.I.A. and the Pentagon, and diplomatic savvy as a senior American military liaison officer in Pakistan during the turbulent period there from 2009 to 2011.\nGeneral Nagata has also earned a reputation for creative thinking. Last year, he assembled an unofficial brain trust beyond the traditional realms of expertise within the Pentagon, State Department and intelligence agencies, in search of fresh ideas and inspiration for how to combat the Islamic State. Business professors, for example, were asked to examine the Islamic State’s marketing and branding strategies.\nTraining the Syrian rebels, however, proved to be a star-crossed task. In late July, many of the first 54 Syrian graduates of the military’s training program and the rebel unit in which they served came under attack by the Syrian affiliate of Al Qaeda. A day before the attack, two leaders of the American-backed group and several of its fighters were captured.\nClassified military assessments later concluded that the rebels were ill-prepared for an enemy attack and were sent back into Syria in numbers that were too small. They had no support from the local population and had poor intelligence about their foes.\nDefense Department training sites across the Middle East, including ones in Turkey and Jordan that General Nagata and his aides spent months preparing, will soon suspend almost all operations.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/16/world/middleeast/untangling-the-overlapping-conflicts-in-the-syrian-war-1445057244011/untangling-the-overlapping-conflicts-in-the-syrian-war-1445057244011-master495.png", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/05/world/MILITARY/MILITARY-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/16/world/16SYRIA/16SYRIA-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/world/09Prexy-web/09Prexy-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/11/world/middleeast/syria-war-deaths-1442010980408/syria-war-deaths-1442010980408-master495.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/15/world/15SYRIA/15SYRIA-thumbStandard-v2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:52:45.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
