Soos is suing the Niagara County Democratic Committee and the Niagara County Board of Elections over his firing from the board three years ago. \nThe suit, filed in Buffalo federal court, claims the party and Board of Elections violated Soos’ free speech rights when it terminated him from a part-time job at the board. \nThe firing came just a day after Soos, a Democrat, spoke out against Nicholas J. Forster’s candidacy for Democratic party chairman in October of 2012. Forster was elected and Soos said he was fired the next day. \nThe Buffalo News works to promote civil conversation in the comments section below.
