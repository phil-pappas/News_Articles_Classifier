(AP Photo/Hans Pennink) \nFrancis Ward is emeritus professor of journalism (retired) at Syracuse University. By Francis Ward \nThe biggest story of the month -perhaps the year- occurred Thursday when Rep. Kevin McCarthy,R-California, the current House majority leader, dropped a bombshell. He told his colleagues in the caucus of Republican House members that he was dropping out of the race to replace John Boehner as speaker of the House. All three cable networks (CNN, Fox News and MSNBC) gave saturation coverage throughout the day to McCarthy's bombshell. he story was also No. 1 with all three broadcast networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) in their evening newscasts. \nHowever, all of this coverage missed the underlying reason for this latest round of turmoil in the Republican Party. \nKevin McCarthy - the overwhelming favorite to replace Boehner - could not get the required 218 votes because he could not win over the 40 to 50 House Republicans who call themselves members of the \"Freedom Caucus.\" These are hardline right wing conservatives who are guided by a rigid, inflexible ideology of no compromise with President Obama and the Democrats. \nThese absolutist Republicans also believe it's OK to shut down the entire federal government (with all of its pain, suffering and hundreds of millions in costs) unless they get their way. \nThe Freedom Caucus members don't understand that democratic governments and inflexible ideology are incompatible. Compromise is the essence of democratic governance. Only dictatorships like Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union believe otherwise. \nThis episode is the latest in a long string of events which demonstrate clearly that the Republican Party is no longer a traditional political party. It has become part of a broad ideological movement whose sole purpose, like with all ideological movements, is to seize and hold power. \nA corresponding goal is to use the power of government to vanquish, not merely defeat, your political enemies. We're seeing that now with the obsessive GOP drive to discredit Hillary Clinton because she used a private email account. \nAn even worse example of Republican over zealousness is the maniacal threat to shut down the government unless Planned Parenthood is de-funded. \nThis political craziness is the main reason why there's gridlock in Congress. News media should recognize this in their coverage and stop pretending that Republicans and Democrats are equally to blame for the gridlock. After all, the Democrats have never threatened or actually shut down the government for any reason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:03:22.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
