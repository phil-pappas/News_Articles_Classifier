We have finally decided the house will go on the market Oct 16 and have two days of open houses. We keep house hunting as well and finding houses we like but we can't put in an offer until we have our house on the market. If we do no one will accept our offer without a kick out clause (meaning they can accept other offers and ditch ours in the meantime). But we are trying to be good sellers and are house hunting because our realtors tell us to. Its just aggravating. However we have decided what we want in a new house. The real answers are: one floor living as much as possible, lots of storage, and a fire place and garage. Plus in our price range and near enough to my husband's job. Nothing complicated or fancy. A newer kitchen and bathrooms and no wall paper would be nice. But we can be flexible. They are all blurring together. In the meantime, we just pack and 'negotiate' with each other – mostly 'do you remember the house with the whatchamacallit?' The answer is always 'no, which one was that'. Maybe someday we will find one that is memorable and we can actually remember it.\nCaroline’s Breast Cancer Blog", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:12:13.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
