Just last week, Rep. Richard Hanna, R-N.Y., said he thinks a \"big part\" of the investigation was to go after Clinton.\n  Jeb still livid about Trump 9/11 comments \"He kept us safe and united the country. There's no denying that,\" Bush said.\nBy Curt Mills • 10/18/15 10:41 AM A former staffer on the committee also criticized it as political.\nBut Gowdy said on CBS there's no evidence the committee is political, and that the two members who offered those comments aren't on the committee, and haven't been briefed on what it's doing. He said the former staffer left in June and also isn't up to date.\n\"Actually there's no evidence\" the committee is political, Gowdy said. \"There are three people who don't have any idea what they're talking about.\"\n\"These three wouldn't even be called as a witness in my former job, because they have no first-hand knowledge,\" he added, referring to his former job as a prosecutor.\nGowdy also said that when Clinton testifies before the committee on Thursday, his goal is not to tear down Clinton, but to learn what she knows about the days leading up to the deaths of four Americans. He said he thinks Clinton will know more about the security situation in Benghazi before the attack, and said he wants to know why Clinton apparently ignored warnings that the security situation was getting worse.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Top Khorasan leader killed in airstrike in Syria Abdul Mohsen Adballah Ibrahim al Charekh, aka Sanafi al-Nasr, moved money to al Qaeda leaders in Iraq.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/18/15 10:33 AM \"While violence was going up in Libya, why was our security going down?\" he asked.\nGowdy has said he only wanted to call Clinton as a witness once the committee had all her emails, but said she would testify even though all her emails have not been collected. He said the committee is still missing \"large tranches of information\" from Clinton.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:59:51.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
