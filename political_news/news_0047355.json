He now says all three are still missing.\nSpeaking late Friday at a press conference at an air force base in the Canary Islands, Pedro Morenes said a message received from Moroccan forces had been mistakenly understood to mean the crew had been rescued.\nHe blames a \"distortion of information\" for causing a lamentable state of uncertainty and confusion.\nThe helicopter ditched Thursday about 280 nautical miles (519 kilometers/320 miles) from its destination on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria having set off from Mauritania.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
