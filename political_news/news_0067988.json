At center stage will be Hillary Clinton, to her right is Bernie Sanders, to her left is Martin O'Malley, and on the ends will be Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. \nVice President Joe Biden hasn't announced if he'll seek the nomination, but even without official word, he's polling high enough to merit a spot on the debate stage if he wants it. (Video via The White House ) \nAlthough the candidates will be standing side-by-side on the stage, their actual rankings aren't nearly as even. A Real Clear Politics compilation of multiple polls has Clinton in the lead at 42 points, Sanders at 25.4, and Biden at 18.6. O'Malley, Webb and Chafee are all polling at fractions of 1 point. \nThe candidates will likely face questions about their stances on gun control, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and immigration, among other issues. CNN's coverage of the debate begins 8:30 p.m. Eastern. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images and music from Birocratic / CC BY ND 3.0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:40:59.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
