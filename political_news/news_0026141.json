It reflects what those briefed at the donor retreat describe as a difficult fundraising environment over the summer. \nBy comparison, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson raised more than $20 million over the same time period. \nThe quarterly figures mark a practical and symbolic measure of strength for all presidential campaigns, but they don't tell the whole story. \nRubio, like most of the 2016 presidential field, also benefits from an allied super PAC and nonprofit group that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money on his behalf. He's not legally allowed to coordinate with those groups, however. \nCombined with money raised earlier in the year, Rubio's campaign started October with $11 million cash on hand, according to Thursday's donor briefing. That's about what Carson had in the bank after expenses, suggesting that Rubio's team is spending its resources more cautiously than some of his competitors. \nOverall, the Rubio campaign told donors Thursday that fundraising improved in September, when it raised $1 million in online donations alone. October, which wasn't included in the quarterly total, will be the campaign's best month so far, according to the briefing. \n__ \nThis story corrects the Rubio campaign's cash on hand to $11 million, rather than the previously reported $14 million.
