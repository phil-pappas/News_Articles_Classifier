(Photo: AP) Kathmandu: Faced with an acute shortage of aviation fuel, Nepal on Thursday airlifted 66 tonnes of the jet fuel from Kolkata to replenish its depleted reserves amid worries that the continued blockade by protesting Madhesis in the southern plains could ground domestic carriers.\nNepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) dispatched its Boeing 757 to Kolkata to airlift the aviation turbine fuel (ATF).\nThe Boeing made two rounds to Kolkata, NAC officials said. This is possibly the second time when Nepal airlifted fuel from India, after 1989 when then Royal Nepal Airlines had made a similar airlift from Bangladesh to keep the kitchen fires burning after its southern border with India was sealed.\nNepal is reeling under severe fuel shortage as agitating Madhes-based parties have blocked all entry points to press for their demands, which includes more representation and rights for the India-origin residents of the plains in the new Constitution.\nOnly a fuel tankers of fuel and cooking gas have managed to entered Nepal from India over the past couple of weeks because of the protests near the main border points. NAC spokesperson Ram Hari Sharma told local media that after the Boeing is defueled, it would be sent back to conduct its regular services on the Kuala Lumpur and Doha sectors. He said a Boeing 757 could carry 33 tonnes of fuel in the tanks in its wings. \"The jet requires 7.5 tonnes of fuel for the roundtrip,\" he said.\n\"Defueling the aircraft will yield at least 20 tonnes after leaving enough in its tanks to conduct its regular flights,\" he added.\n\"This will help NOC to boost its reserves. We can airlift more fuel as per the government's order and need.\"\nThe daily fuel requirement of domestic carriers amounts to 50 tonnes. Sharma said NAC planes would not be transporting other fuels like petrol, liquefied petroleum gas and diesel.\n Nepal Nepal oil reserves Nepal constitution violence World Also Read Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras calls referendum on bailout for July 5 UN human rights body accepts call for postwar Sri Lanka accountability Robot kills man at Volkswagen plant in Germany Al-Qaeda backs new Somali Shebab chief: statement", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/world-neighbours/article/nepal-airlifts-66-tonnes-atf-kolkata-boost-reserves", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Nepal-fuel.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Nepal-fuel.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:42:34.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
