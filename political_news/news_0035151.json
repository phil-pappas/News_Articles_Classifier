Party spokesman Chavanond Intarakomalyasut believed many people approved of the amnesty approach but it must be based on sincerity and discussion at every level. Stakeholders should not raise the issue because it might ignite another round of conflict, the spokesman warned. The Democrat spokesman did not believe the NRSA was authorised to propose an amnesty, saying it was a case of waiting to see its resolution on this matter. He said the 200-member NRSA should not propose only those items that serve its interests or it would be impossible to implement reforms. It should prioritise its agenda so results materialise, he added. Seri Suwanpanon, chairman of the NRSA's meeting regulation writing committee, said politicians and assembly members Nikorn Chamnong and Witthaya Kaew-paradai had made useful contributions. Nikorn is from the Chart Thai Pattana Party and Witthaya the Democrat Party. The core regulation includes realising the reform plans done by the now-defunct National Reform Council, Seri said, adding that the major challenge facing the reform effort was get all sides to cooperate. The meeting regulation was almost done and the panel was waiting only for further comments from the \"five rivers\", which would meet on Wednesday, he said, in reference to the organisations set up after the coup in May last year. 304 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:08:27.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
