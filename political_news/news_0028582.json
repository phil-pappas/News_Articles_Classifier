And, most importantly, to provide clear direction.” \nBusinessGreen reports Ms Solberg argued a carbon tax would prove a key mechanism in providing a stable investment environment for clean technologies and called for the United Nations to agree to a global carbon price at the Paris climate change summit that begins at the end of November. \nWhile the Paris Summit could provide a boost to existing carbon markets and pave the way for a market mechanism for tackling emissions from emissions and shipping, a global carbon price agreement remains unlikely. \nHowever, growing numbers of political and business leaders, including a group of influential fossil fuel companies, have recently stepped up call for a global carbon pricing policy. \n“Norway has had a carbon tax in place for a long time,” Ms Solberg said, rejecting the argument carbon pricing could damage economies. \n“This has not slowed down industrial development. Rather, it has encouraged innovation and the development of solutions that reduce emissions and bring down operating costs. \n“On a global level, if there was ever a time when we should put a price on carbon emissions and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, it is now.” \nDespite Norway’s ambitious action on climate change, the government has been criticised recently by campaigners for it’s continued push to explore oil reserves in the Arctic. \nIn an open lette r to Ms Solberg published on Huffington Post this week, climate scientist Professor James Hansen, warned that Norway’s decision to award licenses in the Barents Sea could harm ecosystems most vulnerable to climate change. \n“What Norway chooses to do in the Arctic can have a massive effect, for better or worse,” he wrote. \n“We still have a small window of opportunity to avoid climate tipping points and stabilise the climate, but not if the race to exploit Arctic oil reserves continues unchecked.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:11:33.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
