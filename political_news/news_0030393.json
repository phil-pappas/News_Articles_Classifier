Still, the moment Wednesday when he announced that he wouldn't be getting into the race was a victory for a campaign that's felt its momentum gaining in recent days.\nBiden's entry into the Democratic field would have shifted dynamics, creating new challenges -- and adding new costs -- for the Clinton campaign. Instead, the Democratic front-runner's team can stay the course it set months ago, with no other establishment opponents, and needs to focus on only one major opponent in the primary, Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator has strength with certain constituencies but is struggling to build support among African-Americans and Latinos.\nSanders' efforts to do so, and to solidify his support from union leaders -- who like his populist rhetoric but have questions about his electability -- will be complicated by the sense of gathering momentum for the candidate he has been unable to dislodge as front-runner.\nAfter a tough July and August, Clinton got back on track in September and picked up more steam last week with a strong debate performance. Her allies are so optimistic that she'll do well during her day of testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, that they have planned a Friday rally in Northern Virginia with Clinton loyalist and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. That night, she'll appear on the Democratic-friendly MSNBC with Rachel Maddow before heading Saturday to the Iowa Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, which her allies hope will be the culmination of a 10-day victory lap. Former President Bill Clinton will speak at a pre-dinner rally for his wife, marking the first time this cycle that he's delivered a speech at a Clinton campaign event, and Katy Perry will perform.\nIt's not as if the field is cleared for Clinton. In the days before withdrawing from the race he never formally entered, Biden gave Clinton's opponents plenty of ammunition, including suggesting that her characterization of Republicans as \"enemies\" was \"naive.\" Clinton still faces challenges, for example, in solidifying union support, though Biden's decision to stay out of the race removes an important obstacle.\nWhile Clinton has made commitments to eliminate a tax on health plans opposed by unions and opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, she came to the positions late and key unions, including AFSCME and the Communication Workers of America, have held off on endorsing in the Democratic primary in part because of support for Sanders among union members, said a labor source. And not all Biden backers are ready to jump on board: \"I'm not inspired by the Clinton campaign,\" Dick Harpootlian, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman, said after Biden announced his decision. \"I'm not inspired by her.\"\nStill, Clinton's method of handling what could have been a Biden crisis says much about how she might consolidate her recent gains: During two months of intense chatter about a possible challenge from the vice president, Clinton stayed disciplined and measured, keeping to a script that erred on the side of generosity. Whenever reporters asked about the vice president's flirtations with a campaign, Clinton repeated that Biden deserved space to mourn the death of his son Beau and time to figure out whether he should run.\n\"I think that Secretary Clinton was prepared one way or the other,\" said Minyon Moore, a longtime Clinton adviser. \"She has always maintained that she has a great deal of respect for the vice president. I think she was one of the first out there to say, you know, this is a deeply personal decision and he needs to be able to have the space to make that decision.\"\nClinton's aides followed her lead, answering questions with the same degree of deference to the vice president. Her campaign stayed focused on the same game plan it started running months ago and left some preparations for a potential Biden entry to Correct The Record, the David Brock-founded super PAC coordinating with the campaign, which was conducting opposition research on him.\n\"It didn't alter her course. She had to continue to do what she was doing,\" Moore said of the effect of Biden's deliberations on Clinton and her team.\nThe one exception was campaign chairman John Podesta, who said last week on MSNBC that if Biden wanted to run, \"it is time he make that decision.\" Given his role in the campaign and his decadeslong relationships with Biden and with the Clintons, he was in a unique position. Still, Clintonites distanced themselves and pointed to the candidate's insistence not to interfere with the vice president's process.\nOn the stump in recent weeks, Clinton tested out some attack lines, but never directly mentioned Biden. Her comments at town halls in New Hampshire and Iowa this month that she'd be able to make progress on tightening gun laws because she is \"determined\" to do it could be interpreted as a veiled criticism of President Barack Obama -- and his point man on guns, Biden -- for failing to do so in the wake of a series of mass shootings. But Clinton never came close to directly criticizing Biden, which added sincerity to the call she made to him after is Rose Garden speech and the statement she issued afterward, praising him as a \"good man and a great vice president.\"\n\"I admire his devotion to family, his grace in grief, his grit and determination on behalf of the middle class, and his unyielding faith in America's promise,\" she said.\nSanders also phoned Biden after the vice president's announcement and the two spoke later Wednesday afternoon, according to longtime Sanders aide Michael Briggs.\nBiden had been heading toward a no for days but didn't make his final decision until Tuesday night, after speaking at two events honoring former Vice President Walter Mondale, sources close to the vice president said. On stage during the day, he had been less veiled in his criticism of Clinton -- though he did not go after her by name -- but also faced backlash for offering up a new account of his advice to Obama on the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n(Mike Dorning and Margaret Talev contributed to this report.)\n(c)2015 Bloomberg News\nVisit Bloomberg News at www.bloomberg.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1741473&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1741473&h=What+Joe+Biden%27s+decision+means+for+Hillary+Clinton", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1741473"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:52:21.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
