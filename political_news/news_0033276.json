Mike Miller and House Speaker Michael Busch joined Republican leaders Tuesday to address the Maryland Chamber of Commerce. (Amy Davis / Baltimore Sun) Michael Dresser Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun GOP leader: \"I don't always know what's affecting your business.\" \nCAMBRIDGE – General Assembly leaders assured Maryland's business community Tuesday that while Democrats and Republicans may disagree vigorously on issues, Annapolis is not Washington and the state legislature does not resemble a \"dysfunctional\" Congress. \nSenate President Thomas V. Mike Miller and House Speaker Michael E. Busch, the Assembly's leading Democrats, emphasized education as a priority as they appeared on a panel at the Maryland Chamber of Commerce's Business Policy Conference here. \nThey were jointed by House Minority Leader Nic Kipke and Senate Minority Leader J. B. Jennings, who stressed goals of protecting business from excessive regulation and advancing Republican Gov. Larry Hogan's program of economic change. \nAnd they urged business people to be aggressive in raising alarms when a state action threatens their livelihood. \n\"You need to reach out to us. I don't always know what's affecting your business,\" said Jennings, a Baltimore County Republican. \nJennings' message followed a similar exhortation from Lt. Gov. Boyd Rutherford, who represented the Hogan administration. \nRutherford presented a sunny view of the state's economy, saying that private sector job creation had improved to 7th nationally and first in the region since Hogan took office in January. \n\"The long-term trend is even more positive,\" Rutherford said. \nThe lieutenant governor offered no clues to specific proposals the administration plans to introduce in the 2016 legislative session, which begins in January. \nWith few specifics on the table, the four legislative leaders had little to fight about. Instead they compared the operations of the legislature favorably with a GOP-led Congress that Miller called \"the worst in the history of the United States\" without getting pushback from their Republican counterparts. \nJennings agreed that the level of partisanship is lower in Annapolis. \n\"For the most part, we all get along,\" said Jennings. \nBusch put his finger on what is likely to be a bone of contention during the session despite the legislature's limited clout in setting transportation priorities – Hogan's decision to scuttle the $2.9 billion Red Line light rail project in Baltimore. \n\"There is no plan for Baltimore city for any type of transit,\" Busch said. \nThe speaker also called for a stepped-up effort to solve a long-standing problem for the port of Baltimore — obsolete tunnels leading to the port that can't accommodate trains carrying double-stacked containers. \n\"The port is not going to expand to its full potential\" until that problem is solved, Busch said. \nThere was some partisan skirmishing around the edges of Tuesday's discussion. After Kipke touted Hogan's plan to spend nearly $2 billion on transportation projects around the state, Busch noted that Hogan had proposed to roll back the chamber-supported gas tax increase that made much of that spending possible. \nOne of the few specific issues discussed was a proposal – which died in committee last year – to require employers to offer paid sick leave to employees. \nMiller and Jennings agreed that the bill would likely come up again. Miller said he isn't sure whether the measure – opposed by most businesses – would pass. \nWhile the emphasis Tuesday was on working together, leaders of both parties indicated they expect contention as lawmakers grapple over what to do with a possible budget surplus. \n\"It's going to be an interesting session. You're going to see some fights,\" Jennings said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:38:23.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
