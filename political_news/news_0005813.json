(Photo: AFP) Nagpur : Ishant Sharma returned to competitive cricket with an impressive effort of 3/26 as Delhi restricted Vidarbha to 222 for six on the first day of their Ranji Trophy Group A match, in Nagpur on Thursday.\nIshant worked up good pace and bounce from the Feroz Shah Kotla strip after Gautam Gambhir opted to field. The lanky speedster bowled in four short spells and got wickets in three of those spells.\nFor Vidarbha, Faiz Fazal (55) and Subramanium Badrinath (44) added 89 runs for the third wicket in 38.4 overs. While they steadied the innings from 16/2 after Wasim Jaffer (0) was run out without playing a ball.\nThe other important partnership was 71 for sixth wicket between Aditya Shanware (41) and Jitesh Sharma (35 batting). However, the day was about Ishant showing that he is a class apart from other bowlers. While fellow paceman Pradeep Sangwan (2/34) barely got the ball to bounce above shin, Ishant was getting it to rear awkwardly. Ganesh Sathish got one that bounced and the resultant slash was taken by Vaibhav Rawal at third slip.\nHis second wicket was well set Fazal, who gloved it to Mohit Ahlawat behind stumps as it kicked up from length. Shanware at the end of the day got one that had shade extra bounce and moved away as Ahlawat took a simple catch.\nIt was Jitesh, whose cheeky shots got the score moving after Vidarbha were stuck for better part of the day.\nBrief Scores: Vidarbha 1st innings: 222 for 6 (F Fazal 55, S Badrinath 44; I Sharma 3/26) v/s Delhi\n Cricket Ishant Sharma Ranji Trophy Gautam Gambhir Delhi vs Vidarbha Also Read 'Unreachable' Ishant Sharma not included in Delhi Ranji team Blame on Virat Kohli for Ishant Sharma’s ‘over aggressiveness’ Father promises to talk aggressive Ishant Sharma into staying calm on field I want Ishant Sharma to be aggressive, will be the first one to push him: Ravi Shastri", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/sports-cricket/article/ranji-trophy-vidarbha-find-ishant-sharma-too-hot-handle", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ISHAFP_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/ISHAFP_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:55:18.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
