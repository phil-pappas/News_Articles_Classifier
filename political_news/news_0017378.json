More NHS managers alarmed at unions reform bill \nBut Mr Liu suggested the president would not take kindly to being reprimanded on human rights during his view; Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has promised to raise the issue next week. \n“We don’t shy away from talking about human rights,” Mr Liu told a press briefing. “What we are against is to use human rights to interfere with other countries’ internal affairs and to try to impose your own system on to others.” \nMr Liu said British people “would feel offended” if China lectured Britain on human rights. “Likewise,” he added. \nMr Xi is expected to have a private meeting with the Labour leader and will also see him at a state banquet. Mr Corbyn’s spokesman said the Labour leader would express his views “in the appropriate way”. \nDavid Cameron and George Osborne have energetically courted Beijing since 2012, when diplomatic relations were put into the “deep freeze” after the prime minister met the Dalai Lama in London. \nThe tone of the state visit will be relentlessly upbeat on both sides, with Mr Liu saying that Britain was “coming up from behind” after losing ground to other European countries in terms of relations with Beijing. \nConcerns raised over Chinese-backed project in London’s Docklands \nLatest scheme stalls despite British politicians’ efforts to attract foreign cash \nRead more \nThe ambassador said the improvement in relations was down to the fact that “political mutual trust has been very much enhanced”. Mr Cameron’s critics say he has soft-pedalled on any criticism of Beijing. \nThe Chinese president will spend four nights in Britain next week, visiting Buckingham Palace, giving a speech at Westminster and visiting the City of London and Manchester. \n“This is a major, historic opportunity for China-UK relations,” Mr Liu said. While Mr Osborne has spoken of a “golden decade”, the Chinese appear to have escalated the concept to “a golden era”. \nAsked whether this era might be interrupted if Britain opted to leave the EU, Mr Liu said he hoped not, but added: “We would like to see a strong Europe and a strong UK. I do hope the UK and Europe can work out an arrangement that suits both sides.” \nMr Xi is expected to use a speech at Guildhall next Wednesday to set out how he hopes to make London the global centre for offshore Chinese finance .
