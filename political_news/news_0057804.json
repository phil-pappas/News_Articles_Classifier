LOUS – The Cardinals took Game 1 of the NLDS from the Cubs, and they took one of their storylines, too.\nThe Cubs rookies, developing at jetspeed and playing a huge role in their push to the postseason, sputtered in a 4-0 loss to the Cardinals Friday night. Call it a rookie hazing if you will.\nThird baseman Kris Bryant was 0-for-4 with two strikeouts and an inning-ending double play.\nAddison Russell did break up John Lackey’s no-hitter with a single leading off the sixth, and Kyle Schwarber had two hits and a walk.\nBut they were upstaged, mightily, by Cardinals rooks Stephen Piscotty and Tommy Pham, playing in their first postseason games. Piscotty doubled and scored the only run that was scored during the first seven innings of the game and Piscotty and Pham, the latter as a pinch-hitter, homered in the eighth to break the game open.\n“Chicago has great young guys and we also have great young guys so it’s going to be a battle,’’ Cardinals veteran catcher Yadier Molina said. “Their rookies have talent. So do ours.’’\nSchwarber, the hitting star in the 4-0 Wild Card victory over the Pirates that propelled the Cubs into this series, had talked about being nervous before that game. Before this one, he felt a peace about him. It was like manager Joe Maddon said, his kids had experienced a Game 7 of the World Series type atmosphere and passed the test.\n“I don’t worry about these rookies,’’ veteran catcher David Ross said. “What they showed me in Pittsbugh, I don’t have one bit of doubt about anybody in this room, that’s for sure.\n“I don’t’ care how old you are, the environment in Pittsburgh we’re not going to see anything more than that. We’ve just got to execute and hope [the Cardinals] don’t.’’\n“I would say that our team was amped up, just as it was in the Wild Card game,’’ Russell said.\nThere were no signs of rookies falling about in the Cubs clubhouse, not after a first defeat after nine straight wins including the Wild Card victory.\n“That’s why it’s the first one to three [wins],’’ Schwarber said. “It’s a race, it’s not a sprint. The Pittsburgh game was a sprint. This was a nice little jog. We need to pace ourselves. If we go out and win this next game we put ourselves in a pretty good situation. Going back home to our home crowd.\n“Actually I wasn’t too nervous at all. It was weird. I was expecting to be nervous but I wasn’t nervous before the game, and going out there for batting practice, nothing. It was calm, I kept my emotions in check which was a good thing. And you end up with a loss. It happens.’’\nOn the postgame interview podium, where the night’s heroes talk, Piscotty and Pham sat side by side.\n“You know, in the minor leagues we’re kind of groomed to come here and contribute right away,” Pham said. “The expectations are high for us. So when we come here we expect to help out the team.’’\n“The veterans, sharing some advice to us younsters about the moment [said] it was going to feel different and it did. But they stressed, ‘relax, breathe, try to handle the nerves better than the other team and I think everyone on our team did that tonight.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:10:44.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
