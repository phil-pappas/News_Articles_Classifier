Authorities sought a warrant for blood evidence of drugs.\nHospital officials provided no immediate word on the condition of Odom, a 35-year-old former Los Angeles Laker and member-by-marriage of the Kardashian clan, who was found face down at the Love Ranch Tuesday afternoon, according to brothel owner Dennis Hof.\nBut the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who visited Odom at the hospital Wednesday, said doctors believe he is recovering after being totally unresponsive Tuesday.\n\"Apparently from what the doctor said, he was much better off today than yesterday. He at least has some responsiveness now,\" Jackson said.\nKardashian and some of Odom's childhood friends were by his side, and former Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant visited him last night, Jackson said.\n\"He's got tubes in him now but we felt inspired by his presence,\" he said. \"We're just holding hands and hoping he can bounce back.\"\nOdom started \"throwing up all kinds of stuff\" when the 911 operator told them to turn him on his side, Hof told The Assoicated Press in a phone interview.\nNye County, Nevada, Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said investigators sought a warrant to obtain a blood sample to determine if Odom suffered a drug or alcohol overdose.\nHof said Odom arrived alone Saturday and \"spent time socializing with some of my girls,\" but wasn't seen taking any illegal drugs. \"He was polite and reserved, and he told multiple employees that he was there to get some privacy and spend some time relaxing,\" he said in a statement.\n\"He largely kept to himself, and at no time did he engage in any drug use in the presence of anyone in the house. He did drink alcohol from our bar, and was taking some herbal sexual enhancement capsules. At his request, he spent Monday evening alone in his suite,\" the statement said.\n\"It's incredibly sad,\" Hof told the AP. \"He just wanted to get away, have a good time and relax.\"\nOdom emerged as one of the most promising basketball talents of his generation after a difficult childhood in Queens, where his mother died of cancer when he was 12 and his father was addicted to heroin. He eventually won two NBA championship rings and an Olympic medal, and became a star on reality TV. But his life never seemed free of struggle and tragedy, most tragically the death of his infant son in 2006.\nHe spent most of his 14-year NBA career in Los Angeles with the Lakers and Clippers, becoming a fan favorite and beloved teammate. Then he took fame even farther, carrying on a whirlwind romance with Khloe Kardashian. Their huge 2009 wedding was taped for the E! network, and their marriage chronicled on the \"Khloe & Lamar\" show, where Odom he appeared to be a romantic partner, very much wanting more children that never came.\nOdom appeared on nearly two dozen episodes of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" and several installments of \"Kourtney & Kim Take Miami\" as well as the show with his wife, which aired in 2011 and 2012.\nAfter seven years with the Lakers, he felt crushed in December 2011 when the club traded him. He played his final NBA game 18 months later, and his last years were a spiral of arrest, estrangement and widespread rumors of drug use.\nKardashian filed for divorce in 2013, citing irreconcilable differences, his behavior became more erratic. His divorce from Kardashian has not yet received final approval from a judge, and she .\nHof, who owns several legal brothels in Nevada, told the AP that his staff had picked up Odom from a home in Las Vegas on Saturday, and he seemed \"happy, he was sleeping every night,\" while visiting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:28:48.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
