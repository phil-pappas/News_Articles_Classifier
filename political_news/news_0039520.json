Too often care is being devolved to the community without support and funding following. \n\" This Government is failing everyday people in their most vulnerable moments. Its priorities are wrong. We know their focus on protecting the interests of a privileged few means more financial stress for hard-working families. \n\" Now is not the time to be cutting the real value of health funding. Yet that is precisely what has happened. \n\"The trends are worrying. The number of patients seen in less than 3 weeks has fallen in the past year, and the number taking more than 8 weeks to be seen has risen. \n\"As Mental Health Awareness Week draws to a close, it is shocking to learn that across New Zealand, adult mental health callouts are up 28 per cent in just four years. \n\"The tripling of emergency department presentations shows a neglected health system under strain. This has real human consequences,\" Labour’s Associate Health Spokesperson David Clark says. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
