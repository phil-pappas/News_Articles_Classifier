But both the DNC and the Republican National Committee said they will not add a formal debate to the 2016 presidential debate schedule. \nThe Black Lives Matter network said that’s not good enough and has launched a petition drive to get a presidential debate devoted to its themes. \n“We deserve better,” the group said. “Debates that are shaped by the corporate media will never adequately address the issues we care about. We renew our call for more debates, including a debate that takes seriously the most pressing issues of our time.” \nOn Thursday, President Obama spoke out on behalf of the movement, saying racial bias and excessive force in law enforcement are “a legitimate issue we’ve got to address.” \nThe organization said it wants the candidates to focus on issues including “over policing and blue on black violence; violence and economic disenfranchisement of transgender people; patterns of incarceration leading to the world’s most bloated prison industry; systemic and historic forms of economic policies that level black communities; attacks on organized labor and the dismantling of the safety net, the criminalization of immigrants, and more.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:11:27.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
