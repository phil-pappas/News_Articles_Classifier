So how far can European history help us understand the dangerous and unpredictable conflict spreading across the region? \nThere are difficulties, of course. For one, our forebears, most of them illiterate, did not have access to the powerful media that make it easy to mobilise and terrorise masses of people. Nevertheless, the devastation visited upon Iraq and Syria echoes the horrors of Europe’s Thirty Years’ War that started in 1618. When the town of Magdeburg was sacked by mainly Catholic imperial troops in 1631, says Professor Diarmaid MacCulloch, a leading Reformation scholar, the majority of the German city’s 20,000, mainly Protestant, inhabitants are said to have died. They were “either killed outright or burnt alive in the fires which raged through the city and left it a wasteland”. More Japanese universities need brighter ideas \nIt is difficult to read this now without thinking of the Syrian city of Aleppo , devastated by the barrel bombs of President Bashar al-Assad in pursuit of overwhelmingly Sunni rebels; or of the beautiful cities of Yemen destroyed by air power of the Wahhabi Saudis as they seek to defeat Shia rebels. \nFor all the devastation, however, the wars helped make Europe what it is now. The formula cuius regio, eius religio (religion belongs to the ruler) was ratified by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. It increased the power of European states, both Protestant and Catholic, transforming them from loose dynastic territories to tightly organised monarchies, such as the Protestant states of Sweden and Brandenburg-Prussia or the Catholic states of France and Spain and the Habsburg empire. In depth \nFurther reading \nAs in early modern Europe, so in today’s Middle East . In Iran, radical Shia clerics oversee the government, while those who think religion and politics should be separate keep their heads down or languish in jail. In Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism, an extreme and literalist version of Sunni Islam, serves as a state ideology legitimising the absolutism of the House of Saud. The Saudi king styles himself guardian of the two holy shrines, at Medina and Mecca, echoing the absolutism of Louis XIV and XV, who called themselves the “most Christian” kings. \nIn parallel with the political rivalries of 17th century Europe, sectarian tension in Iraq, Syria and Yemen has been stoked by regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which occupy opposite ends of the Sunni-Shia spectrum. \nWahhabism began as an attack by Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, an 18th century reformer, on practices he considered idolatrous. Wahhabis allied to the al-Sauds, ancestors of today’s Saudi ruling family, set upon far-flung shrines in Mecca and Medina in the early 1800s, as well as the holy Shia cities of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq. \nIn the pursuit of purity, today’s Wahhabis have subjected local tribal systems to the hegemony of the house of Saud. Attacks on local religious and cultural practices by Saudi clerics evoke the iconoclasm of the Puritans who wrecked the cathedrals of Scotland, while the alliance of religion with state power has precedents in events such as Louis XIV’s expulsion of the Protestant Huguenots from France . Saudi iconoclasm adds to the wealth of the ruling clan by permitting the construction of wedding-cake style towers surrounding the Kaaba, the sacred cuboid temple at the heart of Mecca. \nFor all its extremist elements with Shia militias in Iraq attacking Sunni districts and Sunni imams prevented from leading prayers in Iran, Shia Islam is more akin to Catholicism in the sense that it is far less iconoclastic. Where the Islamist militants of Isis, fuelled by an extreme version of Wahhabism, legitimise the destruction of Palmyra on the grounds that the relics of antiquity are idolatrous, the Shia Hizbollah have occupied the region surrounding the great temple of Jupiter in the Lebanese town of Baalbek for decades without engaging in iconoclastic destruction. \nGiven the Wahhabi record, it seems paradoxical, not to say tragic, that the west has chosen to ally itself with the fount of iconoclastic puritanism. \nIn the long term, religious conflicts of early modern Europe gave rise to the enlightenment and the regimes of religious pluralism we have today. As this took at least three centuries, we can only hope that Muslims find a much more rapid path to mutual toleration. \nThe writer is author of ‘Encounters with Islam’ Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:16:37.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
