The majority — 62 percent — of the crashes were rear-end collisions most likely caused by close signal spacing, the study says.\nTalks of the realignment have been ongoing since 2009 , but the city didn't have the money to pay for it.\nThe city has received a $2 million Ohio Department of Transportation grant, and is applying for more funding from the Northeast Ohio Areawide Coordinating Agency .\nThis year, Westlake paid $15,000 to reposition signals north of the interchange and add a left turn signal for northbound Columbia Road traffic to head westbound on I-90.\nThe realignment project will go out for bid in the spring, and work will begin sometime after the Republican National Convention scheduled for July.\nWork will take a year to complete, but two traffic lanes will be maintained during construction, city Engineer Bob Kelly said.\nFor more Westlake news , like me on Facebook .\nFollow me on Twitter: Follow @ChandaNeely", "external_links": ["http://www.noaca.org/", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Chanda-Neely-reporter/365300653673603", "https://twitter.com/ChandaNeely"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:00:06.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
