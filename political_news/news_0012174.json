So how better than to make outrageous comments about Bernie Sanders? \nRight Wing Watch via LGF : \n“It amazes me and it actually kind of scares me,” Paul said. “I’ve been spending more time going after Bernie and socialism because I don’t want America to succumb to the notion that there’s anything good about socialism. I think it’s not an accident of history that most of the times when socialism has been tried that attendant with that has been mass genocide of people or any of those who object to it. Stalin killed tens of millions of people. Mao killed tens of millions of people. Pol Pot killed tens of millions of people. When you have a command economy, when everything is dictated from one authority, that’s socialism, but it doesn’t come easily to those who resist it.” \nYeah, those Danish people are all about mass genocide, right? We hear so many news stories about how the Danes line up their citizens and send them off to their deaths because...socialism. \nRand Paul should stick to his talking points and not stray so far off the reservation, because talk like this is irresponsible, and political discourse at its lowest low. \nListen below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:54:06.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
