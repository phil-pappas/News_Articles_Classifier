With this other government bodies like the RBI, SEBI and some states cannot avail of the card for their social welfare schemes. The SC subsequently referred the issue to a constitution bench at least of five judges.\nThe bench headed by Justice J Chelameswar made it clear that all applications seeking \"modification, clarification and relaxation\" of its August 11 interim order will be heard by the constitution bench itself.\nThe Centre, RBI, SEBI, IRDA, TRAI, Pension Fund Regulatory Authority and states like Gujarat and Jharkhand had recently moved the court and pleaded strongly for voluntary use of Aadhaar cards for providing benefits of various schemes, other than PDS and LPG, at the doorsteps of the aged and the weaker sections.\nHowever, the pleas for relaxation of the August 11 order restricting the use of Aadhaar cards for PDS scheme and LPG distribution scheme, was opposed by those petitioners on whose PILs the apex court had said these cards will not be mandatory for availing benefits of welfare schemes.\nEarlier, the Supreme Court, while terming Aadhaar as optional, had barred the authorities from sharing personal biometric data collected for enrolment under the scheme.\nIt had also passed a slew of directions for the Centre till the matter was finally decided by a larger bench.\nThe bench was hearing a batch of pleas against decisions of some states to make Aadhaar cards compulsory for a range of activities including payment of salary, provident fund disbursement, marriage and property registration.\nThe Centre's counsel is likely to mention as Thursday for urgent hearing of the case.\nâ€”With inputs from Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:48:40.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
