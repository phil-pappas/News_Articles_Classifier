For more information, visit the DOT’s website.\nSource: SCDOT\nOnce stricken with helplessness as floodwater filled their homes, many Lowcountry residents set their sights Thursday on getting life back to normal even as authorities, including Gov. Nikki Haley, warned of more devastation to come.\nFlood warning extended for tri-county\nA flood warning has been extended for Berkeley, Charleston and Dorchester counties until 2:30 p.m. Friday.\nArea emergency management agencies are reporting that high water levels and flooding is continuing. Although little to no additional rainfall is expected through Friday, water levels are expected to only slowly recede across the tri-county area. Those who live near the Ashley, Edisto and Santee rivers and surrounding creeks and tributaries can expect flood levels to hold steady or even rise some.\nThe National Weather Service encourages anyone who lives near a river or creek to be prepared to evacuate if they keep rising. Locations that will experience flooding include Charleston, North Charleston, Mount Pleasant, Summerville, Goose Creek, Hanahan, Moncks Corner and McClellanville.\nAuthorities urge drivers to avoid flooded roadways.\nAfter flying over the Georgetown and Givhans Ferry areas in a helicopter, the governor urged people along the Santee and Edisto rivers to consider evacuating. At points on the Edisto south of Givhans Ferry, residents already have seen significant flooding, and it will get worse as runoff from heavy rainfall last weekend in the Midlands and the Upstate reaches the Lowcountry, she said.\nShelters\nSeveral shelters will be open for those affected by flooding of the Edisto and Santee rivers:\nC.C. Blaney Elementary School, 7184 S.C. Highway 162, Hollywood.\nMcClellanville Middle School, 711 Pinckney St., McClellanville.\nTimberland High School, 1418 Gravel Hill Road, St. Stephen.\nThe predictions came from experts who were “erring on the side of caution,” and they haven’t been wrong yet, she said. It’s better to get out now than to wait for mandatory evacuation orders from local officials, she added.\nStill, many residents in the area insist on staying, Haley said.\n“I know you’ve lived there a long time. ... I know you may have been through flooding before,” she said of residents in those areas. “This is different. ... Please try and leave.”\nThe water that has built up in South Carolina’s creeks, rivers, ponds and reservoirs continued to put pressure on dams statewide. Fourteen of 50,000 in South Carolina have failed, and the number of dams being monitored by emergency officials grew Thursday from 62 to 70.\nDownstream from some of those dams, the greatest risk for further flooding lies along the Santee River in the South Santee and Germantown areas, Haley said. Flooding in Georgetown could last for 12 days, she said. U.S Highway 17 and S.C. Highway 41 are expected to be closed.\nThe Santee reached 19.01 feet on Thursday, with an additional 5.5 feet expected by the weekend, according to the National Weather Service.\nIn Charleston County, deputies and National Guardsmen have set up two command posts to deal with emergencies along the Edisto and the Santee — one on U.S. 17 south of Ravenel and one in McClellanville.\nIf people along Edisto in Charleston and Dorchester counties choose not to evacuate, they should keep a close eye on the river levels and be prepared to get out, Charleston County Assistant Sheriff Mitch Lucas said.\n“This truly is a dangerous situation in many parts of the county,” he said. “The time to move is now.”\nAt the greatest risk for flooding are people on Parkers Ferry Road in Adams Run, on U.S. Highway 17 near the Charleston and Colleton County line, and in parts of Jacksonboro.\nThe Edisto reached 16 feet early Thursday, and it was expected to rise one-third of a foot, nearing record height.\n“I’m pleading with citizens in affected areas to hear and heed our warnings,” Charleston County Council Chairman Elliott Summey said. “We’ve been fortunate in Charleston County not to have had any deaths.”\nMason Fayne, 62, was one of the people who didn’t leave home despite predictions last week of historic rainfall. He stayed in his home on Arbor Oaks Drive near Summerville. It’s where he had lived with his late wife, and it’s where Fayne told her he would stay until his own death.\n“When you see that water come in, you just have to sit back, pop open a beer and say, ‘What the hell are you gonna do?’” he said. “I’ve been through Hugo. I’ve been through a lot. I think I can make it through this.”\nA painful wait Other Lowcountry residents who decided to stay in their homes as floodwater inundated their communities caught a glimpse of hope Thursday as the nearby rivers backed away.\nIn Ashborough off Dorchester Road near Summerville, residents long for normal. For school days. For air conditioning. For getting up and going to work. For a chance to drive a car to the grocery store without getting wet. For a time when strangers don’t drive up to the floodwater’s edge just to get out and snap a picture of themselves in rubber boots.\nFor now, they wait for the water — 4 feet of it in spots — to recede. The overflowing Ashley River still swirls through their fences, their garages and their cars. They kill time by registering for aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. They take 30-minute shifts to keep watch at night, looking for looters in rafts. They use their own public transportation system: A resident whose house didn’t flood keeps three kayaks in the front yard for people to borrow on the honor system.\nTheir neighborhood remained a concern Thursday for National Weather Service forecasters. The fresh water pouring into the Ashley and the Cooper rivers, coupled with high tides, make the area slow to drain of floodwater.\n“A lot of people ask why the water won’t get out of there faster,” meteorologist Richard Thacker said. “Well, there’s just so much of it, so much volume.”\nSharon Maralit has been cooped up in her home for a week with her four children, her mother and her husband. Her Hampton Drive house is an island, and they’re marooned on it. They find ways to keep busy.\n“Texting,” one of her sons said of a pastime that helps pass the time.\nThe family crowded on the front porch Thursday, sitting on sandbags stacked in the doorway or on the steps. An armadillo scurried inside a kayak tied to the railing. They had rescued the critter they found stranded on a floating log.\nWhat they saw was promising. The river had dropped 1 foot in a day, they estimated. It was a contrast from a few days earlier, when they saw their neighbor’s Mini floating by.\nThey watched as two youth pastors from Seacoast Church paddled up to their new dock on the Ashley. It was the grocery delivery. They brought some of the essentials: hamburger meat, Captain Crunch, Oreos and a gallon of milk.\n“Right now, we’re just waiting for the water to clear so we can start the cleanup,” Maralit said. “You can just see all the grime on everything.”\nAcross the street, Eric Perez cursed the people who told him he didn’t need flood insurance when he bought his home six years ago. His real estate and insurance agents told him not to bother because his property had never flooded.\n“A lot of us are finding out the hard way,” he said. “Now, we’re at the mercy of FEMA.”\nPerez spent Thursday pulling out stereo speakers, furniture and pictures that had been sitting on the floor. He started ripping out the hardwood on his first floor, which had filled with water.\nTwo of his cars were destroyed. He opened the doors of an SUV sitting in the driveway, unleashing a ripe stench from the floodwater intensified by the heat inside. The odor mixed with the fumes from fuel that formed a colorful sheen on the brown water.\nLike others, Perez longed for an ordinary day when he could be with his wife and children without wading through water. The family members were staying with friends and relatives.\n“This was our little patch of heaven here,” Perez said, standing beside a swimming pool teeming with minnows and full of twigs. “It’s just a mess now. … The water just can’t go down fast enough.”\n‘A helpless feeling’ As floodwaters receded entirely in other areas, residents came home Thursday to the heartbreaking reality of just how much they’ve lost.\nIn North Charleston’s Pepperhill community, Milton Green had spent $34,000 adding on to his house 18 months ago. His mortgage is $2,800 a year, and he is four years from paying it off. But during the storm, a flooded drainage ditch overflowed into his house, so he and his wife are living in a hotel for $400 a week.\n“I really can’t afford that, I’m using up all my reserves,” Green said. “I’ll be good for about another week, and then I’m in the red. I’ll have my credit cards maxed out.”\nA retired Charleston firefighter, Green, 65, already has been denied coverage by his insurance company. He didn’t have flood coverage and wasn’t required to have it, unlike new homeowners in the neighborhood.\n“Now I’m stuck with this damage,” Green said. “What FEMA doesn’t do, I’m screwed.”\nRon Bycroft, a volunteer with the Charleston Baptist Association, was going door to door with a crew to assess damage in the neighborhood where poor drainage led to damage to 50 homes.\nThe group is backed by the Southern Baptist Convention’s disaster relief services. They have crews feeding 7,000 people in Columbia and working on James Island and Johns islands, and they plan to head into Kingstree once floodwaters recede. Teams from Alabama, Florida and Georgia — places where Baptists from Charleston have volunteered — are en route to help clean out houses, cut drywall and sanitize homes so people can start over.\n“Some of these people, their houses are totally destroyed from the inside,” Bycroft said. “When my crews walk out of this house next week it will be dry, clean and safe. It won’t be put back together completely, but it will be dry, clean and safe, so they can start rebuilding their lives.”\nIn the Arbor Oaks neighborhood south of Summerville, residents piled couches, refrigerators and mattresses on sidewalks.\nInside Bryon Teegardin’s house, a crew tore up soaked wood flooring, revealing a crack in the foundation that stretched from wall to wall. He suspected that the flood had caused it.\n“When the water started coming in, that was a helpless feeling,” he said. “There’s nothing we could do. Now, I have a feeling they’re going to condemn this place.”\nThe water had rushed into this community near Dorchester Road on Saturday night as it spilled from the Sawmill Branch Creek. It curled around door frames and seeped under walls.\nIt flowed into the three bedrooms of Eric Seitz’s house as he watched a Clemson football game elsewhere. He returned to the sight of fish swimming in his foyer and his family’s cat eyeing a new shoreline in his living room.\nOn Thursday, the most daunting mound of waterlogged trash rested outside his house: a piano, beds, his grandfather’s China cabinet, classic children’s books like “Goodnight Moon.”\nHis wedding album and one of his children’s baby books were still soggy. He wasn’t throwing those away.\nHe hoped FEMA would cover the cost of things his insurance company won’t.\nSeitz praised the National Guardsmen who showed up unexpectedly Thursday and hauled off the community’s damaged possessions, which dripped as they were loaded into trucks. He had seen the kindness of others already — from someone who paid for his family’s dinner to a group of friends who helped gut his house of damaged items.\n“Everyone had pitched in,” he said. “It’s overwhelming. You hear stories of price gouging and looting, but we have been blessed.”\nPreparations Communities elsewhere in the Lowcountry still haven’t shed the floodwater.\nJamestown Mayor Roy Pipkin continues to keep his eye on the slowly rising Santee River as he and others prepare for heavy river flooding this weekend, a primary concern for state officials.\n“They (Berkeley County emergency department) brought us some maps yesterday to show us possible inundated areas that could be flooded,” Pipkin said. “When you say inundated with water you may be talking about an inch. Based on their map it could be in some of the lower areas in town that could get some water.”\nAs the mayor of the Berkeley County town of approximately 100 residents, Pipkin and officials have their phone list ready but he isn’t worried at this point, even as forecasts call for the river to hit 23 feet by Saturday and climb nearly another foot by Tuesday.\nThe river’s most historic crests in the town — 30 to 33 feet — occurred in the early part of the last century and in 1998, when it hit 21.67 feet. Pipkin said the town didn’t evacuate then and likely won’t now, even as water levels are expected to reach a major flood stage of 23 feet early Saturday and nearly 24 feet by Tuesday.\n“On Saturday we’ll make up our mind and possibly have an evacuation if needed, but I’m not too worried right now,” Pipkin said, adding that floodwaters typically overflow into swamps on Williamsburg and Georgetown County side of the river.\nThe Congaree River runs southwest from Columbia to Lake Marion. The Santee River flows from the lake west to the Atlantic Ocean.\nPlans are ready to execute should the Santee River do anything other than rise to projected levels, said Berkeley County Emergency officials.\n“The issue right now would be the unexpected, if a dam failed; if the water didn’t go the way we thought it would go,” Berkeley County spokesman Michael Mule said. “Our preparations are for if the unexpected happens. That’s what the sheriff, fire, EMS and the county supervisor are preparing for.”\nMailboxes still above water Tuesday along Happiness Lane in the Givhans Ferry area were submerged by Thursday in the Edisto, Don Sweat said. He owns a mobile home along the street that parallels the Edisto River where he spends vacation time.\nSweat anticipated that only one house, which sits on stilts, would survive the floodwater. About 6 feet of water covers the road through the community now accessible only by boat.\nWithout flood insurance, he doubts he will replace his home and doesn’t expect the Federal Emergency Management Agency to contribute any funds for recovery because he uses the place for leisure.\nIf the home’s structure survives the water, Sweat still expects mold to quickly grow on the cabinets and the floors while the Edisto slowly recedes.\n“I just asked about insurance a month ago, but I procrastinated,” he said. “I’m helpless now. There’s nothing I can do till the water goes down.”\nMelissa Boughton and Diane Knich of The Post and Courier contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://info.scdot.org/PressRelease/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=2096"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:43:56.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
