Instead, the tensions in Jerusalem have spread to Palestinians communities in the West Bank, Gaza and within Israel itself.\nHowever, unlike Rabin, who concluded that force has its limits and that Israel needs to embrace diplomacy, the current prime minister reckons force works and diplomacy is only good to waste time and gain territory. (Rabin was later assassinated by an Israeli extremist against the backdrop of incitement by the Israeli Right led by none other than Benjamin Netanyahu.)\nInside Story - The end of the Oslo agreement?\n'The Zionist enterprise'\nBut now that his policy backfired, Netanyahu is doing what he does best; project blame elsewhere. Predictably, he expressed shock and dismay, and accused the Palestinians of trying to destroy the \"Zionist enterprise\", i.e. Israel.\nSuch \"whining while shooting\" policy has worked for Israel in the past, but will it work this time around?\nThe peace process generation\nUnlike their predecessors, the overwhelming majority of the young Palestinians who are out demonstrating grew up under the shadows of the Israel dictated \"Peace Process\".\nAlso read: Welcome to the New Middle East\nTheir anger and frustration is the culmination of Israel's refusal to end its repression and occupation of the Palestinian people more than two decades after the Oslo process began.\nIt's as if there's never a good time to end the occupation and begin the peace. Not when Israelis feel insecure - for reasons, real or imagined.\nIt takes political chutzpa and moral bankruptcy to blame them for leadership failure in Israel or Palestine. They shouldn't be blamed for why Israel, to paraphrase one of its diplomats, didn't miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity to make peace.\nInstead, Israel has rejected an awfully generous Palestinian/Arab offer to live in peace and security within 78 percent of historic Palestine.\nIt's as if there's never a good time to end the occupation and begin the peace. Not when Israelis feel insecure - for reasons, real or imagined. Nor when they feel totally secure.\nFive years ago, the influential US weekly TIME magazine asked a controversial question on its cover: \"Why Israel doesn't care about peace.\"\nAnd the answer is rather straightforward: Israelis feel prosperous, secure - and disengaged from the peace process with the Palestinians. Basically, \"it's quiet there, over on the moon\", TIME referred to the adjacent Palestinian territories.\nBut the Palestinian response to Israel's indifference (and the world's silence) has been loud and clear: You might turn your back on our suffering, you might ignore our occupation, and you might even let us down again and again, but we aren't going anywhere.\nAlso read: State of the world: In search of leadership\nAnd within couple of weeks, it's the Israelis who are anxious, helpless and fearful of another Intifada.\nAnd most surprisingly, they're also shocked.\nIn your face\nHow could any any sane Israeli be any bit surprised that Palestinians would do something - anything or everything - to free themselves from decades of occupation, repression and disposition?\nA Palestinian tries to dodge rubber coated bullets during clashes with Israeli troops near Ramallah, West Bank [AP] Do they really expect the Palestinians to accept Israel's discrimination and dehumanisation? Or perhaps rejoice at being occupied by \"the one and only democracy in the Middle East\", that affords them refugee camps in their own homeland.\nWell, they don't and won't. Time to get real and perhaps learn one or two lessons from history.\nFirst, occupied people ultimately liberate themselves from their colonisers as we've seen over the last century; Palestine is no exception.\nSecond, occupying another people isn't (and shouldn't be) easy or cost-free enterprise. But Israel has had it relatively easy during the longest occupation of the 20th century, perhaps too easy, at least in comparison with other foreign occupations in the region and beyond.\nAnd third, it's Israel's own settlement expansion throughout historical Palestine that has shortened the distance between Palestinians and Israelis with each passing day, and in the process, making it tougher to separate the two peoples, and certainly far harder to police their fault-lines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:44:23.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
