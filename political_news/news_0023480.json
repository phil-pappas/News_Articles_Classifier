Nebraska gave the company a package of tax incentives and exemptions, and Omaha demolished a historic warehouse district after ConAgra threatened to leave in 1986. \nSen. Heath Mello of Omaha, who met with ConAgra officials to try to keep the company from moving, said CEO Sean Connolly told him the decision had nothing to do with Nebraska's tax climate. \nMello said state and local officials instead need to do a better job following industry trends, so they know earlier what companies need to stay competitive. He said he has had \"preliminary conversations\" with Gov. Pete Ricketts ' administration about steps the state can take to prevent large employers from leaving in the future. \n\"I think it's a wake-up call that state government needs to be smarter, it needs to be more innovative, and it needs to have credible research and data available to help us make decisions,\" Mello said. \"We have to address that. It is a weakness in regards to us being competitive with other states across the country.\" \nSen. Mike Gloor of Grand Island, chairman of the Revenue Committee, said his committee's focus will remain on lowering property taxes and finding new ways to pay for K-12 schools. \nGloor said ConAgra's move shows that companies look at more than taxes when deciding where to locate. \nNebraska offers a friendlier overall tax climate than Illinois, he said, pointing to that state's budget impasse and ongoing pension crisis. Even the tax program that was used to lure ConAgra to Illinois has been put on hold because of state budget problems, although officials say the benefits were offered to the company before the program was scaled back. \n\"I'm shaking my head, thinking: Illinois? Really?\" Gloor said. \nEven so, some groups say Nebraska could become more competitive by lowering its income tax rates for individuals and corporations. Doing so would reduce the need for tax incentives that favor some businesses over others, said Jim Vokal, CEO of the Platte Institute, an Omaha-based free-market think tank. \nVokal said lawmakers should look hard at the tax benefits ConAgra received decades ago and consider whether they served the state's long-term interest. Ricketts has also said the company's departure should serve as a reminder of the need to ensure that Nebraska's tax code and incentives are competitive. \n\"We have the tax incentives because we have such a high-tax environment,\" Vokal said. \"They're a great economic tool for states like Nebraska, but they come at the expense of broad-based tax reform for all Nebraskans.\" \nBusiness groups defend the incentives as a valuable tool to attract companies. They're particularly important in Nebraska because two of the state's neighbors — South Dakota and Wyoming — have no income tax, said Barry Kennedy, president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \nKennedy said his group plans to advocate for lower individual and corporate income taxes during the 2016 session, but he acknowledged that tax breaks wouldn't have stopped ConAgra's departure. \nPoliticians usually face pressure to act when a major employer threatens to leave the area, but usually there's not much they can do, said Renee Fry, executive director of the OpenSky Policy Institute, a Nebraska tax policy think tank. \nFry said employers generally want a young, well-educated workforce in places that nurture creative thinking and innovation. Because of its low unemployment, she said, Nebraska has a worker shortage that makes it harder for businesses to find employees. \n\"Cutting taxes isn't really going to cause young people to move here,\" Fry said. \"Young people are looking for a job, a cool place to live, or to be near their families.\" \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:36:55.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
