The Congress lost power after the 1977 general elections soon after Emergency . \nThe Janata Party, an amalgam of anti- Congress groups, took charge of New Delhi, but could hold power for only for two years. \nState assembly elections after 1977 display similar trends. In Bihar, the Janata Party won 214 out of a total of 324 seats in 1977. \nBy early 1980s, the Janata Party began to crumble in Bihar too. There were many factions that emerged. Two regional parties in Bihar today are Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Janata Dal (United). Both the parties were formed from factions that separated from the Janata alliance. \nKnown for their caste vote-banks and implacable opposition to one another until now, they are now allies with the Congress in the ongoing state polls. \nThis is ironic because the Janata Party emerged as an opposition to the near despotic rule of the Congress in the 1970s. \nToday, offshoots of the Janata Party keep forming new factions and alliances. Based on their performance in national and state polls, their status keeps swinging between national or state parties. \nAnother factor is the creation of Jharkhand from Bihar in 2000, making JD (U) and RJD seats more concentrated in Bihar. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:05:26.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
