Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Thursday that he never meant to link a Congressional investigation into Benghazi to Hillary Clinton's faltering poll numbers, and that the outrage over his remarks has been a setback to his hopes of becoming the next House speaker, NBC News reported. In an appearance on Fox earlier this week, McCarthy said, \"We put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are [Clinton's] numbers today? Her numbers are dropping.\" Family of Oregon Mass Shooter Shocked The comment drew criticism from both sides of the aisle, including some of his fellow members of the House GOP.
