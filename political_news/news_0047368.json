But poor management is not a crime,” Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik said in the letter.\n…The IRS mishandled the processing of tax-exempt applications in a manner that disproportionately impacted applicants affiliated with the tea party and similar groups, leaving the appearance that the IRS's conduct was motivated by political, discriminatory, corrupt, or other inappropriate motives.\n…But former House Oversight Committee chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, said the DOJ's decision gives the impression that “government officials are above the law.”\n“The Justice Department's decision to close the IRS targeting investigation without a single charge or prosecution is a low point of accountability in an administration that is better known for punishing whistleblowers than the abuse and misconduct they expose,” Issa said in a statement. “After stating that their investigation confirms that tea party and conservative groups were improperly targeted, they dismiss it merely as a byproduct of gross mismanagement and incompetence — ignoring volumes of evidence in the public record and efforts to obstruct legitimate inquires.”\nAnd Rep. Paul Ryan, the chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means committee and the likely successor to outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, called the DOJ's announcement “predictable” and said his committee will continue its investigation into the IRS's actions.\n“Through these investigations we have uncovered serious and unprecedented actions taken by the most senior IRS official in charge of the non-profit unit, Lois Lerner, to deprive conservative organizations of their constitutional rights,” Ryan said in a statement. “Despite the DOJ closing its investigation, the Ways and Means Committee will continue to find answers and hold the IRS accountable for its actions.”\nRead more here.", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/23/politics/lois-lerner-no-charges-doj-tea-party/index.html"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:40:47.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
