And secondly, the Louisiana governor called for the U.S. to \"create a no-fly zone working with our Turkish and other allies.\" \n\"Let's talk about a no-fly zone,\" Raddatz interrupted. \"ISIS doesn't have aircraft. So what would that no-fly zone really accomplish? When has it really worked?\" \nAccording to Jindal, a no-fly zone would \"stabilize the region so you don't have all these refugees flooding into Europe and trying to leave the country.\" \nJindal said that it would also prevent Russia from bombing Syrian rebels and would show \"our Sunni allies in the region that we're serious about winning this.\" \n\"These are radical Islamic terrorists that are burning people alive, crucifying, killing Christians and other religious minorities,\" Jindal remarked. \"We have to hunt them down and kill them before they attack us here.\" \n\"You don't think that's what they're doing now?\" Raddatz shot back. \"We've had thousands and thousands of airstrikes. ISIS is not a traditional army. The reason -- and I've been out on an aircraft carrier, I have seen those jets coming back with their bombs still attached. Because they can't drop bombs in congested areas. They can't risk killing innocent civilians in those areas.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:33:04.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
