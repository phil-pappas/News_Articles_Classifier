The advocates cited Murray’s touting of a “clean sweep” of law enforcement union endorsements as they wondered how she would handle allegations of police misconduct.\nMurray has said she will fairly and thoroughly investigate all complaints.\n“If you say that you care, come answer our questions,” said Mimi Pierre Johnson of New York Communities for Change.\nMurray campaign spokesman Bill Corbett responded to the advocates by saying Murray’s “demanding campaign schedule has not provided for a mutually convenient date at this time, but she looks forward to meeting with the organization’s members in the near future.”\n“Supervisor Kate Murray would be delighted to add New York Communities for Change to her busy calendar of debates and speaking engagements,” Corbett said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:21:53.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
