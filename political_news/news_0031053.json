Too bad. Respect Islam. Got it? And the West says, ‘yes massa.’\nEven the lily-livered writer of the article adheres to the sharia (Islamic law) and doesn’t mention or criticize the motive for the dog-hate – Islam.\nSharia Toronto: Cabbies turning away passengers with seeing-eye dogs\nThis article doesn’t mention the most likely reason why this is happening, and that is probably because the Toronto Metro News knows that printing the truth would be “Islamophobic”: most cab drivers are Muslim, and Islam hates dogs: “Once Gabriel promised the Prophet (that he would visit him, but Gabriel did not come) and later on he said, ‘We, angels, do not enter a house which contains a picture or a dog.’” — Sahih Bukhari 4.54.50\n“Abdullah (b.
