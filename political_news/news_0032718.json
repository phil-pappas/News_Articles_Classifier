Hospital systems are merging, hospitals are purchasing provider practices, and the insurance industry is undergoing what some are calling \"merger madness.\" By 2025, it is likely that the U.S. cancer care delivery system will look completely different as programs and providers find themselves working in new ways with new partners.\nTo address this trend and to suggest steps toward a future path that ensures improved patient care within this changing environment, the Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) will release a white paper, \"What Will It Take? Five Essential Actions to Achieve a Positive Impact on Patient Care in the Integrated Healthcare Environment,\" at its 32 nd National Oncology Conference in Portland, Oregon , Oct. 21-23 .\nThe five essential actions for achieving a positive impact on patient care within the next decade are:\nAligning stakeholders and requiring accountability Defining quality in a value-based reimbursement system and providing access to quality care Using non-traditional delivery systems (telehealth) and providers (primary care physicians and non-physician providers) to deliver cancer care Integrating the use of Big Data to drive treatment decisions Moving to patient-directed care in which the patient is at the center of all decisions and systemic change \"Increased integration will impact all aspects of an organization's cancer care delivery - cultural, operational, clinical and financial,\" said ACCC President, Steven D'Amato , BSPharm, BCOP. \"Our focus in this newly integrated environment is to provide education for hospital systems and physician practices on how to offer the best collaborative oncology care in a seamless way for patients.\"\nThe white paper stems from discussion at the ACCC third annual Institute for the Future of Oncology Forum held in June 2015 and includes input from oncologists, cancer program and practice executives, and patient advocate organizations on essential actions for improving patient care within the next 10 years. The essential actions identified will be crucial to developing an oncology care system where both traditional and non-traditional providers work collaboratively to use all available knowledge and provide personalized cancer care that meets patient needs.\nThe white paper will be released during a conference session on \"Advancing Quality - From Oncology Medical Homes to Integrated Delivery\" that will take place on Thursday, Oct. 22 . The session, chaired by Mr. D'Amato, will focus on infrastructure needs for cancer programs and practices to succeed in the more integrated delivery system of the future.\nTo receive a copy of the white paper, please contact Lori Gardner at lgardner@accc-cancer.org .
