Not attending forums, she’s not listening, she’s not there, and so she’s facing those criticisms, you know, it’s natural to try to deflect those criticisms.\" \nRegular no-shows at debates \nConservative candidates across Alberta are increasingly absent from public debates and forums. \nAccording to data from 1VoteMatters , 14 Conservatives have bailed on Alberta events to date. The strategic voting organization has been tracking debate no-shows, missed meetings, and rejected media interviews by Conservative candidates. It's found more than 80 absences by Tory representatives across Canada. \nCandidates refusing to show up or to confirm attendance are forcing forums to be cancelled or put on hold, while others are simply pushing forward without everyone present. \n“All of the political parties have been very keen on participating except for one ,\" Brian Lee, a former Progressive Conservative MLA, told the Calgary Herald. \"I’ll let you guess. It starts with a 'C.'\" \nA Conservative party source told the Toronto Star in August that candidates across the country have been advised to skip debates . \nAndrew MacDougall, a former director of communications for Conservative Leader Stephen Harper, explained to the newspaper that knocking on doors and meeting voters is a better use of candidates' time. \nConservative spokeswoman Meagan Murdoch told Metro News that there's no strategy behind some candidates lack of attendance, pointing out that Liberal and NDP candidates have missed debates as well. \nRegardless of the reason, absent candidates can be frustrating for voters hoping for a better understanding of their positions. \nRahim Virani showed up at Calgary Skyview's all-candidates' debate on Sept. 29, hoping to ask Conservative incumbent Devinder Shory about his position on the refugee crisis, Bill C-51 and Bill C-24. But the Tory did not appear. \n\"I was hoping maybe he could clarify some of that stuff for us, because it's really hard to get an idea of what's going on,\" Virani told CBC News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:52:26.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
