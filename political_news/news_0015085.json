Terry Branstad about ways the state and federal government can work together, along with farmers, agribusinesses, environmental and conservation groups, to mount a large effort that could quell a lawsuit filed by Des Moines Water Works. \nThe utility's lawsuit targets drainage districts in Calhoun, Sac and Buena Vista counties, alleging drainage tiles there act as a conduit for high levels of nitrates to pour into the Raccoon River, a drinking water source for 500,000 central Iowa residents. \nThe utility seeks to have water discharged from drainage districts — and indirectly farmers — regulated by the federal government, much like discharge from factories. The lawsuit is slated to be heard next year. \n\"The state has to do more,\" said Vilsack, who initiated the Vision Iowa program. \"The worst thing that can happen is for a federal judge to decide this.\" \nBen Hammes, Branstad's spokesman, said his boss is discussing several ideas with leaders around soil conservation and water quality, including Vilsack. \"People really want to solve the problem, but we don't have anything official to discuss,\" he said. \nJay Byers, CEO of the Greater Des Moines Partnership, said Friday he expects several proposals to go to the Iowa Legislature next year. \"We need to be working together to help address this issue in a big way,\" Byers said. \nThe economic development group is working with leaders in agriculture, business and conservation to find water-quality solutions that would help scale up farm efforts to reduce the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus in Iowa waterways. \n\"The key is that we have to generate significant resources that can create a carrot-approach for producers to really move forward with as many conservation strategies as possible,\" Byers said. \nEnvironmentalists and some farm groups back a small — three-eighths of 1 percent — sales tax increase to fund the Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Trust Fund, approved by 63 percent of Iowa voters in 2010. It's expected to generate about $120 million annually. \nSome piece of the money generated could go to boosting conservation to improve water quality, officials have said. The effort, however, has failed to gain traction with lawmakers. \n\"There are still a lot of discussions about how it could happen,\" Byers said. \"We need to move the ball forward.\" \nHe called the discussions between Vilsack and Branstad \"critically important\" to finding solutions. \nIowa scientists estimate it will cost as much as $1.2 billion annually over five decades for farmers to build the conservation infrastructure needed to offset the state's intensive farming. Iowa is a national leader in corn, soybean, egg, pork and beef production. \nIowa's nearly 90,000 farmers have been under pressure to reduce the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus that leave fields and make their way into Iowa waterways and eventually contributes to the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico, \nOn Friday, Vilsack visited a farmer in northeast Iowa who invested $16,000 in a bioreactor that so far has reduced nitrates that come off of 35 acres by 40 percent. \"If you do the math, you're going to need a serious amount of money over a long period of time,\" he said. \nUnder the Vilsack's Vision Iowa program, taxpayers pumped $225 million into tourism, recreation and other quality of life projects, leveraging $2 billion in investment. \"It changed the face of many Iowa cities,\" Vilsack said. \n\"You could do a similar effort along those lines, creating a fairly significant pot of money at a state level,\" he said. It could be matched through private and public investment. \nWayne Fredericks, president of the Iowa Soybean Association, said he sees more farmers adopting conservation efforts such as cover crops, saturated buffers and grassed waterways. \n\"Farmers are looking at ways they can change their operations, but changes don't happen overnight,\" said Fredericks, who farms near Osage.
