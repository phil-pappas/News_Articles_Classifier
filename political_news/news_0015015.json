The lawsuit alleges that the defendants fraudulently towed U-Haul trucks and trailers in order to charge U-Haul exorbitant and baseless fees for the return of the equipment.\n\"U-Haul filed the lawsuit after an extensive investigation following an increasing number of U-Haul rental equipment had been towed in the region under suspicious circumstances,\" said U-Haul Area District Vice President Steve Hansen . \"This lawsuit follows a string of recent news stories on other Chicagoland tow truck companies allegedly engaging in unlawful behavior.\"\nAccording to the lawsuit, various defendants allegedly offered payments to U-Haul customers in exchange for their participation in the tow fraud aimed at billing U-Haul for thousands of dollars in unnecessary towing and vehicle storing fees.
