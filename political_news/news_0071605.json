In the last year, the city has compiled a waiting list of VLI and special-needs homes in need of rehabilitation. The rehabilitation project will target homes of residents who have been on that waiting list. Project funds will be used for major home repairs such as roof, insulation, heating and cooling, electrical, and plumbing repairs. Improvements will also be made to make life easier for residents living with disabilities.\n\"Grants like these help seniors stay in their homes,\" said Ashley Aubrey Harrison , assistant vice president and Community Affairs representative at Whitney Bank. \"We are pleased to once again partner with the City of Hammond and FHLB Dallas to bring these resources to the community.\"\nCity of Hammond Mayor Pete Panepinto says that the grant will contribute to the city's overall goal of \"ensuring Hammond's prosperity and quality of life.\" He explains, \"This is the second time in the past three years that we've been able to partner with FHLB Dallas and Whitney Bank to improve housing in our communityâ€¦ ensuring that those who are elderly or disabled have safe places to live.
