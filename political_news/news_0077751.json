According to sources Firoz has already approached Akshay with the olive branch, namely the sequel to their 2002 hit Awaara Paagal Deewana . And Akshay has agreed in principle to return to the sequel.\nFiroz doesn't deny the likelihood of a rapprochement. \"Akshay may be in Awara Paagal Deewana sequel. Akshay along with Suniel Shetty, Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever are the core cast of the franchise.\" Director Vikram Bhatt will no longer be part of Awaara Paagal Deewana .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:34:19.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
