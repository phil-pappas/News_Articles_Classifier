Scott Walker has been trying to buy. Related Content \nA spokesman for business executive Elizabeth Uihlein acknowledged that workers at her adjoining property may have cleaned up the trail slightly. \nBut the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports those who have seen the trail say the improvements are significant. \nUihlein is seeking to buy 1.75 acres along Rest Lake, where the footpath is located. But a tentative deal with the Department of Natural Resources was put on hold after critics raised questions. \nA DNR spokesman says the agency inspected the site on Thursday and found an \"established trail.\" He declined to say whether the department had talked to Uihlein or her representatives. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
