There is no better time to recognise and reflect on this sacrifice than during Niuean Language Week,\" says Spokesperson for Pacific Island Affairs Pita Paraone. \n\"New Zealandâ€™s vibrant Niuean community is currently 24,000 strong. It is important to support them in keeping the Niuean language alive amongst future generations\". \n\"New Zealand First encourages all New Zealanders to make an effort to embrace the Niuean language this week,\" says Mr Paraone. \"Kia monuina.\" \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
