All of these questions provoke massive partisan divides. \nOverall, 54 percent say they think the way Clinton handled her email as secretary of state is an important indicator of her character and ability to serve as president, 43 percent say it isn't relevant. That's a reversal since March, when 52 percent said it wasn't relevant. \nGiven partisan divides on the question, it may not harm Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination, but could become a bigger issue should she make it to the general election. In the new poll, 70 percent of Democrats see it as irrelevant, including 77 percent of Democratic voters who say they back Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination. Among independents and Republicans, however, majorities see it as a meaningful indicator of her character: 57 percent of independents and 80 percent of Republicans say so. \nDespite those concerns, 72 percent of all Americans say they see the Benghazi committee as mostly using its investigative mission for political gain, just 23 percent think it is conducting an objective investigation. Even Republicans are skeptical on this measure, with 49 percent saying the committee is trying to score political points vs. 47 percent who say it is conducting an objective investigation. Among Democrats, 85 percent see it as seeking political advantage and among independents that stands at 75 percent. \nOn the more general question of whether the committee has gone too far, opinions are more mixed. Women are more apt than men to say the committee has gone too far (48 percent among women, 31 percent among men), and Democrats are more likely to say it has overreached than Republicans (71 percent of Democrats think it has gone too far, 74 percent of Republicans that it has acted appropriately). \nDissatisfaction with Clinton's handling of Benghazi is widespread, 59 percent are dissatisfied, 36 percent satisfied. Among Democrats, 63 percent say they are satisfied, but large majorities of Republicans (85 percent) and independents (65 percent) say they are dissatisfied. \nThe CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,028 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:24:40.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
