We share these concerns as does the Chief Inspector of Hospitals, who has rated the safety of acute medicine at West Cumberland Hospital as ‘inadequate’ since July 2014.\nWe cannot ignore this situation and we all share a common goal which is to ensure a safe and sustainable service for patients in West Cumbria. We are doing all we can to recruit to key vacancies including our innovative partnership with the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan). Whilst our consultants have not yet formally resigned, it is our duty to plan for all eventualities and all possible worst case scenarios and this means we must have open discussions with our clinical teams such as the discussion the A&E team had at their meeting on Friday.\nWe are also working closely with all health partners, as part of the newly formed Success Regime, to develop a long-term clinical strategy within the next six months. This will also involve many more open conversations with our staff, patients and members of the public about the challenges faced so that we can establish a clear way forward, not just for the Trust, but for the whole health economy in West, North and East Cumbria.\n– Dr Jeremy Rushmer, medical director at North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust Last updated Tue 13 Oct 2015 Politics Cumbria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:08:43.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
