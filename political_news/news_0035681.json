Specifically, the firm has been selected for its exemplary and cutting-edge work on behalf of plaintiffs in the \"Securities Law\" practice area.\nIn determining category finalists, the editorial staff of The National Law Journal vetted numerous nomination submissions for accomplishments across seven categories of plaintiff lawyers, based on particular types of cases in which they've excelled. Firms were required to have had at least one \"significant plaintiffs win\" between July 1, 2014 and June 30, 2015 and possess an impressive track record of wins within the past three to five years.\nTo qualify, a \"significant win\" meant prevailing in a bench or jury trial or in a major settlement that carried high stakes, such as a substantial amount of money or an outcome that could affect litigation strategy or case law nationwide. Further, at least half of the firms' litigation resources must have been dedicated to plaintiffs' work.\nSome of the factors used in creating the list were: performance in significant cases, including key rulings, victories at trial, and settlements; verdict dollar amount, size of punitive damages penalties, cash settlements; complexity of procedure and substantive law; duration of case, and/or number of class members; willingness to take on large cases and to persevere in the face of adversity; volume of cases handled in a particular time period (sum of accumulated verdicts or settlements); novelty of claim, cause of action, or theory of recovery; impact (litigation results that changed a government, business practice; feedback or acknowledgment from the bench; and firm size in relation to impact or recovery amount.\nBernstein Liebhard LLP, established in 1993, represents institutional investors in shareholder, class and derivative litigation and plaintiffs in various types of complex litigation and mass tort litigation.
