Initial work will be undertaken in Vanuatu and the Cook Islands, before being expanded out to airfields Niue, Kiribati, Samoa, Tonga and other Pacific nations. \n\"Training will also be provided to local staff in the Pacific to ensure that Pacific Islands are able to update aviation charts and procedures on an ongoing basis,\" Mr McCully says. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
