Here we look at 8 of his statements and give the real picture of what is happening.\n1 What he said: \"To these working people who have been completely abandoned by a party heading off to the fringes of the left let us all here today extend our hand. We’re now the party of work, the only true party of labour.\"\nWhat's the truth: This is the party which has axed 350,000 public sector jobs, voted against a review of zero hour contracts, blocked a review into closing the gender pay gap, hiked fees for employment tribunals and is ramming through the Trades Union Bill.\nDan Kitwood Under the spotlight: Did George Osborne's claims add up?\n2 What he said: \"Now I often get asked in this job: do you understand the impact of the decisions you make?\nAnd my response is this: Yes I do.\"\nWhat's the truth: George Osborne is refusing to halt his tax credit cuts even though it will leave working families worse off by £1,300 a year on average. He has cut welfare for the poorest and services such as libraries, youth clubs and sure start.\nMillions of working families will be worse off as a result of the tax credit cuts\n3 What he said: \"It's always the poorest who suffer when the economy fails. It’s always working families who lose their jobs. That’s not a kinder, caring Britain. I’ll tell you what that is. It's economic cruelty dressed up as socialist compassion.\"\nWhat's the truth: George Osborne claims to care about the poorest but on his watch 1million people are using foodbanks, child poverty has risen with 300,000 more kids in hardship and homelessness is up by 40% since the Coalition came to power in 2010.\nSWNS Food for thought: A volunteer helps at a foodbank\n4 What he said: \"With Labour the banks went bust - we’re fixing them. With Labour the debt soared - we’re going to bring it down. Labour have now turned their back on opportunity and aspiration - we’re going to build the share owning democracy this Party has always believed in.\"\nWhat's the truth: Labour rescued the banks and the economy under Gordon Brown. The banks were not properly regulated but at the time Osborne was calling for less regulation on them. The number of individuals owning shares has fallen from 37% in 1975 to just over 12% in 2012.\nRocky claim: It was Labour that rescued banks such as Northern Rock\n5 What he said: \"I’ll always pay tribute to the role the Labour movement played in building the NHS and establishing rights in the workplace.\"\nWhat's the truth? If he cared about rights in the work place why has he hiked fees for employment tribunals and is pushing through the Trades Union Bill that will make it almost impossible to strike? And why is the NHS in financial crisis?\nAndrew Matthews/PA Strikes will be almost impossible under the Trades Union Bill\n6 What he said: \"Over the decades, the wings of local government were clipped again and again by all parties, most especially ours.\"\nWhat's the truth: Yes, local government was stripped of its powers under Thatcher but also by this Government too. School planning is now the responsibility of central government, while only this week the Tories announced new laws directing councils on how they can use their pension funds.\nPower failure: Manchester Town Hall has had some powers clipped under the Tories\n7 What he said: \"We’re going to allow local government to keep the rates they collect from business.That’s right, all £26bn of business rates will be kept by councils instead of being sent up to Whitehall. Right now, we collect much more in business rates than we give back in the main grant.\nSo we will phase out this local government grant altogether.\"\nWhat's the truth: By devolving powers, Osborne is also devolving the cuts. The axing of the local government grant means rich councils with a large number of businesses will get richer but those in deprived areas with few companies will get poorer.\nReuters Sweeping change: Power will devolved from Whitehall to town halls\n8 What he said: \"We are the builders.\"\nWhat's the truth: House building has stalled under the Tories and is the worst peacetime record since the 1920s. Big infrastructure projects such as new runway in the south east have been delayed and most of the major building schemes - such as Crossrail and the redevelopment of Birmingham New Street - were started under Labour. There are 508,000 fewer homeowners than in 2010 while only 2,062 genuinely affordable homes for social rent will be built in 2020.\nDry rot: George Osborne says the Tories are the builders\nPoll loading …\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/JBeattieMirror", "http://i4.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article6075387.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS68219780.jpg", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "http://i2.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article6423407.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Piggy-bank-with-money-Pic-PA.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:56:12.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
