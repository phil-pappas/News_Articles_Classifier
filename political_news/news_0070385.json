John Kasich has been arguing for three years — Ohio’s severance tax on fracking is low compared to other states. \n\nBut based on the recommendations from an informal legislative group, there will be no move to increase Ohio’s tax on oil and gas companies anytime soon. \n\nThe 2020 Tax Policy Study Commission met this morning for the first time, 21 days after its deadline to produce a recommendation to the House and Senate on a new severance tax for shale fracking \n\nThe commission was given a report today from a three-member group that spent time over the summer trying to craft suggestions on how and when to increase the tax as drilling continues to expand in parts of eastern Ohio. \n\n“Ohio’s total tax burden on the oil and gas industry is lower than or as low as every other state with a severance tax,” the report said. The Kasich administration has been making a similar argument for years, as GOP legislative leaders, prodded by the oil and gas industry, have repeatedly rejected his proposals to increase the tax. \n\nThe report compared Ohio’s current severance tax rate, which Kasich has called a “total and complete rip-off to the people of this state,” to a number of other states. \n\n“One of the challenges we’ve had is no state does it the same,” said Sen. Bob Peterson, R-Sabina. But after studying the issue, Peterson and others on the working group confirmed that Ohio’s rate is low. \n\nBut with the oil and gas industry currently dealing with lower market prices, “now is probably not a good time to increase the tax.” \n\nRep. Jeff McClain, R-Upper Sandusky, who along with Peterson are co-chairing the 2020 Tax Commission, added: “We’ve basically given a recommendation of caution. We want to make sure we take care of Ohio but we make sure we don’t kill the industry as well.” \n\nKey findings and recommendations from the report include: \n\n--The oil and gas industry is “under financial duress.” \n\n--The state should consider a trigger or a low phase-in of a new severance tax. “Ohio should not expect to see a new revenue stream to materialize overnight until market conditions improve.” \n\n--The updated tax rate should be comparative with other shale fracking states across the nation. \n\n--New revenues should help local governments in fracking counties with infrastructure, equipment and services needed to handle the oil and gas industry. \n\nTriggers, Peterson said, could be based on profitability, prices or a delay for certain amount of time as the tax is phased in. \n\nMcClain added that Ohio’s geology makes it more expensive to drill in Ohio and “you don’t get near the prices for your commodities. We have to take those things into account as well.” \n\nThe 2020 Tax Commission will examine a new severance tax as part of an overall examination of Ohio’s tax code, with recommendations or proposed legislation expected before it finishes its work at the end of 2016. \n\nAfter negotiations among the House, Senate, Kasich administration and the oil and gas industry failed to yield a severance tax compromise in June for the two-year budget, Senate President Keith Faber, R-Celina, insisted that language be added that set an Oct. 1 deadline for the commission to craft a recommendation. \n\n“I’ve been disappointed, frankly, that they didn’t meet the original deadline,” Faber said. “ So they continue to work on language to try to get that ready to come out.” \n\nThough the 2020 Commission will look at all state taxes, it also has been charged, specifically, with exploring how to move Ohio’s income tax system to a flat tax of 3.5 percent or 3.75 percent by 2018. \n\nOhio’s current progressive income tax rates range from 0.5 percent to 5 percent on income earned above about $210,000. \n\nAsked about a flat tax, State Tax Commissioner Joe Testa told the commission today that it would be difficult. “It’s going to be hard to come up with a rate that doesn’t create a lot of losers.” \n\nThe great majority of Ohio taxpayers already pay an effective income tax rate of less than 3.5 percent. \n\n“The big thing about the flat tax is you’re going to have winners and losers,” McClain said. “ That may be the right thing to do long term, but it’s still very painful when it happens.” \n\nPeterson said he thinks a flat tax can be effective policy, but he agrees that the challenge is changing the current system. \n\n“Transitions can be messy,” he said. \n\njsiegel@dispatch.com \n\n@phrontpage", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:28:35.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
