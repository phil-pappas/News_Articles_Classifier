Photo: Martyn Thompson\nMartyn Thompson is sitting in the back part of the loft that he shares with ceramic artist Dove Drury Hornbuckle , describing the aftermath of his first visit to New York. It was 1982, and “everybody was going to be something. Ambition was born in me at that moment. And I got back to Sydney with this idea that whatever I want to do, I can do.” Thompson has, since then, done everything from painting to fashion design to (especially) photography, and after that trip he spent more than a decade in Paris and London before settling in New York in 1999.\nAfter he arrived, he rented for a few years while looking for a loft, but everything he saw had been renovated to death. Finally, he had a breakthrough that many New Yorkers have experienced: His broker said he had just the place, though it was out of Thompson’s price range. It was also a rare un-messed-around-with loft in the Little Singer Building in Soho, built in 1903 and converted to residences in 1982 — precisely the year when Thompson first saw the city that opened up his horizons. He was able to come up with the extra money, and a dozen years later he’s still in the apartment.\nToday it is a riotous, flower-strewn, mural-painted, art-filled think tank where he and Hornbuckle have enough space to go their separate ways for the workday and rejoin at dinnertime. From this ever-evolving environment, he runs his creative empire: Last year, he launched a line of textiles and rugs printed with his photographs of flowers and still lifes, and this year he’s collaborating with Hornbuckle on a series of one-of-a-kind lamps.\nThe furnishings are a pastiche, collected in different cities over time: a set of Giò Ponti chairs from London, a wood-painted bureau from Paris, and Charlotte Perriand lighting found here and there. In 2011, Thompson photographed the loft for his first book, Interiors , when it looked very different, and wrote the following: “I used to be very particular and neat, almost neurotically so. I think I’m more relaxed now — I like to have some mess around. I want to feel comfortable and not like I’m living in a work of art. No matter how perfect an interior may be, there should always be room for people.” This one has plenty. Also space for a lot of fabric. And great furniture. And art, and ceramics, and lamps. And, still, ambition to spare.\n*This article appears in the Winter 2016 issue of New York Design Hunting.\nBEGIN SLIDESHOW", "external_links": ["http://www.martynthompsonstudio.com/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1742702341", "http://www.dovedruryhornbuckle.com/"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:06:11.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
