It is a combination of news analysis and investing. \nTowery developed “Newsvesting” after studying Warren Buffett’s habit of constantly reading the news and analyzing information that is available to anyone who is interested. \nI have to confess that I approached this book with a personal bias. Matt Towery coached my older daughter about debate when she was in high school and he was in college. That was more than 40 years ago. \nMatt was a colleague in growing the Georgia Republican Party. We worked together to help elect Mack Mattingly the first Republican U.S. senator from Georgia in 1980. Matt became a successful attorney with a fascination for politics and government. He went on to win a state legislative seat and then became a force in the state legislature. \nIn 1992, when I was redistricted into a new congressional district in an effort to defeat me, Matt chaired my campaign and helped me survive despite the best efforts of the old Democratic machine. \nMatt wrote a best-selling book, “Powerchicks,” about the rising power of women in politics. \nHe became a very successful pollster with his own firm, Insider Advantage. He became an expert on politics in the Southeast and founded several state-focused magazines. \nWith that many different activities and achievements, you can imagine my surprise when he called to say he had written a bold new book on investing based on studying the news. He called it Newsvesting. \nI agreed to read it out of friendship. I found myself fascinated because it is in fact very interesting and thought-provoking. \nMatt has developed a knack for noticing the news that matters and then thinking deeply about its implications. \nLike Warren Buffett, he isn’t trying to run from shallow event to shallow event. He is looking for the deep, long waves that signal real opportunities or hazards about a sector or a company. \nRead the rest of the article on The Washington Times … \nChairman & Founding Publisher:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:20:36.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
