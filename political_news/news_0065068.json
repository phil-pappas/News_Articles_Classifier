And it is attracting criticism from all sides.\nHere's what is going on and why it matters.\nWhy does it matter? Image copyright Reuters When Scotland voted last year to remain part of the UK, David Cameron promised significantly increased powers for the Scottish Parliament, including the ability to set some tax and benefit levels.\nAt the same time, he promised English MPs they would get more power too - they would be able to legislate in areas such as health and education without any input from MPs representing Scottish seats. He called it \"English Votes for English Laws\", which got shortened to EVEL.\nGetting the balance of power between the different legislative bodies right is seen as important to the future of the UK. If the Westminster Parliament is going to have any authority, voters from all parts of the country must feel they are being fairly represented.\nWhy not just set up an English Parliament? Image copyright PA Image caption The vast majority of MPs in the House of Commons represent English constituencies This is what the SNP - who are firmly opposed to EVEL - claim the government is trying to do, in all but name. They claim the current plans will just make their MPs at Westminster \"second class\" citizens.\nSome argue that an English Parliament would strengthen the SNP's case for an independent Scotland, further weakening the ties that bind the UK together.\nThat has not stopped many Conservative MPs, who are in favour of the Union, calling for one to be set up to curb the power of Scottish MPs at Westminster.\nThe government is against an English Parliament - and it has come up with a formula it hopes will keep English and Scottish MPs happy. It is a big ask.\nSo how will it work exactly? All laws passed at Westminster will, in theory, continue to have the backing of the majority of MPs, just as they do now.\nBut an extra stage will be introduced in the middle of the law-making process, allowing English MPs to block anything they don't like the look of in bills deemed to be \"England only\".\nExplain that again, with the correct jargon The government will give English MPs a new \"veto\" over laws that only affect England .\nIn some cases it will be MPs from England and Wales who will get a say on laws not affecting Scotland or Northern Ireland.\nUnder the government's proposals , an England-only committee stage will consider bills deemed \"England-only in their entirety\", while agreement of a \"Legislative Grand Committee\" will be required for individual parts of legislation that relate only to England or England and Wales.\nAll MPs will vote on the other stages of the bill's journey through Parliament.\nHow many England-only laws are there? Quite a lot. The Scottish Parliament already has control over the NHS, education, criminal law, housing and economic development, with further powers on the way. The Welsh Assembly has power over health and education, with more to come. Northern Ireland can set its own laws in a whole range of areas, although it often adopts version of English laws.\nThe picture becomes even more murky when you consider laws that are, on the face of it, England, or England and Wales, only but have knock-on effects in Scotland and the other devolved nations.\nIf you want to get into this aspect in more detail, the McKay Commission looked into the whole issue.\nFollow the money Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Was spending on the 2012 Olympics for England, or the United Kingdom? There are also funding implications for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland when a spending commitment is made for England only, for example on the NHS. Under the current Barnett formula grant system, the devolved administrations' funding is adjusted to take into account changes to public spending in England.\nThis is often controversial, for example when spending on the London Olympics was deemed to be UK-wide, rather than England-only - triggering a row between Westminster and the devolved administrations.\nFor these reasons, according to House of Commons Library research , it is \"not a simple matter\" to count England-only bills. However, it adds that \"whatever method is used, there are relatively few bills that unambiguously affect England only\".\nThat's not the end of the matter though. There could be sections of a bill that apply only in England, even when the legislation itself extends across the United Kingdom.\nMore power for the Speaker Image copyright PA Image caption John Bercow may find himself at the centre of political rows The government says it will be for the Commons Speaker to decide whether a bill, or sections of a bill, apply only to England, or only to England and Wales.\nIn practice, civil servants will make a recommendation and Speaker John Bercow will abide by it. There are bound to be exceptions when one side or the other feels it is getting a raw deal - meaning the Mr Bercow could be dragged into political rows.\nThe SNP claims this will \"politicize\" the Speaker - he is meant to be above party political point scoring - but Commons leader Chris Grayling insists he is up to the job of being impartial and it won't be that different to the kind of judgements he is expected to make already.\nWhat is Labour saying about all this? Image copyright PA Image caption Labour's Chris Bryant wants an \"English voice\" in Parliament Labour has previously called for a \"constitutional convention\" to consider the issue, and has accused the Conservatives of \"rushing\" a decision that will enact \"profound constitutional change\".\nSince the plans were last debated, Labour has elected a new leader, Jeremy Corbyn, but remains opposed to the proposals.\nShadow Commons leader Chris Bryant says Labour backs \"an English voice in Parliament\" but does not want \"an English veto\".\nThe plans as they stand will \"create two tiers of MPs which will threaten the union and set England against Scotland,\" he added.\nUnder its previous leadership, the opposition called for devolution within England to regions and for the House of Lords to be replaced with a \"Senate of the Nations and the Regions\".", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/79755000/jpg/_79755059_79755058.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-29477233", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/22A2/production/_86266880_3179b24e-f2df-447a-beef-8c5b0cdbe41a.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/77710000/jpg/_77710716_77710711.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1573A/production/_86266878_5847e698-b5da-4fa6-bb51-ae3b5f225399.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33351688", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/77684000/jpg/_77684001_getty.jpg", "http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn07027/the-english-question", "http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130403030652/http://tmc.independent.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/The-McKay-Commission_Main-Report_25-March-20131.pdf", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/79767000/jpg/_79767810_79767809.jpg", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-votes-for-english-laws-proposed-changes#history"], "published": "2015-10-22T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:53:13.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
