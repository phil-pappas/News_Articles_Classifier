Equality belongs to us, the political system belongs to us.\n\"We’re within our rights to lay claim to both - so that’s what we’re going to do.”\nPoll loading …\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/benglaze", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics"], "published": "2015-10-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:31:50.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
