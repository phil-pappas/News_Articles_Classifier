Each such instance is punishable by up to 10 years in prison .\nThe FBI is so certain that it has seized four (count 'em: four) State Department servers in order to forensically determine who perpetrated those crimes.\nThe FBI has seized four State Department computer servers as part of its probe into how classified information was compromised on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email system … They are being checked by technical forensic analysts charged with determining how Top Secret material was sent to Clinton’s private email by State Department aides during her tenure as secretary from 2009 to 2013…\n…The FBI is trying to determine the origin of the highly classified information that was found in Clinton emails … the department also has been unwilling to say whether the private email system, used by Clinton and close aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, should be considered an official State Department network covered by FOIA laws.\n…The FBI probe of State Department servers is the latest disclosure on the criminal investigation into the private Clinton email server that has embroiled the leading Democratic presidential candidate for several months.\nThe politics surrounding the probe prompted FBI Director James Comey to tell reporters last week that the bureau will not be influenced by politics… “One of the main reasons I have a 10-year term is to make sure that this organization stays outside of politics, and if you know my folks, you know that they don’t give a whit about politics,” Comey said, adding that the FBI has devoted sufficient resources and personnel so that the Clinton email probe can be completed in a timely way.\nThose remarks were the first official confirmation of the investigation… In a sign of increasing worries about the probe at the Clinton campaign, the New York Post reported that an unidentified legal aide to Clinton has advised her to hire a criminal defense lawyer.\nThe number of communications regarded as classified is about 400 … Security analysts have voiced concerns that foreign hackers may have breached the private email server.\nOne theory is that Clinton aides who were cleared for access to national security secrets first read classified reports on State Department information system and then “gisted” the material into private emails for Clinton.\nLet me put it in simple terms for any Democrats reading along: it would seem that one or both of Clinton's most trusted aides, Huma Abedin or Cheryl Mills, broke federal laws regarding the handling of classified information. If they were normal peons like us, they'd already be breaking rocks at Leavenworth and braiding Top Dog Martha's hair.\nAt this point, I predict a race to a plea bargain between Huma and Cheryl, with the winner gaining some sort of immunity.\nGet to steppin', ladies. But make me a sammich first.\nHat tip : BadBlue Real-Time News .", "external_links": ["http://badblue.bitnamiapp.com/trendr8.htm", "http://freebeacon.com/politics/fbi-seizes-four-state-department-servers-in-clinton-email-probe/", "http://directorblue.blogspot.com//feeds/posts/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:39:23.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
