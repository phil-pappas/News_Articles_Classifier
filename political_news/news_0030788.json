He was shot and killed in the attack. She says security officers arrested one of al-Okbi's relatives on suspicion that he assisted the attacker.\nThe Israeli security agency Shin Bet said Monday the attacker had no past record of involvement in militant activity.\nPolice say the attacker was armed with a gun and knife and opened fire in a southern Israeli bus station, killing an Israeli soldier and wounding 10 people. An Eritrean migrant was also killed in the attack after an Israeli security guard fired at him, apparently thinking he was an assailant.\n___\n9 a.m.\nAn Israeli hospital official says an Eritrean migrant shot during an attack on a bus station has died of his wounds.\nSoroka Hospital spokeswoman Sharon Edri says the migrant died of his wounds late Sunday. Israeli officials say an Israeli soldier was also killed and several others hurt in the attack carried out by an Arab attacker armed with a gun and knife.\nIsraeli police said officers at the bus station mistakenly opened fire on the Eritrean man during the attack, apparently thinking he was an assailant.
