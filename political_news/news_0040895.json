Democratic presidential candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton listens while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015, before the House Benghazi Committee. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nBy James Warren Oct. 22, 2015 | 3:00 p.m. EDT + More Republicans on Thursday tried to play rope-a-dope with Hillary Clinton, who proved no dope about her role in the Benghazi tragedy.\nWith stacks of emails piled high, a House select committee inspired modest political theater but fewer factual insights on whether the then-secretary of state was responsible for and deceitful about the deaths of four Americans at two U.S compounds in 2012.\nThey appeared to have no new silver bullet or even a Styrofoam pellet. They were hot, she was cool. They were outraged, she seemed unflappable. The panel members on both sides were decidedly partisan. So much for Watergate Committee-like consensus.\nThe early hours of their exhausting daylong spectacle included the theatrically predictable: The Republican chairman skewering her and the White House, his Democratic counterpart deriding him, Clinton calmly defending herself and GOP panel members claiming they've discovered damning revelations amid hundreds of previously undisclosed emails.\nThroughout, Clinton proved again that she's an adroit practitioner when it comes to Capitol Hill performance. She was succinct and measured during the inquisitional thrust and parry; at times resembling a veteran junior high teacher assisting not especially bright students in understanding not just her answers but their own questions.\nAnd sitting behind her was lawyer David Kendall, one of the capital's most adroit and experienced attorneys. He's offered the Clinton family counsel during two decades of travails, including the Whitewater investigation, the Monica Lewinsky scandal and President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Benghazi ]\nIt was a reminder that this was far from the first legislative rodeo for Clinton or her brain trust. Several of her interrogators (on both sides) were either in college or not in politics when the Clintons experienced their first congressional fire in the 1990s.\nPanel Chairman Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican and former prosecutor, had opened by accusing her of being responsible for insufficient security in Benghazi. But he also refuted the notion, asserted by at least one high-ranking Republican colleague, that the hearing is all about knocking down her presidential campaign poll ratings. \"Let me assure you it is not,\" he said. \"This investigation is about four people who were killed representing our country on foreign soil.\"\nBut no sooner had he, lead Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Clinton made their opening remarks than the very first questions posed to Clinton diverted from Gowdy's purported mission.\nInstead, Illinois Republican Peter Roskam asked about the initial use of U.S military power in Libya, simultaneously seeking to both link her to the decision and blame her for the chaos that subsequently consumed Libya amid the downfall and death of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\nClinton drove the policy, did she not, asked Roskam (who was, ironically, an occasional ally of Barack Obama on some issues when they served together in the Illinois legislature)?\n\"Well, congressman, I was the secretary of state,\" she said. But her boss, President Obama, made the key decision with other countries in the region and Europe asking for U.S. assistance.\n[ READ: It's Gowdy Doody Time ]\nOther Republicans went down different paths, including what are transparent weaknesses in the Clinton defense. Those include the tardy response to requests from Ambassador Christopher Stevens for more security in Benghazi, as well as the initial White House spin of the attack as inspired by an anti-Muslim video, as opposed to terrorists.\nBut other lines of inquiry had little to do with the actual deaths of the four Americans.\nOne Republican wanted to know why nobody at the State Department was fired, while another focused on an email with negative assessment of Clinton by two lower-level State Department workers.\nA third inquired at length about her frequent email exchanges with Sidney Blumenthal, a former journalist and longtime Clinton family confidante and vocal advocate who's seen as a nefarious figure by GOP members.\nClinton sought to underscore the complexity of the Libyan situation, unintended consequences of good intentions, the need for Congress to find common ground and her own devotion to the job.\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Hillary Clinton ]\nWith her voice seemingly catching, she cited her travels to 112 countries while Secretary of State and devotion to the nation and the job. National security had to be placed ahead of politics and ideology. Later, she'd talk about how she'd lost more sleep than any of the assembled over the Benghazi deaths.\n\"I am here to honor those we lost and to aid those who serve us still,\" she said. \"My challenge to you, members of the committee, is the same I put to myself: Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed on us. They expect us to lead ... to reach for statesmanship.\"\nBut the initial three and a half hours brought no consensus, especially as Democrats themselves seemed far more inclined to reflexively defend Clinton than question her.\n\"We've learned absolutely nothing new,\" said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington. Yes, there were a lot more emails. But had those uncovered anything that seven previous congressional investigations and one internal State Department probe had not? \"The answer is no,\" he said.\nThe indisputable fact that the Republican majority disagrees was to play out during the remainder of Clinton's testimony â€“ and the expected 20 witnesses to follow in coming days.\nTAGS: Gowdy, Trey Clinton, Hillary politics Libya Cummings, Elijah Congress", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg5ij%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Hillary%20Clinton%20and%20the%20Benghazi%20Committee%3A%20Modest%20Theater%2C%20Few%20Insights&summary=Hillary%20Clinton%27s%20Benghazi%20Committee%20testimony%20was%20predictable%20and%20not%20especially%20enlightening.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg5ij%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Hillary%20Clinton%20and%20the%20Benghazi%20Committee%3A%20Modest%20Theater%2C%20Few%20Insights", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg5ij%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Hillary%20Clinton%20and%20the%20Benghazi%20Committee%3A%20Modest%20Theater%2C%20Few%20Insights", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg5ij%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg5ij%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg5ij%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:51:26.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
