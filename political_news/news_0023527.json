Related Content Legislators propose raising conviction cap to $1 million \nThe case to be argued Monday represents the latest push from the American Civil Liberties Union against a law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature and signed by Gov. Scott Walker. \nThe Wisconsin Justice Department is defending the legislation, saying the case amounts to a request for judges to overstep their authority and rewrite the law. \nSupporters say voters should be required to show ID to guard against election fraud. \nOpponents, however, say its true intent is to make voting tougher for older, poor and minority voters who tend to support Democrats and are less likely to have proper ID. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
