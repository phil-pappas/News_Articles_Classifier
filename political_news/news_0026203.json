This places mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability world-wide.\nWhile various forms of treatment are available, the WHO states that two-thirds of people suffering never seek help. Primarily due to fears of stigma and discrimination, individuals are left with feelings of loneliness and isolation. From children dealing with schoolyard bullying, to executives coping with workplace pressures-the need to put the spotlight on enabling people to attain inner wellbeing, never seemed so timely.\nNow people can get help from the privacy of their own homes via enritsch.com, which is set to become the world's largest health & wellness community. This free service enables members to access information and a range of resources; seek expert advice; locate, and post reviews on service providers-enabling them to make informed decisions.\n\"We are all about enritsch-ing people's lives. The concept of community for us extends beyond providing solutions to people's daily challenges. It also means supporting our fellow brothers and sisters in the global sense of the word through charitable partnerships and giving. Our work is inspired by our desire to make a positive contribution to humanity,\" said founder Stefan Ritsch , a resident of the UAE.\n\"Although companies around the Middle East are stepping up their efforts to create a healthier, happier education environment and workforce through a range of initiatives-the statistics speak for themselves. They point to the the need for ongoing education and awareness; and to equip people with the tools to be able to achieve a positive state of physical, mental and social wellbeing.\"\nEnritsch is working on establishing partnerships with a range of government and private sector companies specializing in all aspects of health and wellness.\nThrough collaboration and cooperation, the consortium will focus on substantially reducing the number of people suffering from a mental health illness around the world.\nPeople can register for free at http://www.enritsch.com.\nAs part of the launch, Enritsch are encouraging people to share their stories about how someone they know - a friend, family member or someone in their community - through their act of kindness, has helped bring joy to someone else's life.\nA Health & Wellness package valued at 5,000 DHS will be awarded to the post with the most amount of votes given by the community.\nTo enter, go to http://www.facebook.com/enritschinglives , tag the person you are nominating and leave a comment, picture or video saying why you believe they are #EnritschingLives .\nThe competition will run from Sunday 11 October until the end of the month.\nAbout Enritsch:\nWe are all about \"enritsch-ing people's lives\" around the world.
