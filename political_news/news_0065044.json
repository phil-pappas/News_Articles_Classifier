About 28% of likely caucusgoers said they support Carson, 20% back Trump, 13% support Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and 10% are for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \nThe survey is the first major poll to find Trump trailing by a significant margin nationally or in the four early states since a CNN national poll taken June 26-28, which showed Trump behind Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 12% to 19%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:29:59.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
