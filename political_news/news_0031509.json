Yet he pointedly accused Republicans of resorting to \"gimmicks\" and prohibiting other changes needed to address modern security threats.\n\"Unfortunately, it falls woefully short,\" Obama said. \"I'm going to be sending it back to Congress, and my message to them is very simple: Let's do this right.\"\nThe rare presidential veto marked the latest wrinkle in the ongoing fight between Obama and Republicans who control Congress over whether to increase federal spending - and how.\nFour years after Congress passed and Obama signed into law strict, across-the-board spending limits, both parties are eager to bust through the caps for defense spending. But Obama has insisted that spending on domestic programs be raised at the same time, setting off a budget clash with Republicans that has yet to be resolved.\nTo side-step the budget caps, known in Washington as sequestration, lawmakers added an extra $38.3 billion to a separate account for wartime operations that is immune to the spending limits. The White House has dismissed that approach as a \"gimmick\" that fails to deal with the broader problem or provide long-term budget certainty for the Pentagon.\nObama also rejects the bill as written due to provisions making it harder for him to transfer suspected terror detainees out of the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a key campaign promise that Obama is hard-pressed to fulfill before his term ends. The White House has also expressed concerns over provisions preventing military base closures and funding equipment beyond what the military says it needs.\nBut Republicans lambasted Obama for prioritizing the domestic spending he seeks over the security of U.S. troops and the nation they protect.\n\"This is the worst possible time for an American president to veto their national defense bill, and especially to do so for arbitrary partisan reasons,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor.\nThe veto forces Congress to revise the bill or try to settle the larger budget dispute. Although Republicans have vowed to try to override Obama's veto, the White House insisted it was confident it had the votes to ensure Obama's veto stays in place.\n___\nReach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:00:09.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
