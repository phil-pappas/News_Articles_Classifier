It would be a meaningful and substantial response to the scale of human suffering we see daily.\"\nPromoted stories Speaking on their behalf, the Right Reverend Paul Butler, the Bishop of Durham, argued that the crisis was a “time of opportunity for us as a country and for our wider continent...to rise above narrow self-interest, however defined, and to embrace the highest parts of our humanity”.\nAlex Salmond, the former First Minister and now the SNP’s foreign affairs spokesman, also decried the Government's response, saying: \"It is obviously inadequate in terms of numbers but it is also this idea that you can ignore the refugees who have arrived in Europe; that's not tenable. It's not tenable because the countries, which are closest on proximity, can't bear that pressure alone. You have to act in terms of solidarity.\"\nBut Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, said: \"No country in Europe is doing more in Syria than we are. We are spending a billion pounds helping the refugees in the refugee camps in Syria and now we have announced that we will take 20,000 - 5000 a year for the rest of this Parliament.\"\nMeanwhile, the crisis deepened with the deaths of five people, including a baby and two children, as migrants attempted to reach Greece from Turkey.
