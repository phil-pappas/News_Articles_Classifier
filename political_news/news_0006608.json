She said the district has been cooperating with the Town of Crawford Police Department in its investigation, including sharing the school’s video surveillance records. \n“Behavior such as this, which is disrespectful to students, teachers and staff in the district as well as the entire Pine Bush School District community, will not be tolerated,” Carbone said. \nShe added that the graffiti is in the process of being removed, also mentioning that any other damage to the building sustained in the act will be repaired as quickly as quickly as possible. \nCarbone reaffirmed district administrators and the students’ families will be in contact to discuss additional disciplinary action. \nReports surfaced dismissing any connection between Friday’s incident and a series of anti-Semitic incidents a few years ago that led to legal action against the school district. \nThe school district agreed to pay $4.48 million, while also agreeing to enact broad reforms in curriculum and training in a settlement with five current and former Jewish students who claimed that they had been victims of pervasive anti-Semitism in the schools, a court filing showed. \nIn the wake of the 2012 lawsuit, the school district and plaintiffs issued statements claiming anti-Semitism harassment to be wrong. \n“The district will never condone anti-Semitic slurs or graffiti, Holocaust ‘jokes’ or physical violence,” the joint statement read on. “No family should have to experience the hurt and pain that bullying and name-calling can cause children to endure because of their religious, national or cultural identity \nThe district never admitted to any wrongdoing or fault in the settlement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:09:07.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
