Previously, Lew had warned that he would exhaust the \"extraordinary measures\" he's using to make payments under the $18.1 trillion debt limit on Nov. 5. Now, he warned, he expects to be left with no resources except for $30 billion in cash after Nov. 3, less than three weeks away.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ Lew's message will increase the pressure on outgoing House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to raise the debt ceiling before his planned retirement at the end of October. Republicans have yet to select a new speaker after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., bowed out of the race, which means Republicans may be hamstrung in dealing with the debt ceiling until they find a new leader.\nComplicating it further, many conservative members of the House won't want to raise the debt ceiling unless it's part of a deal to cut spending further.\n  McCarthy warns against Obama's drawdown in Afghanistan \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy praised President Obama's decision to keep troops in Afghanistan Thursday, but warned against an \"arbitrary drawdown\" in 2016.\nMcCarthy, R-Calif., issued a statement following Obama's Thursday announcement that he was delaying plans to pull all American troops out of Afghanistan by the end of his term.\nInstead, Obama said he would keep nearly 9,800 troops in the region until October 2016 and then cut back to 5,500 troops in early 2017.\nMcCarthy warned against the planned reduction, citing Taliban gains in Afghanistan.\n\"The president should not continue his arbitrary troop drawdown from 9,800 troops to 5,500 in 2016 until conditions on the ground and U.S. national security\nBy Susan Ferrechio â€¢ 10/15/15 12:59 PM Lew has been managing government accounts to pay incoming bills without raising the debt ceiling since March, when a previous suspension of the debt ceiling ended.\nOnce all the tools for managing the debt to keep it below the ceiling are exhausted, he will only have cash on hand and incoming revenues to pay for the government's bills.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated Wednesday that the Treasury would face the possibility of missing a payment on the debt or on another obligation \"sometime during the first half of November.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:11:47.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
