The four, all students at Summerville High School in Tuolumne, Calif., “were going to come on campus and shoot and kill as many people as possible at the campus,” Sheriff James W. Mele of Tuolumne County said at a news conference on Saturday. Investigators have found no clear motive for the planned attack, Sheriff Mele said, but he said that “the suspects' plans were very detailed in nature and included names of would-be victims, locations and methods in which the plan was to be carried out.”", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/us/4-students-arrested-in-northern-california-suspected-of-plotting-killings-in-high-school.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:53:08.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
