He appeared spry and energetic as he lauded his former vice president in a packed ballroom in Washington. \nCarter says he wanted Mondale to play a key role in his White House because as a peanut farmer from Georgia, he \"needed a lot of help.\" \nCarter is also weighing in on more recent world events. He says all Americans should support the nuclear deal with Iran. Carter says he spoke about the deal Tuesday with Secretary of State John Kerry. \nThe former president says the worst human rights violations taking place today are against women and girls.
