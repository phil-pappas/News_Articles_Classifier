Shame can be addressed in treatment by using cognitive-behavioral therapy, increasing self-efficacy, the Twelve Steps and related principles. It is important to understand that shame is deadly, yet has a purpose in the beginning of addiction treatment as a useful survival tool. Over time, however, shame leads to isolation, anxiety, depression and relapse. Shame is an internal process that feeds upon itself in addiction, but external factors, such as the stigma attached to addiction, also impact the shame cycle. Reaching out to others, telling one's story and having healthy relationships with self and others are key components to fighting the cycle of shame.\nThis presentation will help participants better understand the role of shame in addiction and recovery and how to help those seeking recovery gain the courage to address the fears that keep their shame alive.\nTo register\nAll are welcome but advance registration is strongly recommended.
