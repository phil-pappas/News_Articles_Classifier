Their continuing refusal only gives weight to those who believe this is a bad deal for New Zealanders, and a slap in the face for democracy. \n“All the indications are that the TPP has been concocted solely for the benefit of foreign companies and their sharp-suited billionaires, not for the people of New Zealand. \n“The inclusion of so-called investor state dispute settlement clauses gives special legal rights to foreign investors, which could see our government being sued for, say, stopping the pollution of our rivers if these companies think it would undermine their profits. \n“From what we can tell so far, and given the government’s withholding of the details, this deal looks like very bad news for New Zealanders, for the seas in which we swim and fish, the air we breathe, and even for our health.” \nENDS Greenpeace \nGreenpeace exists because this fragile earth deserves a voice. \nGreenpeace is an independent global campaigning organisation that acts to change attitudes and behaviour, to protect and conserve the environment and to promote peace.
