Trey Gowdy told CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that he's primarily interested in Clinton's account of the attacks because she was secretary of state at the time. That she's the leading Democratic candidate for president, he says, is of no interest.\nThat's the opposite of what two Republican members of Congress have said. A former staffer for Gowdy's committee has also said the probe is primarily political.\nGowdy says those critics are uninformed.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:28:01.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
