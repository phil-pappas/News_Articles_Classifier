In it, women like Martha Plimpton and Margaret Cho read the offensive comments directed toward women who dared to share their abortion stories via #ShoutYourAbortion . The comments, conceived in malice and meant to sting, are in reality completely often nonsensical and even unintentionally hilarious, like this one: \"If you understood physiology, you'd know that the interior of uterus is external to woman's body. Like inside of mouth.\"\n ​The most badass thing about this video, though, is that it features Amelia Bonow, one of the women who launched the hashtag and actually had to go into hiding because of the threats she received . It's nice to see that Bonow is shouting back.\nCorrection: A previous version of this post called the organization ​A is For Advancing the Rights of Women ​. It is called A is For.\nFollow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/prachigu", "https://vimeo.com/142463362", "https://vimeo.com/aisfororg", "http://www.aisfor.org/#sthash.uIBWKolU.dpbs", "https://player.vimeo.com/video/142463362"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:28:05.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
