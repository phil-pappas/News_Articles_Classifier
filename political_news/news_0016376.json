The fact that this woman was in a men’s prison to begin with goes to show how little regard Corrections has for the safety of incarcerated people, especially if they’re trans.’ \n‘The Department of Corrections knows that she is a trans woman, as they are administering her hormone treatment. But she is being kept in a men’s facility anyway.’ \nThe group will be making two demands at the rally. \n‘We will be demanding firstly that Serco and the Department of Corrections release public statements, taking responsibility for what happened last week. This would not have happened if not for the placement policies of Corrections, and for both Serco and Corrections’ thorough mismanagement of the facility,’ says Rākete. \n‘Secondly, we will be demanding that the Department of Corrections reform their policy regarding the initial placement of transgender people in men’s or women’s facilities. We demand that the Department of Corrections publicly demonstrates its efforts in doing so.’ \nThough the prison concerned in this case is run by a partnership between the Department of Corrections and private company Serco, No Pride in Prisons stresses that this is not a privatisation issue. According to Rākete, ‘the government cannot deflect blame for these incidents onto Serco.’ \n‘Corrections policies maintain the prison system at the cost of human safety.’ \nClick here for a link to the rally’s Facebook event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/470315266474767/ \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:12:53.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
