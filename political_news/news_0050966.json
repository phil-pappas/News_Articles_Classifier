Voters will be asked to approve a tax increase to help pay for it.\nUnder a 1980s judgment, the city owed firefighters $75 million in back wages, plus $67 million in interest, because it had not given firefighters raises required by state law.\nThe mayor did not address all of the details of the deal in his remarks at the news conference, which was also attended by union officials.\nLandrieu was held in contempt by a civil district judge over the dispute last month, but he was spared weekend house arrest during an appeal.\nThe deal marks a significant accomplishment for the two-term mayor. New Orleans has been ordered by the federal government to carry out costly reforms to its prison and police department, and has also has been struggling to afford more police officers and make street repairs.\n(Reporting by Letitia Stein in Tampa, Fla.; Editing by Mohammad Zargham )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:12:06.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
