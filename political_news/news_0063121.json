But the Prime Minister’s working group has revealed that the period to gain net profit has been delayed to 2037, as Mongolia has received financing of seven billion USD for underground mine construction through the Dubai deal. We wonder why the Justice Coalition is staying silent, with no opposition, when Oyu Tolgoi issues are in such a difficult situation. During the last meeting of the 2015 Spring Parliamentary Session, the Mongolian People’s Party promised to introduce conclusions on the Dubai deal soon. However, the report still hasn’t been made. The Prime Minister said not to politicize Oyu Tolgoi, but we can’t observe these actions in silence, when it turns out that Mongolia will not gain any profit from that huge mine which could feed our country for many years.” \nAt the press conference MP S.Ganbaatar said, “Mongolia is in foreign debt of 21 billion USD and is considering salary deductions. In 2009, when the Oyu Tolgoi deal was signed, we had no debt. In 2039 when the deal is concluded, we will be seeing value from the mine for only for the second year, which means Mongolia is getting almost nothing. Even though we receive royalty taxes of five percent, we pay money equivalent to three percent for management expenses. I am being blamed for telling the truth. \n“There are many regretful measures on the budget. Approximately two billion USD is being saved by deducting salaries and liquidating agencies. Meanwhile, it was decided to spend a whole 17.5 billion USD only for getting advice from an American firm, and 10 billion USD of it has been already been spent.” \n\nAfter the press conference, independent parliamentarians answered questions from correspondents. \nWhat is the position of independent parliamentary members on the Cabinet’s decision to liquidate and integrate agencies? \nWe think the Procurement Office should exist. We had bitter experiences with procurement being carried out at every ministry and raising disputes, making the health ministry the construction ministry. It was the correct decision to unite the functions of procurement at every ministry. Budgets for environmental protection and fighting air pollution were cut. We see both correct and incorrect decisions in the budget amendments. \nWhat is wrong with financing for Oyu Tolgoi’s underground mine development? \nIt was estimated that 4.2 billion USD in investment was needed for the underground mine, however, investment of six billion USD was approved with the Dubai deal. This six billion USD won’t come to Mongolia. Rio Tinto has the right to spend its liabilities. Mongolia’s land and licenses are pledges as collateral. The Dubai deal was printed in English and Mongolian and then it was signed, but Ch.Saikhanbileg claimed at a parliamentary meeting that the Dubai deal should be translated into Mongolian. Then we asked him whether the Mongolian copy of the agreement was lost in Dubai. There are lots of suspicious things about the Dubai deal. \nIndependent parliamentarians signed a request to impeach the Prime Minister. How many other parliamentarians have signed it so far? \nWe believe that the Dubai deal is not beneficial to Mongolia and made a request to impeach Prime Minister Ch.Saikhabileg. So far, 14 Members of Parliament have signed the official request letter. When the Oyu Tolgoi issues will be delivered to an arbitration court someday, we should be left with the fact that the State of Mongolia did not approve of the Dubai deal. \n\nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16517   13  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:59:53.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
