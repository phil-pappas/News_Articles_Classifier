Suddenly, all of Obama’s bizarre behavior to help Muslims makes sense…\nNot that I give credence or trust for any Russian official, but Putin is right on many levels in this video. What I don’t understand is why it takes the testimony of a professional Politburo pinko to make the article author, or ANYONE, think that “Suddenly, all of Obama’s bizarre behavior to help Muslims makes sense.”\nReally???? I reckon his seven years of OBVIOUS BEHAVIOR, loyalty toward the Muslim Brotherhood, and ALL OF THE ISLAMIC WORLD didn’t make any sense before. Now suddenly it does???\nThe only thing “bizarre” at this stage of the White House mosqued Presidency of Obamalek is that not enough Americans, especially political pundits, actually acknowledge that we have a Muslim Mole in the Oval Office. When they FINALLY do that, they’ll understand ALL OF HIS BIZARRE BEHAVIOR.\nMakes a feller want to hit the hard stuff early and give himself a root canal.\nJW\nSee original article here:\nhttp://mrconservative.com/2015/10/65135-breaking-putin-exposes-obamas-disturbing-connection-to-isis/", "external_links": ["http://shoebat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/obama-isis-strategy.jpg", "http://mrconservative.com/2015/10/65135-breaking-putin-exposes-obamas-disturbing-connection-to-isis/", "http://toprightnews.com/leaked-footage-of-putin-exposes-obamas-connection-with-isis-watch-before-its-taken-down/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ykb5sxTl1Rw"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:46:24.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
