The format is used by Tinder, a popular dating app that lets men and women swipe left to reject someone and right to accept them.\nRead More The ad also hits Rubio for saying he does not support an abortion exception in the case of rape and incest and Carson for saying, \"There is no war on women, there may be a war on what is inside of women, but there is no on women in this country.\"\nThe ad then cuts to Clinton campaigning in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in September.\n\"I'm a proud, lifelong fighter for women's issues because I firmly believe what's good for women is good for American,\" Clinton says.\nThe finger then returns on screen to swipe right for Clinton.\nThe five figure ad buy will run in Nevada and nationally and will be targeted to women voters.\n\"In 2016 Nevadans will have a clear choice between a Republican candidate obsessed with taking away women's healthcare decisions and a committed advocate for their best interests in Hillary Clinton,\" said Justin Barasky, Communications Director at Priorities USA.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8iEiBRmpK0", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:10:01.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
