Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah and his wife Julie walk on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, prior to a vote to replace outgoing House Speaker John Boehner. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is the front-runner in the race to become the next speaker, but he faces two Republican opponents who are trying to draw some of his support. Chaffetz and three-term Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida both say they can bring a needed fresh perspective to GOP leadership, unlike McCarthy, who has served as majority leader under Boehner.
