The International Organization for Migration said more than 593,000 people have crossed this year — of which 453,000 traveled from Turkey to Greece, which has faced a massive influx of people from Syria. (AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris)\nAssociated Press Oct. 14, 2015 | 8:01 a.m. EDT + More WARSAW, Poland (AP) — The latest news as migrants fleeing war or seeking a better life make their way across Europe by the tens of thousands. All times local.\n2 p.m.\nCroatia's conservative president says her country might need to build a fence on its border to stop the migrant influx just as neighboring Hungary has done — comments that are drawing criticism.\nPresident Kolinda Grabar Kitarovic tells the Jutarnji List daily on Wednesday that \"I think some kind of a fence or physical barrier will be needed in the future.\"\nShe adds \"I would like to avoid that, but I don't see how else we can protect ourselves,\" particularly if neighboring countries close their borders with Croatia.\nHungary has sealed its border with Serbia and threatened to do the same with Croatia because of the tens of thousands of migrants crossing through to go to Western Europe. Croatia's liberal government has ruled out building a fence.\nMore than 170,000 asylum-seekers have passed through Croatia since mid-September.\n___\n1:50 p.m.\nEuropean Union nations are failing to live up to their pledges to provide more funds and experts to help cope with Europe's refugee emergency.\nEuropean Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said Wednesday \"noble words need to be followed by concrete actions\" and that commitments are \"far below what is required.\"\nThe EU's border agency and asylum office have appealed for around 1,000 more officers, while the executive Commission has requested hundreds of millions of euros in funding.\nIn the three weeks since the leaders' last emergency summit on immigration, around 12 of the 28 EU nations have offered 130 personnel. Just three states have pledged a total of 12 million euros ($13.7 million) to a migration fund that is aiming to reach 1.8 billion euros ($2 billion).\nTimmerman timed his appeal on the eve of another EU summit in Brussels.\n___\n1:20 p.m.\nFormer Polish prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski says migrants who have arrived recently in Europe are carrying diseases that could hurt the local populations.\nThe words sparked a sharp rebuke on Wednesday from a left-wing politician, Janusz Palikot, who slammed Kaczynski's words as racist language that Adolf Hitler \"would not be ashamed of.\"\nKaczynski, whose opposition Law and Justice party is expected to win parliamentary elections on Oct. 25, told voters Tuesday in Makow Mazowiecki that: \"There are already signs of the emergence of very dangerous diseases which haven't been seen in Europe for a long time: cholera on Greek islands; dysentery in Vienna; various types of parasites, protozoa, which aren't dangerous in the organisms of these people, but which could be dangerous here.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
