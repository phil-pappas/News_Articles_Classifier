All passengers can still claim compensation in the traditional way, using an application form, but many do not make claims to which they are entitled.\nBased on the current pattern of delays and number of advance tickets it sells, Virgin said it would pay out an estimated £3.8m next year with the automated system, instead of £1m.\nSome automatic refunds are already paid by Transport for London, which can pay out to passengers with registered Oyster cards or contactless payment cards affected by mass delays on the tube or London Overground, but Virgin is the first national operator to introduce such a system.\nThe transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said it was fantastic news for West Coast passengers, adding: “Virgin Trains are making the most of modern technology to improve the service customers get. Our plan is to make sure passengers across the country benefit from schemes like this and we are encouraging other operators to roll out similar schemes nationwide.”\nMike Hewitson, head of policy at the independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: “This is a great step forward and we would like to see this system introduced across all operators and ticket types.”\nHowever, until a network-wide scheme is introduced, even Virgin passengers may have to claim in a traditional way. A journey with connections across different train operators will not be eligible for automatic refunds. But Virgin said 13.5m journeys a year would potentially be covered. A delay of more than 30 minutes will see half the fare for that single journey refunded, while more than an hour will deliver a full refund.\nAbout 5% of Virgin’s trains were either cancelled, late by more than 30 minutes or failed to make a scheduled stop in the past 12 months, according to Network Rail figures, although the majority of delays were caused by factors not attributed to Virgin.\nNetwork Rail paid a net £105m to train operators for disruption and delays last year, including £15m to Virgin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:49:08.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
