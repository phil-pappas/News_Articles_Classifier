The same party leaders who now draw the map of districts would likely appoint commission members. In other words, just another step to the same old same old.\nAnd to those of us with any significant political memory, the term “blue-ribbon commission” raises the specter not of greater equality or control but of a group of older, predominantly white men making decisions for the increasing number of us who are minorities and women — usually not to our advantage.\nWhile imperfect, under the current system we the people choose our representatives every two years. Those representatives are accountable to us. With an independent commission, where is the accountability to the people? How are our concerns accounted for when these commissioners are appointed?\nFurther, I strongly doubt that it is party leaders using Lincoln’s hat to determine who draws the map who discourage nearly two thirds of eligible Illinois voters from exercising their right to vote. Few outside of insider political circles know or care.\nWorking with immigrants, whose primary goal is to become citizens and enjoy the many privileges that accompany that status, I’ve been fortunate to see close up how these eager voters see the system. They are not concerned with who makes the map. Rather, the frustration they experience comes from the arcane rules of voter registration, which, despite the efforts of leaders such as Cook County Clerk David Orr, seem aimed at diminishing rather than expanding vote totals in their communities.\nThey (and I) are also discouraged by the massive amounts of money poured into specific races by named and, increasingly, anonymous entities, a reflection of the increasing disparity of income and influence that dogs our state and our nation. These factors, not the “hat dance,” are the real impediments to more effective democracy.\nWhatever side you were on, the Chicago elections this past spring were an interesting case of what is possible. Fifteen new aldermen won seats — many running against well-heeled incumbents — through big-time on-the-ground involvement and grassroots organizing; that is, the old-fashioned way. These contests contrasted sharply with the elections last November, when even many “good Democrats” sat out. The only thing that would have been better in these unexpected city election contests would have been even greater participation. And that’s something we can do something about.\nBefore we start messing with the Illinois Constitution, why not start with initiatives to facilitate more people voting, such as same-day voter registration, online registration, and elections held on weekends rather than on a weekday. And while we are at it, why not try real campaign finance reform? Restrictions on campaign spending? Shortened election periods? Limits on campaign advertising?\nThese ideas work in other places from England to Israel; their voter participation rates are higher, and their legislative bodies more diverse.\nWe’ve seen the impact of money and restrictive voting policies not only in Illinois but throughout the nation. If we want true reform and competitive races to occur, let’s go beyond appearances and get to core problems beneath.\nLawrence Benito is CEO of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant & Refugee Rights (ICIRR), an umbrella organization of 130 immigrant-serving organizations across Illinois.\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: Follow @csteditorials\nTweets by @CSTeditorials\nSend letters to: letters@suntimes.com", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/csteditorials", "https://twitter.com/CSTeditorials"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:38:40.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
