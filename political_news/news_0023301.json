Israel has adamantly denied the allegations.\nThe worst of the violence flared up on Tuesday when Palestinians committed four attacks that killed three Israelis and wounded many more. And on Friday, a Palestinian posing as a journalist stabbed an Israeli soldier.\nRepublican U.S. lawmakers have pressed the Obama administration to take a more active role. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a Republican presidential candidate, blasted the administration for blaming \"both sides.\"\n\"As Palestinian terrorists continue to murder and maim Israelis, the Obama administration is spreading malicious falsehoods about the attacks,\" Rubio said in a statement.\nOn Thursday, Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., called for a State Department spokesman to be removed from his position for saying an Israeli stabbing attacker committed terrorism.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:07:49.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
