Posted \nWhat happens to the Obamacare if the Republicans win the White House? Sadly, the answer is, not much. \nCNBC reports: For more than half a decade, the GOP has blasted President Barack Obama's signature health-care reform legislation, and the law remains deeply unpopular with the party's base. But experts say a Republican president would have to clear a very high bar in getting Congress to kill the Affordable Care Act outright, even though GOP candidates have called for doing that. Reforming and improving the ACA is a much more likely option, they say, noting that even Democratic contenders like Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for making changes to Obamacare, such as eliminating the \"Cadillac tax\" on pricey health plans. \"I don't think there's much chance, at all, of repeal at this point,\" said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, Altman said that if a Republican wins the White House next year, and if the GOP retains control over both houses of Congress, \"you can expect another big debate about the ACA in 2017, which will focus on substantial changes to the law.\" \nFor those of us suffering under the oppression of the \"affordable care act,\" this offers little hope. But a little hope is better than the alternative, so here's a big reason to push to keep the Democrats out of the White House in 2016,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:07:56.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
