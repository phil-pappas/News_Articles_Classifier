Osteoporosis-related fractures most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine.\nBone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesn’t keep up with the removal of old bone.\nOsteoporosis affects men and women of all races. However, white and Asian women — especially older women who are past menopause — are at the highest risk. Medications, healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones.\nThere typically are no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss. However, once bones have been weakened by osteoporosis. You may have signs and symptoms that include:\nBack pain, caused by a fractured or collapsed vertebra.\nLoss of height over time\nA stooped posture\nA bone fracture that occurs much more easily than expected.\nFor additional information, please contact: James Matthew at Miracle Alternatives, LLC by phone (1.888.870.5581),\nFax () or email (support@hgllc.co).\nYou will also find further information on our web site at http://MiracleAlternatives.com\nThe QRS 101 Home System isn’t only a machine to treat osteoporosis, pain and other conditions.
