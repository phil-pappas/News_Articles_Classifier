Show Caption Next \nWASHINGTON — It was over in just minutes and almost no one saw it coming. \n“Everyone was eating barbecue and McCarthy dropped the bomb,” said U.S. Rep. Curt Clawson, R-Bonita Springs. “I don’t think anybody saw it coming.” \nThat would be Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, thought to be the most likely prospect to succeed outgoing House Speaker John Boehner. Instead, McCarthy told the 247-member House Republican Conference he was bowing out of the Speaker’s race, explaining later, “I just think it’s best to have a new face.” \nClawson, a member of the 40-member Freedom Caucus whose endorsement of fellow Floridian and former Florida House Speaker Daniel Webster prevented McCarthy from reaching the 218 votes he’d have needed to win, said the race is now “impossible to predict…because I don’t know who’s considering jumping in.” \nMcCarthy had been challenged both by Webster and Jason Chaffetz of Utah. On Thursday, there was much speculation about drafting Wisconsin Congressman and former vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan for the job. No date for a conference election has been set. \nAsked if his party’s inability to hold a leadership election suggested that the caucus is ungovernable, Clawson gave his trademark outsider’s reply. \n“I personally think that the ambiguity of the current situation is OK, and that it’s an opportunity for improvement,” he said. “I view this whole process as an opportunity for improvement and an opportunity for a different leadership style which, I think, could help the whole nation. \n“The market and the voters are crying out for outsiders and folks with a different skill set,” he said. \nWhile the Freedom Caucus has endorsed Webster, Clawson said he is obligated “as the race opens up” to consider other candidates. Asked if he’d support McCarthy if he decided to stay on as majority leader and Steve Scalise of Louisiana stayed as whip, Clawson said he had respect for McCarthy putting “the team” ahead of his own ambitions. \nBut he said he would not speculate on the other chairs in the leadership. \n“It’s too early till we have the top guy figured out and he should have a chance to influence the assembly of his own team, as in any sport or business,” he said. \nClawson said he doesn’t see the leadership uncertainty as a distraction from the important and required work before the Congress as a series of deadlines for extending the debt ceiling and keeping the government operating loom. \n“People know how to do their jobs,” he said.
