Donald Trump stuck a shiv into the Republican establishment Friday by suggesting that former President George W.

Bush listens as he is introduced at the Pentagon Jan. 10, 2002, to sign the Defense Department Appropriations Bill. But Trump would not budge.\n\"He was President, OK?” the GOP front-runner said. “Blame him, or don't blame him, but he was President. The World Trade Center came down during his reign.\"\nTrump’s crack is likely to send shockwaves through the Republican ranks, especially Bush’s brother Jeb, who is also running for President.\nSTR/Reuters \"When you talk about George Bush, I mean, say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time,\" Trump said. But it’s not the first time Trump has dissed Dubya. He has called his presidency a “disaster” several times.\nThe bipartisan 9/11 Commission, which investigated the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, concluded the administrations of Bush and his predecessor President Clinton both made mistakes that allowed Osama Bin Laden to launch the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.\nBut it did not blame any one person for the intelligence failures.\nBush’s former counterterror chief Richard Clarke, however, testified that Bush scaled back their anti-terror efforts in the months before the attacks — and apologized to the families of the 9/11 victims for failing to protect their loved ones.\ncsiemaszko@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:15:46.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
