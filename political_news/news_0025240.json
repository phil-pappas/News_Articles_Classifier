Court documents say there were three bullet holes in the driver's-side front window and another bullet hole in the vertical support behind the window.\nAs Hoffman was shooting, Gutierrez accelerated. He and another witness told police they saw the Chevy truck pull off the highway at Bell Road. Gutierrez was not injured despite the shattered glass from the gunfire, and he called police from a QuikTrip parking lot in Peoria.\nRelated Stories I-10 Shootings Suspect Formally Charged by Maricopa County Attorney I-10 Shootings Suspect Claims Innocence Amid Social Media Outcry Against Ducey's Damning Tweet Three Teens Arrested in \"Copycat\" Incidents to I-10 Shootings Christopher Joel Hoffman Maricopa County Sheriff's Office The incident occurred about 11 a.m. Saturday, Initially, law enforcement wondered whether the incident could be connected to the freeway shooting spree that terrorized Phoenix drivers from late August through mid-September. But as more information came in throughout the weekend, the Arizona Department of Public Safety declared it an isolated situation.\nA man is in custody for four of the car shootings along Interstate 10, but the DPS says other incidents in the spree could have been the work of a copycat.\nDescribing the Saturday shooting, Peoria Police Department Detective J.M. Delgado wrote in a statement: “Ernesto [Gutierrez] did not know why he was shot at. He never saw the suspect before, and he did not have any problems with anybody,”\nGutierrez told police the shooter was a white male with a shaved head who looked to be in his late 30s to early 40s, and until an anonymous person called Peoria police at 8:30 p.m. and gave the dispatcher Hoffman's name, this was all the information available.\nErnesto Gutierrez's vehicle Arizona Department of Public Safety After speeding away from the scene, Hoffman drove to his mother's house, reloaded the gun with extra ammunition, and stashed it in his former bedroom, according to police. He bragged about the shooting to his mother and stepfather, and his mother found her husband's missing gun in her son's old room.\nShe hid it in her own bedroom, police say, and turned in her son later that night.\nWhen Peoria police arrived at her house, she led them to Hoffman, who was passed out on the living room couch.\nInitially, Hoffman denied shooting Gutierrez's car but admitted he probablyhad meth on him, police say.\nAfter his arrest, officers found a clear, plastic baggie of meth in his front shirt pocket.\nLater that night, during a second interview at the Peoria police station, investigators say, he admitted to driving what turned out to be his mother's tan Chevy and to shooting his stepfather's gun.\nHoffman, who told police he started snorting meth when he was 14, was living in a halfway house for recovering drug addicts in North Phoenix.\nHe remains in the Fourth Avenue Jail on suspicion of disorderly conduct, aggravated assault, and dangerous drug possession.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/phoenixnewtimes", "http://www.twitter.com/phoenixnewtimes"], "published": "2015-10-06T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:00:13.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
