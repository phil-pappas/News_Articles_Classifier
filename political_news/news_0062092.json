He said more than 300 miles of roads will be fixed this fiscal year. City Councilman Scott Sherman's Office Potholes cover Allied Road in Allied Gardens in this undated photo. \nBut Faulconer said he won't support a potential ballot measure for 2016 that would collect more money for repairing the city's infrastructure. City Councilman Mark Kersey has floated the idea for the measure but has not yet released details on it. The San Diego Association of Governments is also considering a countywide infrastructure ballot measure. \n\"My focus is on doing the job with the money we have coming in to City Hall,\" Faulconer said. \"If you make streets and roads a priority, we're going to start to see the results.\" \nAllied Road's condition was ranked one of the worst in the city based on a 2011 assessment of all road conditions, Faulconer said. \n\"This is where our dollars should be going, to make sure that streets are smooth, to make sure you have a road you can ride your bike on, you can drive your car on, no matter where you live in the city,\" he said. \nSan Diego began a new road assessment in February . Its results were scheduled to be published this fall but now will not be released until the end of the year. \nCity Councilman Scott Sherman, who represents Allied Gardens, said the street looked like a \"war zone\" before the repaving. \n\"If you sent a pothole crew out here, it would take four or five days to go through all the way up and down the street, and that wouldn't really be fixing the problem,\" Sherman said. An earlier version of this story contained incorrect information from Councilman Scott Sherman about underground power lines on Allied Road. Sherman misspoke, and so the information has been removed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:54:35.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
