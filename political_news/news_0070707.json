Related Second case of viral meningitis... \nGun sales at Johnson's Sporting Goods in Brunswick increased after a speech by President Barack Obama concerning the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College. \nJohnson's Sporting Goods sold eight guns in less than a day, and some people bought more than one gun as they worried that their right to bear arms could be infringed upon. \n\"When the president speaks, he's playing on people's emotions,\" Jennifer Johnson said. \"When you start to play on emotions, you lose sight of making rational choices and decisions.\" \nAfter 30 years in the gun-selling business, Johnson said she's heard every argument in the book for and against tougher gun laws. She said none of it makes sense. \n\"The problem is you're creating more laws, but the laws are already in place to protect those people, but they're still happening,\" Johnson said. \n\"It's a mixture of emotions. It's sadness. Our hearts go out to the families of these victims,\" Maine Gun Safety Coalition representative William Harwood said. \nHarwood is the founder of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition. The group was formed shortly after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, when two students from the school in Colorado fatally shot 12 students and a teacher. \nHarwood said the same issue is still being debated more than 15 years later. \n\"The people are out ahead of the politicians on this issue. The polling says over and over again that people care about this issue, and they want common-sense gun legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands,\" Harwood said. \nJohnson said tougher gun laws will only make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens. \n\"You look at the accidents, you know, the drunk drivers. Do we take all the cars away? Bad things will happen, I'm sorry to say,\" Johnson said. \nJohnson said the focus should not be on gun-control legislation but with the growing number of people with mental illness, which she said seems to be behind all of the mass shootings.
