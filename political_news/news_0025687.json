But my daughter is. My 7-year-old, Willa, is plainly angry that there has never been a woman president. And she knows Hillary Clinton is running and wants her to win. For me, my doubts about Clinton's economic centrism and hawkish foreign policy notwithstanding, this is a significant check in her favor.\nBut Clinton hasn't highlighted this in the past. In her 2008 race for the presidency, Clinton downright downplayed her gender. By contrast , she's playing it up this time around. Her very first campaign speech was about feminism, and it was a theme she consistently returned to in the first Democratic debate. Partly this is Clinton and her team realizing that they didn't read the tea leaves right in 2008 — that even then, Americans were hungering for change and Barack Obama arguably played into that vis-à-vis race to run as a progressive change candidate in that election even though he was arguably as centrist as Clinton or even more so. But now, with voters across the board downright clamoring to shake up the establishment, the best arrow in Clinton's quiver in this regard is her gender. She's trying to walk a fine line, effectively arguing to voters: Yes, I'm the most experienced and best positioned to get things done, but I'm also not the establishment status quo because I'm a woman.\n Clinton also played into this during the Democratic debate last night, and it was effective — a sign that it's a strategy she should continue to embrace. When asked how she would be different than President Obama, for whom she served as secretary of state, Clinton said , \"I think being the first woman president would be quite a change from the presidents we've had up until this point, including President Obama.\" Here, Clinton who has been dogged by the fact that in a change election, she's not exactly a fresh new candidate, is smart to highlight the \"newness\" of electing a woman president. And similarly, in an election where Democratic voters and voters in general are becoming increasingly populist, Clinton is dogged by her legacy of being cozy with Wall Street and big business, and having voted for the Iraq War before later recanting. Her best strategic move to downplay her largely Democratic status quo issue stances is to highlight the radical change that her election would, at least on some level, represent. \"I can't think of anything more of an outsider than electing the first woman president,\" Clinton said in the debate.\nMore from #CosmoVotes 20 articles Bill Clinton Tweets an Adorable \"What Happens in...

But the other reason this works for Clinton is it also seems a match stylistically. Clinton has always been an outspoken feminist since her days in college all the way through her time as first lady. But as a political candidate, she's struggled to be authentic and connect with voters on a personal level. In an interview the other day with BuzzFeed's Heben Nigatu and Tracy Clayton for their \"Another Round\" podcast , Clinton rightfully pointed out the bar here is higher for women candidates. \"As a woman, you're really held to a totally different standard, and you're expected to be both strong and vulnerable at the same time,\" Clinton said. \"That's not easy to do.\" That's true — arguably there's some sexism that comes into play when Hillary, more than other candidates, is dinged for not being \"relatable\" (and I include myself in that critique). At the same, Clinton indeed often comes off as though she's trying to be the person that tested best in the polls. Just being herself, including being a raging feminist, would be refreshing for voters to see.\nAnd Hillary increasingly claiming the mantle of gender allows her to remind voters that she's fought for women's issues her entire life. One of the best moments of the Democratic debate came when Anderson Cooper asked Hillary Clinton if her plan to establish paid family leave would amount to the sort of expansion of \"big government\" about which Republicans complain. Clinton, who had already spoken of having to take care of a sick baby while trying to get to work, got heated. \"They don't mind having big government interfere with a woman's right to choose and take down Planned Parenthood,\" she said . \"They're fine with big government when it comes to that. I'm sick of it!\" It was a strong and stunning moment of pointing out flagrant Republican hypocrisy while simultaneously demonstrating her clear priorities and leadership for women's health and reproductive freedom.\nCarly Fiorina on the Republican side, who literally decries \"identity politics\" on her very own campaign website , has also increasingly played up her gender as part of her political appeal. Partly it's in response to sexist attacks from Donald Trump (\"Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that?\") and partly it's a smart sense that Republican voters see one of Fiorina's biggest assets that she could nullify Hillary's \"first woman president\" appeal. But Fiorina is also playing to the larger electoral sensibilities of American voters on both sides of the aisle clearly hungry for change, and electing a woman president would be a big change indeed. But note to Fiorina: Hillary Clinton reminds us it's not enough to have women candidates if they don't actually stand up for women and women's issues like reproductive freedom, paid family leave, and equal pay laws.\nOf course it wouldn't be enough to elect Hillary Clinton just because she's a woman. Clinton herself said as much during the debate: \"I'm not just running because I would be the first woman president. I'm running because I have a lifetime of experience in getting results and fighting for people, fighting for kids, for women, for families, fighting to even the odds. And I know what it takes to get things done. I know how to find common ground and I know how to stand my ground.\" A candidate's qualifications and vision must be at the forefront of our decision-making. But Clinton and Fiorina are right to highlight that, especially at a time when 1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted in their lifetimes, where women earn on average just 78 cents for every dollar men earn, where 20 trans women — mostly women of color — have been killed so far this year, it's also high time we have a woman president who sees women's lives and women's issues as a direct and personal priority, and can be a beacon for transforming the traditional sexism and patriarchy of America that has gotten us into such an unequal mess.\nIn 2013, well before Clinton or Fiorina or any other of the candidates even announced they were running, the women's political group EMILY's List conducted a poll to determine whether voters were really ready for a women president. Then, 86 percent of Americans said the country is ready for a woman president; nearly 75 percent thought the country would elect a woman president in 2016; and almost half of all Americans said they would be more engaged in the 2016 election if a woman candidate were running. Hillary Clinton's best strategy is to keep being that leading woman candidate — not running from that identity but toward it and being herself, a proud feminist who supports women's rights. As Clinton heralded in her opening remarks, \"Finally, fathers will be able to say to their daughters, you, too, can grow up to be president.\" Yes, and mothers like me too.\nFollow Sally on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/02/poll-voters-ready-for-a-woman-president", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444788162-berniehillary.jpg", "http://www.woar.org/resources/sexual-assault-statistics.php", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/equal-pay/career", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/04/24/hillary_clinton_s_first_campaign_speech_it_s_all_about_feminism.html", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444791243-gettyimages-492531918.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/the-oct-13-democratic-debate-who-said-what-and-what-it-means/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444838410-clintons.jpg", "http://www.advocate.com/transgender/2015/10/06/kiesha-jenkins-becomes-20th-us-trans-woman-murdered-year", "https://carlyforpresident.com/", "http://theweek.com/speedreads/583151/clinton-republicans-dont-mind-having-big-government-interfere-womans-right-choose", "https://twitter.com/sallykohn", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/320x160/landscape-1444749201-dem-debate.jpeg"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:39:21.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
