The event was more reminiscent of the upscale campaign events former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is known to host along the campaign trail, as a rock band played poolside and donors handed their car keys to valets before sampling a variety of wines and appetizers.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ While the minimum donation was $250, many of the wealthy attendees gave the maximum $2,700 donation , according to the pool report. During the event Sanders told guests his campaign has raised over $2.5 million since his debate and gave a truncated version of his normal stump speech, telling the high dollar donors that he does not \"represent the interests of the billionaire class or corporate America.\"\n  Dems' labor rule tweak would trip up 'majority' voting The legislation includes numerous pro-union changes to enhance the power of the NLRB.\nBy Sean Higgins â€¢ 10/14/15 7:07 PM During the last fundraising quarter, the Sanders campaign raised $26 million to Clinton's $28 million.
