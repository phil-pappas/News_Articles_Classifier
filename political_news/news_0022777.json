Bernie Sanders, of Vermont, left, speaks as Hillary Rodham Clinton looks on during the CNN Democratic presidential debate Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas. (John Locher / AP) Comments \nThe first Democratic presidential debate Tuesday in Las Vegas cemented former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as frontrunners for the nomination. \nThe three other candidates – former Baltimore mayor Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. James Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee – managed to help Americans put a name with a face. But none of them had a breakout moment, and Webb and Chafee actually damaged their chances with cringe-worthy answers. \nAmong the topics the candidates covered: guns, Russia, Syria, Iraq, the Clinton email scandal, Black Lives Matter, socialism, capitalism, NSA leaker Edward Snowden, Benghazi, Planned Parenthood, Wall Street regulation, immigration and their favorite enemies. CNN's Anderson Cooper moderated the debate and with aplomb. He asked sharp questions and kept the candidates on point, if not on time. \nHere's what stood out. Most replayed exchange \nIt wasn't the most revealing, but the moment you'll see again and again in news coverage and social media was when Sanders leapt to Clinton's defense on the controversy over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. \n\"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,'' Sanders boomed. \n\"Thank you, me too, me too,'' Clinton replied. \nSanders went on to chide the media for focusing on the email issue to the exclusion of what he considers to be the real issues in the campaign: the collapsing middle class, poverty, income inequality, bad trade policy and the influence of money on politics. And then this happened: — CNN (@CNN) October 14, 2015 This was the most revealing exchange \nCooper pressed Sanders on gun control – he voted against the Brady bill mandating background checks and a waiting period and opposed a bill holding gun manufacturers responsible for mass shootings. Sanders defended his record on guns – and, one by one, the other candidates raced to the left of the self-described Democratic socialist. \nClinton, asked if Sanders was \"tough enough on guns\": No, not at all. I think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence. This has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA. ...'' \nO'Malley: \"We passed comprehensive gun safety legislation, not by looking at the pollings or looking at what the polls said. We actually did it.'' \nChafee: \"I would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this. Where can we find common ground? Wayne Lapierre from the NRA, whoever it is, the leaders. Come one, we've go to change this. We're not coming to take away your guns, we believe in the Second Amendment, but let's find common ground here.\" \nWebb, however, tacked right: \"... we do need background checks. We need to keep the people who should not have guns away from them. But we have to respect the tradition in this country of people who want to defend themselves and their family from violence.'' Worst performance \nChafee, hands down. He defended his switch from Republican to independent to Democratic by describing himself as \"granite'' on the issues. So why did he crumble like chalk when Cooper asked him about his vote to repeal provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had prevented banks from engaging in risky investment activities? \nChafee gave a \"dog ate my homework'' answer, blaming his sudden ascent to the Senate after the death of his father: \nWhich was immediately ridiculed on Twitter. Lincoln Chafee, voting for things: #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/geRk0sjMec — Andy Herren (@AndyHerren) October 14, 2015 The Clinton and Sanders show \nHere's how much airtime each candidate got: How much time each candidate spoke for during the #DemDebate http://t.co/FLxjxpOj6O pic.twitter.com/fikjvwQSWX — The New York Times (@nytimes) October 14, 2015 \nWebb frequently whined to Cooper that he wasn't getting any attention. At least he didn't come in dead last. Weirdest moment \nWebb again, in response to Cooper's request that they name \"the enemy they are most proud of.\" The former Marine's answer came from a dark, dark place: On the #DemDebate stage, candidates name the enemies they are most proud of making http://t.co/Bh9YsZMq82 https://t.co/JGOYG9citK — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 14, 2015 \nWebb's full answer: \"I'd have to say the enemy soldier that threw the grenade that wounded me, but he's not around right now to talk to...'' \nHe grinned but no one laughed. And the most awkward moment of the night goes to... http://t.co/LkUrtXp27p #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/JHZDKJzoVD \nBusiness Insider has the story behind the quip. If Jim Webb had played the I-Killed-A-Guy card earlier, he might have had more success getting Anderson to give him more time. — Josh Barro (@jbarro) October 14, 2015 Random thoughts \nRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump's name came up three times, in a discussion of free college tuition. Trump live tweeted the debate, criticizing the candidates for being too rehearsed . ... CNN came in for some criticism for letting Cooper dominate the questions, with little airtime for the token woman, Hispanic and African-American correspondents . ... Vice President Joe Biden, still trying to decide if he's running for president, did not make an appearance, either in person or in a \"Draft Biden'' ad that ran earlier in the day on CNN ... Facebook partnered with CNN to put on the debate. After it was over, Facebook users asked to vote for a winner overwhelmingly picked Sanders. ... The candidates threw some elbows but maintained decorum, in contrast to the previous two debates among a gaggle of Republicans eager to make their mark. Among the wonkish Dems, there seemed to be little danger of spontaneous human combustion. Democrats make for a good debate. Republicans make for good television. #DemDebate", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:05:53.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
