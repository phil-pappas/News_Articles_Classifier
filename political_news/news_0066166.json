Doctors administered him fluids intravenously. \nJagan's mother Vijayamma, wife Bharathi and other family members and senior party leaders rushed to the hospital to meet him. \nPolice had to face resistance from scores of party activists, who had arrived here from various parts of the state. \nThe government's action in foiling Jagan's fast came under criticism from the party leaders. One of the senior leaders, Botsa Satyanarayana, said the party would hold a meeting to decide its next course of action. \nJagan had vowed to continue his fast till the central government accords special status to the state. \nThe concern was growing among the party leaders as the leader of opposition had turned weak and was barely able to speak. \nDoctors had advised Jagan to call off the fast since ketones in urine had increased alarmingly and this could have an adverse impact on the functioning of his kidneys. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:27:01.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
