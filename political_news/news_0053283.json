Associated Press Oct. 24, 2015 | 12:36 p.m. EDT + More CANTON, Ohio (AP) — A man looking to write a new chapter for his relationship turned to a newspaper's front page to pop the question.\nRobbie Paxton says it felt like the longest seven minutes of his life waiting for girlfriend Tina Troyer to notice the front-page ad he'd placed in The Repository (http://bit.ly/1H19Q8e ) on Friday.\nThe 50-year-old Canton man says he was making breakfast and wondering why Troyer wasn't saying anything after he set out the paper and her morning coffee.\nPaxton was just about to ask if she'd read the paper when she responded with a resounding \"yes!\"\nThe 49-year-old Troyer says she was thrown off guard especially because she always reads the ads inside before looking at the rest of the paper.\nIt's not clear when the paper will carry the couple's marriage announcement — they haven't set a wedding date yet.\n___\nInformation from: The Repository, http://www.cantonrep.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
