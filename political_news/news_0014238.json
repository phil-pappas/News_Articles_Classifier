The Iowan, Chuck Laudner, was particularly well regarded, having directed Rick Santorum’s winning campaign in the state in 2012.\n“I am more serious about this than I’ve ever been before,” Trump said in the article. “I made the deal with Chuck and Corey and some more we’ll be announcing soon because I’m serious and I want to focus on making America great again.” Still, the piece took a skeptical tone, noting that Trump had flirted with running without following through several times in the past.\nToday, there’s no doubt that Trump is running—he has been the clear frontrunner for three straight months, since announcing his campaign in mid-July. Yet that aura of disbelief still pervades articles about his campaign, which are invariably suffused with a sort of can-you-believe-it? incredulousness that no other candidate faces.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-is-serious-about-2016-bid-is-hiring-staff-and-delaying-tv-gig/2015/02/25/4e9d3804-bd07-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:05:52.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
