Before she was even old enough to get her driver's license, she had starred in TV shows and films, signed a record deal and released her first album. \"I had this amazing career,\" Lovato told U.S. News on Monday, \"yet I was depressed.\"\nAt age 18, Lovato \"hit a rock bottom,\" she says. Due to various mental health and emotional issues – including self-harm, eating disorders and substance abuse – she halted her tour in South America to enter rehab back in the United States, where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder .\n\"When I got diagnosed, it was a relief to know that I wasn't just being ungrateful, that it was actually me being sick,\" says Lovato, who is in the District of Columbia for the National Council's Hill Day, an annual two-day event in which behavioral health professionals and advocates meet with members of Congress to fight for better mental health care resources and treatments.\nLovato's platform, Be Vocal: Speak Up For Mental Health , encourages people living with mental health conditions to talk about their experiences and urges communities to support them. Her plea to lawmakers is to make mental health care more accessible to the public. \"I remember going to treatment and there were girls that would … be there for a week and then their insurance would stop paying,\" she says. \"That's a problem.\"\nLovato attributes her bipolar disorder in part to her genes, noting her father had bipolar schizophrenia. Her time in the spotlight has both helped and hurt her mental health, she says.\n\"Being young and entering the entertainment industry didn't really give me a chance to grow up normally – your mistakes are highly publicized,\" she says. \"But it also worked in my favor because had I not been in the public eye, I don't know if I would have held myself accountable for being in recovery.\"\nToday, Lovato, now 23, is healthy, but not without a firm commitment to her treatment regimen – something that's taken time to learn how to maintain with her jet-setting lifestyle. \"Do you wake up in the middle of the night to take your medication? Do you take your day off when you get home to go to therapy?\" she asked while lounging on a District hotel room couch and sipping hot lemon water. \"The answer is yes. …You never have a day off in recovery.\"\nLovato says her openness about her mental illness has not only helped her get the support she needs, but has also made her more successful in her career. \"I'm more aware, I'm more present, I'm able to perform better, [I'm] more honest during my performances,\" she says. \"But I wouldn't have been that way had I not spoken up.\"\nOthers should take note, Lovato adds. \"You deserve to live a happy and healthy life, and the longer you hold this in, the more you're delaying your happiness,\" she says. \"It's important that you ask for help because it's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength.\"\nHow to Find the Best Mental Health Professional for You\nHow Mental Illness is Misrepresented in the Media ​\nTAGS: mental health bipolar disorder depression eating disorders", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdxy97%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdxy97%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdxy97%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Demi%20Lovato%20Speaks%20Up%20About%20Mental%20Illness", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdxy97%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Demi%20Lovato%20Speaks%20Up%20About%20Mental%20Illness&summary=%27It%E2%80%99s%0D%0Ataken%20years%20to%20figure%20out%20how%20to%20manage%20my%20bipolar%20disorder%20while%20in%20the%0D%0Aspotlight.%27%3Cbr%20%2F%3E&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://bevocalspeakup.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdxy97%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdxy97%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Demi%20Lovato%20Speaks%20Up%20About%20Mental%20Illness"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:11:02.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
