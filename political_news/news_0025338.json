Those claims, dismissed by Israel as incitement, reflect widespread Palestinian fears fueled by the doubling of Jewish visits to the shrine since 2010.\nBacked by senior Israeli politicians, activists have become more vocal in demanding Jewish prayer rights on the mount. Some call for the site's partition and the rebuilding of the biblical Jewish Temple that once stood there.\n\"As more and more Jews are going up, it is clear that this is bringing us closer to the immediate goal of prayer (rights), and afterward, the Temple,\" said Elishama Sandman, 19, who has led Jewish tours on the mount.\nMuslim activists have also beefed up their presence in recent years, with funding and logistical support from the Islamic Movement and Palestinian factions in the West Bank.\nYoung Palestinians sporting headbands of different factions, including the militant Hamas, have clashed with Israeli police, throwing stones and firebombs from a mosque in the compound and drawing tear gas and stun grenades.\nScores of older Muslims, many bused to the shrine by the Islamic Movement, spend hours on the mount each day, some disrupting visits of Jews with curses and chants of \"God is Great.\"\nIsraelis \"got our land and now they want to get our holy places,\" said a 65-year-old Muslim man. He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from authorities after he yelled at Jewish visitors.\nFrictions have peaked during Jewish holidays, a busy time for Jewish visits. Since the Jewish New Year in mid-September, repeated clashes between Palestinians and police at the compound triggered deadly violence in other parts of Jerusalem, across Israel and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nWith religious passions unleashed, violence could rapidly escalate — as it did in 2000 after then-opposition leader Ariel Sharon visited the shrine in a demonstrative act that helped trigger the second Palestinian uprising.\n___\nWHY IS THE SHRINE SO IMPORTANT?\nThe 37-acre (15 hectare) holy site — the size of 21 soccer pitches — anchors competing religious and national identities of Jews and Muslims, Israelis and Palestinians.\nKnown to Jews as the Temple Mount, it's the holiest site in Judaism. The devout believe that God's presence is most keenly felt here and revere it as the home of the biblical Jewish Temples. Believers say Jewish religious practice is only complete once the Temple has been rebuilt.\nLeading rabbis, citing religious purity laws, have banned entry to the compound since Israel captured it in 1967, along with the rest of east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. Israel's chief rabbis reaffirmed the ban in 2013, but several leading clerics from the religious Zionist stream linked to the settler movement had already given the go-ahead to ascend.\nMost Jews continue to worship exclusively at the adjacent Western Wall, a Temple remnant.\nFor 1.6 billion Muslims, the hilltop is the third holiest site of their religion, marking the spot where the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. The enclosure houses the gold-topped Dome of the Rock and the thousand-year-old Al-Aqsa Mosque. A prayer performed here is believed to be 500 times more powerful than one in an ordinary mosque.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:03:23.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
