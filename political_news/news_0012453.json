Only when recreational and commercial gillnets are removed from the dolphins’ habitat will they be safe from extinction”. \n“The campaign is also a reminder against complacency. After the last Māui dolphin net entrapment, the Minister of Conservation of the time, Nick Smith, now Minister for the Environment, promised to increase fisheries observer coverage to 100% in the core Māui habitat over four years, to clarify and quantify dolphin deaths. At last update almost two years in, only 11%, or 54 of 475 fishing days had observer coverage.” \n“This campaign calls on the Government to honour its commitment to 100% observer coverage in core Māui habitat, and reminds the New Zealand public of their role in either saving Māui and Hector’s dolphins, or supporting their extinction.” \nThe campaign launch takes place near Onehunga Port, landing point for much of the fish caught in Māui habitat. The public are invited to attend and to bring painted dolphins. By-catch information will be released as part of graphic new campaign collateral. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:34:59.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
