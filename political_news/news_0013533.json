Chris Wattie/Reuters /Landov \nCanadian news outlets are calling it a \"Liberal wave.\" After nearly a decade in office, Stephen Harper has been ousted as Canada's prime minister, falling to the Liberal party's Justin Trudeau. Losing his bid for a fourth term, Harper will also step down as leader of the Conservative party. \nCelebrating his victory, Trudeau, 43, touted \"sunny ways\" to a boisterous crowd in Montreal, a reference to his insistence on running a positive campaign. His critics had said Trudeau wasn't experienced enough to lead Canada. Trudeau is the son of the late Pierre Trudeau, who had two stints leading Canada before retiring in 1984. \nUnder Canada's parliamentary system, the leader of the party with the most seats in the House of Commons is anointed prime minister. On Monday, the Liberal party took more than half the seats â€” 184 out of 338. \nFrom Toronto, Dan Karpenchuk reports about the parliamentary election results for NPR's Newscast unit: \n\"The Liberals captured more than four times the seats they held before parliament was dissolved, sweeping the Atlantic provinces and all the seats in Toronto. \n\"The Conservatives under Stephen Harper were crushed, winning only 99 seats. Harper conceded defeat and a statement from the party said he would be stepping down as leader. The New Democratic Party ran third with 44 seats, the separatist Bloc Quebecois took 10, and the Green party one.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:10:59.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
