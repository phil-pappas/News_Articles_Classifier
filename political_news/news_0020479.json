The Porirua Asthma Service is also providing free swimming lessons to asthmatic children from low socio-economic families.\" \nThe Porirua trial, which started in July 2013, is one of 16 social sector trials taking place in communities around New Zealand which involve agencies working together to get better results for families receiving social services. \n\"The trial shows what can be achieved by agencies and community providers working together. It’s a good example of enabling community leadership by locals who know their community and how best to target services and support,\" says Dr Coleman. \nThe trial includes a wide range of cross agency work with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Development, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Justice, Te Puni Koriri and NZ Police, as well as Porirua City Council, local iwi and other local community leaders. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:24:12.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
