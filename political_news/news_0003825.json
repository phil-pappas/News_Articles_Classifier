Peter Buckley of Ashland — co-chair of the Legislature's joint budget-writing committee — told fellow Democrats during a caucus meeting on Monday that February's coming short session would be his last. He told supporters early Wednesday. \nBuckley had served as the top House budget writer since late 2008, about when the last recession slashed billions from state revenues. Since then, he helped preside over a rebound in Oregon's fortunes — with lawmakers approving a record $7.4 billion education fund this session. \nThe 58-year-old, first elected in 2004, said he wanted to spend more time with his family. His youngest child has yet to graduate high school. Buckley, with a background in acting and writing, served as an educational theatre consultant after moving to Oregon. \n\"I've done what I've been able to in order to serve the needs of this Oregon we all love,\" he said in an email to supporters. \"I now need to better serve the needs of my family, and to look to the next challenge to face.\" \nBuckley's announcement comes after House Democrats replaced their longtime majority leader, Val Hoyle of Eugene, mulling over a run for secretary of state, with Jennifer Williamson of Portland. \nAnother top House leader, Speaker pro Tempore Tobias Read of Beaverton, is leaving to run for treasurer. His fellow budget co-chair, Sen. Richard Devlin , D-Tualatin, has also announced a run for secretary of state. \nLeaving now means Buckley will miss out on wrangling in 2017 over rising health care costs and the fallout of a court decision throwing out billions in assumed pension savings. \nBut, he also notes, it might also mean missing out on billions in new revenue — assuming, that is, labor-backed advocacy group Our Oregon manages to pass new tax increases this fall . He called the measure a \"game-changer.\" \n\"It has to happen,\" he said in his statement. \"If not, this is as good as it gets, and Oregon will swing back and forth with the economic tides. We have a choice and a chance, and I greatly look forward to casting my vote on the ballot next November.\" \n— Denis C.
