More than 500,000 people have arrived in the European Union this year, seeking sanctuary or jobs and sparking the EU's biggest refugee emergency in decades. (AP Photo/Muhammed Muheisen)\nAssociated Press Oct. 8, 2015 | 5:59 a.m. EDT + More LUXEMBOURG (AP) â€” The latest developments as hundreds of thousands of people seeking safety make an epic trek through Europe. All times local.\n___\n11:55 p.m.\nMore than any other topic, Austria's stance toward refugees is determining Sunday's race for Vienna's city hall, pitting voters who welcome them against those who fear that a surge of immigrants threatens their own well-being.\nOnly a fraction of the nearly 200,000 people who crossed into this country last month stayed, with most traveling on to Germany. Still, the Interior Ministry counted over 46,000 requests for refugee status by the end of August, compared to around 28,000 for all of 2014.\nA pro-migrant demonstration Saturday brought over 100,000 people to Vienna. But the asylum numbers and the nightly newscasts showing masses of people entering Austria have increased support for the Freedom Party, which believes immigration threatens traditional Austrian values and hurts an already shrinking job market.\nVienna would be a key prize for the Freedom Party, since the city has been governed for 60 years by the Socialists, alone or as the dominant coalition partner.\n___\n11:10 a.m.\nRomania's president says the influx of refugees could spark a resurgence of racism in Europe which he says countries have a duty to reject.\nPresident Klaus Iohannis spoke Thursday at an event to commemorate the Holocaust. Between 1940 and 1944, about 280,000 Jews and 11,000 Roma, or Gypsies, were killed during the pro-fascist regime of Romanian dictator Marshal Ion Antonescu.\nRomania was one of four eastern European countries to oppose a European Union resettlement plan for 120,000 asylum-seekers but has since modified its stance.\nIohannis reasserted that Romania could overcome \"this complicated situation\" with refugees \"and easily cope with it.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
