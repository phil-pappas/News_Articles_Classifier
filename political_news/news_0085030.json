Over the past two years IAMGOLD has reduced overall costs by approximately $175 million and improved productivity at its mines, resulting in a drop of the Company's all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\") at its gold mines by $120 per ounce since Q2 2013. The current gold price environment requires Rosebel to initiate further action and adjust the size of its employee base accordingly.\nPresident and CEO of IAMGOLD, Steve Letwin , commented, \"We are taking further steps to reduce costs and capital expenditures to continue to strengthen our financial position during a period of weak and uncertain market conditions. While we have strived to avoid impacting jobs at the operations, this is a necessary step for the long-term viability of the Rosebel mine for the mutual benefit of Suriname, the employees and our investors. On behalf of IAMGOLD and the Board of Directors, I express appreciation to all of our employees at Rosebel for their hard work and commitment in these challenging times.\"\nC AUTIONARY S TATEMENT ON F ORWARD -L OOKING I NFORMATION\nAll information included in this news release, including any information as to the Company's future financial or operating performance, and other statements that express management's expectations or estimates of future performance, other than statements of historical fact, constitute forward looking information or forward-looking statements and are based on expectations, estimates and projections as of the date of this news release.
