The source also said Prayut already had an idea who would sit on the charter-drafting panel and the reform steering council. However, the selection of the 21 charter drafters will be done first. If any proposed name is vetoed by anyone at the meeting, it will be dropped, the source said, explaining that the junta had learned its lesson from the National Reform Council. Some NRC members were deemed to have not done their jobs very well because of a lack of qualifications, so the junta would be very careful about selecting the charter drafters and members of the reform steering council this time, he said. There has been an unconfirmed report that Meechai Ruchuphan will chair the new charter-drafting committee, and other panel members could be legal professional Pakorn Nilprapan, and Ekachai Srivilas and Jira Komutpong, former NRC members. As for the reform steering council, the list of names includes military men who are being promoted this month as well as some who have retired. Other than that, some ex-NRC members would also gain seats in the new council. 201 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:53:07.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
