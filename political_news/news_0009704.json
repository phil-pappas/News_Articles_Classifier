Peter Stoop by Simon Evans Australia's wine exports have grown at their fastest rate since late 2007 as the twin forces of a falling Australian dollar and growing demand from China bring more optimism to the $4 billion wine industry.\nExport sales to China in the 12 months ended September 30 soared by 47 per cent to $313 million, making it Australia's third-largest export destination by value behind the United States and United Kingdom.\nTotal exports from the 1429 wine companies that ship product offshore increased 8 per cent to $1.96 billion, while volumes climbed by 5 per cent to 734 million litres.\nThe official figures were released on Friday by industry body Wine Australia, with chief executive Andreas Clark saying that exports had produced their strongest period of growth since export value peaked in October 2007.\nRobert Blackwell, the chief executive of large privately-owned McWilliam's Family Winemakers, says the substantial fall in the Australian dollar to around $US0.73 had been a big plus in opening doors for discussions with distributors and retailers in overseas markets.\n\"That's really moved the needle in terms of bottled wine being more competitive and it's a real plus for us and for the industry,\" Mr Blackwell says.\nThe Australian dollar has fallen more than 20 per cent in the past 15 months, and now appeared to be holding around the low US70c mark and this was important.\n\"The dollar holding at that level certainly means we're able to have more conversations with people,\" he says, referring to negotiations with distributors and retailers in offshore markets who are more enticed by the good value that Australian bottled wine represents.\n Mr Blackwell says free trade agreements with China have also helped open up the market and fuel more growth. McWilliam's is also making strong inroads in Japan with a stable that includes brands such as McWilliam's, Hanwood Estate and the Western Australian brand Evans & Tate.\nThe broader Asian region comprising China, Hong Kong, Japan and others became Australia's largest export region for the wine industry in June, 2015 and momentum has gathered pace in the past few months.\nAustralia's biggest wine company, Treasury Wine Estates, held the official global launch of its flagship Penfolds Grange and other high-end stablemates in Shanghai on Thursday, underlining the importance of Asia to the company.\nWine exporters were hurting in mid-2011 when the Australian dollar reached a record US$1.10. However the fluctuations have been large, with the currency at US48c in 2001, which helped fuel a surge in exports in the early part of that decade.\nThere are 962 Australian companies exporting wine to China but Australia's exports into that country are still at less than a third of those from France.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:59:54.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
