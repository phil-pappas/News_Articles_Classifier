By Pat Garofalo Oct. 23, 2015 | 6:00 a.m. EDT\n+ More If, as expected, the District of Columbia city council passes the Universal Paid Leave Act of 2015, America's capital city will suddenly have the nation's most generous paid family leave law, providing four paid months off for workers to care for a new child or an ill family member. The proposal has the backing of the Obama administration, which helped shepherd it into being via a Department of Labor grant.\nThat the Obama team's fingerprints are on the bill is not surprising, as paid family leave is an issue that is looming larger and larger on the Democratic side of the aisle. In last week's initial Democratic 2016 debate, every candidate who wasn't once a Republican – former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley – endorsed mandatory paid family leave, with Sanders calling the nation's current lack of such a federal policy \" an international embarrassment .\" (The U.S. stands alone in the developed world in not mandating any sort of paid family leave; globally, only Papua New Guinea joins America in requiring zero weeks of paid maternity leave.)\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the 2016 Presidential Elections ]\nDespite the fact that Republicans like to position themselves as the party of family values – and the potential next speaker of the House made spending time with his family one of his key demands before deigning to run for the position – they haven't jumped on board with paid leave, supposedly wary of another dread government mandate. \"I don't think we need more federal rules,\" said one-time 2016 front-runner Jeb Bush when he was asked about a paid leave requirement last week. Ditto Texas Sen. Ted Cruz back in September.\nBut there might be a danger here for the GOP. Polls consistently show that a large majority of voters – including a majority of Republicans – favor paid leave laws. According to a recent poll by the Roosevelt Institute, in fact, 83 percent of respondents, and 67 percent of Republicans, said that paid family and sick leave would be effective in creating a better economy. The same poll found that paid leave policy is one of the biggest drivers of potential votes – more so than other popular campaign trail items such as college affordability, the minimum wage and taxing the rich.\n\"American workers and families are just ready for it,\" says Andrea Flynn, a senior fellow at the progressive Roosevelt Institute who works on reproductive health issues. \"With the conversation about equality taking up more of the public space, more people get it. Problems faced by U.S. workers aren't faced by workers all over the world.\"\nThe reasons for the popularity of paid leave laws are pretty clear: In the modern workforce, more households include two working parents, and child care costs went through the proverbial roof a long time ago, leaving those holding a newborn without many good options. Some states – most notably California – have implemented paid leave requirements without ill effect , while the president has been beating the bully pulpit for paid leave for some time. Oh, and it turns out that paid leave policies are really good for the kids , too.\n\"The reality of family work-life for most Americans is quite difficult and although Republicans are very reluctant to introduce new government programs, which I pretty much agree with, I don't see how this one is avoidable,\" says Kay Hymowitz, a senior fellow at the conservative leaning Manhattan Institute. \"Republicans are going to have to address this is for strategic reasons; if we hear about some cities like Washington, D.C. offering four months of paid leave, the public is going to say 'yeah, give me some of that.'\"\n[ DATA: U.S. Stands Alone on Lack of Paid Leave ]\nAnd a couple of the 2016 candidates are indeed claiming they will bridge the divide between the GOP's primeval fear of new regulations and the facts of the modern family. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, for instance, is spinning a line that her economic policy will be so economy-boosting that companies will be tripping over themselves to offer leave in order to find the best workers.\nIt's Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, though, who has trotted out an actual policy proposal: a tax credit for employers who offer paid leave. \"This won't solve every scheduling conflict between work and family life. No policy can do that. But it will help ensure that our people don't have to sit behind a desk while the most profound moments of their lives pass them by,\" said Rubio in a speech at the Value Voters Summit in September.\nRubio's plan suffers from a fundamental flaw: It will toss some money at companies that already provide paid leave, rather than incentivizing companies that don't to do so. It would wind up entrenching the current inequities in leave law – that less educated, lower-wage and often minority workers are far less likely to receive it – rather than shrinking those gaps. It's a policy bank-shot, an attempt to engineer behavior through the tax code rather than just making a rule and enforcing it.\nThat said, the plan does put Rubio on record supporting an idea that is quite popular, and with an approach that still smells like something a Republican policy shop would cook up. \"His policy won't work to do what's needed in parental leave, but strategically there's a good case that what it does is get his name associated with that idea,\" says Rachel VanSickle-Ward, a professor of political studies at Pitzer College. In terms of \"threading the needle between appealing to the conservative base and getting some traction on these policies, I think it's a relatively savvy way to do it,\" she says.\nRubio is likely betting that putting conservative varnish on an idea whose time has come will give him a contrast point with Republicans and a way to blunt Democratic attacks should he make it to the general election (which, as U.S. News' Robert Schlesinger wrote, is looking more and more plausible ). He would also likely benefit from being the first to have designed a concrete proposal if his opponents eventually deduce they have to do the same (much like Sanders is claiming victory for Clinton chasing him on subjects such as trade). It's worth remembering that it wasn't too long ago that Democrats were also singing a different tune. Just last year, in fact, Clinton was of the opinion that , \"I don't think, politically, we could get [paid family leave] now.\" Look how far they've come.\n[ SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy ]\nSo where does that leave us? For Rubio, the question is whether a policy proposal that impresses few experts is enough; for the rest of the GOP field, it's whether they're letting a political moment pass them by that they'll later pay for; and for Democrats, it's whether voters actually care about all of this enough to turn out for Team D based on its full-throated embrace. \"The numbers that we're seeing are overwhelming; I guess the question is will that translate into votes,\" says Flynn.\nHymowitz, for her part, is skeptical that the issue is a political game-changer. \"People like parental leave, I believe that's true, but I don't think it's high up on the list of concerns in a presidential election, although in debates [the GOP candidates] could find themselves with an embarrassing silence,\" she says. Though the Roosevelt poll highlighted above indicates that paid leave is more likely than other things to get voters to cast their ballots a particular way, other data aren't so rosy. As NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben, a former U.S. News staffer, noted , voters like paid family leave, \"but it's not at the very top of their priority lists.\"\nAnd therein likely lies the rub. We'll see whether the GOP thinks it's safe for the family values party to stay away from valuing parents' ability to stay home with a newborn, or whether its Democrats making an error by going all-in on something that won't win them any converts or drag voters to the polls.\nThe Report Thank you, your email has been submitted.\nSubscribe to our\nNewsletter Stay informed with exclusive content sent\ndirectly to your inbox.\nTAGS: 2016 presidential election family Rubio, Marco Clinton, Hillary Republican Party Democratic Party", "external_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-first-democratic-debate-full-rush-transcript/", "http://www.americanwomen.org/research/voters-support-economic-justice-policies", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/leave_report_final.pdf", "http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/paid-family-leave-1-2011.pdf", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carly-fiorina/the-status-quo-isnt-working-for-women-in-america_b_7983718.html?1439485489", "http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123176/paul-ryan-wont-sacrifice-family-time-work-makes-others-do-it", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecdhi%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-could-become-best-place-in-us-to-have-a-baby-get-sick-or-have-parents/2015/10/05/0277c3ae-6b30-11e5-aa5b-f78a98956699_story.html", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecdhi%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=The%20Politics%20of%20Paid%20Family%20Leave%3A%20Rubio%20vs.%20the%20Democrats", "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2015/09/02/3697995/ted-cruz-family-leave/", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecdhi%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/paid-family-leave-is-no-pipe-dream/2015/10/15/bc317c46-7377-11e5-9cbb-790369643cf9_story.html", "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2015/1006/D.C.-introduces-paid-leave-Why-2016-could-finally-be-family-leave-s-election", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629600000473", "http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/09/447210270/why-paid-family-has-become-a-major-campaign-issue", "http://ftp.iza.org/dp5793.pdf", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecdhi%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=The%20Politics%20of%20Paid%20Family%20Leave%3A%20Rubio%20vs.%20the%20Democrats&summary=Can%20the%20family%20values%20party%20afford%20to%20avoid%20paid%20family%20leave%3F&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecdhi%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://marcorubio.com/news/rubio-value-voters-summit-transcript-2015/", "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/06/hillary-clinton-doesnt-think-paid-family-leave-is-possible-yet/372993/", "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/10/13/1431573/-Jeb-Bush-does-not-support-paid-family-leave-and-does-not-want-to-talk-about-it", "http://ap-gfkpoll.com/featured/findings-from-our-latest-poll-15", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecdhi%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=The%20Politics%20of%20Paid%20Family%20Leave%3A%20Rubio%20vs.%20the%20Democrats"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:53:01.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
