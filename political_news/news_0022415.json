You supported the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. You honeymooned in the Soviet Union. And just this weekend, you said you're not a capitalist. Doesn't that ad write itself?\"\nMany voters tune into debates because they are tired of 30-second attack ads.\nCooper then picked out the most obvious political weaknesses in Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, and after attempting to bloody each, he said he'd move on to \"some of the most pressing issues facing the country.\" What a relief. But rather than refereeing a debate, Cooper and his CNN colleagues posed most questions in the form of a jab -- and an invitation for others to pile on.\nTo Clinton: Is Bernie Sanders tough enough on guns? O'Malley: Is Clinton too quick to use force? Webb: Should a conscientious objector like Sanders serve as commander-in-chief? And so it continued.\nWhen Anna from Tempe asked, \"What will you do to address climate change?\" CNN's Don Lemon added: \"Gov. O'Malley, please tell Anna how you would protect the environment better than all the other candidates on that stage.\"\nAnna's question should have stood on its own, and all the candidates should have had the chance to answer it. Instead, after O'Malley responded, Cooper asked Webb for the second time if he was \"out of step\" with the party, given his support for fossil fuels. And he asked Sanders, \"are you tougher on climate change than Sen. Clinton?\"\nInstead of allowing such disagreements to arise naturally, CNN forced them down the candidates' -- and viewers' -- throats. This was moderator-as-matador, with the performance aided by rules designed to encourage the bulls to charge. Any time someone mentioned a rival, that candidate got a chance to respond. That would be a fair rule if the moderators tried to maintain equal time, but they didn't. During the discussion of income inequality, Webb could be heard saying off camera: \"Bernie, say my name so I can get into this.\" It was hard not to feel for him.\nCNN wanted a bullfight. But for the most part, the candidates were more interested in discussing their own ideas than trashing their rivals, and rightly so. This was the first debate of the campaign, the first chance for the candidates to explain their platforms to a national audience. Yet the moderators had little patience for that, and when they weren't inviting criticism, they were leveling it themselves.\nTo Sanders, Cooper delivered a political punch with a commercial plug: \"Why did it take 18 inspector general reports -- and a CNN investigation, and others -- before you and your colleagues took action\" on problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs?\nTo Clinton, he asked: \"In all candor, you and your husband are part of the 1 percent. How can you credibly represent the views of the middle class?\" Doubling down: \"Why should Democrats embrace an insider like yourself?\"\nThat's not to say there were no good questions.\nEach candidate was asked, \"What is the greatest national security threat to the country?\" (Cooper urged them to answer that one \"very quickly.\") And Carrie from Manassas, Va., asked: \"President Obama has had a difficult time getting Republicans to compromise on just about every agenda. How will you approach this going forward, and will it be any different?\" Great question. Unfortunately, only Sanders was asked to answer it.\nThe debate covered some important issues, and the candidates mostly acquitted themselves well, exhibiting a basic decorum that the moderators lacked. But it would have been far more informative had the conflict had been less contrived.\nAbout The Writer\nFrancis Barry is a Bloomberg View columnist.
