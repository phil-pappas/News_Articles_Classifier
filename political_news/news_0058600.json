The delay to Chilcot report is a scandal.\"\nMr Blair's office denied the interview was an attempt to set out his version of events before facing probable criticism.\nMr Blair's spokesman said: \"Tony Blair has always apologised for the intelligence being wrong and for mistakes in planning. He has always also said and says again here that he does not however think it was wrong to remove Saddam.\n\"He did not say the decision to remove Saddam in 2003 'caused Isis' and pointed out that Isis was barely heard of at the end of 2008, when al Qaeda was basically beaten.\n\"He went on to say in 2009, Iraq was relatively more stable. What then happened was a combination of two things: there was a sectarian policy pursued by the government of Iraq, which were mistaken policies.\n\"But also when the Arab Spring began, Isis moved from Iraq into Syria, built themselves from Syria and then came back into Iraq. All of this he has said before.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NicolaSturgeon/status/658036435572903937?lang=en-gb", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17B1B/production/_86315079_86315078.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:31:26.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
