The awards recognize programs and projects that exemplify best practices and innovation and create efficiency and effectiveness in state government.\n\"We are honored to once again to see Pennsylvania recognized on a national stage for leadership and innovation in human resources management,\" said Secretary of Administration Sharon Minnich . \"Through this program, we can help state agencies manage the changes that result from a generational transfer of leadership and provide employees with the skills they need to be successful in the workplace.\"\nThe Office of Administration created the CMP to reduce the loss of institutional knowledge and skills as experienced employees retire or transition to other employers. Currently, 16 percent of state employees are eligible to retire and that figure will grow to over 30 percent over the next five years. The program also supports workforce and succession planning by contributing to the professional growth of existing employees.\nThe CMP pairs mid-level management employees with senior managers to receive ongoing coaching and development. The pairs work together to create an individual development plan for the mentee and document a core business process within their agencies. The mentoring relationship is supported by monthly meetings focused on knowledge management, networking and other skills.\n\"This program is helping state agencies to meet Governor Wolf's priority of government that works by ensuring we have employees with the knowledge and skills necessary to fulfill our missions and provide the services that Pennsylvanians depend on,\" said Minnich.\nThe CMP launched in October 2014 with 32 mentor/mentee pairings from 18 state agencies, who graduated in June of this year. The program is offered at no cost.\nTo learn more about the awards, visit http://www.nasca.org\nMedia contact: Dan Egan (OA), 717-772-4237\n releases/pennsylvania-earns-national-award-for-employee-mentoring-program-300158732.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nasca.org/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC26696&Transmission_Id=201510131045PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC26696&DateId=20151013", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-earns-national-award-for-employee-mentoring-program-300158732.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:40:10.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
