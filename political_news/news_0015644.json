I respect their freedom of expression. They should also respect others' freedom of expression,\" Kulkarni said at a press conference in Mumbai.\nEarlier in the day, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Shivsena is intensely nationalist and opposed the programme due to this attitude. Raut said, \"Cops like Tukaram Ombale who laid down their lives fighting against Pakistan in Mumbai. Such police force was used by chief minister to protect Pakistan, insulting the martyrs.\"\nAlso read: Sena calls Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis pro-Pakistan\n\"If fighting against Pakistan is a crime, then Shivsena has committed that crime.\"\nAccusing Sudheendra Kulkarni of being a \"Pakistani agent\", Sena leader Raut had said that blackening of Kulkarni s face was a mild protest.\"\nFadnavis had disapproved Shiv Sena's protests saying the issue has brought disrepute to the state. He said, \"We may not agree with views of somebody, but when a foreign dignitary or a diplomat arrives on a valid visa and holds a programme, which is not illegal, it's the duty of a state to provide protection.\"\nShiv Sena has also decided to go it alone in the forthcoming Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation election and not have any tie-up with the BJP. The decision was taken last night at a meeting of senior Sena leaders here, a Sena leader said.\nAlso read: Shiv Sena set to pull out of saffron alliance in Maharashtra?", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "http://dnai.in/cWuc", "http://dnai.in/cWuC"], "published": "2015-10-13T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:14:09.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
