Scott Walker says he'll sign legislation banning so-called John Doe investigations into potential political corruption, a measure that passed the Legislature this week. Related Content Assembly passes campaign finance overhaul bill \nSpeaking at a groundbreaking in Milwaukee Thursday afternoon, the Republican governor said he looks forward to approving the bill. He says it's just a matter of how quickly it gets to his desk, whether that's \"in the next day or two or early next week.\" \nRepublicans have been united in their support for the plan. They say prosecutors can use other tools, such as grand juries, to uncover political wrongdoing. \nDemocrats, meanwhile, voted together in opposition, saying a block on the secretive fact-finding probes would lead to more undetected corruption. \nWalker was investigated by two John Doe probes but was never charged. \nCopyright 2015 The  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:34:34.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
