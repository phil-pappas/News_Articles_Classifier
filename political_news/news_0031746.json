Mayberry wants voters to approve a proposed recreation center, saying it will lend a sense of community that Tigard current lacks. (Dana Tims/Staff) \"No matter which side people are on, this is a big deal for us,\" said Marty Wine, Tigard's city manager. \nIn Darbie Mayberry's view, Tigard's upcoming vote on a new community recreation center should be a slam-dunk. \n\"This will benefit every single person in this city,\" said Mayberry, whose family has owned and operated Tigard Cleaners in downtown Tigard since 1960. \"The community needs it.\" \nIf approved, Measure 34-241 would authorize the city to issue up to $34.5 million in general obligation bonds \"for a community and recreation center,\" according to the ballot title. It adds, \"The City expects the community and recreation center to be operated by a non-profit organization, such as the YMCA.\" \nNowhere, however, is the YMCA designated as the official operator of a future city-owned facility. Nor is the building's physical location specified. Neither of those points will be decided until after the city, at some future date, solicits bids from possible operators and goes through an extensive site-selection process. \nAnyone reading recent mailers distributed by pro-measure supporters might not realize that. \"The YMCA will build community in Tigard,\" one headline reads. \"YMCA-Tigard partnership will benefit everyone,\" according to another. \nThe measure's critics have seized on those assertions, calling them misleading and disingenuous. \n\"Not even an ounce of what those mailers are describing is true,\" said John Goodhouse, the Tigard City Council member who cast the lone vote against referring the measure to the ballot. \"We have absolutely no specifics at this point, other than that a 'yes' vote would authorize the city to issue bonds.\" \nGoodhouse said he supports the idea of the city building a community recreation center. \"But this is just not the way to go about it,\" he said. \nCouncilor Marc Woodard, a leading proponent of the measure, disagreed. The city long has had plans to build some sort of community center, he said, and now is as good a time as any to measure public support by putting it up for a vote. \n\"The folks opposing this want to keep Tigard a bedroom community where the status quo doesn't change,\" Woodard said. \"I don't think our community can compete with all these surrounding cities without exactly these sort of well-rounded services.\" \nThe back-and-forth has remained nothing if not spirited. \nVince Arditi, an area resident with an extensive background in recreation-center management, has filed an elections complaint with the Oregon Secretary of State's office. He is alleging that measure proponents earlier in the campaign failed to meet reporting deadlines for contributions. While the contributions are now a matter of record, Arditi's complaint is not expected to be resolved until after the election. \n\"This is what it looks like when someone tries to buy an election,\" Arditi said, noting that the Friends of the Downtown Tigard YMCA has contributed more than $40,000 to the 'yes' campaign. \"That's the bottom line.\" \nAll but $4,000 of the 'yes' contributions have come from YMCA of Columbia-Willamette , which operates a city-owned recreation facility in Sherwood and hopes to fill the same role in Tigard, according to the organization. \n\"When we come to Tigard, we will be offering classes and services of interest and value to everyone in your city,\" the organization's executive director, Bob Hall, wrote in a Voters' Pamphlet statement. \nLongtime Tigard real estate broker Neal Brown is chairman of the Friends of the Downtown Tigard YMCA. He declined to comment on Arditi's allegations. \n\"What I can say is that a community needs three things to be successful â€“ a place to live, a place to work and a place to meet and recreate,\" Brown said. \"This is what we're trying to do for Tigard.\" \nThe measure, if approved, is expected to result in a tax of 51 cents per $1,000 of assessed value per year. That would translate to about $122 per year on a house assessed at $240,000. \n\"No matter which side people are on, this is a big deal for us,\" said Marty Wine, Tigard's city manager. \"But it's important to note that if it passes, the work of figuring out specifics will be just beginning.\" \nFor measure supporters such as Mayberry, that can't come soon enough. \n\"Until now, there's been nothing that our children and our community can do together,\" she said. \"This holds that hope.\" \n-- Dana Tims", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:06:26.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
