Anyway, inch by inch.... Quote: Americas Top Cops Just Called the War on Drugs 'A Tremendous Failure' The top cops in America's four biggest cities said on Wednesday that the war on drugs has failed to keep America safe and that it's time to reform the country's criminal justice system, a view now officially shared by more than 125 other prosecutors, sheriffs, attorneys general, and law enforcement leaders from across the US. The police chiefs of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston appeared together in Washington, DC to explain a new initiative called Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration ahead of a meeting with President Barack Obama on Thursday afternoon. The chiefs and other law enforcement officials said their goals include reducing incarceration and protecting public safety. We share a common problem,\" said co-founder Ronald Serpas, a former New Orleans police superintendent. \"The way our country is currently approaching criminal justice is not ensuring public safety but is making our jobs more difficult. Arresting low level offenders prevents us from arresting high level offenders.\".... What's really important here is the people on this list can actually do something about these problems,\" Elderbroom said. \"Many of the signatories are sitting chiefs and prosecutors in a position to enact change. Police and prosecutors have really wide discretion on who to arrest, charge, and convict, so these changes can have a really big impact without any change to state or federal law.\" We've handed prosecutors an inordinate amount of power,\" Elderbroom said. \"So to see a list that includes not just prosecutors but sitting US Attorneys and District Attorneys is really exciting and has the potential to have a big impact.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:25:23.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
