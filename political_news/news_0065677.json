In such a scenario, third-party mediation was a must and if India does not accept a third party role, then there is a stalemate,” Sharif told the media after his with US President Barack Obama . “This stalemate needs to be addressed,” the Prime Minister said in response to a question. \nSpeaking in chaste Urdu, Sharif said he raised the Kashmir issue in all his meetings with Obama. “It (K-issue) also figured in the joint statement,” Sharif said, adding all of them have recognised Kashmir was a critical point and needs to be resolved. Sharif said he briefed Obama on the K-issue. \n“Unfortunately, Pakistan has not received the response it needed from India on its peace initiative,” he said, adding that the US President during the meeting agreed that Kashmir issue needs to be resolved. \nWhile India has dismissed third-party mediation on K-issue and maintains that all outstanding matters in the Indo-Pak ties should be resolved bilaterally. In response to a question on the Indo-Pak relationship, he recalled his visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the meeting, he said, he offered Modi to revive the peace process from where he and former premier Atal Bihari Vajpayee left in 1999. \nSharif said he urged Modi that the duo must talk and resolve the issues between the two countries. “He agreed for talks and then cancelled the foreign secretary-level talks,” said the Pakistan PM. \n“Had Modi spoken to me, things would have been different. But he took such a decision without consulting me,” said Sharif. He said a set of three dossiers on alleged Indian activities in Pakistan were handed over to the Secretary of State John Kerry yesterday. \nHe said that firing on the Line of Control (LoC) was discussed during his talks with US leaders, alleging ceasefire has been “violated” not only on the LoC, but also on the actual boundary. \nPakistan, he said, wants to improve ties with its neighbours. Sharif said his government was committed to take action against terrorists. “It’s our responsibility. This is also part of your National Action Plan,” he added. “We know what is in our interest,” he said when asked if he would fulfil his commitment to take action against LeT. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:21:36.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
