Mark Dayton and other local leaders to discuss the effects of the Ebola epidemic on the African nation and the ongoing recovery.\nVice President Joseph Boakai arrived in the Twin Cities Wednesday for a series of meetings and charity events.\n“He is in the Twin Cities to meet with Liberians, provide an update on Ebola and extend the government’s gratitude to Liberians here and its international partners,” said Joe Mason, a volunteer who is helping coordinate media during Boakai’s visit.\nThe Twin Cities is believed to be home to the largest concentration of Liberians outside Africa.\nAt the height of the epidemic, Minnesota’s Liberian and West African communities, primarily clustered in the north suburbs, hosted fundraisers, supply drives and town hall meetings. Many here watched helplessly as family and friends succumbed to the highly lethal virus as it spread through Liberia’s densely populated capital city of Monrovia.\nOn Thursday, Boakai met with Twin Cities medical staff and spoke of the challenges faced by the Liberian health care system. He toured North Memorial Medical Center in Robbinsdale, which will donate a second ambulance to Liberia.\nThe city of Brooklyn Center also will donate a fire truck, said Mayor Tim Willson.\nBoakai will speak at a town-hall meeting Friday at the Brooklyn Park Community Activity Center, Mason said.\nDayton will host Boakai at the governor’s residence on Monday.\nThe Ebola outbreak centered in western Africa has been the largest in history with 28,540 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases and 11,313 deaths worldwide, according the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were the hardest-hit countries.\nOn Sept. 3, the World Health Organization declared Liberia free of Ebola virus transmission. In Sierra Leone, the last known patient was confirmed free of Ebola on Sept. 25. Guinea is still reporting a handful of new cases.\nThe virus, first discovered in 1976 in the now Democratic Republic of the Congo, is spread through bodily fluids. Those infected suffer fever, vomiting, diarrhea and hemorrhaging.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:49:20.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
