Bush in 1980 all losing the nomination. By contrast, of the nine contested Democratic nominations during this period, the Iowa winner has generally gone on to win the nomination, with the exception of Iowa senator Tom Harkin in 1992, Dick Gephardt in 1988 and Ed Muskie in 1972.“ \nDinan teaches courses on campaigns and elections, voter behavior, and state politics. He frequently provides commentary for news outlets across the country and is the author of “The American State Constitutional Tradition” and numerous articles on state and federal politics. \nAbout Wake Forest University : Wake Forest University combines the best traditions of a small liberal arts college with the resources of a large research university.
