It is Greater Accra. The region is now the most populous region in the country. \n\"Right from Kwame Nkrumah's time until now they say you have to win Greater Accra to win Ghana. We have to win Greater Accra to win Ghana in 2016. \n\"In 2000 we did it and we can repeat it in 2016. If we are going to win Greater Accra we have to have a language that appeals to everybody. Good positive language. \n\"We do not have a tribal agenda. We have a Ghanaian agenda. That is what is going to take us to power,\" he said to a rousing applause from a number of the supporters who attended the rally. \nThe tour took him to the Volta, Eastern and the Upper Regions of the country where he met regional and constituency executives as well as some supporters of the party.
