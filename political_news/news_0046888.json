Dan Burton (shown here at a 2011 committee hearing), who retired from Congress in 2013, was paid to \"maintain or increase protection for the public with reference to psychiatric treatments including drugs and brain devices,\" in a bill Congress is considering to speed the development of drugs. (Photo: Mark Wilson / Getty Images 2011 file photo) \nA group co-founded by the Church of Scientology has sought former Rep. Dan Burton's help in lobbying Congress about certain psychiatric treatments. \nThe Citizens Commission on Human Rights paid Burton $20,000 in the past three months, according to lobbying disclosure reports. \nBurton, who retired from Congress in 2013, was paid to \"maintain or increase protection for the public with reference to psychiatric treatments including drugs and brain devices,\" in a bill Congress is considering to speed the development of drugs. \nThe Citizens Commission on Human Rights calls itself a \"mental health watchdog\" dedicated to \"providing information that a multibillion-dollar psycho/pharmaceutical industry does not want people to see or to know.\" \nBurton was often critical of the pharmaceutical industry when he served in Congress. \n\"I've gone to a number of these lectures that are put on by pharmaceutical companies,\" Burton said at a hearing he convened in 2002 on the \"over-medication of hyperactive children.\" \n\"They're very nice dinners they put on and very expensive in many cases, have great wines and all those sorts of things — they do have doctors that come in and talk about the attributes and the positives about these drugs,\" he said. \"So they are very effective in selling their products to the doctors and the doctors writing those prescriptions.\" \nBurton invited Lisa-Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley and a spokeswoman for the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, to testify at that hearing. She argued that Congress should prevent schools from “coercing parents into placing their children on to mind-altering drugs.” House Government Reform Committee Hearing \nActress Diane Ladd testified at another hearing Burton held in support of alternative medicines. \nBurton also tried to show, contrary to the findings of medical experts, that a vaccine preservative caused children to develop autism. \nWhen the Church of Scientology opened a National Affairs Office in Washington in 2012, Burton was among the lawmakers at the opening ceremony, according to the organization's website. \nEmail Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.
