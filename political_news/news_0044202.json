(AP) â€” The latest on the fatal beating of a 19-year-old and serious injury of his brother inside a church (all times local):\n___\n3:20 p.m.\nThe lawyer for a woman accused of assaulting her half brother during a deadly central New York church beating says she's a \"sweet\" stay-at-home mom who \"cares deeply about her kids.\"\nThomas O'Brien III is defending Sarah Ferguson against a charge she took part in the attack at the insular Word of Life Church that seriously injured 17-year-old Christopher Leonard and killed 19-year-old Lucas Leonard last week.\nHe declined to say anything about the case, Ferguson's relationship with her brother or what she says happened.\nChristopher Leonard testified at a hearing Wednesday that Ferguson, his parents and three other congregants punched him and whipped him with an electrical cord.\nBruce and Deborah Leonard have been charged with manslaughter in the death of Lucas. All the defendants have pleaded not guilty.\n___\n3 p.m.\nA prosecutor says a lot was asked of the teenager who took the witness stand against his half sister in a deadly central New York church beating case.\nSeventeen-year-old Christopher Leonard testified Wednesday about the encounter last week at the Word of Life Christian Church in New Hartford. He said his sister, Sarah Ferguson, joined his parents and three other congregants in punching and whipping him with an electrical cord.\nHis 19-year-old brother Lucas Leonard died after the attack, which Christopher said started because they \"didn't want to answer\" questions during a meeting. He was not asked the nature of the questions.\nOneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara says he \"can't imagine the stress\" the teen was under when he took the stand.\nFerguson and the parents, Bruce and Deborah Leonard, have pleaded not guilty along with three others.\n___\n2:40 p.m.\nA judge has ruled that prosecutors presented enough evidence to warrant grand jury action against the half sister of two brothers beaten, one fatally, at a central New York church.\nNew Hartford Town Justice William Virkler ruled after hearing testimony Wednesday from 17-year-old Christopher Leonard about the attack this month that left him injured and his 19-year-old brother Lucas dead.\nTheir half sister, Sarah Ferguson, is charged with assault and will continue to be held on $50,000 bail.\nThe Leonards' parents, Bruce and Deborah Leonard, face the most serious charge so far, manslaughter. Three other congregants of the Word of Life Church are also charged with assault.

He hasn't ruled out charges against others.\n___\n2 p.m.\nA teenager says a beating in an upstate New York church that seriously injured him and killed his brother began because they \"didn't want to answer\" questions during a meeting.\nSeventeen-year-old Christopher Leonard testified at a court hearing Wednesday about the encounter last week at the Word of Life Christian Church in New Hartford.\nChristopher said his parents, his sister and three other congregants punched him and whipped him with an electrical cord. He said he was eventually taken to another room and left sitting in a corner with earplugs and earmuffs, so he couldn't hear conversation around him.\nHe says he later was brought back into the church sanctuary and saw his 19-year-old brother, Lucas, lying on the ground and not breathing.\nAll six suspects have pleaded not guilty.\n___\n1:30 p.m.\nA teenager who authorities say was severely beaten by relatives in an upstate New York church has steadfastly avoided looking at his sister as he walked into court to testify against her.\nSeventeen-year-old Christopher Leonard came to court in New Hartford for a hearing Wednesday in the assault case against Sarah Ferguson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:38:54.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
