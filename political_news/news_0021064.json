(AP) - Two New Hampshire properties at the center of armed standoff with federal agents, including a compound that featured escape routes and once was believed to be booby-trapped, have sold at auction.\nBusinessman James Hollander of Plainfield bought both properties belonging to convicted tax evaders Ed and Elaine Brown during a federal auction Thursday. He paid $250,000 for the 100-acre compound and $415,000 for Elaine Brown's dental office.\nThe Browns became anti-government celebrities in 2007 when they held federal agents at bay for nine months after they were convicted of tax evasion.\nAn auction last year drew no bidders. Federal authorities said they couldn't guarantee the property surrounding the compound was free from explosives or other booby traps.\nThe proceeds will go to pay back taxes owed to the municipalities.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:56:09.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
