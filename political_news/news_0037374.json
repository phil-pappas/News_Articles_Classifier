Lindsey Graham questioned Monday how it’s possible that real estate mogul Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson are beating him in the Republican presidential race. \n“On our side, you’ve got the No. 2 guy tried to kill someone at 14, and the No. 1 guy is high energy and crazy as hell. How am I losing to these people?” Mr. Graham said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” \nThe Republican presidential candidate was referring to when Mr. Carson, who is trailing Mr. Trump at No. 2 in most polls, said publicly that he tried to stab one of his high school classmates when he was 14. \n“And I’ve tried to murder no one ever, so this should move me up a little bit,” Mr. Graham joked. “Well, the day’s not over, but as of right now, nobody.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:30:22.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
