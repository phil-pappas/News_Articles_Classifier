Inspired by this year's theme, Evolution of the Cat Revolution, supporters are committing to make their own evolution in working toward animal control and sheltering practices that protect the lives of all cats.\n\"Our incredible success in promoting Trap-Neuter-Return for feral cats as a mainstream practice has saved countless lives, but there's more to be done,\" said Becky Robinson , president and founder of Alley Cat Allies, the advocacy organization that established National Feral Cat Day. \"We encourage cat advocates to continue with their own local evolution by taking the next step. It could be neutering a cat, speaking at a community meeting or spearheading a campaign for a local Trap-Neuter-Return ordinance. There's always room to grow.\"\nMore than 1,500 events have taken place on this day since 2011. Volunteers are organizing spay/neuter clinics, arranging educational sessions, encouraging official governmental proclamations, and raising funds to support local Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) programs.\nHundreds of these local, volunteer-driven events are listed on nationalferalcatday.org , which also has ideas that people can use to celebrate in their own communities.\nAlley Cat Allies, the nation's only national advocacy organization dedicated to the protection and humane treatment of cats, established National Feral Cat Day as a call to action to raise awareness about feral (or community) cats, promote Trap-Neuter-Return, and empower and mobilize the millions of compassionate Americans who care for them.\nCommunity cats are the same species as pet cats, but they live outdoors and are unowned and not socialized to people. Through Trap-Neuter-Return, community cats are humanely trapped and brought to a veterinarian to be evaluated, spayed or neutered, and vaccinated. While under anesthesia, the cats are eartipped – a small portion of the left ear is painlessly removed for identification. After they recover from the sterilization surgery, they are returned to their outdoor home.\nTrap-Neuter-Return is the only effective method of stabilizing cat colony populations. In the last decade, the number of local governments with official policies endorsing TNR has increased tenfold, with hundreds of cities and towns successfully carrying out TNR programs.\nFollow all the activities for National Feral Cat Day on social media with the #feralcatday hashtag.\nAbout Alley Cat Allies\nAlley Cat Allies, headquartered in Bethesda, Md. , is the only national advocacy organization dedicated to the protection and humane treatment of cats.
