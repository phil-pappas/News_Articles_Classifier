The couple moved to Indianapolis, where Fairbanks made a fortune as a railroad lawyer before entering politics as a protégé of Ohio Gov. William McKinley. With McKinley in the White House and Fairbanks in the Senate, the president appointed him to a joint high commission with Canada to settle Alaska’s border. Although the commission proved unable to strike a deal, Fairbanks buttressed his popularity by declaring: “I am opposed to the yielding of an inch of United States territory.” Alaskans showed their appreciation by naming what is now the state’s second-largest city in his honor.\nIn 1900, Sen. Mark Hanna (R-Ohio) maneuvered to make Fairbanks the vice presidential nominee, blocking New York Gov. Theodore Roosevelt. But Fairbanks, with his eye on the main prize, shunned Hanna’s offer.\nFairbanks’ political fortunes changed with McKinley’s assassination in 1901. Roosevelt accepted Fairbanks as his running mate in 1904 because he did not consider the office worth a fight, while Fairbanks hoped it would ultimately lead to the presidency. For the final two years of the administration, they largely worked at cross purposes: Roosevelt thwarted Fairbanks’ bid for the 1908 presidential nomination while Fairbanks helped to stifle Roosevelt's legislation in the Senate.\nMeantime, Cornelia had become one of Washington’s most popular hostesses. She remained active as president-general of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The Fairbanks’ home, near Dupont Circle, stood out on the capital’s social landscape.\nIn 1916, the Republicans, seeking to deny Democrat Woodrow Wilson a second term, nominated Charles Evans Hughes. Fairbanks wired the Indiana delegation: “My name must not be considered for vice president and if it is presented, I wish it withdrawn.” Nevertheless, he wound up joining what would be a losing ticket.\nSOURCE: SENATE.GOV\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:03:57.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
