(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) By KEN THOMAS The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling Vice President Joe Biden a \"good man\" following the vice president's announcement that he will not seek the White House. \nClinton says in a statement that Biden has a strong economic record and continues to fight for higher wages, safer communities and a more peaceful world. She says \"it's a record to be proud of, defend, and build on.\" \nShe says she's confident that \"history isn't finished with Joe Biden .\" The decision leaves Clinton and Bernie Sanders as the major Democratic candidates. \nA third Democrat, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, calls Biden a \"very good and decent man\" and says the vice president's experience would have been a \"welcome addition\" to the presidential race.
