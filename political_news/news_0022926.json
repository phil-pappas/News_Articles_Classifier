While I had publically put my support behind Rep. Dan Webster (R-FL), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was the presumptive frontrunner. However, on Thursday he withdrew his name from consideration and acknowledged that the GOP Conference needed a new direction. \nI believe that we need to change the way Congress does business. The American people have been dissatisfied with the congressional leadership and this election for Speaker gives us a chance to demonstrate that we are listening to their concerns. My hope is that members of Congress will recognize the need for significant reforms and will elect a Speaker committed to changing Washington so that Congress places the interests of American taxpayers before inside-the-Beltway interests. \nDeSantis does leave some wiggle room to change his mind. The new favorite is Wisconsin Congressman and former Vice-Presidential candidate Paul Ryan , who is weighing a potential run. Earlier this year, Constituents asked DeSantis not to support Boehner for reelection, the first time Webster ran, but he sided with the incumbent, which resulted in hundreds of complaint on social media. \nDeSantis’ primary opponent and fellow Congressman David Jolly has been one of Webster’s most vocal supporters since McCarthy dropped out, penning this letter earlier this morning. The two join other Central Florida Congressman supporting Webster including, Bill Posey, Ted Yoho, and Rich Nugent.
