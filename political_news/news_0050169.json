He also states his belief that Chelsea Clinton is not Bill’s daughter. He says she is a product of an affair between Hillary and former Clinton lawyer Webster Hubbell.\nStone claims Hillary was in a panic over his new book. Even though his book is a top-rated political history seller on Amazon last week it was flooded with one-star reviews. Stone blamed the one-star reviews on Hillary and evidence seemingly suggests he is right. He told the New York Post :\nMy publisher [Skyhorse] confirmed with Amazon — they are all from the same URL, at Hillary’s HQ in Brooklyn. Why are they so afraid of this book?\nHere are some of the reviews:\nPolitico also released a story quoting Clinton’s press secretary Brian Fallon as saying:\nWhen this Roger Stone book comes out — we’ll obtain the book. Our research team will be able to go through it . . . There will be a war room set up to deal with that.\nAmazon has since removed the one-star reviews and they are suing more than 1,000 people it claims are posting fake reviews and selling them starting at $5. It has been estimated 15 percent of online reviews are false.\nThe heat from Clinton is seemingly effecting Stone’s interviews as well. An appearance on MSNBC was canceled on Monday afternoon at the last minute. Stone stated the network was under pressure from the Clinton’s. His appearance with Larry Wilmore on the Comedy Channel was cancelled as well.\nStone said:\nI’m obviously getting under their skin.", "external_links": ["http://shark-tank.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/reviews-300x300.jpg", "http://pagesix.com/2015/10/19/author-hillary-flooded-amazon-with-negative-reviews-of-my-book/", "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/florida/2015/09/8577017/private-call-clinton-fundraisers-fret-over-email-fiasco-and-new-beng", "http://shark-tank.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/reviews.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:49:57.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
