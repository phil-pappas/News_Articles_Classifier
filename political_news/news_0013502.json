He would be incredible for women in this country,\" Ivanka Trump told CNN's Poppy Harlow when asked in an interview what he would do for women as president. \nTrump faced tough questioning from Fox News' Megyn Kelly during an August GOP presidential debate, when she pressed Trump about misogynistic, sexist comments he made in the past, such as calling some women \"fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.\" \nTrump slammed Kelly afterwards, saying her questions were \"ridiculous\" and \"off-base\" during an interview with CNN's Don Lemon. \n\"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes,\" Trump told Lemon. \"Blood coming out of her wherever.\" \nThe presidential candidate has pledged to share more with the public his daughter, a former model and now an executive at Trump's real estate empire, on the campaign trail as he looks to broaden his appeal to women voters. But she said in the interview that people shouldn't expect her to talk about his platform. \n\"I'll leave policy to him,\" she said. \nBut she told Harlow that she will certainly share tales of what it was like to be parented by Donald Trump. \n\"He's loving and supportive. He's pushed me, he's corrected me, he's disciplined me,\" she said. \"And I think as a parent now myself, I appreciate how hard that is, more than ever before.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:21:52.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
