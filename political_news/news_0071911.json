This relationship is based upon shared trust, owner education and steady communication for the animal's best health outcome.\nZachary M. Wright , DVM, DACVIM (Oncology) of Animal Diagnostic Clinic in Dallas, TX , explains, \"We are all familiar with the human healthcare best practice of combining the expertise of general medical practitioners with board-certified medical specialists, whether in surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurology or internal medicine.
