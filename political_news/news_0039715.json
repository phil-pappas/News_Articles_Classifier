By Lisa Esposito Oct. 20, 2015 | 1:44 p.m. EDT + More When rankings are as closely regarded and widely anticipated as the U.S. News & World Report health care quality ratings, consumers and organizations want to understand the methodology behind them. On Tuesday, a U.S. News panel of editors and analysts at the 2015 U.S. News Hospital of Tomorrow Conference discussed the process.\nPanelists for \"Rankings and Ratings: An Update on U.S. News's Hospital Quality Reporting,\" described recent methodologic changes to the public reporting program, explained how the methodologies are likely to further evolve, and reflected on the first year of U.S. News reporting on common procedures and conditions.\nMajor takeaways from the conference session include:\nThe U.S. News health rankings team plans to expand Best Hospitals for Common Care in 2016 and beyond. Among other changes, rankings will include new cohorts: aortic valve replacement, abdominal aortic aneurysm, lobectomy and colectomy related to cancer, and obstetric-perinatal outcomes. In the future, U.S. News intends to expand evaluations to cover individual physicians and regional health systems or groups of hospitals. Panelists emphasized the need for hospitals to become more transparent about their outcomes by publicly reporting data from clinical registries. \"I created this monster in 1990, and it turned into something I never anticipated,\" said Avery Comarow, health rankings editor at U.S. News & World Report, as he greeted the session's audience. Comarow directed the launches of Best Hospitals in 1990, Best Children's Hospitals in 2007, Best Nursing Homes in 2009 and Best Regional Hospitals in 2011.\nRELATED\nBetter Health Cost-Cutting Through Data Ben Harder, chief of health analysis and a managing editor at U.S. News & World Report, gave the bulk of the presentation. Harder oversees data use in U.S. News' suite of decision support tools for health care.\nFour years ago, U.S. News introduced the Best Regional Hospitals rankings, by metro area and state, to give consumers objective measures of success in providing high-quality care among hospitals in their communities. This year, a new offering, Best Hospitals for Common Care , added another dimension.\nHarder described an important component that emerged from Common Care data: the relationship between surgery in low-volume hospitals and increased (but still rare) deaths. \"A large part of that picture is appropriateness,\" he said.\nThe latest Best Regional Hospitals rankings featured several changes in methodology: The Common Care ratings became a rankings factor, eligibility was limited to general acute-care hospitals, and specialty hospitals were ineligible.\nReputation-only specialties – ophthalmology, psychiatry, rehabilitation and rheumatology – were eliminated from Best Regional Hospitals' consideration, because of the lack of objective measurements.\nHarder noted that the risk-adjustment model used by the U.S. News ranking team differs from that of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. One difference is that U.S. News rankings incorporate socioeconomic status in hospital readmission results. Therefore, results for procedures such as joint replacement or conditions like COPD could vary between the ranking systems.\nHe addressed current data limitations in rankings: the use of retrospective data and the lack of clinical variables like body mass index, which can affect patients' medical and surgical outcomes. Access to clinical registries and databases would serve to improve public reporting and transparency, he said.\n[ READ: Hospitals Harnessing 'Data Insights' to Enhance Care ]\nProcedures to assure accurate data reporting from hospitals are being further strengthened, said panelist Murrey Olmsted, a senior methodologist and health researcher with RTI International. Olmsted works with the Best Hospitals and Best Children's Hospitals rankings as a contractor for U.S. News.\nU.S. News' Geoff Dougherty, senior health services researcher, said U.S. News will perform the 2016 analytics for Common Care entirely in house, another change.\nHarder summed up the motivation behind ranking hospital quality: \"We are here to help patients make better decisions.\"\nTAGS: rankings health care", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedo8h%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=U.S.%20News%20Gives%20Update%20on%20Hospital%20Quality%20Reporting&summary=Best%20Hospitals%20for%20Common%20Care%20rankings%20will%20further%20evolve%20in%202016.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedo8h%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedo8h%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=U.S.%20News%20Gives%20Update%20on%20Hospital%20Quality%20Reporting", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedo8h%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=U.S.%20News%20Gives%20Update%20on%20Hospital%20Quality%20Reporting", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedo8h%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedo8h%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:39:48.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
