We’ve proved it in our schools across our country; that the poorest children don’t have to get the worst results, they can get the best.

Downing Street sources insisted his intention was to stand down as PM in 2020. \nAsked about the contenders jockeying to replace him, the party leader said: \"I'm very proud that I run a team and a team with some real stars. \n\"We are seeing this week great speeches by Boris Johnson - we've just heard a vision for how we bring our country together - a great speech by Theresa May, one of the architects of modernisation of the Conservative Party, a brilliant speech by George Osborne about changing the way we run our country. \n\"It demonstrates the Conservative Party is a team of leaders, not simply one person; a team that's got great ideas and visions for the future, so I couldn't be happier.\" Share article \nMr Cameron said he was \"looking forward\" to bringing Mr Johnson into No 10. \nAsked if the MP for Uxbridge, who currently attends the political Cabinet, would get a ministerial job, the PM was unequivocal, saying: \"Definitely.
