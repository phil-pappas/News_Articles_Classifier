For investors, that means some year-end tasks remain on the to-do list.\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean placing your bets about which stocks or sectors you believe will do well – or poorly – in 2016. Instead, investment professionals say, year-end financial tasks often pertain to taxes or general planning matters.\nHere are some tasks investors should handle before the year ends:\nTax-loss harvesting. Tim McGrath, managing partner at Riverpoint Wealth Management in Chicago, says tax-related questions make up the bulk of client discussions in the fourth quarter, including a look at capital gains.\nShort-term capital gains are the net gains from the sale of shares owned for one year or less. In a nonqualified account, taxation of these gains can put a dent in returns. To offset those effects, McGrath uses tax-loss harvesting, the process of selling a security that shows a loss. In some cases, investors or advisors can replace the sold security with something similar. That maintains the desired asset allocation mix while avoiding a potential tax hit.\n\"Tax-loss harvesting is obviously a big thing at the end of the year,\" McGrath says. \"We already did some of that when the market dropped, just in case it bounced back. But we'll look at it again,\" he says.\nBob Andres, founder and chief investment officer of Andres Capital Management in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, says the fourth quarter is typically when investors review their holdings and plan to sell securities that no longer meet their portfolio's objectives.\nHe cites the example of municipal bonds . \"The outperformance of municipal securities over the last two years may provide profit-taking opportunities to offset losses in other asset classes,\" he says. \"Gains in one asset class may be used to offset losses in another, dollar for dollar. Tax swapping is the simple act of selling a holding and replacing it with one of similar but measurably different characteristics, such as longer maturity or different coupon or rating.\"\nTake your distributions. Eric Kies, chief compliance officer at The Planning Center in Moline, Illinois, also emphasizes the need to take required minimum distributions from individual retirement accounts . Investors who own traditional IRA accounts must begin taking their distributions no later than April 1 following the year in which they turn 70 1/2, and by Dec. 31 every year after that. Investors who fail to make the withdrawals face penalties.\n\"Depending upon the client's situation, there may be opportunities to convert traditional IRA assets to a Roth IRA by year end,\" Kies says. Often, retirees find that the Roth conversion makes sense. Investors may contribute to a Roth at any age, and they are not required to take the yearly minimum distributions. In addition, withdrawals from Roth IRAs are not taxable until six months after the account holder turns 59, and as long as he has held the funds for at least five years.\nEach investor's situation is different, which is why the fourth quarter is a good time to evaluate your overall financial position.\n\"We look at clients on an individual basis. Some might be in a higher tax bracket in 2016 than they are in 2015, or just the opposite. For some clients, we might hold off on making changes just because we know it's a big year. They're retiring or they have a big distribution, so the last thing we want to do is to add anything to enhance that this year,\" McGrath says.\nIn those situations, it might benefit the investor to wait until 2016 to make any significant portfolio shifts.\n\"Towards the end of the year is the time that we reassess all investments that we're in for clients, to see if there are any strategies that we're going to change. We'll be doing tactical plays throughout the year, but just a complete overview on every individual security, typically we do it in fourth quarter or the first quarter. That's when we implement a lot of things,\" McGrath says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:19:12.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
