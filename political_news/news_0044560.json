One administration shouldn’t be allowed to undermine it. And at times, this requires putting the interest of the country above partisan interest. \n“The hope is that the global community takes notice and urges change before the elections rather than looking back at the 2016 elections; shaking their heads and asking ‘how did this happen’; we are telling you exactly how it’s going to happen,” Akufo-Addo told a gathering in Washington in the USA. \nHe added: “All the pieces are in place for a rigged elections. As Africans, we have witnessed election related violence tear countries apart, we know what we risk should these problems not be resolved”. \nThe NPP and pressure group, Let my Vote Count Alliance (LMVCA), are demanding for a fresh register for the 2016 elections. \nThey claim that the current register is bloated and cannot be trusted. They insist that the Electoral Commission must change it in order to ensure transparency and engender public confidence in the outcome of the elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:05:18.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
