Depending on whom you talk to, it’s either a grassroots effort to better fund our schools or a partisan and special-interest power struggle. “We have always recognized it as being not any sort of grassroots education effort but politically as a partisan assault on the legislative leadership and constitutionally as an assault upon representative democracy,” said Republican state Rep. Greg Snowden, a vocal opponent of Initiative 42. But Patsy Brumfield, spokeswoman for the group pushing Initiative 42, said, “There’s 200,000 signatures on a petition that just negate those silly implications. If this weren’t grassroots, we could never have gotten sufficient signatures to get it on the ballot.” Clarion Ledger Posted October 19, 2015 - 6:47 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
