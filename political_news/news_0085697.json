Frank Wagner focuses on special interests at the expense of his district and that should mean an end to his 24 years in Virginia's legislature, Democratic challenger Gary McCollum said at a debate Thursday.\nWagner, under attack nearly every time McCollum gave an answer, said that for someone who claimed not to be a politician, McCollum sure sounded like one.\nThe Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce debate was moderated by Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth at the Virginia Beach Convention Center.\nIt included a discussion of education, the economy, transportation, McCollum's military record and a remark Wagner recently made that was described as divisive by the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus.\nThe chamber has endorsed Wagner. Both candidates touted their business credentials, and Wagner said his endorsement by Norfolk Democratic Mayor Paul Fraim showed the importance of regional cooperation.\nThe attacks from McCollum were not unexpected. As a challenger, he's already up against the power of incumbency and has been under partisan attack himself the past few weeks for an error on his resume in which he said he remained in the Army Reserve 23 years after having no contact with the service.\nMcCollum called for more spending for education and said good teachers are leaving because pay is too low. He also slammed Wagner for sponsoring legislation this year \"written by\" Dominion Virginia Power that ended state oversight of the monopoly's base electricity rates for five years.\n\"He has not done the things in the best interest of this district. He's paying attention to special interests,\" McCollum said.\nMcCollum, in his first bid for office, regularly says, \"I'm not a politician.\" Wagner jabbed at one point: \"The second you sign a certificate of candidacy, you're a politician, and that was an excellent political answer.\"\nMcCollum said Wagner and other members of the legislature have not shown leadership on transportation. That irked Wagner, who helped broker a bipartisan transportation bill that's now paying for improvements in Hampton Roads.\n\"So to sit here and take these shots that somehow I'm not a leader when everybody in this room knows exactly how that transportation bill went down...\" Wagner said.\nMcCollum called for redistricting reform so districts are more competitive and candidates more responsive to constituents.\nMembers of the General Assembly draw their own legislative districts, and both parties have used that power to gerrymander districts beneficial to incumbents.\nWagner said he worried that any independent panel drawing lines would be influenced by politics. But \"if I was absolutely assured this was a nonpartisan panel... yeah, I'd be supportive of it.\"\nMcCollum said voters need leadership on the issue, which Wagner hasn't provided. And he called Wagner \"the biggest receiver of gifts in the entire state Senate.\"\n\"We need fresh leadership,\" he said. \"Twenty-four years in office is long enough.\"\nWagner responded: \"I believe I'm in the best position to deliver the things that we need in this area.\"\nIt's difficult to conclusively verify the gift claim because reporting requirements have changed. According to an analysis of Virginia Public Access Project data, Wagner is the second-biggest gift recipient among current senators, trailing Majority Leader Tommy Norment.\nMcCollum's campaign, however, provided an analysis showing Wagner edging Norment in gift receipts since 2002.\nThe 7th District is one of a handful of competitive Senate races that Gov. Terry McAuliffe hopes will shift control back to Democrats.\nWagner offered a warning about that possibility.\n\"You're going to have deja vu,\" he said. \"I'll take you back to the last two-year budget. Held up by the Democrats.... Localities now couldn't plan their budgets because they didn't know how much they were going to get. School boards couldn't plan their budgets.\"\nThen the surprise resignation in June 2014 of Democratic Sen. Phil Puckett shifted control of the evenly divided Senate to Republicans, who quickly approved the budget before the July 1 deadline, Wagner said.\nAll 140 seats in the General Assembly are up for election on Nov. 3.\nPatrick Wilson, 804-697-1564, patrick.wilson@pilotonline.com\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
