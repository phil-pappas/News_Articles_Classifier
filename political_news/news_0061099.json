This is the second green campus that Delta has built in Xichuan following Delta Sunshine Elementary School in Yangjia Town in the aftermath of the Wenchuan quake. The school, currently housing nearly 280 students and staff, is constructed under the reinforced protection requirement for a strong earthquake of 7.5 on scale. In addition, the campus design takes local environment into account, providing good ventilation, heat insulation, sunshade, and humidity buffering for the summer, and heat preservation and wind shelter for the winter. The passive design effectively reduces energy use and improves the comfort in the school space.\nThe design of the junior high, based on the top award winning project -- \"Delta Sunshine Elementary School in Yangjia Town\" -- in the 2009 Delta International Solar Building Design Competition, was carried out by China Architecture Design & Research Group (CAG). The energy-saving concept was fine-tuned in accordance with local terrain and weather conditions, allowing for a successful replication of the green architecture in the reconstruction of the quake-stricken region. After nearly a year of construction since the foundation was laid down on Oct. 15, 2014 , a safe campus is finally open to welcome back the students and staff.\n\"It was touching to see those smiling faces of the vibrant students who could live and learn in the new campus,\" said Liao Qinglong, Executive Vice President and General Manager, Delta Electronics ( China ), \"Not only does the green architecture save energy, the students and staff living in it could also feel the palpable comfort.\" Under the mission \"to provide innovative, clean and energy-efficient solutions for a better tomorrow,\" Delta not only proactively engages in the development of green power products, but also commits itself to the promotion of green architecture. At the COP21 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) scheduled to convene in the end of this year in Paris , Delta is set to hold the \"Delta 21 Green Buildings at COP21 Exhibition\" at the Grand Palais. The exhibition will showcase Delta's green architecture endeavors, presenting the 21 green architectures Delta has built in the past 10 years, including Delta Sunshine Junior High School of Longmen and Delta Sunshine Elementary School in Yangjia Town, to demonstrate their green design concepts and energy-saving potential.\nThe school's surface area totals 14,007 square meters, with the premises occupying a surface of 4,680 square meters. An ensemble of 18 classrooms for 6 classes is conceived for the school. The contractor CAG, responsible for the design and implementation, takes into full consideration weather condition, local architectural culture, and demand for energy use, accommodating actual land condition of the campus and different features of various buildings. The plan, optimizing space design and energy system structure, adequately leverages such recycled energy as solar power, passive solar power technology in particular, to strengthen the energy-saving concept, offering effective protection for the environment. The energy-saving technologies deployed include buoyancy-driven ventilation, green rooftop, and solar power-enabled hot water system. In addition, the design also adapts to the original terrain features, blending organically the architecture into the nature, and minimizing as much as possible hard pavement to be replaced by grasses and trees.\nConsidering the hot and humid summer and cold and wet winter in the Lushan region, the green school adopts various techniques to reduce classroom temperature. These include natural ventilation, adding an empty layer under the roof, lifting up the floor, installing overhead windows for natural daylight, and sunshade lighting adjustment. Compared to rooms without such techniques, temperature in the classrooms adopting the techniques lowers 1°C~2°C during the daytime in the summer, and relative humidity in the air in such classrooms on the first floor decreases by 23.5% during the day. The rooftop windows increase average lighting on the tables in classroom on the top floor by 92 lux. For the Lushan region where sunshine hours are less than 1,000 per year, the improvement amounts to nearly 30% reduction of average daily power consumption for lighting. Outdoor areas in the campus, except the playground, are paved with permeable bricks or permeable concrete, guaranteeing roughly 2,400 tons of rains infiltrating the land to preserve underground water environment.\nThe inauguration ceremony of the junior high school was attended by more than 200 people, including the school's students and staff and a group of honorable guests.\nDelta's achievements in energy-saving initiatives and commitment in corporate social responsibility over the years have received a great deal of international accolades. The electricity density (the amount of power used per productivity unit) at Delta's major production sites has decreased 50% in 2014 from 2009, and Delta is committed to extending the energy-saving initiative across all of the group and further reducing the power density by 30% by 2020. Delta was the only company from greater China to be included to the Climate Performance Leadership Index (CPLI) of the 2014 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). In addition, Delta has been selected for the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) World for five consecutive years since 2011, and topped at the electronics industry this year on the index. Delta is committed to continuously engage in the promotion of green initiatives, fulfilling its duty a corporate citizen in the international community.\nAbout Delta\nDelta, founded in 1971, is a global leader in power and thermal management solutions and a major player in several product segments such as industrial automation, displays, and networking.
