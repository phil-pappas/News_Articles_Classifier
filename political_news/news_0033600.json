Chairmen are thrilled to have members that will come to hearings, that will cast tough votes, that will draft substantive legislation that has a chance of getting across the floor, that are team players on procedural votes, those sorts of thing.” “But you do have to work,” Mr. Cole said, noting that it took him until his fourth term in office to win a coveted seat on the Appropriations Committee. “And guess what? You don’t just show up and get to rule the world. It takes some time.” The rules proposals are an obvious outgrowth of the friction between Mr. Boehner, who did not hide his disdain and lack of respect for some of the rebellious conservatives, and conservatives who considered Mr. Boehner a distant and divisive figure, in the words of Mr. Mulvaney. The proposed changes in the structure of the steering committee would prevent it from being stacked with allies of the speaker, as it is now. The conservatives have also called for other committee members to elect their own chairmen in most cases and to remove the threat that committee leaders could lose their post if they do not support the policy position endorsed by the full House Republican Conference. The questionnaire made it clear that House conservatives would vote only for a speaker candidate who promised to increase their numbers on the steering committee and to not punish lawmakers who cross the leadership by stripping them of committee assignments, as Mr. Boehner did. They are seeking other pledges as well, including a move to impeach the director of the Internal Revenue Service and a commitment to not give in and accept any stopgap spending bill if Senate Democrats block regular spending measures — an impasse that could lead to a government shutdown. Some conservatives who were not officially part of the Freedom Caucus also joined the push for changes. “I think the primary thing is some folks feel like they don’t have a voice at the table,” said Representative Bill Flores of Texas, head of the Republican Study Committee, a sizable bloc of House conservatives. “They don’t have the voice as to what comes to the floor, they don’t have a voice as to what amendments get offered and don’t get offered, and they’re frustrated with that. And I can’t blame them. It’s happened to me before, too.” Mr. Loudermilk, the Georgia freshman, said that until the Freedom Caucus forced the shake-up in House leadership, he felt irrelevant in Congress. “During the last two or three weeks, it’s the first time I actually felt that my vote and my voice actually matters,” he said. “It should be like that all the time.” \nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .
