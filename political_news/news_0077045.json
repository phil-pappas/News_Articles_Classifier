(AP) - The latest on the road rage killing of a 4-year-old girl on a New Mexico freeway (all times local):\n12:18 p.m.\nA man accused of the road rage killing of a 4-year-old girl on an Albuquerque freeway has been tied to violent crimes in New Mexico over the past decade but the cases were dropped.\nTony Torrez has only been prosecuted for a speeding violation. Court records say Torrez pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor speeding violation for going 16 to 20 mph over the speed limit in April 2013.\nAround that time, charges including abandonment or abuse of a child and aggravated battery of a household member were dismissed after the victim died.\nProsecutors also were not able to proceed with 2006 domestic violence charges.\nThe 32-year-old Torrez was arrested Wednesday and charged with murder and other crimes in the shooting death of Lilly Garcia.\n___\n11:15 a.m.\nThe grandfather of a 4-year-old girl killed in a road rage shooting in New Mexico says something has to be done about gun violence.\nJose Garcia told The Associated Press outside the family's home on Thursday that this type of tragedy should never happen. The grandfather, who spoke in Spanish, says Lilly Garcia's death has left the family in deep mourning.\nThey live just south of the freeway where Tuesday's shooting occurred. Lilly Garcia was killed after a driver opened fire on her father's pickup truck.\nPolice arrested 32-year-old Tony Torrez on Wednesday and charged him with murder and other crimes.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:23:41.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
