Biden said Tuesday he thought Obama \"should go.\"\nBut according to the The New York Times in 2012, Biden advised against it. \"Mr. President, my suggestion is, don't go,\" Biden recalled saying in January, 2012. \"We have to do two more things to see if he's there.'\"\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ White House spokesman Josh Earnest tap danced around the apparently contradictory comments by refusing to answer questions about it.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Rubio on Crist: 'Some people can't live without' running for office \"I'll let the voters in that area decide. I think they know we don't need more of Charlie Crist.\"\nBy Al Weaver • 10/20/15 5:24 PM \"I was not in the room when these decisions were being made or when the president was consulting his advisers about this very difficult foreign policy call that he made,\" Earnest said in response to a question.\nBiden also disputed potential 2016 Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's account, who said as secretary of state at the time she endorsed deploying a Seal team to Pakistan to raid the bin Laden compound. Instead, Biden said that during a meeting of top advisers on the eve of the raid, only then-CIA Director Leon Panetta supported going in.\nFor all the varying accounts swirling, it was Earnest who was left to suss out fact from revisionist history.\n\"[O]n many occasions, I've declined to provide insight into the private conversations between the president of the United States and the vice president of the United States other than to tell you that the president deeply values that advice,\" Earnest punted. \"But I'm not going to get into the substance of their conversations.\"\n\"I'm telling you that I don't have any insight to share with you about the private conversations between the president and the vice president,\" he said, encouraging reporters to ask Obama and Biden themselves.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Muslims oppose U.K.'s tough new counter-extremism program The initiative removes passports of teenagers whose parents suspect of having connections to extremists.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 10/20/15 12:40 PM   5:07 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:59:57.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
