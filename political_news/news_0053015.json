Share on twitter by Joanna Mather Making a greater proportion of low-income earners' wages tax free could be used as a trade-off for increasing the GST, CPA Australia says.\nBacking an idea floated by Liberal MP Dan Tehan in Monday's The Australian Financial Review , the accounting professional body said it was worth considering an increase in the tax-free threshold, which is currently $18,200 a year.\nThis could form part of a compensation package for poorer families, who would be hit hardest by a GST rise, CPA Australia chief executive Alex Malley said.\nThe idea is to lift the tax-free threshold to match the minimum wage at $33,327 a year.\nThis near doubling of the amount of money a person can earn before incurring income tax would make work more attractive than welfare.\nBut it would be costly for the government because the tax-free entitlement is universal. \"It would...mean a tax cut for many Australians,\" Mr Malley said.\nAustralian National University research fellow Rob Bray said he had \"some sympathy\" with the idea of matching the minimum wage to the tax-free threshold.\nHowever, such a change would absolve part-time workers from having to pay tax and the jury was still out on whether such tax incentives were effective.\n \"We know that the French created a work incentive by removing tax on overtime and that's been assessed as having absolutely no impact on the level of overtime people worked,\" he said.\nRelationship unclear \"The relationship between tax and incentives to work is nowhere near as clear as is suggested and there is a significant body of research that suggests the impact is relatively small.\"\nThe Australian Council of Trade Unions estimates that 1.9 million workers earn the minimum wage as set by employment awards. The minimum wage is worth 43.4 per cent of average weekly earnings, which are $1477 a week.\nOne of the trickiest tasks for any tax system is to balance the disincentives to work, or work more hours, that come with the withdrawal of benefits. Another problem for policymakers is that a GST increase weighs most heavily on the poor.\n\"A higher tax-free threshold, depending on what else is done to the tax and welfare systems, may well reduce the impact of the high effective marginal tax rates faced by many workers as they move from means-tested welfare to more work,\" Mr Malley said.\n\"It could [also] serve as part of a compensation package required to offset the impacts of any corresponding increase in taxes on consumption that may be considered as part of changing the overall tax mix.\nAustralia should direct tax relief toward lower income earners, Mr Tehan wrote in the Financial Review .\n\"Like the UK, it is time we recognised that if we want to place work over welfare, placing income tax on those on minimum wage or below must be looked at,\" he said.\nMr Tehan is outspoken on tax, having previously argued for the GST to be applied to fresh food , education, health and financial services.\nTreasurer Scott Morrison also recently praised the UK's welfare-to-work initiatives.\nIain Duncan Smith, the pensions secretary in the Conservative government, is introducing measures to allow low-income earners to work more without losing as much of their benefits. There is also a new \"national living wage\" of £7.20, up from £6.50 an hour .\nAccounting firm KPMG has recommended axing the $18,200 tax-free threshold introducing a \"work incentive offset\" would encourage people to derive income from paid employment rather than welfare.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-10-19T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:02:46.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
