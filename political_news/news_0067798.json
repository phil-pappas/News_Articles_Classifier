This involves the construction of the Lake Road - Oforikrom bypass and the Aboabo drainage works. \nPresident Mahama expressed appreciation to President Hollande for his support during the Ebola outbreak and France's role in stabilising the situation in Mali and other parts of the sub-region. \nHe also thanked France for agreeing to support the training of teachers in the teaching and learning of French language in Ghanaian schools. \nPresident Mahama who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Hannah Tetteh, Dr Edward Omane Boamah, Minister for Communications and Mr Kwasi Quartey, Executive Secretary to President, later held similar discussions with the Francophone Business Forum. \nThe focus of his visit to France is Ghana's decision to join the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to share ideas bordering on economic and political development. \nPresident Mahama would also attend and address a forum of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Ambassadors and Ghanaians in the Diaspora. \nWhile in France, President Mahama is also expected to visit Bordeaux where he would hold discussions with the Bordeaux Chamber of Commerce and present a lecture at the University of Bordeaux. \nHe is also expected to hold discussions with the Mayor of Bordeaux on a number of development issues. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:20:16.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
