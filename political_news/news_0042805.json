Related UVa Students Transform Totaled Volkswagen into Electric Sports Car \nHorn will face tough questions from the House subcommittee and, according to an advanced copy of Horn's prepared remarks provided to the committee Wednesday , he is planning to apologize for his role in the emissions-rigging scandal. The 51-year-old German originally became the CEO of VW’s America subsidiary last year. \nVolkswagen’s USA HQ is based in Herndon, Va. The drive from Herndon to D.C. spans about one hour with traffic, but the trip will likely feel a world apart for the VW executive team before it takes the stand before Congress. \nAccording to the prepared remarks, Horn claims he did not know of the scheme to deceive EPA testing official via a “defeat device” until just a “few weeks” before VW first confessed to the plot on September 3. \n“I did not think that something like this was possible at the Volkswagen Group,” Horn will say, according to the aforementioned prepared speech, “we have broken the trust of our customers, dealerships, and employees, as well as the public and regulators.” \"The very notion of a carmaker intentionally violating our environmental laws is beyond belief\" \nIn essence, this piece of software (the “defeat device”) was able to detect when a VW diesel car was being tested by the agency and it then activated a series of short-lived pollution controls, reducing the output of nitrogen oxides—making it so the vehicle appeared less damaging to the environment than both consumers and federal officials were aware of. EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia said described it as an \"auxiliary emissions control device.\" \nThe cheat reportedly began in 2009, as the software was present in roughly 11 million vehicles, including 500,000 of VW’s four-cylinder \"clean diesel\" cars in the U.S., according to an early probe. \n“The very notion of a carmaker intentionally violating our environmental laws is beyond belief. Attempting to deceive regulators and customers is a double whammy of betrayal. We will get to the bottom of this,” said Michigan Republican and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Fred Upton in a statement last week when the subcommittee hearing was announced. \nIndications that VW’s diesel vehicles were non-compliant with stringent EPA diesel regulation first came to light in 2014, when a West Virginia University study was published illustrating a definable gap between testing results and advertised statistics. \"I did not think that something like this was possible at the Volkswagen Group\" \nPer Horn, he was made aware of the West Virginia University report but was “informed that the technical teams had a specific plan for remedies to bring the vehicles into compliance and that they were engaged with the agencies about the process.” \nIt’s unclear, at the moment, whether the remedies mentioned in the prepared remarks are indicative of the larger rigging scandal. \nImportantly, the transcript of Horn’s impending comments also shows that VW will be dropping applications seeking U.S. emission certifications for its 2016 diesel models, including the Jetta, Golf, Passat and Beetle. In translation, thousand of new models that are currently stored at ports nationwide will be stranded, without regulatory approval, leaving dealerships with open orders and without options. It’s currently unclear when VW will refile its application. What is clear, is that dealerships carrying predominately VW models are hurting in a multitude of ways. The D.C. Tech angle \nLocally, in the D.C. startup ecosystem, iStrategy Labs (ISL) celebrated a big win connected to VW USA in July when it was named the official social and digital agency of record for the german car maker. This assignment obviously came before news of the emission-rigging scandal rocked headlines, internationally. Today, ISL continues its disruptive social media marketing for the brand, which has assumably become an immensely challenging task—due to the negative public opinion that currently envelopes one of their largest clients to date. \nVIDEO: \n*And for fun, just imagine what ISL's custom VW “Social Dash,\" which measures “MPH” (Mentions Per Hour) and “TPM” (Tweets Per Minute), looked like on September 3.
