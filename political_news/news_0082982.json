He added that groups paying Muslims to heckle and taunt Jews heading to the Temple Mount must must be stopped as well.\n He also encouraged plans to build safe bypass roads for people traveling through the West Bank.\nLiberman's statement came hours after an Israeli teenager was stabbed in at a gas station near Jerusalem's Old City on Sunday morning.\nOn Saturday evening, a Palestinian terrorist murdered two Jewish men and wounded a mother and her son in the Old City of Jerusalem in a stabbing and shooting spree. The suspect was shot dead following the attack.\nThe victims were Rabbi Nehemia Lavie, 41, an Old City resident who worked at the Ateret Cohanim Yeshiva, near the place he was killed, and Aharon Benita from Beitar Illit.\nThe toddlerâ€™s mother, 22, was in critical condition.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:53:52.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
