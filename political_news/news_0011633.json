Photo: Andrew Meares\nOil company executives rhapsodise about the Great Australian Bight's potential as a last frontier containing massive reserves of what romanticists used to call black gold.\nBunna Lawrie speaks of the place in the poetry of a people who have lived at the edge of that frontier for maybe 50,000 years.\n\"I\"m the whale song man from the Nullarbor on the Great Australian Bight,\" says Lawrie, who prefers to be called Bunna.\n\"The Great Australian Bight is the greatest whale nursery on this planet. The whale story where I come from is my university, my school. It's the place where our beautiful southern right whales come to calve their young, to teach their young to travel on the next journey.\nAdvertisement \"Whales like sperm whales, blue whales, pygmy blue whales, killer whales, humpback whales â€“ they travel down there to honour that great journey, that song, that story of the great white whale Jeedara that is there now.\"\nHere is an asymmetrical argument. On one side there is BP, a powerful multinational oil company with billions of dollars at its disposal and a world addicted to petroleum and its by-products.\nOn the other is Bunna, the Indigenous Mirning man who says his people are descendants of the whale Jeedara who built the cliffs of the Bight and all the tunnels and marine caves beneath the Nullarbor and its ocean. Bunna sings the story of Jeedara in his effort to stop oil drilling there.\nBut BP, which says the Bight could contain reserves of oil to rival the Mississippi Delta and Nigeria, brings with it a modern storyline that sings a more discordant tune.\nThe Gulf of Mexico, within the Mississippi Delta, is still recovering from the world's biggest environmental catastrophe, when BP's Deepwater Horizon rig blew up, killed 11 workers and disgorged 800 million litres of oil into the sea over 87 days in 2010.\nAnd BP got out of Nigeria long ago as civil war, attacks by militant groups, sabotage and a whole slew of messy problems linked to Big Oil's treatment of the environment and the people of the Niger Delta mounted up.\nLittle wonder that BP is searching for new sources of oil, declaring it has learnt its lessons.\nIt is now awaiting a decision, due at the end of the month, by Australia's National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority on whether it can float a giant drilling rig from South Korea to begin searching for oil deep in the seabed of the Great Australian Bight.\nThe bight itself is up to 2.5 kilometres deep, its waves regularly six times the size of those in the Gulf of Mexico, its fisheries worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year and its marine biodiversity unmatched anywhere.\nUnsurprisingly, those who worry about the environment are beginning to let their voices be heard. Right now, neither the Liberal-National Coalition in Canberra nor the Labor opposition appears interested in intervening. With the mineral boom over, the major parties can see large, sorely needed revenues flowing if oil starts gushing.\nThe Environment Minister, Greg Hunt, has an easy out. The whole thing will be decided by NOPSEMA, an arms-length body established by the previous Labor government. The politicians decided to hand over responsibility to this authority after one of Australia's worst oil disasters: the 74-day Montara oil and gas leak off the Kimberley coast in 2009, the effects of which are still reportedly bedevilling Indonesia's marine environment.\nLabor's opposition spokesman on resources, Gary Gray, was something of an oil man before entering parliament in 2007. He advised Woodside Petroleum on its successful effort to repel a takeover by Shell. He then became Woodside's Director of Corporate Affairs. Woodside has something of an interest in the Great Australian Bight's oil, drilling exploration holes to 4000 metres before immense seas forced a retreat in 2003.\nThe Wilderness Society, however, isn't about to retreat from its view that the Bight is too valuable to put at risk. It commissioned an extensive report by oceanographer and coastal scientist Laurent Lebreton which show that a blow-out producing 5000 barrels of oil a day for 87 days would have an 80 per cent chance of producing an oil slick within four months heavy enough to close fisheries over 265,000 kilometres in winter and eventually wrapping around Victoria's coast and reaching Tasmania.\nIn summer a slick of 213,000 square kilometres would spread well into Western Australia, the study contends.\nSouth Australian Senator Nick Xenophon has joined the campaign, calling for parliament to regain the power to decide on offshore oil drilling. Several independents appear likely to come on board and the Australian Greens are likely to make the matter their next major campaign.\nMeanwhile, Bunna Lawrie, Mirning elder, born at the Koonibba Mission at the edge of the Nullarbor, for 38 years singer-songwriter for the Indigenous band Coloured Stone, and in his people's story the descendant of a white whale, came to parliament this week to put the whole thing into a sort of poetry.\n\"My ancestors and I have looked after the whale, the land and the sea for 50,000 years; preserved and protected it from the beginning of time.\n\"I cannot allow BP to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight.\"\nThese are unlikely to be the last words heard about the subject.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:12:32.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
