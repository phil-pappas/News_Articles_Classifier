Report Score: 19 From beer to uncertainty 7:59am Thu 1 Oct 15 \nAdd up every fossil fuel emmision from human heating, domestic use and transport (aviation, motoring etc) and it's a tiny fraction of the cataclysmic emmisions from growing animals for meat. Most 'environmentalists' are money-grabbing hypocrites unless they are vegan and campaign against the real cause of the forthcoming environmental apocalypse. I'm an omnivore and I've accepted the environment is truly screwed and will get worse. But I'm not a scrounging hypocrite trying to make money out of the absurdity of claiming transport emmisions are the main problem. The answers simple: the planet would need to go vegan to survive.
