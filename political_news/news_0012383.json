Purchase: Order Reprint The five candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination collectively uttered more than 18,000 words over two hours during their first debate Tuesday on CNN, and some of their pronouncements strayed into gray areas. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, former Govs. Lincoln Chafee and Martin O’Malley, Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Sen. Jim Webb disagreed on guns, the economy and foreign policy. Not every candidate cited facts that can be easily verified, but here’s a look at some of their statements — and the details behind those words. “It is immoral and wrong that the top one-tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent — almost — own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. That it is wrong … that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent.” Sanders The first part of Sanders’ statement is based on a 2014 paper that found that wealth has become increasingly concentrated among the superwealthy. The average wealth of the bottom 90 percent — 144 million families with $84,000 — had increased in the late 1990s and the early 2000s, but then collapsed in the financial crisis. The top tenth of 1 percent is comprised of 160,000 families with net assets of at least $20 million. These families saw their share of wealth increase from 7 percent of total household wealth in the 1970s to 22 percent in 2012; by contrast, the bottom 90 percent saw their share of wealth drop from 35 percent in the mid-1980s to 23 percent in 2012. That means the top 0.1 percent own almost as much as the bottom 90 percent. ••• “African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent.” Sanders This is a favorite talking point, and Sanders often clarifies that he is referring to the “real unemployment.” But he exaggerated. He was not referring to actual unemployment rates, but to the broadest measure of underemployment. ••• “Virtually every telephone call in this country ends up in a file at the NSA.” Sanders The National Security Administration has collected metadata from billions of phone calls. Data includes the number, time and duration of calls, but not content. ••• “The economy does better when you have a Democrat in the White House.” Clinton Clinton draws this claim from a 2014 paper by Alan S. Blinder and Mark W. Watson of Princeton University, which did find this connection. But it also said that the data did not support a claim that this was due to macroeconomic policy choices. “Both fiscal and monetary policy actions seem to be a bit more stabilizing when a Republican is president — even though Federal Reserve chairmen appointed by Democrats preside over faster growth than Federal Reserve chairmen appointed by Republicans by a wide margin,” the paper said. “It seems we must look instead to several variables that are mostly ‘good luck,’ with perhaps a touch of ‘good policy.’” ••• “Take the trade deal. I did say, when I was secretary of state … that I hoped it would be the gold standard. It was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn’t meet my standards.” Clinton She never said “hoped.” Instead, she said in 2012, “This [deal] sets the gold standard in trade agreements.” ••• “Our poor families are becoming poorer. And 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago.” O’Malley This statement is based on outdated data and it is unclear exactly who he means when he says “70 percent of us.” His statement is based on June 2014 research that shows broad stagnation for American families and the economy from 2001 to 2013. Since then, however, real wages and earnings have increased broadly, Bureau of Labor Statistics data show. ••• “What I did was allowed by the State Department.” Clinton This is Clinton’s standard line, but it’s a stretch. When Clinton was secretary of state, there were in place State Department rules on how to handle e-mails and whether to use a personal e-mail account. In 2009, eight months after Clinton became secretary of state, federal regulations on handling electronic records were updated: “Agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved.” In reality, Clinton’s decision to use a private e-mail system for official business was unusual and flouted State Department procedures, even if not expressly prohibited by law at the time. She appears to have violated the requirement to turn over her business-related e-mails before she left the government. ••• “We have 27 million people living in poverty.” Sanders It is actually 46.7 million people as of 2014, according to the Census Bureau. ••• “We put our city on a path to reduce violent crime, Part 1 crime, by more than any major city in America. … Arrests peaked in 2003, but they declined every year after that.” O’Malley O’Malley was referring to FBI crime data that include criminal homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, arson and motor vehicle theft. Baltimore’s overall crime rate fell by 48 percent between 1999 and 2009. Baltimore saw the third highest drop in violent crimes among major cities during the period. In 1999 (the year O’Malley became mayor), Baltimore had the highest violent and property crime rate among major police agencies. In 2009, the city dropped to 13th highest. But the city’s drop in crime rates mirrored a national decline. He said arrests declined as violent crime dropped, but at the peak of arrests, two-thirds of people in jail were there for nonviolent offenses, according to the Justice Policy Institute. A police commissioner switched the arrest strategy to target violent offenders, driving down arrest numbers to 77,595 in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:29:10.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
