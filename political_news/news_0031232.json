We stress that the freedom of transit of LLDCs should not be constrained under any circumstance or pretext to disrupt the flow of goods and services.\n\"The freedom of transit of LLDCs must be fully and unconditionally adhered to by all transit countries,\" said Singh, also the Nepali Congress general secretary.\nHis remarks come at a time when Nepal claims to be suffering from scarcity of essential goods like fuel and cooking gas due to what it terms as \"undeclared blockade\" of a key trade point at the border with India by people protesting the controversial newly-promulgated Constitution.\nIndia has rejected as \"totally false\" allegations that it blockaded the checkpoint and has emphasised that it can only take goods up to the border and beyond that it is the\nresponsibility of the Nepalese side to ensure adequate safety and security for the trucks.\nThe Secretary-General commended Nepalese government and people on the adoption of the new constitution, according to a statement issued by the UN Office on Saturday.\nBan strongly welcomed the decisions made by the Council of Ministers on October 1 to create the conditions for dialogue with agitating groups, including Hindu Madhesis who are Indian-origin inhabitants of the Terai region bordering India and opposed to splitting Nepal into seven provinces.\nThe Secretary-General also urged all parties to respond to the calls for dialogue and to resolve their differences in a peaceful and flexible manner.\nSingh had travelled to New York after Prime Minister Sushil Koirala cancelled his visit to the UN headquarters at the last minute due to the ongoing political unrest gripping the Himalayan nation.\n Nepal United Nations India World Also Read Vladimir Putin, Poroshenko discuss measures to restore peace to east Ukraine: Kremlin Hindi, 3 Indian languages find place in Dubai driving tests Barack Obama names new US Secret Service head after scandals Car bombs kill 27 people north of Iraq's capital Baghdad", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/united%20nations_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/united%20nations_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151003/world-neighbours/article/nepal-turns-un-over-obstruction-trade-point-india", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-04T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:07:10.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
