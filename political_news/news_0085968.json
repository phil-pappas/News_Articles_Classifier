(Vision courtesy ABC News 24)\nPT2M42S 620 349 Autoplay On Off Video feedback Video settings Dumped cabinet minister Eric Abetz has emailed Liberal Party members saying he understands why they would feel \"disenfranchised\" by the demotions of conservatives following Tony Abbott's ousting as prime minister.\nIn a letter sent to members at lunchtime Wednesday, Senator Abetz also expressed \"disappointment\" at what he said were a \"hundreds of resignations\" from the Liberal Party since Malcolm Turnbull was reinstated as leader.\nIt is understandable that with the removal of Tony Abbott, Kevin Andrews and myself from the ministry that our core constituency feels disenfranchised.\nBut Senator Abetz's claim of \"hundreds\" of resignations was immediately disputed by the President of the Tasmanian Liberals who said only 7 members had quit and that had been outweighed by 8 new applications to join.\nDumped employment minister Eric Abetz.\n\"While any resignation of any member is regrettable we need to keep a sense of proportion about this given that it is a matter of public record that the Tasmanian Division's membership numbers over 2000,\" President Geoff Page wrote on Facebook.\nAdvertisement The conservative Tasmanian senator promised in the letter to continue to be a \"strong advocate\" for the party's \"grass roots\" from the backbench and urged members against abandoning the cause.\n\"With calls for the formation of a new party and hundreds of resignations from the Liberal Party, I call on members to remain as members of our party,\" he said.\nKevin Andrews, a conservative, was dropped as defence minister. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\n\"The Liberal Party has always been bigger than the person who holds the position of federal leader of the Parliamentary party from time to time.\n\"It is disappointing to hear of a spate of resignations from the Liberal Party and of threats not to renew memberships over the recent federal leadership change in the Liberal Party.\"\nAnd he said those Liberals worried about his demotion would still have their socially conservative views advocated for in the partyroom.\nIllustration: Ron Tandberg.\n\"It is understandable that with the removal of Tony Abbott, Kevin Andrews and myself from the ministry that our core constituency feels disenfranchised and concerned that their views will no longer be heard.\"\n\"I want to assure anyone who subscribes to the values espoused by Menzies that I will continue to be a strong advocate for the grass roots of our cause and what we believe in, albeit from the backbench.\"\nSenator Abetz was axed as employment minister in Mr Turnbull's reshuffle, while Mr Andrews was dropped as defence minister.\nBoth hail from the party's hard-right wing and like Mr Abbott, advocate socially conservative views on issues like gay marriage and the monarchy.\nBut Mr Turnbull also demoted his close friend, the moderate and veteran cabinet minister Ian Macfarlane in, his reshuffle, arguing old hands needed to make way for the government's rising talent.\nSenator Abetz's email is another warning that the conservative right, many of whom feel maligned by the leadership change, will continue to agitate.\nIt comes a day after Mr Abbott warned he would likely stay in Parliament, saying there would be no byelection in his northern Sydney seat of Warringah and that at 57, he was still relatively young for public life.\nHe also urged Liberal supporters to vote for Mr Turnbull even if they did it \"through gritted teeth\".\nMr Abbott has promised there would be \"no sniping,\" and \"no wrecking\" towards the new Coalition government from him.\nJust days after Mr Turnbull replaced Mr Abbott, a sensitive document designed to damage the new leader was leaked to Fairfax Media.\nFollow Latika Bourke on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Latika-M-Bourke-132583706779458/timeline/"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:12:13.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
