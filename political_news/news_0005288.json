These MPs say that there is a breach of natural justice when people who have completed prison sentences are being detained as criminals and threatened with deportation to a country they may well have little connection with. \nThe Committee is concerned for all the affected whƒÅnau and families of New Zealanders being impacted by this policy and also all the people who are being detained in unacceptable conditions in detention camps. \nThe Committee urges the New Zealand Government to proactively advocate for the affected New Zealanders to achieve the same rights that foreign citizens would be extended in New Zealand if they were facing deportation. \nThe Co-Chairs believe the matter is of the utmost urgency and expect the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Australia to immediately work to find a just solution to this intolerable situation. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:24:56.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
