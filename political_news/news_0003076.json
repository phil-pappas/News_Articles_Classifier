What kind of rational dialogue do you expect to have when you argue a position the opposition doesn't hold ? It would be like you saying \"I'm a Christian\" and then me saying \"Yeah, well Islam sucks and Allah's a baby killer!\"... You ever notice how all the criticisms of socialism are directed at authoritarian dictatorships where the leaders' ultimate goal was to attain more power and control and never of successful democratic socialist models like the Scandinavian countries? If you want to hold onto a dying and decaying system designed to enrich a small number of people and impoverish everyone else, be my guest, but you should know any feeling of intellectual superiority you feel is fashioned out of ignorance.

The application of capitalism, however, did elevate the greatest number of people from poverty to prosperity in the history of the world. But we should be convinced that capitalism is a failed economic system because you're not rich too? You have been listening to too many rich Democrats. If you want to improve capitalism, then you should advocate to abolish the regulations enacted for the benefit of cronies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:25:02.150+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
