(Keith Bedford/Reuters) October 25 at 8:13 PM George F. Will’s observation that progressives are Hobbesian was intentionally misleading [“ Judicial restraint is the problem ,” op-ed, Oct. 22]. For Hobbes, limited government exists not to provide for the individual good but to maintain social order. He recognized that the pursuit of the good is the realm of the individual and not the government. He also recognized that no man is an island.\nYes, in this country every individual has the right to practice his or her religion or non-religion of choice (within certain proscribed limits — would Mr. Will permit human sacrifice? Polygamy?). But the Orwellian-termed “religious liberty” cannot include the right to impose your religious views on someone else if those views restrict the individual rights of the other. The right to own, brandish and use a firearm in private or public deprives others of their right to speak freely or practice religious views or see a movie without fear of reprisal or threat to life. The right to exercise political speech cannot include the right to drown out or inhibit the political speech of others simply because you have the means to do so. No man is an island.\nMr. Will holds the Declaration of Independence as the libertarian foundation of our constitutional republic. A better enunciation of inalienable rights is in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1941 State of the Union address : freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. I’ll take that over “Don’t tread on me” as a guiding moral and political principle.\nEric L.
