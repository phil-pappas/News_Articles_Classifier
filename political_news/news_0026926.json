(Russian Defense Ministry Press Service via AP)\nAssociated Press Oct. 12, 2015 | 6:46 a.m. EDT + More BEIRUT (AP) — Activists say Russian jets have intensified their airstrikes in a central Syrian province as government and allied troops push out insurgents from the area.\nThe advance Monday is the latest in a government bid to regain control of areas in the rural parts of Hama, and the Sahl al-Ghab plain. The plain links Hama to the northwestern rebel-controlled Idlib province and Latakia, a government stronghold.\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says 30 airstrikes were reported in Kfar Nabudeh, while government troops and Lebanon's Hezbollah fighters entered from the south.\nDuring the last six days of ground operations, government troops have moved in on two villages in eastern Hama, Atshan and Tal Sukayk, and a third in the plain area. Activists say rebels seized one village south of Idlib.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
