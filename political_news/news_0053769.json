For the past five years, Lancome has partnered with St. Jude through various fundraising efforts and is now elevating and expanding their support. The Moments of Happiness campaign will begin this month and will include regional in-store events with celebrity makeup artist Mickey Williams , an interactive social media \"hand heart\" campaign and nationwide fundraising efforts that will benefit St. Jude throughout the year.\n\"Finding a way to bring moments of happiness to children with life-threatening illnesses and their families, with joy and grace, is a delicate balance,\" says Lancome ambassadress Julia Roberts . \"I applaud the work that Lancome is doing with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.\"\nFrom October 18th to October 24th , the brand will donate $1 directly to St. Jude for every transaction made on Lancome-usa.com and at counters nationwide.
