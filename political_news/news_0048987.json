Recommendations to Ministers are expected by the end of March 2016 and some may need to be included in legislation, if accepted by the Government. \nThe union representatives will be led by Council of Trade Unions representative Helen Kelly. Government agency representatives will be led by Government Chief Talent Officer Andrew Hampton. \nHealth Minister Jonathan Coleman today confirmed the Government will negotiate over pay rates for about 50,000 care and support workers. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:26:41.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
