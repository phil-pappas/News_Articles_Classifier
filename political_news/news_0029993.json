There is a great need for measures to be put in place to allow (asylum-seekers) to arrive in Europe safely,\" she said, referring to perilous boat crossings in the Mediterranean.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:27:05.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
