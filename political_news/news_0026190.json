Selected via a social media contest, a Canadian hockey family and their friends had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to play a game of ball hockey with the 'Great One' at a local outdoor rink.\nGretzky, a Brand and Jumpstart Ambassador with Canadian Tire, is encouraging Canadians to get out and play. The idea is simple – invite Canadians to get outside and be active using the two most inclusive words we know: 'Wanna Play?'\n\"One of the greatest hockey players ever, Wayne Gretzky , is a welcome addition to help Canadian Tire inspire Canadians to live healthy, active lifestyles,\" said TJ Flood, Senior Vice President of Marketing, Canadian Tire. \"We believe that play helps foster fitness, confidence and creativity. It all starts with the simplest act of a neighbourly knock on a front door with an invite to play.\"\nThroughout the summer, 'Wanna Play?' focused on rediscovering the enjoyment of inviting others out to play. Through social media, partners, athletes and influencers shared content outlining how they play and challenged Canadians to do the same. As a hockey legend, coach, mentor and role model, Wayne Gretzky is an inspiration to kids and adults alike.\n\"When I was growing up, the streets were always full of kids – my dad was such a positive influence on me. In surprising Canadians with an invite to play via Canadian Tire, I want parents to realize how inspiring they can be to their children,\" said Wayne Gretzky . \"The more parents play, the more their kids are going to want to participate. And to think it all stemmed from two simple words, 'Wanna Play?'\"\nWith a long history of supporting sport in Canada – from Jumpstart, to community sponsorships, to professional partnerships, sport is in Canadian Tire's DNA. Being active through organized sports and physical activity helps foster important social and development skills in addition to physical benefits. Our commitment to helping Canadian families enjoy life in Canada – from the playground to the podium – is stronger than ever.\nAbout Canadian Tire Corporation\nCanadian Tire Corporation, Limited, (TSX:CTC.A) (TSX:CTC) or \"CTC,\" is a family of businesses that includes a retail segment, a financial services division and CT REIT.
