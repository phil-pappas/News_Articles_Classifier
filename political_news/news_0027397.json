From 2006 to 2010 I have served as assemblyman for the Gbemumu electoral area in New Fadama. I can therefore say that I have lived my entire life here. If there is somebody who lives in his own constituency and runs his business at the same place, it is me and that puts me at a great advantage' he said. \nWith a talent for languages, he is able to communicate with a broad spectrum of the ethnic groupings in the constituency and outside it. 'I speak Hausa, Ewe, Twi, Ga, English and Italian,' he said. \nWith his business venture he has employed 18 persons, the number rising to double that figure when activities are at their peak. \nAs an expert in events logistics, he supplies stages, platforms and other related stuff. He played a major part during the recent preparation of the largest bowl of rice in the world at the independence square. 'I mobilized 300 kids from my area alone to the Independence Square to be fed from the largest bowl of rice. Most of them set foot there for the first time in their lives for which they and their parents were grateful' he said. \nTo his party supporters in the constituency he said 'with a united front we can wrestle the constituency from the incumbent.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:02:25.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
