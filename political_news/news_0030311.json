The explanation for the dismissals was in a letter the Judicial Conduct Board sent last year to Eakin that was made public Friday. The board says Attorney General Kathleen Kane has given it additional emails involving Eakin, which it didn't have in 2014. The board's chief counsel Monday declined to say how many new emails it was given, or whether they're substantially different from what it reviewed in 2014. Eakin apologized last week for insensitive personal emails but said they don't reflect his character. Explicit and pornographic emails involving state prosecutors were uncovered last year as part of Kane's internal review of how the Jerry Sandusky child molestation case was handled.
