(AP) - The president of the New Jersey Senate says he is ready to make a major policy announcement.\nDemocrat Stephen Sweeney has been both an ally and foil to Gov. Chris Christie. They worked together to pass a law that makes public workers contribute more toward their pensions four years ago.\nBut Sweeney has been upset about Christie's decision not to put more state money toward those pensions.\nSweeney's last major policy announcement was a call for the federal government to help with state pensions nationwide.\nSweeney is threatening to send state troopers to gather Republican lawmakers later this week for an override of Christie's veto on a measure that would mandate law enforcement agencies be notified when a potential gun buyer seeks to expunge mental health records.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:54:39.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
