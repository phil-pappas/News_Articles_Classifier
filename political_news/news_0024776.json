The One Bermuda Alliance rejects that suggestion. \n“Minister Fahy had strong objections to the Ombudsman’s report , and he expressed them forcefully, as is his right. He gave perfectly sound reasons for his disagreement. \n“If MP Walton Brown wants a good example of a really contemptuous dismissal of an Ombudsman’s findings, we suggest he read the Hansard report [ PDF ] of the House of Assembly proceedings of 17 March, 2014, starting at page 1700. \n“There, the Leader of his Party, MP Marc Bean, is discussing an Ombudsman’s report that criticised him, as the then Minister of the Environment, for failing to live up to an international treaty to which Bermuda is a signatory, in allowing development of Tucker’s Point to go ahead. \n“MP Marc Bean, on the floor of the House of Assembly, accused the Ombudsman of the day Arlene Brock of intellectual dishonesty and bias, getting her facts wrong and living in an ivory tower. The Ombudsman also complained publicly that she was put under a great deal of pressure by three unnamed ‘high level’ officials to drop her investigation of the Tucker’s Point development. \n” Need we say more?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:17:47.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
