A constitutional renewal now known as the Second Founding, prompted by the bitter and tragic Civil War, saw ratification of three amendments that confirmed the legal equality of all persons born or naturalized as United States citizens.\nThe Second Founding ​ On the 150th anniversary of Reconstruction, The Atlantic presents a digital symposium on the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, and their legacy.\nRead more ​ The Thirteenth Amendment, formally ending slavery, was ratified on December 6, 1865, by all 36 states (the recalcitrant Kentucky, New Jersey, Delaware, and Mississippi had rejected it the first time around). Over the next five years, the states went on to ratify the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, which extended citizenship to former slaves and gave the franchise to them and to all citizens (except women).\nCelebrating the Second Founding brings back into public view, and into public discussion, the ways in which slavery and its aftermath have shaped America’s collective identity. After the revolution, a torturous constitutional accommodation was required for the continuation of slavery. Then came the redemptive moment, in the wake of civil war, when the constitutional frame was corrected and a different future for the country became possible—but not without a hard struggle to move from mere legal emancipation to real freedom and equality.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:21:55.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
