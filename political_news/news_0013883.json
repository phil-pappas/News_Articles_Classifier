Bayern face Arsenal in the Champions League next week.\nWerder had some efforts on goal and tested keeper Manuel Neuer but neither Anthony Ujah nor former Bayern striker Claudio Pizarro, who came on as a late substitute, could find the equaliser. The former German champions are stuck on seven points in 14th place after their fifth consecutive defeat.\nMax Meyer scored a stoppage-time goal to give Schalke 04 a last-gasp 2-1 victory over ten-man Hertha Berlin and keep them firmly in third place on 19 points, one behind Dortmund.\nMax Kruse scored a hat-trick as VfL Wolfsburg, who squandered a two-goal lead, beat Hoffenheim 4-2 in a roller coaster game for their first win in four matches that lifted them to fourth on 15 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:11:38.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
