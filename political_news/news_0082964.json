She is now conscious. She is drowsy. When you ask her, she responds by oral command. We have just given her water to drink and she has consumed it. Her condition is better,\" Dr T P Lahane, Dean of state run J J Hospital told reporters here, adding, \"within 48 hours we will discharge her.\"\n43-year-old Indrani was rushed to JJ hospital from Byculla jail on Friday afternoon in an unconscious condition after she allegedly overdosed on anti-depressant pills. \"We will keep her under observation for the next 24-48 hours,\" said Lahane.\nWife of media baron Peter Mukerjea, Indrani was arrested by Khar Police on August 25 for her alleged role in the murder of Sheena, her daughter from an earlier marriage, in 2012. Indrani's daughter Sheena, 24, was allegedly kidnapped from outside National College in Bandra and strangled to death in a car by Indrani, her former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai.\nAsked about the confusion over two contradictory reports, one saying she has taken an overdose of pills and the other saying this was not found, Lahane said, \"these were two different tests. \"There is one screening test which gives a clue as to how to treat the patient. And the other is the confirmatory test which is only carried out by the forensic laboratory. This reliable and authentic test,\" he said, adding that \"they have got nothing in that test.\nOn whether the report of overdose was wrong, Lahane said, \"Whatever talk of overdose there has been, we can explain it two ways. We did the MRI in which the brain was found to be normal. We did other tests on the basis of clinical findings, on the basis of which diagnosis is done\". Accordingly, suitable treatment was given to her and she has responded. And after responding to it, she is now conscious,\" he said.\nAsked whether she can suffer memory loss, he said,\"This is something only time will tell. Generally, in such cases, there are no chances and I believe that recovery is 90 per cent to 100 per cent.\" Asked why was she brought to the hospital, Lahane wad, \"Clinically, we thought the cause was overdose of medicines and accordingly she was treated and she has responded.\nLahane had on Saturday said a report on Indrani's urine samples from Hinduja Hospital laboratory confirmed that level of benzodiazepine--an anti depressant--was found raised.\n\"Normally if a patient is on antidepressant drug the level of benzodiazepine in urine is 200. But the level of benzodiazepine is 2088 as per the Hinduja report.The report is positive for drug overdose. Anti-epileptic drugs has already been ruled out. The (test) has come negative.It is only the anti-depressant that has caused the thing(collapse),\" he had said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T14:39:53.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
