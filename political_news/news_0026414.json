He really is. I’m not a populist. But I’m a realist.”\nBehind the scenes, his small team of political advisers has been quietly reaching out to Democrats who could join the campaign in senior roles, including State Department official Marie Harf and former Obama campaign guru Paul Tewes.\nBut those doubting he’ll really run have ample evidence, too. The latest sign of wavering came as several people close to Biden said his decision is likely to drag on until later this month, making it highly unlikely he’ll be on stage for the first Democratic primary debate on Oct. 13.\nOne directive from Biden has been clear: His decision will not be rushed, according to several people who have spoken to him in recent days.\nWhile the prospect of running is still real, Biden is in the same place he’s been for weeks: deeply conflicted about his family’s readiness for the rigors of a campaign following his son’s death in May, said the individuals, who requested anonymity.\nBiden has said repeatedly that it will be a family decision, but the individuals said Biden has yet to hold a formal family sit-down to make a final call.\nAmid the mixed signals, Democrats awaiting his decision say each day that passes leads to more skepticism that he’d have enough time to mount a competitive bid. David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Obama, said Biden has “ceded a long head start to others,” and making up for lost time gets harder and harder each day.\n“His bet is that disaffection with Hillary [Rodham Clinton] will allow him to peel away some of her donors and operatives,” Axelrod said. “He’s a well-liked figure within the party, but unless she flat-out collapses — which I don’t foresee — he would have his work cut out for him.”\nHarf, a senior adviser for strategic communications to Secretary of State John Kerry, has been in contact with Biden’s team about a top communications job, people familiar with the planning said. She was deeply involved with the Iran nuclear negotiations, including the effort to line up votes from skeptical lawmakers, and also worked on Obama’s re-election.\nTewes ran Obama’s campaign in Iowa in 2008, winning accolades for Obama’s dramatic victory in the caucuses in which he defeated both Biden and Clinton.\n“The vice president is the only person who could get in the race at this juncture and have a real shot, but of course, time is of the essence,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a former political adviser to Obama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:09:48.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
