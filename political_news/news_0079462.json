The party’s ex Minister for Transport said he wishes he had retired prior to the 2007 general election, and admitted that the subsequent Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition made decisions that were “horrendous for people”. “Those three years [2008-2011]were horrendous for everybody. Decisions that I was involved in and partaking in were horrendous for people,” he told RTÉ Radio. “There isn’t a day that passes that that doesn’t, in some form or another, come back... to haunt [me]. “There was nobody either in the political system, in the civil service, or apparently in the banking or regulatory authorities that knew exactly where everything was or what was going on,” he added, referring to the atmosphere of confusion which reigned at the time. He revealed that he had no idea that bailout negotiations with the EU, ECB and IMF were ongoing despite assertions to the contrary made by him and cabinet colleague Dermot Ahern during an infamous 2010 interview, and decried the Irish electoral system which continues to foster “all that’s bad” in politics.
