Climate change , drought and other disasters, shifting energy landscapes, population growth , urbanization , GMOs, changes in the workforce , automation â€” these are just a handful of the factors that affect the global access to food.\nWe'd all like to see a future in which people worldwide have a sufficient amount of safe and nutritious food to help them maintain healthy and active lives. Is this realistic in our lifetimes?\nTo borrow a phrase, artificial intelligence is eating the world, and it can help move us closer to this future of abundant food. Neil Jacobstein, Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Co-Chair at Singularity University , explains what AI can do for the future of food, as part of a video series on food as a Global Grand Challenge.\n[image courtesy of Shutterstock]", "external_links": ["http://singularityu.org/bio/neil-jacobstein/"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:30:28.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
