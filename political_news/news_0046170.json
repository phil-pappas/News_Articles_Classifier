The push for participation over quality will have long term consequences for children’s education – particularly those who are vulnerable.” \nends NZEI Te Riu Roa \nNew Zealand Educational Institute \nNZEI Te Riu Roa members work in every community in New Zealand, leading and advocating for quality public education.
