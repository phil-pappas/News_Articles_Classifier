It's only fitting we announce Project Anqa here in Berlin , which has such a long and rich tradition of archaeology and heritage preservation.\"\nCyArk and ICOMOS, a non-governmental, global organization dedicated to the conservation and protection of cultural heritage sites, will work with local experts in the Middle East to record cultural landmarks using reality-capture technologies such as 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, and traditional survey. Scan results from Ziggurat of Ur in Iraq , the first Anqa site digitally captured, were unveiled today at CyArk's summit in Berlin .\n\"CyArk's summit provides a critical forum for discussions on progress and issues facing the global preservation and conservation movement,\" said Gustavo Araoz , president, ICOMOS and chair of the CyArk 500 Advisory Council. \"While turmoil in the Middle East demands immediate attention, this is a long-term and evolving effort to ensure we secure and share our collective history.\"\nCyArk 500 Challenge Gathers Momentum\nAt a gathering of more than 250 foreign ambassadors, government officials, cultural representatives, and corporate executives representing 35 countries at the Berlin State Library, CyArk unveiled this year's historical sites officially added to the CyArk 500 Challenge, its international campaign to digitally preserve 500 heritage sites in five years.\nIn the two years since the launch of the 500, one-third of the slots have been assigned with projects approved by an international council of advisors. Working with governments and local partners, CyArk has completed scans for almost 20 percent of its overall goal. Recently completed projects include the Brandenburg Gate ( Germany ), Ancient Corinth ( Greece ) and the Ziggurat of Ur ( Iraq ).\nThe data collected at each location generates accurate blue prints that can be used to rebuild a site if damage or destruction occurs. Millions of people can virtually experience the digital monuments via a data library on CyArk's website. Today, nearly 100 sites are available for the public and educators to experience free virtual tours, 3D models and educational lesson plans.\nData Management Challenge Grows\nAs progress towards the 500 continues, CyArk is also adding storage infrastructure to ensure the protection of, and continued access to, a staggering amount of digital information.\nIt takes about 10,000 gigabytes of data, or the equivalent of 200 trucks of paper, to digitally preserve each site. To manage this tremendous amount of data from field work to an archive, CyArk relies on its partnership with leading companies in the technology industry.\nFor example, Seagate Technology is now providing CyArk with cutting-edge enterprise storage drives, business NAS systems and rugged mobile hard drives that capture, centralize and archive massive data files. Seagate's technology helps CyArk provide a \"museum of the future,\" in which millions of people around the world get the opportunity to virtually experience the world's historical sites in interactive and engaging ways.\nIn addition, Iron Mountain Incorporated is protecting and preserving digital scans of each monument, archiving the data in a highly-secure underground records and data storage facility in western Pennsylvania , U.S. Located 220 feet underground in a former limestone mine, the facility is home to other important and priceless information assets and cultural collections, including rare photo collections and historical documents.\nCyArk requests the nomination of additional sites for preservation and the pledging of funds towards its 500 Challenge through donations via the organization's website .\nAbout CyArk\nCyArk is an international nonprofit organization that uses 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, and traditional survey techniques to create an online, 3D library of the world's cultural heritage sites before they are lost to natural disasters, destroyed by human aggression, or ravaged by the passage of time. Spurred by the Taliban's destruction of the 1600 year-old Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan , CyArk was founded in 2003 to ensure that the world's collective heritage is available to future generations, while also making it uniquely accessible today.\nCyArk works with cultural and technology experts to record and generate 3D, engineering-grade data of heritage sites. The data can be converted into highly accurate documentation drawings for conservation efforts; realistic visualizations for education and interpretation; and interactive, narrative virtual experiences. Data from every heritage site scanned is stored in perpetuity in CyArk's \"Digital Ark\" and is accessible to the public for free on CyArk's website, www.cyark.org . To date, CyArk has digitally preserved nearly 200 heritage sites, such as Pisa , Pompeii, Easter Island , Babylon, Mount Rushmore and the Brandenburg Gate.\nMedia Contact Information\nU.S.\nCassie Batinich\n1-952-346-6073\ncassie.batinich@creation.io\nEurope\nSebastian Duering\n49 151 58 20 43 09\nsduering@creation.io\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278313\n releases/cyark-to-digitally-preserve-at-risk-heritage-sites-in-syria-the-middle-east-300162248.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.seagate.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cyark-to-digitally-preserve-at-risk-heritage-sites-in-syria-the-middle-east-300162248.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278313", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151019/278313", "http://www.cyark.org/", "http://www.ironmountain.com/", "http://www.icomos.org/en/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG32245&Transmission_Id=201510200300PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG32245&DateId=20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:49.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
