In the longer-term we want the government to understand the value and importance of guidance counselling in schools and to resource that aspect of the education system to ensure safe practice.” \nSome counsellors are in schools with a ratio of one counsellor to 1,000+ students. \nMost counsellors are usually working with more than 40-50 students a week and while the problems students experience may not be created at school, they manifest themselves there, and they affect a student’s ability – and willingness – to learn. \n“We see adequate resourcing of guidance counsellors as a vital investment in a successful education system.” \nThe how to guide was produced with assistance from the Ministry of Education.
