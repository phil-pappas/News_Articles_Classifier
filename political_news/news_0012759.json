Suddenly all concepts are new, politicians’ promises make sense, cynicism falls away, and you can face the future with the smiling fresh- faced complacency of a vacant idiot. Or David Cameron. \nCameron really is the ideal Tory. Seeing his honest-looking face glossing over complex problems as if fixing the kitchen waste-pipe gives out an air of can-do dad-like pragmatism. \nHe’s the modern version of the jolly English squire, too rich to be troubled by the anxieties of the rest of us, too limited in intelligence to be bothered by moral dilemmas, too comfortable in his skin to do more than peer without comprehension into the struggles of those beneath him as if gazing at the carp in his pond. \nHe breezes in, encourages everyone to keep calm, cheer up, keep up the good work, put your best foot forward, then – like squires everywhere – leaves the dirty work to others. This would include getting the rent in, dispensing justice, evicting trouble-makers and ensuring that the Big House needn’t be vexed by nuisances. \nIn the meantime he says the things he hopes to be true, waves the Union Jack, and like a true dilettante plans what he’ll do after taking his entitled turn in the Chair. \nAround him cleverer and more ruthless politicians (who wouldn’t dream of retiring until they died) circle like hungry sharks. Theresa May plays the new Iron Lady, full of hard-edged vowels and meaningful stares while dishing out the racist stuff backwoods Tories long to hear. \nShe’s doomed to disappointment, lacking that elemental ability to terrify that was Mrs Thatcher’s greatest asset, just a paper tiger playing rough. \nFrom the other wing lumbers big Boris, still wearing his clown hair and calculated bumbling delivery. The boyish looks and jovial image are fading fast and though he’s a serious and dangerous contender it’s likely that by 2020 he’ll reveal the ice-cold heart he’s always hidden and propose an agenda so right-wing that the country will recoil. \nPlaying the part of Cassius is George Osborne, the ultimate man-in-a-suit, the visual opposite of Boris’s haphazard schmutter. \nMr Osborne appears to have no discernible human qualities, his smile is a thing of terror, and you can’t imagine him going through an airport metal-detector without a small forest of hidden knives and daggers setting off the alarms. \nHidden in the undergrowth are dreamers like Michael Gove, playing Ernst Blofeld or for older readers The Mekon, a vast and twisted brain on a tiny body. \nBut the real outside runners are all female: the straight-talking Northern Nicky Morgan, the ambitious Justine Greening, media savvy Liz Truss and even impressive Scot Ruth Davidson – assuming Scotland is still with us by 2020. \nBut what they and any other aspiring Tories need is my Patent Memory Wipe. All their current policies and articles of belief are as retro as a lava-lamp, and the only way to present them anew is to forget the fact that they’ve already failed every possible test. \nFor example: \nThe Free Market – a Thatcher initiative designed to remove the restrictions and regulations which once held our greediest and most heartless in check, and resulted in our current hapless bankruptcy. \nSocial Housing – dirty words to Tory ears, who are more likely to own properties than seek them, currently basking in their ability to let them out for ever increasing sums and turf out anyone who complains at short notice. While hammering the last nails in social housing’s coffin, Mr Cameron sang of the joys of home ownership that thousands of the younger generation will never know. \nPrivatisation – that’s done well hasn’t it? Chaotic railways, electricity suppliers who don’t know where the next joule is coming from, massive water bills, a mindless bull-headed lump of dogma now ruining a school and a hospital near you. \nUnregulated employment – the ‘creation’ of ‘jobs’ which don’t provide any predictable income, don’t have any security, don’t have any rights, and crucially don’t make anyone a living or even feed their kids. \nWelfare – the ABC principle, Always Be Cutting, even though short-term cuts inevitably lead to long-term misery, poverty, family breakdown, ill health, homelessness and other iniquities which cost us so much more in the long run. \nThose are just a few of the lessons of the past for which Tory hopefuls must develop complete amnesia. \nThey don’t work, they never will, we’ve seen their bitter fruits, and yet somehow these are the flags under which nice David and his successors will boldly go into the future. \nMemory Wipe for sale, ready now – form an orderly queue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:43:56.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
