Additional photos below. Facebook This morning, the Colorado Springs Police Department formally identified the woman who died in an October 16 homicide as 32-year-old Fawn Christine Gianes.\nHowever, the victim's sister, Krystal Wielichowski, asked KRDO-TV in the Springs to refer to her by her maiden name and put the word \"Gianes\" in parentheses.\n\"She's a Wielichowski,\" Krystal told the station from her home in Missouri, adding, \"That man murdered her,\"\n\"That man\" is Nikoas Gianes, Fawn's husband. He's been arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder.\nKVOR.com identifies Nikoas as a onetime El Paso County sheriff's deputy, and that seems to be confirmed by his Linkedin page, which also references a military background, as seen in the following screen capture.\nLinkedin There are plenty of other images of Nikoas and Fawn on her Facebook page, which remains online at this writing.\nHere's one example\nFacebook Related Stories Danielle Griego Killed After Domestic Violence Episode the Previous Night (14) ...as well as a shot of the couple with their family, which we're sharing since the children are seen from the back, thereby disguising their identities.\nFacebook Unfortunately, such idyllic imagery appears to have hidden some dark secrets.\n\"There has been suspicion of abuse, there have been prior incidents, but none to this extent,\" Krystal told KRDO, adding that when she heard the news about the shooting, \"it was numbing, I thought it was a cruel joke. I didn't know what was happening. I hit the floor.\"\nWhat took place?\nAt around 7:31 p.m. on Friday the 16th, according to the CSPD, officers were dispatched to a home on the 5300 block of Babcock Place on a report of shots fired.\nUpon their arrival, they found a woman later identified as Fawn. She was dead from an apparent gunshot wound.\nA Facebook portrait of Fawn Wielichowski. Facebook Nikoas was taken into custody shortly thereafter.\nHe is being held without bond in the El Paso County Criminal Justice Center.\nIn the meantime, a GoFundMe page has been launched under the title \" Bring Fawn Wielichowski Home .\" The introduction reads:\nFawn Christine Wielichowski was a loving mother of 2 beautiful children. She brought great joy to many of us with her fun loving attitude and her ability to make us laugh. She was tragically taken from us in a way that no one ever should be.
