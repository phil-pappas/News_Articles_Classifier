Promoted stories \nAccording to the registration website, “everyone” who supports the Tories can get a vote if an online form is filled out. \nThe site states: “In the past, it’s only been the members of political parties who have had a say in candidate rankings. But this time, the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party is doing things differently. We want all our supporters in every corner of Scotland to have their say.” \nIn a communication to members, Davidson described the system as “the biggest exercise in popular democracy every undertaken by a political party in Scotland”. \nIt is understood the new scheme is aimed at involving the tens of thousands of voters who are part of the Conservative Friends of the Union, a group set up by the Scottish Tories ahead of the referendum. \nBallots will go out in November to supporters and members. \nHowever, one party insider said: “It is a good idea in principle, but there must be robust checks in place to stop manipulation and infiltration. We don’t want a winter of publicity like Labour got with its flawed system.” \nAn SNP spokesperson said: “Given that in the general election the Tories received their lowest share of the vote in Scotland since the introduction of universal suffrage, it's no wonder they are trying to come up with half-baked ideas to boost their flagging membership - but copying Labour's shambolic plans probably isn't the best idea.” Share article \nA spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: \"Everyone who registers to take part will be asked to confirm that they are a Conservative supporter and be checked against the electoral register to ensure they are who they say they are. \n\"We are confident our internal checks will root out those seeking to lie and pretend to be a Scottish Conservative supporter and abuse the process.” Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:40:38.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
