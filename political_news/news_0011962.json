Republican Mayor John van Keuren and Democrat Bruce Packer are vying for the four-year mayoral term. \nIn a lively forum Wednesday night, the two tickets outlined their respective visions for the borough's future. About 85 people attended the event, sponsored by the League of Women Voters. Audience members submitted questions on cards, then watched candidates spar over issues including parking, the promotion of affordable housing and government transparency. \nBut divisions were sharpest when candidates spoke about how they would handle the borough's police department and its embattled administration, particularly Police Chief Fred Stahman. \nStahman came under criticism after the suspensions and subsequent reinstatements of two popular officers this year, as well as the August arrest and criminal charges against Detective Sgt. Eric Reamy for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to two underage girls. \nDemocrats called for change in the top brass. Morieko, a paralegal specializing in municipal law, stated bluntly, \"the administration has to go,\" but Republicans generally favored a more cautious approach. \n\"We allowed them to suspend — without pay and benefits — two of our finest officers for an offense that was not of an egregious matter … and we had Detective Sgt. Reamy running amok doing awful things to children,\" Morieko said. \"We need to learn from our mistakes, rebuild and move forward.\" \nBut van Keuren, seeking his fourth term as mayor, said the issue is \"more complex\" than his opponents make it sound. \n\"The mayor and council can't just step in and say: 'You're fired.' There has to be a case built up. And that has been one of the major problems. … You can't just start your own investigation,\" van Keuren said. \nMany candidates touched on the related issue of transparency, with Democrats calling for an increase as Republicans defended their openness during recent controversies. \nOrseck, a human resources-business partner at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, said the council had been \"as transparent as we can possibly be.\" \n\"It's just so hard to explain to the people [that] 'we cannot say this,' or 'we cannot share this,' \" Orseck said. \nBut Huisking, a former corporate CEO and current business professor at Bergen Community College, said although legal constraints do exist regarding what council members can tell the public, council members are often afraid to question \"what the actual statutes say — and more importantly, what is the case law that supports those statutes.\" \nHuisking also suggested using social media to establish a better rapport with the public, calling it a way to learn \"what's going on out there, what the people are thinking.\" \nHow to increase tax ratables and raise revenues without raising taxes also was a central concern, and candidates proposed a variety of remedies. \nOrseck suggested construction of a parking garage and new apartments to bring in residents, and Packer, an actuary, proposed construction of a transit village at 175 Rock Road, where a small shopping center with a CVS Pharmacy and handful of storefronts now sits. \nBut Bourne, a former workplace operations director at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said there were hurdles to redeveloping the parcel, which is private property. \n\"They're not going to give us the property, and we can't tell them what to do with it,\" Bourne said. \"It's great to say we're going to put this stuff up, but you have to actually sit down with a plan. … It takes a lot more than just the rhetoric we're hearing up here to make those things happen.\" \nMorieko favored high-density housing \"in the appropriate places,\" citing the increases in tax revenue those developments bring. Husking concurred but said high-density buildings should fit \"into the character of the town.\" \nVan Keuren said there were \"some opportunities\" for residential development in the central business district, and the council would be discussing the subject soon. \nEmail: janoski@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:56:02.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
