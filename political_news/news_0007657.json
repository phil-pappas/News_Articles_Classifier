Ortega | Getty Images Jennifer Lawrence Lawrence's \"Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co-Stars?\" appeared in Tuesday's edition of Lena Dunham's newsletter , Lenny.\n\"When the Sony [email] hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than [male co-stars], I didn't get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself,\" she wrote. \"I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn't want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two [movie] franchises, I don't need.\"\nMore from NBC News:\nWill your relationship last?

I didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled.'\"\nStill, she suspected she wasn't the only woman who faced these problems on a fundamental level. \"Are we socially conditioned to behave this way?\" she asked. \"We've only been able to vote for what, 90 years? … Could there still be a lingering habit of trying to express our opinions in a certain way that doesn't 'offend' or 'scare' men?\"\nA photo posted by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Oct 13, 2015 at 10:10am PDT\nLawrence lamented that even basic conversations face double standards in a workplace setting.\n\"A few weeks ago at work, I spoke my mind and gave my opinion in a clear and no-[nonsense] way; no aggression, just blunt,\" she wrote. \"The man I was working with (actually, he was working for me) said, 'Whoa! We're all on the same team here!' As if I was yelling at him. I was so shocked because nothing that I said was personal, offensive, or, to be honest, wrong. All I hear and see all day are men speaking their opinions, and I give mine in the same exact manner, and you would have thought I had said something offensive.\"\nShe concluded that she's done seeking an \"adorable\" way to share her opinion while trying to stay likable.\n‹ Are viral sports GIFs violating 'fair use'?

It's just heard. … I wasn't completely wrong when another leaked Sony email revealed a producer referring to a fellow lead actress in a negotiation as a 'spoiled brat.' For some reason, I just can't picture someone saying that about a man.\"\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Dunham's Instagram account hailed Lawrence for sharing her \"brave and beautiful essay.\"", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/8ySE4Fi1Hm/", "http://www.today.com/popculture/sony-hack-paralyzes-hollywood-more-revelations-1D80366280", "http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=a5b04a26aae05a24bc4efb63e&id=64e6f35176&e=fe292e1416#wage", "http://www.today.com/home/church-gets-divine-transformation-family-home-t49766", "http://www.today.com/series/morning-routine/steal-morning-habits-worlds-most-successful-people-t46026", "http://www.today.com/health/will-your-relationship-last-your-credit-score-may-hold-answer-t49116"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:51:22.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
