First Alert, the most trusted name in home safety and the company that developed the first residential smoke alarm in 1964, is releasing three new alarms offering 10 years of protection – including the first-ever commercially available photoelectric and ionization dual-sensor smoke alarm with a 10-year, sealed battery.\nThe First Alert 10-Year Alarm Life Dual Sensor Smoke & Fire Alarm incorporates Smart Sensing Technology to deliver maximum home protection from any type of fire. The 10-year battery and dual photoelectric and ionization sensors meet both consumer demand and expert recommendations for optimal home fire safety, offering the highest level of protection against both smoldering and fast-flaming fires and rendering battery removal and replacement a thing of the past.\nThe National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and other local and national safety advocates recommend having dual-sensor alarms because they provide the best potential for early detection of all types of common household fires while reducing the number of non-emergency or nuisance alarms.\n\"We value safety, but it's in our nature to take certain things for granted. That's why First Alert makes it a priority to provide fire safety products that require minimal maintenance but provide maximum protection,\" said Tom Russo , vice president of marketing for First Alert. \"With our new 10-year dual-sensor alarm, we've covered all bases in one revolutionary package.\"\nDistinguishing this alarm from other dual-sensor offerings is its power source – a non-removable, 10-year battery sealed into the device.\nFirst Alert has introduced two other alarms offering 10-year protection. First Alert's 10-year sealed battery Atom alarm packs all the power of an advanced photoelectric smoke alarm into a miniature, minimalist design. And on the CO front, the First Alert 10-Year Alarm Life Sealed Battery Compact Carbon Monoxide Alarm is brand's first solely battery-powered 10-year CO alarm with a digital display that shows detected CO levels in parts per million.\nFor more information, visit the First Alert website at http://www.firstalert.com .\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-smoke-alarms-score-a-10-in-safety-300157133.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7653651-first-alert-10-year-alarm/gallery/image/832617b7-e4f1-4bb9-b612-f3a970148055.HR.jpg", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=MM23243&Transmission_Id=201510090800PR_NEWS_USPR_____MM23243&DateId=20151009", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.firstalert.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-smoke-alarms-score-a-10-in-safety-300157133.html", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7653651-first-alert-10-year-alarm/gallery/image/81614f3c-21a5-4f15-b482-2288f73c6ad5.HR.jpg", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7653651-first-alert-10-year-alarm/", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7653651-first-alert-10-year-alarm/gallery/image/8ddfb352-b02a-40bf-8002-86662b025185.HR.jpg", "http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7653651-first-alert-10-year-alarm/gallery/image/7ca280bc-ee4d-49e4-a33b-8392a9002f83.HR.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:39:31.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
