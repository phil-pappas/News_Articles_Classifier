Cut to Drake, dancing all slinky and moody in a variety of pastel-colored and sparsely-decorated spaceship interiors for the rest of the track. And, uh, yeah, that's pretty much it. It's extremely Drake.\nDoes Drake like to cha cha?

Of course, that's all a sideshow to watching the man himself alternately bob, shimmy, and shuffle across the screen, taking a break occasionally to grimace passive aggressively at the camera.\nIt's hypnotic, sometimes (unintentionally?) funny, and generally a performance you can't take your eyes off, providing an easy answer to the question posed at the top of this article: yes, Drake is a good dancer.", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/j0ovsXjQJg/", "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6731094/drake-hotline-bling-dance-cha-cha-music-video", "http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/james-turrell-retrospective"], "published": "2015-10-20T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:28:07.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
