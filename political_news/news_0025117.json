Morgan Carroll will challenge Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman for Colorado's 6th Congressional District. (Photo: Wikipedia) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDENVER (AP) - Democrat Morgan Carroll says she raised $377,000 in her first three months as a candidate in a suburban Denver congressional district. \nCarroll is challenging Republican Rep. Mike Coffman, who is serving his fourth term. The district includes Aurora and some of Denver's southeastern suburbs. \nCarroll's fundraising trailed the incumbent. Coffman reported raising about $475,000 in the third quarter of the year, which ended Sept. 30. \nCarroll's haul also puts her behind a Democrat she could face in the primary. Physician Perry Haney has loaned himself $1 million, though it's not clear what sort of challenge he'll put up to the former Senate president. \nFull details on the candidates' fundraising won't be available until after they're reported to federal election authorities later this week. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
