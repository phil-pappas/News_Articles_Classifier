Now he's on Team Rubio.\nRoy, a conservative health care policy wonk who initially backed former Texas Gov. Rick Perry's ill-fated campaign, on Monday announced that he'll be advising Rubio on policy, saying in a tweet , \"No candidate expresses — and embodies — the American dream better.\"\nRoy's past words about Rubio's policy haven't been as glowing.\nOne target has been the freshman senator's criticism of Obamacare's use of \"bailouts\" for insurers — shorthand for a complicated mechanism meant to provide cash to insurers who cover sicker, costlier patients than they expected to as a result of the health care law. Just this month, Rubio took credit for putting constraints on the program, which he derided as a \"crony capitalist bailout program.\"\nRoy, whose Forbes blog regularly features substantive takedowns of Obamacare and also the thin Republican proposals to replace it, has rejected that characterization of the Obamacare provision. He notes the mechanism was meant to coax risk-averse companies to offer new insurance plans to people getting covered under the health care law.\n“It’s not an insurance company bailout if it’s the government that’s messing up the health insurance market, right?\" Roy wondered in an appearance on CNBC last year. \"The insurers are just trying to do their job.”\nRoy similarly delivered some light knocks on Rubio's Obamacare replacement framework back in April, writing on his blog that \"there are a few things he’d need to tighten up in order to achieve real entitlement reform.\"\n2016\nLife in top tier tests Rubio By Daniel Strauss\nRoy's move comes a day before former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is set to roll out his Obamacare replacement proposal. Rubio released his own Obamacare strategy in a POLITICO op-ed in August.\nIt hasn't just been health care that Roy has zeroed in on. In May, while working on Perry's campaign, he wrote a piece for Forbes' health care policy blog that slammed a provision in the tax plan laid out by Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee as \"a multitrillion-dollar effort at social engineering.\"\nThe provision, a new child tax credit of $2,500, is an \"effort to use the tax code to encourage more Americans to make babies,\" Roy wrote. He added that the credit might not actually lead parents to have more children the way it's meant to and could actually make the tax code more progressive and possibly increase the deficit dramatically over the next decade.\nHis overall assessment wasn't so harsh, though. He said there is \"a lot of good stuff\" in the overall plan, such as cleaning up loopholes in the federal corporate tax code, and he said it was worth analyzing in the first place because Rubio is \"one of the most attractive contenders in the 2016 presidential race.\"\nRoy referred all questions to the Rubio campaign. Rubio campaign communications director Alex Conant said, \"Avik is going to be a volunteer adviser for our campaign. We appreciate his support of Marco's agenda for a new American Century.\"\nRoy's move to Rubio isn't the first significant policy-wonk get the campaign has gotten. Lanhee Chen, the former policy director for Mitt Romney, joined Rubio as a policy adviser in September. Other big names on the right for health care policy — including Tevi Troy and Doug Holtz-Eakin — remain neutral.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2015/04/14/marco-rubio-pledges-to-repeal-and-replace-obamacare-but-with-what/", "http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000236251", "https://twitter.com/Avik/status/653542923535953920", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2015/05/06/the-flaw-in-marco-rubios-tax-reform-plan-social-engineering/"], "published": "2015-10-12T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:11:07.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
