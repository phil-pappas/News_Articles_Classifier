County supervisors to spend $15M on homeless housing programs", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously agreed Tuesday to spend $15 million to fund housing programs for the county’s homeless.\nThe plan, authored by Supervisors Mark Ridley-Thomas and Michael Antonovich, will create and fund:\n• A rapid rehousing program, which provides temporary rental assistance subsidies and services, for single adults;\n• Prevention activities for those “on the brink” of becoming homeless,\n• Continued rapid rehousing services for families with children through the end of the fiscal year\n“It is my belief that immediate investment will make a marked difference in the lives of these individuals,” Ridley-Thomas said.\nThe funding will come from $51 million set aside last month to fund services for the homeless created by surplus revenue in the last fiscal year’s budget. The board has a total of $101 million in this year’s budget to combat homelessness.\nThe county’s Chief Executive Office has undertaken a planning process — in the form of 18 public policy meetings — with county department heads, representatives from the county’s 88 cities, experts and other stakeholders to make recommendations early next year to the board on how to allocate the money.\nThe board’s action is one of several plans the supervisors rolled out after marking homelessness a priority. Two weeks ago, the board agreed to open winter shelters six weeks early in advance of the predicted El Niño conditions .\nThe board also voted last week to spend $600,000 on services for homeless persons identified in “hot spots” in the South Bay and portions of the Harbor Area.\n“The county is rolling out a long-term program related to homelessness. It often looks disjointed. It is not,” Supervisor Sheila Kuehl said. “It is actually an identification of the various ways in which we must work together in the county.”\nHomeless advocates praised the board’s action. Funding for rapid rehousing programs for families with children under age 6 would have expired in March. The board’s action extends funding through June 30.\nThe board also created and funded a rapid rehousing program for single adults who are not chronically homeless.\nOrlando Ward of Volunteers of America Greater Los Angeles said rapid rehousing was a “effective, compassionate and smart tool” that allows families to regain “stability and health.”\nAdvertisement About the Author Reach the author at sarah.favot@langnews.com or follow Sarah on Twitter: @sarahfavot .\nFull bio and more articles by Sarah Favot Back to top", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/sarahfavot", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=149"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:53:12.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
