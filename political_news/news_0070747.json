Most congressional efforts to retool the statute have been Republican drives to repeal it or scale it back that Democrats have blocked. \nCurrently, the health law defines small businesses as those having up to 50 employees. That number expands on January 1 to 100. \nThe bill approved Thursday would keep the small business definition at 50 workers but let states increase the number if they choose. \nUnder current law, companies considered small businesses must offer certain required benefits. Business groups complained that increasing the number of firms classified as small businesses would increase health care costs for many employers whose benefits today are less generous. \nWhen Democrats pushed the health care overhaul through Congress in 2010, they believed that increasing the number of companies classified as small businesses would help stabilize that insurance market by adding additional customers. \nThe Senate sent the bill to Obama by a voice vote. It was sponsored by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Tim Scott, R-S.C. \nIt passed by voice vote Monday in the House, where the sponsor was Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky.
