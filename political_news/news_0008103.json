The retired neurosurgeon has surged to the top of early-state and national polls, but has recently found himself defending a series of controversial comments, including one recently in which he suggested that the Holocaust could have been lessened if citizens had been armed .\nAdelson, a Las Vegas casino magnate, gave more money to Republican groups than any other donor in 2012 and is one of the most sought-after givers for the 2016 cycle. His top political priority has been maintaining U.S. support of Israel.\nCarson spokesman Doug Watts confirmed that the candidate has \"no plans at this time\" to attend the event. He did not immediately respond to a question as to why Carson planned to skip it.\n\"All the candidates are invited and those who want to show that they care about the Republican Jewish community are expected to attend,\" said the Republican close to the group.\nRead More The 2016 Presidential Candidates Forum in Washington will feature some candidates perceived by some Jewish leaders as more hostile to the Zionist group's mission, like Sen. Rand Paul and businessman Donald Trump. Carson's absence at the winter forum is somewhat surprising given his fresh attention to Israel -- he visited Israel in December and told The Associated Press there that he was open to countries like Egypt clearing territory for a future Palestinian state.\nThe group's board features several of the Republican party's top megadonors, including Adelson and New York hedge funder Paul Singer.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4605691,00.html", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:56:13.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
