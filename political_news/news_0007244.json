Mums whose partner also works will lose £1,200 a year between the two of them on average, the Resolution Foundation has calculated.\nAnd Mr Osborne’s plan to increase the minimum wage to £7.20 a hour next year will not compensate for the losses.\nThe analysis shows that a single parent working full-time on the minimum wage will get a £700 pay rise in 2016 as a result of the new living wage ­– but will still find themselves £1,500 worse off overall because of cuts to in-work support.\nThe Foundation recently published figures showing around 100,000 working families will be pushed below the poverty line next April when the cuts come into force.\nTax credits victim: nursery manager Kelly Ward will be £1,800 a year worse off\nShadow Work and Pensions Secretary Owen Smith MP said Ms Dorrell had spoken for the millions of families “who are being hit by the Tories’ grossly unfair tax credits cuts.”\nHe added: “So many of the 3 million or so working people affected, feel the same passionate anger, despair and sense of betrayal by the Tories, knowing that they are set to lose an average of £1,350 a year from April.\n“Instead of helping make sure work pays, the Tories are punishing people for doing the right thing.\n\"They are taking huge amounts from working families, many of whom are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\"That’s why the country has seen through the Tory spin, they know their attempts to pose as the party for working people is little more than a cruel joke.\n“The new research showing that mothers are going to be hardest hit by these tax credit cuts, sadly doesn’t come as a surprise.\n\"Since this government came to power in 2010 it’s been women who have lost the most as a result of the cuts and the latest round will have a devastating impact on family finances.\n\"While the combined measures in George Osborne’s miserable 2015 Budget, will push a further 600,000 children in to poverty by 2020.”\nSwept under carpet: George Osborne is accused of hiding the real figures\nHis comments came as Mr Osborne was accused of trying to hide the impact of tax credits cuts after producing a report which failed to show how poorer families will be hit.\nTory MP Andrew Tyrie, the chair of the Treasury select committee, yesterday sent a second letter to the Chancellor demanding a full breakdown of the figures.\nMatthew Whittaker, Chief Economist at the Resolution Foundation said: “Cuts to tax credits next April will leave millions of working families worse off, with women set to face the brunt of these losses.\n“Many mums in working families are set to lose in excess of £1,000 a year. And it will be extremely difficult to recover these losses through work, because many will keep just 20p of every extra pound they earn.\n“The Chancellor must look to ease the pain of the cuts to in-work support in the upcoming Spending Review.”\nA Treasury spokesman said: “We’re offering a new settlement for the British people, one that will create a higher wage, lower tax and lower welfare economy.\n“Our welfare reforms are fair and necessary, taking tax credit spending back to 2008 levels, and most working households better off once they have all come into force.\n\"Two thirds of the 2.7 million people who directly benefit from the new National Living Wage are women, as are over half of those taken out of tax altogether by increases to the income tax personal allowance by 2017-18.”\nTax credits How the changes will affect you Watch: Tearful Question Time plea My question at PMQs Single mum's tears 8million families lose out Strivers who suffer Living wage won't solve it Cameron's broken promise\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201510/2221/4221396001_4561651648001_4561311179001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/JBeattieMirror"], "published": "2015-10-17T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:58:54.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
