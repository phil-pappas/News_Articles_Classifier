This polished, energetic production, which runs at the Overture Center’s Playhouse through Oct. 25, is a shorter version of the Broadway musical aimed at younger audiences. It’s a tuneful romp into an alternative universe where an ugly misfit and a feisty heroine choose to live happily ever after. \nAs Shrek, Dan Jajewski fills the Playhouse with his strong baritone, also contributing nice harmonies to his donkey sidekick and his love, Fiona. His version of the grumpy ogre, hampered by a headpiece that resembles an ill-fitting bathing cap, is world-weary but one-dimensional. By contrast, Sherrick Robinson, who plays Donkey, threatens to steal every scene. He channels Eddie Murphy’s fast-talking style, delivering the funniest lines in the show. Mari Borowski delivers a thoroughly charming performance as the newly freed Fiona. A Disney-esque princess with a clear soprano and loads of sass, she carries the emotional heart of the story. Young performers Fiona King, as a sprightly Peter Pan, and Flynn Marcus, as a whiny Pinocchio, shine in small, featured roles. Lily Mefford and Saskia den Boon also captivate as younger versions of the redheaded, emerald gown-clad Fiona. \nBrandon Ribordy’s clever and economical scene design transports audiences to the pages of a storybook. Columns transform effortlessly from trees in the forest to castle towers. All the musical numbers are invigorated by inventive choreography by Ryan Cappleman, a multiple Tommy-Award-winning choreographer for area high school musicals. \nEven with the homegrown talent, the production feels a bit pre-packaged: Pre-recorded music for the songs is piped in through the sound system and the elaborate and entertaining costumes are rented, so they exactly match the movie and the other Shrek merchandise. Only the dragon puppet, beautifully realized by Monica Cliff, is original to this production. \nWith its mix of low humor (there are lots of gags about bodily functions) and decidedly adult jokes, Shrek is a fun show for older children and parents, but perhaps not ideal for little ones, who may not understand seeing a Big Bad Wolf who tears off his grandma disguise to reveal his preferred ensemble, a sparkly, hot pink disco dress. \nShrek ultimately celebrates a message of individuality, wrapping a contemporary message in the trappings of the Brothers Grimm. This dancing ogre and his lively companions assure audiences of all ages that it’s okay to “let your freak flag fly.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:25:42.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
