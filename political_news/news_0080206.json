This is a legal requirement and one that can result in a fine if the information is not received. Share article \n“We are urging people to respond to the reminder letters before we are required to send out canvassers to knock on doors to get this information. This is additional expense to the council and our council tax payers, and we encourage residents to help us to keep this to a minimum.” \nThe new register of electors will be published in December 2015.
