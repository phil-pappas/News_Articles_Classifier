Bruno giving leftover $1.4M to NY Senate GOP By - Associated Press - Friday, October 9, 2015 \nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The New York Senate’s former longtime majority leader says he’s giving $1.4 million left in campaign funds to the Senate Republican Campaign Committee and $100,000 to a scholarship fund. \nBruno says he’s also closing his legal defense fund and spreading about $70,000 left among several nonprofits. \nHe retired from the Senate in 2008 after 13 years as the Republican leader, initially spending leftover campaign money for defense lawyers at political corruption trials in 2009 and 2012. \nThe state comptroller this year approved $1.8 million reimbursements for his legal defense fees, while rejecting another $606,000 sought by Bruno after he was acquitted at his second trial. \nBruno says keeping a Republican Senate majority as a balance to Democrats controlling other parts of the state government is more important than ever. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:11:13.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
