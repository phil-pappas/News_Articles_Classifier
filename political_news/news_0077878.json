Prayut - absent from the media spotlight for much of this week - has decided to be more cautious when speaking on matters to prevent misleading media reports that could fracture society, government spokesman Maj-General Sansern Kaewkamnerd said yesterday. However, he said the premier still looked forward to giving interviews at appropriate occasions. Prayut reappeared yesterday for his weekly TV programme \"Returning Happiness to the People in the Country\". Sansern said despite the premier's rarer appearances this week, he had worked at Government House every day. He said Prayut had been occupied with reviewing work outcomes, preparing the next working phases, and meeting with high-ranking officials representing the country abroad. \"The PM wants everyone to rethink how to build stability in the country, instead of building hatred towards each other without acknowledging the law and justice process,\" Sansern added. 338 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:52:53.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
