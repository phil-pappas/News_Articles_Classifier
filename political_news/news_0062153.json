I should be grateful if that be investigated\" David Morris, a Conservative MP \nMr Morris is now calling for the Met to investigate Mr Watson after he “intervened to bring about two investigations by the police into an accusation of rape which were later closed due to lack of evidence”. \nMr Morris is also calling for Kathryn Hudson, the Commons standards commissioner, to reconsider her decision that there was not enough evidence to open an inquiry into Mr Watson. \nKathryn Hudson \nIn his letter to the Met Police Commissioner, Mr Morris writes: “I wish to report my suspicion that Mr Watson has wasted police time in doing what he has done. I should be grateful if that be investigated. \n• Tom Watson pressured CPS to reopen second sex abuse case \n“I would also like to be made aware of the amount of hours of police time and public funds that were spent on investigating Lord Brittan following Tom Watson’s letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions.” \nMr Watson has said that it was his “duty” to notify the Director of Public Prosecutions about allegations made against Lord Brittan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:22:02.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
