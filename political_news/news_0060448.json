There’s nothing to stop the convicted paedophile from becoming a children’s sports coach. \n\"New Zealand First’s Criminal Procedure (Removing Paedophile Name Suppression) Amendment Bill is awaiting selection from the members’ ballot. \n\"We challenged Mr Key to pull it from the ballot today and introduce it into Parliament. He refused. \n\"There is no substance to his statement in Parliament that he sees victims’ rights as more important than the rights of attackers,\" says Mr Peters. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:25:17.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
