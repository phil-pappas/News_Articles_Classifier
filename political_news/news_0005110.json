The other reason being holding a record for First James Bond theme to reach No.1 in the UK charts with Writing’s on the Wall , the track for the upcoming Spectre film.\nHe was lucky enough that his debut album went straight to number one when it was released in 2014, and continued being in top 10 of the UK album charts for 69 consecutive weeks.\nEarlier, the record was held by Emeli Sandé and her album Our Version of Events which spent 63 weeks in the UK Top 10. Before her, The Beatles debut album Please Please Me spent 62 weeks after its release in March 1963.\nThis will be the first time that a James Bond movie track has reached number one in its 52 year tenure.\nAfter an official certificate presentation at RAK Studios in north London, Sam said: “This is so amazing! It’s such an honour to be recognised by Guinness World Records. It’s been an unbelievable eighteen months. The album exceeded even my wildest dreams thanks to the incredible support of my fans, and to record the first ever Bond theme to reach No.1 in the UK is a real privilege.”\nEarlier Sam had denied recording any song for the James Bond recent movie Spectre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:03:34.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
