Again, on October 13, 2015 when asked the same question on Citi FM's point blank radio programme, she avoided it and proceeded to declare that President Mahama needs a better team, which is why she is coming on board,' Sacut stated, adding, 'It is not surprising that she failed to turn up for her subsequent planned and announced interviews with Starr FM and Radio Gold.. .' \nBy Charles Takyi-Boadu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:56:38.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
