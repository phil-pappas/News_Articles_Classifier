(AP Photo/Rich Schultz) By The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nWASHINGTON (AP) — \nHere's the latest on the presidential candidates' comments on the Sunday talk shows. All times Eastern. \n__ \n9:30 a.m. \nDonald Trump says that had he been president, the Sept. 11 hijackers likely would not have gotten into the U.S. in the first place. \nThe billionaire developer is leading most polls for the GOP presidential nomination and says on \"Fox News Sunday\" that if he were \"running things...there's a good chance that those people would not have been in our country.\" \nAll but one of the 19 men who hijacked planes and flew them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania legally entered the country on business or tourist visas. One entered on a student visa but did not show up to class. \n___ \n9:15 a.m. \nRepublican presidential hopeful Ben Carson says he doesn't think any of the Democratic candidates would be tough opponents for him to beat in the general election. \nThe retired neurosurgeon would first have to win the crowded race for the GOP nomination, and currently he's behind billionaire businessman Donald Trump . But Carson says on ABC's \"This Week\" that the election will essentially be about, \"whether we want a nation where the government is in control or a nation where the people are in control.\" And that, he says, would make him the clear choice no matter the Democratic opponent. \n____ \n9:00 a.m. \nRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz says it's better for the United States if strongmen like the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi (MOO'-ah-mar gah-DAH'-fee) were still in power. \nThe Texas senator says on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Gaddafi and Egypt's Hosni Mubarak (HOHS'-nee moo-BAH'-rahk) were better allies than the extremists in power in those countries now. \nHe would not say, however, whether Iraq was better off led by the late Saddam Hussein, who was toppled by President George W. Bush 's administration in 2003 and executed three years later. \nGadhafi was killed in a battle in 2011.
