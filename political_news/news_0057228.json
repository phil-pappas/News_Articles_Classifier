I think that Terminator is perhaps 50 or so years away.” But there are concerning technologies “only a few years, at best, away,” Walsh said, and with semi-autonomous systems, such as drones, “it would take very little to remove the human from that loop and replace them with a computer.” Walsh and other members of the campaign painted a dire picture of uninhibited artificial intelligence taking root on battlefields and national borders. Unlike those needed for nuclear weapons, they said, the resources to create “killer robots” will only become cheaper and more available over time. With an online-bought drone, a smartphone and the right software, anyone could create “a little killer robot,” Walsh added. “If we don’t [create rules], we will end up in an arms race,” Walsh said, “and the endpoint of that arms race is going to be a very undesirable place.” Peter Asaro, a professor at the New School in New York, noted that without a human in control, machines fail to take in the unpredictable variables and context of war: “what’s the context, what’s the situation, is the use of force appropriate in this context and this target, and you can automate it but can you automate it well, and who’s responsible when it doesn’t operate correctly.” \nWith the fear of out-of-control drones so great, experts are claiming that we need to come up with rules for maintaining and use of them. Though the Pentagon promised to not use AI that is fully autonomous, there is no agreement in place to stop other countries from going that route. Before this technology develops further, the world leaders need to come together and proactively create treaties that will protect everyone from drones taking over.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:28:36.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
