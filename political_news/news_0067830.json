With Jon Stewart leaving, the suits figured, 'Let's keep the same basic forma, but let's just get another Left wing ideologue to host it. Oh hey, I know, how about a black guy? We'll certainly keep Stewart's 1% share at least.'\nExcept Jon Stewart was at least funny, even if you knew he was full of it. That 'new guy' Trevor Noah is about as funny as watching a partial birth abortion.\nHis ratings after his first week of taking over have cratered , even with all the media buildup and a hot presidential race going on that should have boosted ratings.\nDespite all the free hype from every corner of the left-wing national media, Noah bombed during his first week with an average of just 1.02 million viewers. That’s down a breathtaking -33% from this same time last year. And at this same time last year we were not in the middle of a historic presidential election delivering all-time high cable news ratings during the debates.\nThe best news is that young people have abandoned the show in droves. Among teens, the “Daily Show” ratings are down an incredible -59%, from 56k average viewers to just 23k.\nTrevor Noah sucks. Everyone knows it. He’s a left-wing extremist like self-proclaimed socialist Jon Stewart, but Noah has no talent. He’s creating the GOP-hating content the national media desperately desire, but the content is so bad, the media isn’t re-running it endlessly.\nWhen CNN isn’t using your left-wing propaganda, you suck like nothing ever sucked in the history of suck.\nI had a feeling things were headed this way when Noah's history of anti-semitic and misogynist tweets and remarks first surfaced. Even a lot of the Left can't stand him.\nIt's gotten so bad,he's been reduced to recycling Dave Chappele's material and trying to play the race card for sympathy, whining “America suffers from a level of institutionalized racial segregation” and that he never thought he'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa.\nNow, here's a hint, Mr. Noah, If I felt that way, I'd be on the next plane back there. I mean, why make a living of evil American dollars from a bunch of racists?\nThe good part in all this is that apparently only true believers are swallowing his schtick…and not very many of them. http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-bookmark-en.gif", "external_links": ["http://cdn2.theweek.co.uk/sites/theweek/files/styles/16x9_710/public/2/40/150331-trevor-noah_0.jpg?itok=fyO3PCCb", "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Trevor-Noah-Getty-640x480.jpg", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trevor-noah-racism-connoisseur-joke-831381", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/03/31/trevor_noah_to_replace_jon_stewart_on_the_daily_show_offensive_yes_but_also.html", "http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-bookmark-en.gif", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/10/09/trevor-noahs-ratings-collapse-plunge-59-with-teens/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/trevor-noah-criticized-as-anti-785447"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:33:10.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
