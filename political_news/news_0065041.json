Holder, a decorated five-year veteran of the department, was shot in the head after a chase. A 30-year-old man with a history of arrests has been charged with murder. \nPlaywright and activist Eve Ensler, who spoke at the rally, told The Associated Press afterward that the officer’s death was terrible. But “that murder does not discount the hundreds of deaths that we are seeing and continuing to see and the lack of any indictments and the lack of any justice and that’s why I’m here today,” she said. \nThose who spoke at the rally included family members of people killed in interactions with police all over the country, both recent deaths like that of Akai Gurley in November 2014 and others going back years, like Heyward Jr’s. The RiseUpOctober events were the brainchild of activist Carl Dix and academic Cornel West, and are scheduled to culminate on Saturday with a march in Manhattan. \nRecent deaths at police hands have spurred protests nationwide over police use of force. \n“We are talking about something that is widespread and intense when we talk about losing their lives at the hands of law enforcement,” Dix said Thursday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:24:43.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
