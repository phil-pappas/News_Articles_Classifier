(AP) -- A Florida judge is calling for a sweeping overhaul of the state's 27 congressional districts, including the one now held by a candidate seeking to become the next U.S. House speaker. \nJudge Terry Lewis on Friday recommended a new congressional map that could make it nearly impossible for U.S. Rep. Dan Webster to win re-election from his current central Florida district. \nLewis's ruling also could lead to the ouster of U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham from her north Florida seat while resurrecting the political career of former Gov. Charlie Crist. Lewis also went along with a proposal that would make it harder for South Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo to get re-elected. \nThe Florida Supreme Court must decide whether to accept Lewis's proposal. \nThe court asked Lewis to sort through different proposals after the Florida Legislature couldn't agree on new districts. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press.
