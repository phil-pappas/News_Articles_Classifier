Cooke Scholars will receive up to $40,000 per year for up to three years of study at any four-year accredited college or university.\n\"Low-income students who succeed in community college have the potential to do great things if they attend four-year institutions,\" explained Executive Director Harold O. Levy . \"But too often they have unmet financial need, and transferring can be a difficult process to navigate.\"\nIn addition to financial support, the program helps students make the transition to four-year colleges and maximize their campus experiences with the support of counselors and a network of nearly 2,000 extraordinary scholars and alumni. Cooke Scholars also have additional opportunities such as internships, study abroad, and even continued funding for graduate school.\nTo be eligible, applicants must be current students at accredited U.S. community colleges or two-year institutions with sophomore status or have graduated within the last five years. They must have a cumulative college GPA of 3.5 or above, plan to transfer to a four-year college or university to begin studies in the coming fall, and demonstrate unmet financial need.\nApplications are reviewed by a distinguished panel of university faculty and admissions professionals. Selection criteria focus on exceptional academic ability and achievements, financial need, persistence, leadership, and a desire to help others.\n\"We have seen our scholars do great things after transferring to a four-year school. For example, our inaugural Cooke Oxford Award Scholar, Larry Liu , began his extraordinary academic career at a community college,\" said Levy. \"We're excited to see what unique goals the next group will have.\"\nApplications must be received by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on December 15, 2015 . Notification to finalists will be made in April 2016 .
