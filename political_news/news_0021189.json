Elders warned the outspoken Nandi Hills lawmaker that the motion could lead to his political downfall. Advertisement More by this Author \nA group of elders from the Rift Valley have disowned Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter for spearheading the impeachment motion against Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru. \nThe elders have told the lawmaker to drop the motion, saying it is not a permanent solution to the social and economic problems facing the Jubilee administration. \nOn Saturday, the elders asked Mr Keter to stop being misused by the Opposition to destabilise the Jubilee government and, instead, seek their guidance on issues of national importance. \nThe group’s spokesman, Mr William Serem, said the elders would not allow the Keter-sponsored impeachment motion to divide Jubilee, which brings together members of the TNA and URP. \nAddressing journalists in Eldoret, Mr Serem, who was accompanied by Kalenjin Welfare Association chairman Simon Murkelda, said there is a hidden agenda in the efforts to oust Ms Waiguru. \n“We call upon URP lawmakers from Rift Valley not to support the Keter-sponsored impeachment motion against Waiguru. His plans lack the blessings and support of the community,” said Mr Murkelda. \nHe warned the outspoken Nandi Hills lawmaker that the motion could lead to his political downfall in the forthcoming General Election. \n“We know the people who are funding Keter in the impeachment bid, with the intention of rocking the Jubilee government ahead of the 2017 General Election,” said Mr Murkelda. \nBut on Friday, Mr Keter vowed to proceed with the motion to impeach the minister for alleged corruption in the National Youth Service. \nHe spoke during the burial of Ms Deborah Rugut, the daughter of former Central Provincial Commissioner Japhter Rugut, in Koitiliol Village, Nandi County. \nMr Keter maintained that no amount of threats would make him give up on the matter. He said he would continue to collect signatures to compel Mrs Waiguru to step aside. \nOn Thursday last week, Jubilee lawmakers, including National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale and Senator Charles Keter, dismissed the Nandi Hills MP’s threats to impeach Mrs Waiguru. They accused him of being used by the Opposition to cause a rift in the government", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:10:54.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
