The emails, sent by Jake Sullivan, one of Mrs. Clinton’s top advisers at the State Department, have now been marked “secret” by the department.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Hillary Clinton Emails Take Long Path to Controversy AUG. 8, 2015 Hillary Clinton Email Inquiry Weighs if Aides Erred at ‘Send’ SEPT. 24, 2015 Investigators Find Emails Hillary Clinton Said Were Erased SEPT. 22, 2015 Hillary Clinton’s Long Road to ‘Sorry’ Over Email Use SEPT. 11, 2015 The heavily redacted emails were posted online by the State Department on its website, the latest in a series of monthly disclosures ordered by a court after revelations that Mrs. Clinton had used a private email system when she was secretary of state.\nContinue reading the main story Document More Hillary Clinton Emails Released by the State Department The State Department released another batch of emails on Wednesday from Hillary Rodham Clinton’s private server that she used while she was secretary of state. Of the 6,300 pages that were made public, three emails should have been considered “secret,” the government’s second-highest classification, according to a State Department review.\nOPEN Document Among the emails released Wednesday were five that appear to be random attempts by hackers to penetrate Mrs. Clinton’s email system. The messages appear to be notices of speeding tickets from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. But the emails are well known as phishing attempts by hackers in Russia. It is not clear whether Mrs. Clinton clicked on the malware-infected messages.\nThe latest batch also includes quirky exchanges between Mrs. Clinton and her aides on topics as varied as Mrs. Clinton’s difficulty adjusting the volume on her phone and her frustrations with a White House operator who did not believe she was really the secretary of state.\nAs a presidential candidate, Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly had to answer questions about the private server she used for the emails she sent and received. It is against the law to possess classified electronic material outside a secured government network.\nDozens of emails Mrs. Clinton sent and received were not classified at the time they were sent, but have now been made “confidential.” One other email, made public in May, has been reclassified as “secret.” The inspector general for the intelligence community said in August that two other emails were “top secret” — although the State Department has contested that classification.\nA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the emails released Wednesday. All three of the “secret” emails released by the State Department were almost completely redacted before they were posted online.\nThe “secret” email containing the 2008 Israeli-Palestinian document noted only the attendees at the meeting in Jerusalem on June 15, 2008. They included Condoleezza Rice, then the secretary of state, and several officials from Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\nThat document remained available on Al Jazeera’s website.\n The two emails about the Iran nuclear program were sent by Mr. Sullivan in January 2011 and appear to include a summary of talks conducted by the “P5+1,” the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany. The subject line was: “FW: Summary of Day One of Istanbul P5+1 talks.”\nState Department officials appear to have concluded that those details about conversations among foreign officials should have been classified as secret at the time they were sent.\nMany of the other emails released on Wednesday provided a window into the day-to-day communications of Mrs. Clinton’s State Department.\nIn one email in February 2010, Mrs. Clinton complained to Huma Abedin, a top aide, of troubles trying to place a telephone call.\n“Right now I’m fighting w the WH operator who doesn’t believe I am who I say and wants my direct office line even tho I’m not there,” Mrs. Clinton wrote.\nTwo other emails suggest the secretary of state’s lack of technological prowess.\n“Yes, on call with tripoli. Monica will come turn ringer on,” she wrote in one.\nMany of the emails to Mrs. Clinton offer fawning compliments from friends, family or staff members. But in at least one case, high praise came from an unexpected source: Anita McBride, who served as chief of staff to Laura Bush, the former first lady.\n“We are so fortunate she is where she is. I know it’s so damn hard,” Ms. McBride wrote to one of Mrs. Clinton’s aides. “I’ll pray for her.”\nIn one email, Mrs. Clinton demanded to know who “made the decision that State will not use the terms ‘mother and father’ and instead substitute ‘parent one and two.’ ” Mrs. Clinton wrote that someone should “address this today” to avoid “a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin et al.”\n“I’m not defending that decision, which I disagree w and knew nothing about, in front of this Congress,” she added.\nMrs. Clinton’s emails also show her private frustration over her interactions with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as she pressed his government in early 2010 to make concessions the United States believed were critical to move toward a peace settlement.\n“FYI. Israelis spinning up a storm, starting with plane briefing on the way over,” an aide to Mrs. Clinton wrote to her, noting that one reporter at the briefing said the Israelis “sounded a bit cocky.”\n“They always sound cocky — in the air or on the ground,” Mrs. Clinton wrote back, to Mr. Sullivan.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/12/us/12CLINTONweb/12CLINTONweb-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/25/us/25emails/24emails-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/30/us/politics/HRCemailPhoto/HRCemailPhoto-master495.png", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/09/us/09emails-web01/09emails-web01-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/24/world/23emails-web/23emails-web-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:32:16.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
