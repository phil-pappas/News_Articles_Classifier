By this I mean the real living wage, which is calculated according to the cost of living.\n\"There are now over 300 organisations across Scotland that recognise the tangible benefits to their business of being accredited, huge progress in the last 12 months.\"\nIn response, the UK government spokesman said its proposals were expected to directly boost the wages of nearly three million people and would mean a full-time worker would earn £2,000 more per year by 2020.\nHe added: \"For younger workers, the priority is to secure work and gain experience.\n\"In order to maximise the opportunities for younger workers to gain that experience the national living wage will only apply to workers aged 25 and over.\n\"The wages of younger workers will continue to be underpinned by the core national minimum wage.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3314/production/_85867031_salary.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33437115"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:05:08.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
