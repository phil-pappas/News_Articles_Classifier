It gives strength and power to the players before their games. It is highly inspiring and I am glad I got to try my hands at it,” Sidharth said. \nHe was also moved by his visit to Tane Mahuta and the gift given him by Waipoua footprints. \n“As soon as you set foot in the forest you know that you are in a special place with a lot of history and culture,” Sidharth said. \n“To top it all, the pounamu given to me is absolutely beautiful. I know how much this stone means to the Māori people, I will treasure and cherish it forever.” \nHe was given the hand-carved pounamu piece crafted by Lewis Gardiner who is regarded as one of the most innovative and respected Māori pounamu artists of his generation. Sidharth received a Toki \n– Adze style pounamu which symbolizes prestige, authority, control, power, influence, status, spiritual power and charisma. It was where he also experienced his first official Hongi (traditional greeting). \nNorthland Inc general manager regional promotions Paul Davis said it pleasing that the superstar, whose latest movie “ Brothers” released last month took $87 million in its first week at the Box-office, had chosen to experience what Northland tourism had to offer. \n“We are happy that Northland was chosen alongside Auckland, Wellington and Queenstown as a destination for him to visit given that he was here shooting promotional materials of New Zealand for Tourism New Zealand’s Indian PR and marketing campaign,” Mr Davis says. \n“The Indian market is small, but a growing market for Northland at the higher-end with emphasis being put on the honeymoon and family group sectors.” \nTourism New Zealand figures show that the number of people visiting New Zealand from India is growing steadily with numbers up 24.9 per cent to 43,329 for the year ending August. \nIndian visitors tend to travel from October to March with family arrivals peaking from April to June, making that market attractive to the New Zealand tourism industry as it helps to offset seasonality issues by encouraging visitors in the shoulder and off seasons. \nOn his visit here from October 11-19 Sidharth regularly shared his experiences daily with his 4.3 million social media followers of which 2.4 million are on Twitter. \nApart from sharing his visit here to encourage tourism in India he will also deliver messages to Indian drivers about how to drive safely when visiting New Zealand. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:42:46.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
