Hashtags associated rival Democratic contender, Bernie Sanders, such as #FeeltheBern and #Bernie2016, were also trending but visibly less than Clinton's.\nHillary Clinton was also one of the top 7 most searched queries on Google under the search term \"Joe Biden\" on Wednesday afternoon, and the only non-Biden related query, according to Google trends.\nBoth Clinton and Sanders offered social media kudos to their almost-rival.\nAbout an hour after Biden's announcement, Clinton took to her official Twitter handle - @HillaryClinton - and tweeted: \"@VP is a good friend and a great man. Today and always, inspired by his optimism and commitment to change the world for the better. -H.\"\nSanders, on @BernieSanders, also tweeted: \"I thank @VP for his continued service to the nation and his support of the middle class.\"\nRepublicans also weighed in. On his official Twitter account @realDonaldTrump, GOP front runner Donald Trump posted: \"I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.\"\nRumors and reports about a potential run by Biden intensified this week with hashtags #BidenWatch and #Biden2016 going viral on popular social media platforms.\nBiden, 72, had been wrestling with doubts about whether he and his family were ready for a grueling campaign while still mourning his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in May. His son had urged him to run.\n(Reporting by Angela Moon; Editing by Dan Burns and Christian Plumb )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:05:00.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
