Like any other bride, she catches glimpses of the guests present at her wedding.\nThe couple exchange garlands in a simple ceremony which took place in the lush green lawns of the Prime Minister’s residence in 1 Safdarjung Road on 25th February 1968 in the national capital.\nThe happy couple cut a huge 4-tier wedding cake in the presence of their near and dear ones.\nOnly family and close friends were invited to the high-profile wedding. Notable figures that attended the glittering affair were Mrs. Vijay Lakshmi Pandit and the then Indian President Dr. Zakir Hussain.\nThe video documents only some parts of the wedding, but shows an evidently much in love couple looking forward to starting a new life together. Rajiv Gandhi, who went on to become the Prime Minister, had met the Italian girl Sonia Maino at Cambridge, two years before their wedding.\n Rajiv Sonia wedding Rajiv Gandhi India Gandhi nation Also Read Swine flu likely to ‘hit’ Deputy CM T Rajaiah Hyderabad marches for equal rights ATI staffer, husband found dead in Mysuru Meerut family attacked with acid by son-in-law", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Sonia-Rajiv-wedding_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Sonia-Rajiv-wedding_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gvIX-2H1sU", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccanchronicle.com/151007/nation-current-affairs/article/watch-rare-footage-sonia-and-rajiv-gandhi’s-dreamy-wedding"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:51:26.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
