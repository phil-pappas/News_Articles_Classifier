(Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc.) more > By - The Washington Times - Thursday, October 1, 2015 \nSHARYL ATTKISSON READY TO ROCK POLITICAL TALK \nThis could jolt the chatty Sunday talk show realm: The investigators have arrived. “Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson ” debuts this weekend, focusing on investigative journalism and authentic accountability rather than sound bites and talking points, its creators say. \n“We will pierce secrecy and seek accountability from government, corporations and special interests. We will report on untouchable topics in a fearless way with a team of award-winning journalists. We will follow the trail no matter where it leads,” says Ms. Attkisson, a former CBS correspondent and author of the recent bestseller “Stonewalled.” She pines for a proactive public, urging viewers to seek advice from trustworthy sources and make up their own minds about the complexities of politics, money, power and secrecy. \nThe first show features an interview with Republican front-runner Donald Trump and a close analysis of unchecked immigration in the U.S. and elsewhere. Produced in conjunction with the Sinclair Broadcast Group, the half-hour show will be based in the nation’s capital and broadcast by the organization’s 164 TV stations nationwide, including affiliations with ABC, CBS, CW, FOX, NBC and Univision, among other networks. \n“This is serious journalism dedicated to serious topics that impact us all,” notes Scott Livingston , vice president of news for Sinclair Television Group. He adds that the show is proof of management’s “dedication to the reporting”— a rare commodity in the current chaotic media marketplace. \n‘In today’s world of media and journalism where reporting is often superficial, we pledge to dig deeper, to bring the context and perspective to the stories that matter, to bring to our audience the full measure,” says Executive Producer Batt Humphreys . \nThe show airs Sunday morning; for specific times, consult FullMeasure.news. The program will also be streamed online at the site at 9:30 a.m. ET. \nTRUMP’S TAKE ON RUSSIA \nYes, a billionaire would consider the financial toll of a bombing campaign — and the hidden benefits therein. Republican front-runner Donald Trump displays a certain amount of glee when it comes to Russia’s military action in Syria. \n“I love the fact that Russia is spending a lot of their money, a lot of their manpower and we’re not necessarily going to have to spend this much,” Mr. Trump says. “I think that’s OK. Russia got bogged down in Afghanistan. It ruined the Soviet Union because, I don’t know if you know, but the Soviet Union was basically destroyed. It went virtually bankrupt because of what happened. They got bogged down in Afghanistan. They’ll probably get bogged down over here, too.” \nHe shared his prediction with the Fox Business Network. \nWEEKEND CANDIDATE TRACKER \nThings are bustling in little New Hampshire in the next 48 hours: The cast of GOP presidential hopefuls in the state includes Sen. Ted Cruz , Govs. Chris Christie and John Kasich , Carly Fiorina and Rick Santorum . Mr. Cruz has the most interesting itinerary: He’ll appear at a World War II combat museum in Wolfeboro and a private “smoke a cigar with Senator Ted Cruz” party in Salem. The sole Democrat is Martin O’Malley , who headlines a Democratic “autumn dinner” in Rochester. \nIowa also calls: Republicans in the Hawkeye State include Gov. Bobby Jindal , Sen. Marco Rubio and Ben Carson . They have the place to themselves; there are no Democrats in Iowa at the moment. \nAnd South Carolina? The busy Ms. Fiorina appears with Sen. Tim Scott at a town hall in Aiken, then it’s on to a Young Republicans event aboard the USS Yorktown — always a grand photo-op. Jeb Bush will make a single appearance at a conservative conference in Greenville. No Democrats in the state, however.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:24:38.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
