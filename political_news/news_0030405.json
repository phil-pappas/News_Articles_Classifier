Slowly, her friends start ignoring her. Deeply bothered about the social ostracism, she complains to her school teachers and principal about the incident. The principal of Shefali’s school who recounted this incident to me said that they addressed this issue by counselling Shefali who had gone into depression because of the bullying. She also spoke about their attempts to identify the bully. But her larger concern was this: While we can provide supportive counselling to the victim, what do we do about other boys and girls and their parents who ostracise the victim?\nThe above incident highlights the complex nature of cyberbullying which starts online but often spreads offline. And, worryingly, in a school or college, cyberbullying involves not just the perpetrator and the victim, but a host of other people including other classmates, school mates and their parents.\nNicola Morgan, a UK-based expert on adolescence describes cyberbullying as a crime where you don’t have to look in your victim’s eyes while you’re doing it and in which the supposedly weak can attack the supposedly strong, where muscles don’t matter.\nUnderstanding the problem\nIn my work, I have come across several cases in which victims of cyberbullying silently suffer from guilt, shame, anxiety and depression. Most teachers are at a loss because they have not received any training on the effective ways to tackle this problem. Many children also fear complaining to their parents because parents normally react to such problems by imposing a blanket ban on the use of social media. And, there are several instances where parents are not aware that their children use social media. When faced with cyberbullying, these children are unlikely to approach their parents for help and support.\nNeedless to say, there is an urgent need to understand the multiple dimensions of this growing problem before it can be addressed in a realistic and humane manner.\nResearchers at London School of Economics have just finished a fascinating study on the internet use of around 25,000 European children aged 9-16 years old. This study also looked into the multiple socio-cultural and economic aspects of cyberbullying among children. It revealed that online bullies and those being bullied online are those children who are mostly also vulnerable offline. Sonia Livingstone, the lead researcher of this study, states that children who have various kinds of psychological, social difficulties offline — poor relations with friends, not supported by parents, lonely and so looking for other people or intimacy online — those are the kinds of factors that lead children to take offline vulnerability and extend it online and become more at risk. And those who are already dealing with children who are vulnerable offline, whether they are doctors or clinicians or social workers or teachers, should also have an eye to how that kind of vulnerability might be extended online. And often they don’t, because the immediate problems are so great that they don’t start thinking ‘and what is that child doing on Facebook?’ or ‘who do they know on their phone?’\nFurthermore, those children who are causing harmful experiences online to others in the form of bullying are often the very same ones being bullied online by others, some of them known and some unknown to them offline. This finding sheds light on an issue often overlooked in discussions on cyberbullying in India — while the victim of cyberbullying requires counselling and support, the perpetrator is in need of counselling and support as well.\nThe role of parents\nCan technology help parents protect their children online? Dr Justin Patchin, cofounder of the Cyberbullying Research Centre in the US does not think so. He advises parents against using cellphone tracker software because ‘students will move to other devices or use the computer at the library at the school or at a friend’s house, and secondly, if you’re surreptitiously monitoring the behaviour of your child online, eventually you’re going to find something which you need to confront them about and when you do, they are pretty much never going to tell you anything ever again. It’s going to damage the relationship so much that it’s going to be hard for there to be a trusting relationship where your kid will talk to you about stuff’.\nPerhaps, an open and honest conversation about online risk and safety between parents and children is likely to be a more effective antidote to cyberbullying. Crucially, the conversation needs to begin much before the child reaches adolescence. According to Payal Talreja, a Delhi based mother of two daughters, ‘parents need to discuss and explain about cyberbullying to the child before s/he starts using social media independently. It is also important to lay down rules for protection. Until the age of 10, I would absolutely not allow unsupervised use of the Internet, phone or online interactive games. The computer must be kept in a common area, or only allowed to be used in your presence. Never hesitate to pull the plug. When my daughters grew older, we had this rule that I would always know the passwords on their accounts and could do surprise checks for the phone or computer any time. I only relaxed this rule when they showed themselves to be mature.’\nPayal also stresses that ‘virtual life behaviour should mimic real-life rules for decent behaviour which means avoiding name calling and being derogatory or intolerant because such behaviour will come right back at you.’\nIt is also important to teach one’s child to be an ‘upstander’. While a bystander is defined as “a person or a group of people who see unacceptable behaviour but do nothing to stop it”, an upstander is a phrase coined by the human rights activist Samantha Power to describe people “who take a stand against hate and indifference.”\nThe author is a sexuality educator and counsellor based in Gujarat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:28:02.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
