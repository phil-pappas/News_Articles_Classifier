Bernie Sanders (I-VT) (L) and Hillary Clinton. (Joe Raedle) By Harold Meyerson Opinion writer October 14 at 7:22 PM Follow @HaroldMeyerson In the fall of 1991, a Democratic presidential candidate I was covering as he campaigned across New Hampshire had a line in his speeches that surprised me. He commended to his listeners something called the “Swedish active labor market” — a program, established by Sweden’s Social Democrats as part of their full-employment policy, that trained unemployed workers at the government’s expense and linked them up with available jobs.\nThat candidate was Bill Clinton.\nHarold Meyerson writes a weekly political column that appears on Thursdays and contributes to the PostPartisan blog. View Archive Google+ RSS On Tuesday night, I was forcefully reminded of the then-Arkansas governor’s unanticipated endorsement of Scandinavian democratic socialist policy by former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s takedown of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) invocation of Denmark as a model for progressive change in the United States. My point isn’t that Bill Clinton was a socialist in liberal garb; his support for increasing the size and clout of the financial sector is proof positive that he wasn’t. It’s that the relationship between the European social democracy that Sanders extols and the American progressivism that Hillary Clinton champions is complicated and at times symbiotic, with clear areas of overlap and difference.\nThe social democracies of Northern Europe have higher and more progressive tax rates than we do, which fund a far greater range of social benefits than we do as well. U.S. liberals also favor more progressive taxation and greater social benefits (paid sick days, expanded health coverage). To the extent that this is not just a quantitative but a qualitative distinction, it’s because the European social democratic belief in citizens’ rights extends deeper into the economic realm — particularly the workplace — than American liberalism’s does.\nThe great irony of Northern European social democracy is that it has produced perhaps the world’s most successful capitalist economies. The Swedish full-employment policy that so intrigued Bill Clinton, for instance, made workers confident that they could get jobs with at least comparable pay if their companies failed, thereby eliminating popular resistance to shuttering moribund industries and incubating new ones. The German economy — by any measure the most successful of any advanced capitalist nation over the past decade — confers on employees considerable say in company policy by giving their representatives half the seats on corporate boards . It is also home to the world’s most successful small and medium-size businesses, the", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/07/04/who-are-corporate-directors-working-for-anyway/the-law-should-make-boards-more-diverse", "https://plus.google.com/106329666297901337974", "https://twitter.com/@HaroldMeyerson"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:28:37.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
