(AP) - Two Republican state legislators have introduced a bill that would allow concealed carry gun owners to bring weapons into public university and college buildings in Wisconsin. \nThe proposed legislation from Rep. Jesse Kremer and Sen. Devin LeMahieu (leh mah hew) comes less than two weeks after a gunman killed nine people at a community college in Oregon. \nUnder current law, license holders can carry guns on the grounds of public colleges and universities. But the schools are allowed to ban weapons inside campus buildings. The University of Wisconsin-Madison is one school that has posted signs banning weapons at entrances to every building on campus. \nDemocratic Rep. Melissa Sargent tells the State Journal (http://bit.ly/1Ls9QmV ) she questions the wisdom of allowing more guns on campus where drinking alcohol is common. \n___ \nInformation from: Wisconsin State Journal, http://www.madison.com/wsj \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:45:35.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
