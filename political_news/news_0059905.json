We can't close them anymore.\"\n\"Over the last few decades, we've also locked up more non-violent offenders than ever before, for longer than ever before,\" he continued. \"That's the real reason our prison population is so high.\"\nPlay Video CBS Evening News Obama calls for reforms in criminal justice system President Barack Obama addressed the NAACP convention in Philadelphia Tuesday.

The talks will focus on private sector initiatives to curb the epidemic, with an additional spotlight on local, state and federal efforts. Mr. Obama aims to meet with law enforcement officials, former prisoners and community leaders during his stops.\n\"Justice means that the punishment should fit the crime. And justice means allowing our fellow Americans who have made mistakes to pay their debt to society and re-join their community as active, rehabilitated citizens,\" the president said. \"Justice has never been easy to achieve, but it's always been worth fighting for.\"\nMr. Obama has turned an increasing eye to reforming the criminal justice system. He has been responsible for commuting more prison sentences than his last two Oval Office predecessors, while the Justice Department under former Attorney General Eric Holder drastically changed its harsh policies on charging low-level, nonviolent drug offenses.\nIn his weekly address, the president also pushed upcoming congressional action on criminal justice issues, touting a bipartisan Senate bill introduced earlier this month that would reduce mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders. The measure would include bans on solitary confinement for juveniles and allow prisoners to face shorter sentences if they enroll in programs that would help prevent a repeat offense. A similar bill is making its way through the House.\n\"This is progress,\" Mr. Obama said. \"Not liberal ideas or conservative ideas, but commonsense solutions to the challenges we face.\"\nPlay Video Politics GOP pushes anti-\"sanctuary cities\" bill Sen.

Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, said Saturday. \"We have to take this step in order to get these cities to do the right thing and stop undermining our immigration laws.\"\nHe said the Stop Sanctuary Policies Act would \"help make our communities safer\" and prevent cities like San Francisco from making \"a mockery of even modest attempts\" at immigration enforcement.\n\"When illegal immigrants do commit violent crimes in our country, they must be arrested and deported,\" Toomey said. \"That's the law.\"\nThe president has previously threatened to veto legislation that would crack down on sanctuary cities , saying it \"threatens the civil rights of all Americans.\"\nThe Senate is scheduled to vote on Toomey's bill, co-sponsored by Sen.
