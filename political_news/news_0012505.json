We’ve got you covered. \nDispatch Public Affairs Editor Darrel Rowland sat down with Gov. John Kasich (and a few other reporters) on the Kasich for Us campaign bus as it drove through New Hampshire Wednesday. \nThere, Kasich said of his presidential campaign, “I feel like we’re stronger and growing a little bigger,” he said. “You got to build this thing from the bottom up. You can’t build it from the top down, it doesn’t work … It’s like taking a hammer and pounding into a dam. At some point we’re going to see some water.” \nAnd while the campaign has yet to release fundraising totals - due to the Federal Elections Commission on Thursday - the Republican governor said, “We’ve got enough money to get through here … and to do some other things to build out,” he said. “We have a very low burn rate,” he added, using the slang for how quickly his campaign is spending money. \n*** \nHappening today : Rowland reports, “Kasich’s bus tour continues on Wednesday with a quintessential New Hampshire campaign day: stops at a general store, a deli and the American Police Motorcycle Museum, another town hall and a house party that’s actually in a barn.” \n*** \nICYMI : New Day for America, Kasich’s super PAC plans to spend more money on television ads in New Hampshire leading up to the first primary in the nation there. “The super PAC has extended that buy through the primary, which is expected to be held on Feb. 9, by spending an additional $5 million. That will bring its total for Oct. 1 through the primary to $6.5 million,” WMUR in New Hampshire reports. \nBefore that October, New Day for America had spent $5 million on ads for a total of $11.5 million. \n*** \nKasich on the Democrats : While the Democratic presidential candidates battled it out for the first time in debate, Kasich’s campaign made sure he stayed in people’s Twitter feed, posting messages such as “Glad that's over? Us too. On Thursday, it's time for real solutions. #DemDebate #Kasich4US ” along with a 15-sec video of the governor saying “You’ve heard the Democrats talk about high taxes and more government. On Thursday we’ll be offering a solid alternative of sending power, money and influence back to where you live.” \n*** \nSpeaking of the Democrats : “Gun control, immigration reform and taking on Wall Street to address income inequality were among the most passionately debated topics as five Democratic presidential contenders faced off for the first time,” Las Vegas Review-Journal’s Eric Hartley writes. “On Tuesday night in Las Vegas, the two front-runners, Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, found common ground midway through the debate, agreeing that the media and Republicans have focused too much on Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state.” \n*** \nAnd who was the winner? The political analysts over at Sabato’s Crystal Ball declared it a win for Clinton, saying “Clinton’s deep experience in debates shone brightly. She was better than at any joint forum in her previous campaign. Clinton went into the debate the frontrunner and she came out exactly the same -- probably strengthened in that role.” \n*** \nIssue 1 issues: “As the official Issue 1 campaign struggles with internal dysfunction, nonprofit grassroots groups say they are trying to fill the gaps in telling voters why they should support a reform of Ohio’s legislative redistricting process,” Dispatch reporter Jim Siegel writes. “Michael Li of the Brennan Center for Justice praised Ohio lawmakers Tuesday for placing substantial reform on the November ballot. But groups supporting Issue 1 are finding that getting the political parties to agree on a redistricting plan is one thing, but getting them to work together on an issue campaign is quite another.” \nSee who is stepping in to help lead a grassroots effort to pass Issue 1. \n*** \nAbortion hearings : “Abortion opponents are pushing state lawmakers to make it illegal for doctors to perform an abortion after 20 weeks’ gestation and to ban the procedure at any time if a woman is trying to avoid having a baby with Down syndrome,” Dispatch reporter Catherine Candisky writes. “In addition to the restrictions, the General Assembly also is considering legislation to cut off tax funds to Planned Parenthood and any other group that performs or promotes abortions.” \n*** \nMarijuana legalization poll : “A public opinion poll conducted by Kent State University shows 56 percent of Ohioans support State Issue 3, a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational and medical marijuana,” Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson writes. “Unlike a previous Quinnipiac poll, which produced similar numbers but referred generally to marijuana legalization, the Kent State poll asked specifically about Issue 3 and Issue 2, an anti-monopoly amendment aimed at killing the marijuana proposal even if it passes. WKYC, a Cleveland television station, commissioned Kent State to do the poll.” \n*** \nSpeaking of pot : Secretary of State Jon Husted rejected a new business filing that would deliver pot to you. \n“Fred N. Carmen, a Beachwood, Ohio, attorney, may have been anticipating Ohioans will support legalizing marijuana in the Nov. 3 election when he filed a request with Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted to set up a business called delivermepot.com,” Johnson writes. \n*** \nOn Thursday : GOP presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio will be in Ohio to discuss the “massive disconnect” between the nation’s energy capabilities and D.C.’s bureaucracy. \n*** \nMore from the 8th District : Ohioans are lining up to run for House Speaker John Boehner’s seat when he leaves Congress at the end of the month. Newest to the list? State Rep. Tim Derickson, R-Hanover Township. \n“Following the announcement, Derickson's campaign noted endorsements from state Rep. Wes Retherford (R-Hamilton) and state Sen. Bill Coley (R-Liberty Township). Both Coley and Retherford considered running for the soon-to-be vacant seat before deciding against it,” Enquirer’s Keith BieryGolick writes. \n*** \nOn this day : From the Dispatch library, on this day in 2002 “In a surprising compromise, an Ohio Board of Education committee urges adoption of science curriculum guidelines that critics say will promote the teaching of religious views instead of the evolution-only instruction about life on Earth advocated by most scientists.” \n*** \nVoters Guide : Early voting has started in Ohio and you can see what will be on your ballot with The Dispatch's Voters Guide. \n*** \nGet the news in your inbox : Did you hear we have a Dispatch Politics email?
