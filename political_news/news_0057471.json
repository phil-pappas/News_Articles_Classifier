Captain America is now a person of politically preferred pigmentation who sides with foreign invaders against regular Americans:\nIn the latest issue of Marvel’s revamped Captain America, the iconic superhero takes on a group of right-wing conservatives trying to stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border.\nIn “Captain America: Sam Wilson #1,” the superhero also known as Sam Wilson heads to the border to take on an “evil” militia group known as the Sons of the Serpent, who are patrolling the area between Mexico and Arizona, according to a video summary of the issue created by the MacIver Institute.\nThe Sons of the Serpent try to stop a group of illegal immigrants from crossing the border. They accuse the immigrants of invading a sovereign land to spread disease and crime, take American jobs and collect welfare — staples of the conservative case against illegal immigration.\nThe villain calls for a wall at the border and even objects to having to press 1 for English.\nEventually Captain America swoops in and beats up the “bad guys.”\nThat is, he beats up the patriots defending their country from invasion. What do you expect? Marvel Comics is owned by Disney, the leftist megacorporation that also inflicts its noxious moonbattery through ESPN .\nOn tips from Bill T, JeffersonSpinningInGrave, and 762×51.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/THg1kmxZk6M?rel=0", "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/17/captain-america-battles-right-wing-conservatives-/", "http://moonbattery.com/?p=62650"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:54:04.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
