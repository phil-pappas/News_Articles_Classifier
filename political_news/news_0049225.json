Bernie Sanders was a guest on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" on Wednesday He credited comedian Larry David who impersonated him on Saturday Night Live last weekend Washington (CNN) Bernie Sanders has a Larry David impersonation, and it's \"pretty, pretty, pretty good.\" Sanders wrapped up a fairly serious discussion with Jimmy Kimmel on his Wednesday night ABC show with his own impression of the comedian, who nailed his mannerisms last weekend on Saturday Night Live. \"Well, I thought it was pretty, pretty, pretty good,\" Sanders said , a reference to a famous expression associated with David, as Kimmel's band struck up the theme song to David's show \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\" David stole the show last weekend on SNL's parody of the first Democratic debate, with his personification of Sanders and even got the candidate joking about underwear on the trail this week. RELATED: Larry David's Bernie Sanders joins 'SNL' political impersonations hall of fame Read More Sanders' exchange with Kimmel was otherwise fairly serious, as he laid out his case for how to fight income equality but also weighed in on marijuana legalization and religion. \"We've got to end the war on drugs. And you know you look at what's going on in Colorado and elsewhere I am not unfavorably disposed to moving toward the legalization of marijuana,\" Sanders said. It's a slightly stronger stance from this summer, when he told Yahoo's Katie Couric that he was waiting to take a firm stance on the issue. He also told Couric that he \"smoked marijuana twice â€” didn't quite work for me.\" Kimmel also pressed Sanders on his religious beliefs Wednesday night. \"A moment ago you said 'God forbid.' You say you're culturally Jewish, you don't feel religious. Do you believe in God, and do you think that's important to the people of the United States?\" Kimmel asked. But Sanders walked around the direct question. \"Well, I am who I am. And what I believe in, and what my spirituality is about is that we're all in this together. That I think it is not a good thing to believe that as human beings we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people,\" Sanders said, to applause from the crowd. \"And you know, this is not Judaism. This is what Pope Francis is talking about, that we cannot worship just billionaires and the making of more and more money. Life is more than that.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:51:03.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
