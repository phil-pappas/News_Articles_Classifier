It would be so insignificant to me, compared to making our country great again.\"\nHe also offered lukewarm support for House Ways and Means Committee Paul Ryan, who is being recruited by many of his party's members to run for speaker after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy dropped his bid last week.\nTrump called Ryan \"a very nice person\" who'd be an \"OK\" choice, but noted that he \"doesn't seem to want\" the job.\n\"But I'll bet you that if it was actually offered to him, he would take it,\" Trump said.\nHe criticized Ryan, not for the issues that conservatives usually hit the 2012 vice presidential nominee on -- his role in a budget deal with Senate Democrats and his position on immigration -- but for his long-term budget plan's overhauls to entitlement programs.\n\"I disagree with some of the things. I think that when Mitt Romney chose him last time, it was a tough choice because he's been so anti-Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, in a sense,\" Trump said.\nHe faulted congressional Republicans for failing to use the leverage its conservative base has offered, and said the next speaker needs to be better in negotiations with President Barack Obama and minority Senate Democrats.\n\"The problem is, you'll have 70% of the Republicans say, 'We're not closing government.' Now, when you say that -- you know I wrote \"The Art of the Deal,'\" Trump said. \"When you say that, and the other side says, 'Well, we've got 70% of the people say it's not going to happen,' the other 30% are essentially, they're rendered useless.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:30:18.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
