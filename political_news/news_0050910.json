If you're looking for cheap thrills instead, check back every Monday for a fun pick-me-up that will still leave you enough cash for dinner.\nWe all know Carven can make a damn good coat , but this powdery-pink one from their A/W collection is a quality investment if you want your future winters to be a little less drab. It looks like it's spun from pure cotton candy — and it feels like it, too, thanks to the fluffy wool blend. The shade of pink is just muted enough that it won’t clash with your steady rotation of basics, meaning it can sub as your everyday winter coat even if you’re averse to color. Cinch it over a simple midi dress and wear with brogues to take inspiration from the brand’s French roots.\nCarven Pink Wool Manteau Court Coat , $1,050", "external_links": ["https://www.modaoperandi.com/carven-pf15/pink-wool-manteau-court-coat"], "published": "2015-10-23T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:29:39.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
