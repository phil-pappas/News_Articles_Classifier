During a 2012 trip to Australia, she called it the \"gold standard in trade agreements.\"\nIn the interview, she said the agreement does not meet her standard for creating jobs, raising wages and protecting national security. Clinton raised specific concerns about a potential for currency manipulation by China and provisions that she said would benefit pharmaceutical companies at the expense of patients.\nAdvertisement \"I don't believe it's going to meet the high bar I have set,\" she said.\nThe united opposition from the Democratic presidential field leaves Obama in the uncomfortable position of watching a Democratic debate next week in which none of the major candidates is willing to defend a deal that the White House sees as a key piece of his presidential legacy.\nObama and many Republican lawmakers favor the accord, saying it will greatly help the U.S. economy by boosting exports of American products.\nClinton's campaign and the Obama administration have always said the time would come when she would outline her own policies and deliver criticisms, implied and direct, of the president.\n\"I am not running for my husband's third term or President Obama's third term,\" Clinton told voters in Davenport, Iowa, on Tuesday, repeating a frequent line from her campaign speeches. \"I'm running for my first term.\"\nLast month, she came out against the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast; the administration remains undecided.\nIn August, she said Obama's decision to approve offshore drilling in the Arctic wasn't \"worth the risk\" to the environment. She subtly resurrected her 2008 primary attack of Obama's approach to world affairs, taking a more hawkish stance toward Russia, Syria and Iran.\nAnd she has promised to work to repeal the \"Cadillac tax,\" a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored insurance that the Obama administration says is necessary to fund the health care law.\nOn immigration and gun control, she has pledged to use executive power as president to do more than Obama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:29:44.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
