UNESCO has inscribed the Derveni Papyrus – a philosophical treatise – on the Memory of the World Register 2015, as the most ancient book in Europe.\nThe text is the first book of western tradition and global significance, since it reflects values currently accepted as universal: the need to explain the world, the desire to belong to a human society with known rules, and the agony to confront the end of life.\nThe papyrus was found accidentally in 1962 during a public works project in an uninhabited location, 10 km from Thessaloniki, in Northern Greece. It is now held in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki . The 2,500 years old book was illegible for decades until it was finally decoded in 2006 .\nIt is a philosophical treatise on the nature of the gods, soul, the cosmos, and the nature of religious rituals.\nAnnouncing the inscription, UNESCO’s Director-General, Irina Bokova, noted that the purpose of the Programme‎ is to “preserve documentary heritage and memory for the benefit of present and future generations in the spirit of international cooperation and mutual understanding, building peace in the minds of women and men”.\n ", "external_links": ["http://en.unesco.org/news/international-advisory-committee-inscribes-47-new-nominations-unesco-memory-world-register", "http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-1/", "http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-derveni-papyrus-the-oldest-book-of-europe/", "http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/Museums/Archaeological_and_Byzantine/Arx_Thessaloniknhs.html", "http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2006/06/01/Oldest-papyrus-is-finally-decoded/23991149183747/"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:54:15.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
