(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson)\nAssociated Press Oct. 2, 2015 | 11:01 p.m. EDT + More NEW YORK (AP) â€” Three major league baseball games were postponed Friday as the East Coast faced steady rain with Hurricane Joaquin swirling in the Atlantic.\nIn New York, the Mets' chase for home-field advantage in their opening playoff series was put on hold when their game against the Washington Nationals was called off. They were scheduled to play a split doubleheader Saturday.\nThe New York Yankees' game in Baltimore and the Marlins-Phillies game in Philadelphia also were rained out and rescheduled as part of doubleheaders Saturday.\nHowever, that schedule may be in jeopardy as rain and wind are forecast throughout the weekend. The weather had already postponed racing on tracks and grass Friday.\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center said Joaquin's threat to the East Coast was fading as new forecasts showed it likely to curve out into the Atlantic while moving north and weakening in coming days.\nSo the NFL said it expected the Washington Redskins' home game against the Philadelphia Eagles to be played as scheduled Sunday at 1 p.m., though added it would continue monitoring the weather and be prepared to adjust if necessary.\nThe nearby University of Maryland did adjust, moving up the start time of its football game against No. 22 Michigan on Saturday from 8 p.m. to noon.\nIn Dover, Delaware, rain wiped out qualifying for the NASCAR playoff race Sunday at Dover International Speedway. Rain also washed out qualifying for the NHRA event in Mohnton, Pennsylvania.\nRain also was a factor in two college football games Friday night. In North Carolina, Temple splashed past Charlotte 37-3 for the Owls' first 4-0 start since 1974. In New Jersey, Princeton beat Columbia 10-5 to send the Lions to their 24th straight loss.\nThe Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey, canceled its thoroughbred racing cards for Friday and Saturday because of overnight rain and the forecast for more bad weather. All the races were to have been on grass.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
