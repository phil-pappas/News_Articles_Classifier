This new legislation will help increase the contribution standards make in these areas,\" Mr Goldsmith says. \nThe Bill follows a 2012 review of New Zealand’s standards regime which found the Standards Council was not financially sustainable in the medium to long term and there was a need to improve the current arrangements for delivering standards to users. \n\"It’s important to emphasise that the development and approval of standards in New Zealand will remain independent which is why this Bill creates an independent Standards Approval Board and a Standards Executive,\" Mr Goldsmith says. \nKey aspects of the Bill include: \nEstablishing a new independent statutory board to approve New Zealand Standards and membership of Standards development committees, and an independent Statutory Officer. \nRetaining and strengthening key elements of the current arrangements, such as codifying in legislation the role of technical experts in developing Standards \nLocating the Standards development function in the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment ensuring closer alignment with government objectives such as economic growth, international trade, innovation and health and safety \nStrengthening the existing cost recovery arrangements, by providing for full lifecycle costing of Standards and improved access to Standards. \nThe Bill also updates arrangements for accreditation in New Zealand to ensure they remain relevant to the needs of exporters and key domestic service providers. \nThe arrangements for accreditation will come into force immediately. \nNew arrangements for standards will come into force within 6 months, once the Standards Approval Board has been appointed. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:40:01.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
