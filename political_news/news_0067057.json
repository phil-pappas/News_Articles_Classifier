Adam Schiff (D-Burbank). \nAfter the California congressman issued a scathing assessment of a committee he said has proven to be a \"partisan exercise,\" Schiff turned to ask Clinton a friendly question on the stated purpose of the inquiry into the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, including Amb. J. Christopher Stevens. \n\"I know the ambassador was a friend of yours, and I wonder if you would like to comment on what it's like to be the subject of an allegation that you deliberately interfered with security that cost the life of a friend?\" Schiff asks. \nClinton was more than prepared to answer, calling the accusation \"personally painful.\" \n\"I would imagine I've thought more about what happened than all of you put together,\" she said of the panel’s 12 members. \"I've lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been wracking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been done.\" \n\"I will continue to speak out and do everything I can from whatever position I'm in to honor the memory of those we lost.\" \nA pro-Clinton group quickly distributed video of the answer, calling it \"one of the most personal moments of the hearing.\" Benghazi hearing audience includes more than a few members of Congress (Alex Wong / Getty Images) \nThe 12 members of the Select Committee on Benghazi sitting on the dais aren't the only members of Congress in the hearing room. \nSen. Joe Manchin said he wanted to see the tone of the hearing for himself. The West Virginia Democrat said he did not see a constructive proceeding as he left the chamber. \n\"We're talking about four lives,\" he said. \"If there's a problem, let's fix it. If there's a security breach, let's makes sure that we stop that. If there's people's lives in danger, let's make sure that we have the security we need to make sure it never happens again.\" \nAs Hillary Rodham Clinton testified, television cameras showed two House Democrats and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Joyce Beatty of Ohio and Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, over her shoulders. Stacks of Clinton emails make their hearing debut (Saul Loeb / AFP/Getty Images) \nIt didn't take long for some of those Hillary Rodham Clinton emails to make an appearance at the Benghazi Committee hearing, and rather theatrically at that. \nRep. Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), a former U.S. attorney, brought out two stacks of printed emails -- one that Clinton sent about Libya in 2011, and another that were sent in 2012, a year in which conditions on the ground were deteriorating and ultimately the Sept. 11 Benghazi attacks took place. \nWhy, Brooks wanted to know, did it seem that the situation in Libya \"fell off your radar\" just as the situation was getting worse, and what did it say about the \"culture\" she'd created at the State Department? \n\"I did not conduct most of the business that I did on behalf of our country on email,\" Clinton answered, adding that the more serious the situation, the more likely she was to be dealing with it in meetings with staff or in classified settings. \nWith her answer, Clinton took advantage of a key opportunity that Brooks set up for her. One of the primary arguments against Clinton using personal email rather than a government account was that it posed a risk if she were to transmit classified information on the server she kept in her home. \nClinton's answer pointed to the fact that she was far less likely to use email to begin with to address a major crisis like the Benghazi attacks. 8:36 A.M. Noah Bierman What it's like inside the Capitol right now \nMost of the people in the line that stretched down one of the longest hallways in the Capitol complex Thursday morning would not get a seat in the room where Hillary Rodham Clinton was testifying before the House Benghazi committee, meaning they might have had a better chance of watching her from their couch at home. \nBut they persisted, believing the dozens of television cameras crowding the halls of the Longworth House Office Building -- yes, they are marbled -- were on to something. \n\"This is going to be a historic hearing,\" said Eric Corley, 55, who said he boarded a train from New York at 3 a.m. with his friend Kyle Drosdick, 32, to get to the Capitol by about 7:30 a.m., for the 10 a.m. hearing. \nCongress is used to historic moments – some real, some less so. Just a month ago, Pope Francis addressed a special session, a moment so momentous that one lawmaker was compelled to steal a glass used by the pope to sip water. \nThere are usually a multitude of smaller orbits of news breaking out across the corridors. Even as people geared up to hear Clinton, the Senate was debating a cybersecurity bill that would have far-reaching consequences. Reporters were staking out a meeting of the Tuesday Group, a collection of Republicans who happened to be meeting on a Thursday to discuss whether Rep. Paul Ryan should serve as speaker. \nBut the main action was Benghazi. Even by congressional standards, it was chaotic. \nDozens of reporters were packed against the walls near the entrance to the building and around the hearing room, roped off as they waited to snap pictures of Clinton and her associates walking in. Microphone sticks and Klieg lights sprouted above them like wild bamboo stalks. But the witness saved her voice for answering questions. \nMaureen Dowd, the New York Times columnist who has feasted on Clinton stories for decades, was ushered past the throngs for a coveted seat in the chamber. \nA woman in an orange prison jumpsuit wandered by in hopes of drawing attention to her belief that Clinton should be prosecuted. \nInside, members of Congress tried to maintain the dignity of the process. 7:36 A.M. Michael A. Memoli In opening statement, Chairman Trey Gowdy defends Benghazi committee's work \nHow much has the political dynamic around the Benghazi Select Committee changed in the past month? Look at the opening statement from the panel's Republican chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. \nHis first words, after some initial housekeeping, were the names of the four victims of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks at the U.S. consulate. \n\"We owe them — and each other — the truth,\" Gowdy said, before going on to repeat that word, \"truth,\" 10 more times in a catalog of the questions his committee sought to answer. \nLater, he emphasized what this committee has uncovered that previous investigations had not. From his prepared text: \n\"So this committee is going to do what we pledged to do, and what should have been done long ago,\" Gowdy concluded. \"We are going to write that final, definitive accounting of what happened in Benghazi.\" 7:19 A.M.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:40:12.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
