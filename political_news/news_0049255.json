I send my sympathies to his family too.\" Share article \nLabour's Paul Farrelly added: \"Can I share the sentiments about Michael Meacher. He was, 30 years ago, the first Member of Parliament I ever met.\" \nA by-election will be held in Oldham West and Royton, where Mr Meacher enjoyed a comfortable 14,738 majority.
