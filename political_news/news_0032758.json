(Photo: Teresa Kroeger) CONNECT TWEET   \nAUSTIN -- After months of speculation, Vice President Joe Biden announced Wednesday afternoon at the White House he will not run for president in 2016. \nWalking into the Rose Garden with President Obama behind him, Biden announced the presidential bid encouraged by his late son Beau Biden wouldn't happen during the next election cycle. \n\"Beau is our inspiration. Unfortunately, I believe we're out of time,\" Biden said. \n\"First of all, you have to raise a ton of money, probably something upwards of a million dollars a day at this point,\" said Progress Texas executive director Ed Espinoza. \"Second of all, you have got to be able to get campaign staff in key states right away.\" Biden out, Democratic presidential field holds at four \nThe timing was further strained by looming deadlines by which the vice president would have to file the requisite paperwork to get on each state's primary ballot. The announcement initially means the Democratic field, which remains dominated by Hillary Clinton, will not expand. After former Sen. Jim Webb's withdrawal earlier this week, the total holds at four candidates. \nThe most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll shows the former secretary of state with 54 percent of Democrats' support, followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders with 23 percent. Biden's 16 percent is now ostensibly up for grabs. \n\"Those voters are looking for something that speaks to them,\" said Espinoza. \"I don't know exactly what that is just yet, but that's something that we'll get to explore.\" \nDemocrats have five more debates scheduled, with the next set for Nov. 14 at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa ( Go here for details). Republicans have nearly twice that left on the schedule, as more than a dozen candidates continue to jockey for attention. \nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told media Wednesday he's \"not ruling out and not ruling in any candidates.\" When it comes to his endorsement, \"Number one, I want to see a candidate who truly do more than talk, but take action to secure the border. Number two, we are tired of the broken Medicaid system as we have it. I want a president who will promise and commit to at least a block grant program.\" \nBack at the White House, Biden vowed to remain a player in 2016 -- if not a candidate. \n\"I will not be silent,\" said Biden. \"I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation.\" \nClinton similarly acknowledged in a statement, saying in part, \"I am confident that history isn't finished with Joe Biden.\" \n\"One of the things that has been missing in the campaign so far are people who are out actively defending the accomplishments of the administration,\" said Espinoza. \"That's what Biden can do. He can add that to the conversation.\"  //kvue.tv/1LMOQaO TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:04:16.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
