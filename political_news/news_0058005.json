Officials should be ensuring that they are sure it is a genuine article, not selling hard working taxpayers down the river.” \n“Mr Szekely’s comments that the decision to purchase wasn’t rushed isn’t reassuring. It suggests that his staff lack the necessary skills to be procuring our national heritage using the taxpayer chequebook.\" \nends New Zealand Taxpayers' Union \nNew Zealand's grassroots campaign for lower taxes and less government waste \nThe New Zealand Taxpayers' Union is an independent activist group, dedicated to being the voice for Kiwi taxpayers in the corridors of power.
