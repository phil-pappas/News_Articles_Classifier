More than half—52 percent—said it is somewhat difficult, while nearly a quarter said it is very difficult. Five percent of respondents say it’s not at all difficult to find qualified job candidates, while roughly 20 percent say it’s not very difficult. A majority of respondents—53 percent—says lack of the specific skills needed to perform well on a particular job is the biggest deficiency among unqualified applicants. Nineteen percent cited poor attitude and motivation. Lack of basic work habits, such as punctuality, was cited as the most common problem among unqualified job applicants by 12 percent of employers, and 8 percent said it was a poor grasp of basic educational skills. These results are in line with an October 2013 Snap Poll, when the same questions were asked. In that poll, 71 percent of respondents said it was hard to find qualified job candidates—47 percent said it was very difficult and 24 percent said somewhat difficult. Fifty-two percent cited lack of the specific skills needed to perform well on a particular job, and 21 percent pointed to poor attitude and motivation. Stronger private-sector hiring regionally has been evident in recent data released by the state Department of Labor. In August, private-sector job growth in metropolitan Rochester exceeded 2 percent for the third straight month. For the three-month period ended Aug. 31, private-sector employment in the region grew by an average of 2.3 percent—the best performance in at least two decades. Some employers say the quality of the labor force here is one of the Rochester area’s chief assets. Others say, however, that they might do even more hiring if the local pool of qualified applicants were larger. Nearly 300 readers participated in this week’s poll, conducted Oct. 19 and 20. In general, how difficult is it for your firm or organization to find qualified applicants to fill job openings?
