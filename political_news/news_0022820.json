(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\nAssociated Press Oct. 8, 2015 | 1:34 p.m. EDT + More By The Associated Press\nWASHINGTON (AP) — The latest on the chaos among House Republicans after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy withdrew his candidacy for speaker (all times local):\n___\n1:25 p.m.\nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy says in a statement that he's withdrawing from the race to be House speaker after it became clear that Republicans are so divided and it's necessary to pick a candidate who can unite them.\nThe announcement by the California Republican came as a shock to his colleagues. He says it's imperative for the GOP to come together and work together.\nMcCarthy says he's always put the interests of House Republicans ahead of his own — and that's what he's doing now.\n___\n1:10 p.m.\nThe White House is trying to make sense of Rep. Kevin McCarthy's withdrawal in the race for House speaker, and says it's conservatives who put their \"extreme ideology\" ahead of all else.\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest says it's easy to \"poke fun at the chaos\" triggered by McCarthy's stunning move. But Earnest says the challenge facing the next speaker is the same one that McCarthy would have faced — and what outgoing Speaker John Boehner had to deal with.\nEarnest says the next speaker will have to be able to tame the forces of a small but vocal group of lawmakers who a strong ideological bent — or find a way to \"buck up\" more mainstream House Republicans.\nThe spokesman says that means House Republicans must be willing to stop insisting on getting 100 percent of what they ask for amid divided government.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
