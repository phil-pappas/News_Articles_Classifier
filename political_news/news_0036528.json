Bernie Sanders. Clinton took 51 percent, up 11 points from the September poll, while Sanders remained statistically unchanged, at 40 percent. He earned 41 percent in last month's survey. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley earned 4 percent, with no other candidate receiving more than 1 percent support and 4 percent undecided.\nThe gender gap persists in the most recent poll, with 59 percent of women going for Clinton compared to just 33 percent for Sanders, who is the choice of 51 percent of men. Just 39 percent of men said they would caucus for Clinton.\nThe post-debate poll is more good news for Clinton in Iowa, after the former secretary of state earned 48 percent to Sanders' 41 percent in a Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register survey conducted by Selzer & Co. that came out on Thursday .\nAmong those who watched the debate, 62 percent said Clinton did the best job, while 31 percent thought Sanders did. Just 3 percent said O'Malley won the event.\nPhoto gallery\nHillary on the hot seat: 31 looks from the Benghazi hearing By Diana Dâ€™Abruzzo\nClinton and Sanders led the field when it comes to net favorability, at 66 points and 75 points, respectively. On personal attributes, such as trustworthiness and honesty, Sanders earned a higher share of praise from Democrats. But when asked about experience to be president, 92 percent said Clinton has it, while just 60 percent said the same of Sanders. On leadership, too, 92 percent of Democrats said she had the desirable qualities, but 71 percent said the same of Sanders.\nThe poll was conducted Oct. 14-20, surveying 592 likely Iowa Democratic caucus participants via landlines and cellphones. The margin of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2292"], "published": "2015-10-23T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:24:55.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
