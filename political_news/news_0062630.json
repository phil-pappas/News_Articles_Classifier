Paul Ryan, a Republican from Janesville, remains in the mix to take over as House speaker. The GOP caucus meets Tuesday night and Wednesday morning to try to solve its leadership crisis. By Craig Gilbert of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 20, 2015 11:48 a.m. (0) Comments \nWashington, D.C. — Will he or won't he? \nWith the prospect of a Paul Ryan speakership still dangling, House Republicans were poised for back-to-back meetings Tuesday night and Wednesday morning that should begin to clarify their leadership crisis. \n\"He's not wringing his hands. He's not calling thousands of people saying, 'What do I do now?' \" said Steve King, a Republican National Committee member from Wisconsin who has known Ryan throughout his political career. \"He knows what the upsides and downsides are and all the rest. It's (a matter of) having come to a crossroads, does he want to take it or not?\" \nHaving spent past week at home with his family in Janesville during a congressional break, Ryan was returning to Washington Tuesday with the pressure and urgency building over his political future and the Republican leadership void. \nThe House GOP conference has closed door meetings Tuesday and Wednesday at which colleagues hope to hear from Ryan, who has said repeatedly he's not running for the job of speaker. \nDespite a broad desire among party leaders and lawmakers to see him take the office, two hurdles have to be overcome. One is Ryan's oft-stated lack of interest in a House leadership role, which would cut short his chairmanship of the powerful Ways and Means committee and cut further into time with his wife and three children. \nThe Ways and Means chair is a career-long ambition of Ryan's that he realized less than a year ago, and a platform for his policy dreams of overhauling the tax code and federal entitlements. \n\"It's why I've passed on Senate races and other things (like) leadership. I always believed the chairmanship of Ways and Means was the right place for me,\" Ryan told the Journal Sentinel this past January, when he announced his decision not to run for president in 2016. \"Now that I have it, I'm very happy with where I am.\" \nThe other hurdle is an organized minority of conservatives in the House — known as the Freedom Caucus — that wants concessions from the next speaker over rules and procedures that would give it more say. \nAn analysis by the Pew Research Center of 36 members of the Freedom Caucus found they are not only more conservative but less experienced than House Republicans as a whole; more than 70% entered office since the 2010 elections. \nRyan's allies have said he has no desire to assume leadership of a caucus that is hostage to a small conservative faction that helped drive House Speaker John Boehner to announce his resignation, and helped push Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy out of the race to replace him. \nLeaders of the Freedom Caucus say they're open to a Ryan speakership but won't renounce a list of demands that may be unacceptable to Ryan. \nHouse Republicans, meanwhile, face a series of potentially divisive battles this fall over raising the debt ceiling, funding the government, and the future of the Export-Import Bank. \nIn a national poll of GOP primary voters released Monday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, 63% said they'd be \"comfortable and positive\" about a Ryan speakership, while 28% said they would \"skeptical and uncertain.\" \nKing, the RNC member from Wisconsin, said he thought Ryan's decision would come down to whether he thinks there is not only a good chance but a near certainty he can make the speakership work. \n\"As difficult as many assume this is for him, it is probably not...He's got a really good grasp\" of the pros and cons, said King.
