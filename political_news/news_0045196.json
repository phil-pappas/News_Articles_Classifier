So far, it has not received a reply from the government.\nTo show their strength, the association plans to bring about 10,000 ex-paramilitary personnel for the sit-in. The association had sent a 10-point memorandum to Prime Minister Modi on September 26 and last week sought appointments with Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh besides Venkaiah Naidu.\nThere are more than 50 such associations of former employees from BSF, CRPF, ITBP, CISF, SSB and Assam Rifles that come under an umbrella of National Coordination Committee (NCC) of ex-paramilitary forces personnel welfare associations.\nThough the NCC is neither in favour nor has approved any dharna or strike by Ex-CPMFs personnel association at any place on OROP, the Kerala-based association wants to go ahead.\nHowever, in private, many serving paramilitary personnel, including senior officers, concede that they have been not been taken seriously by the government for not being vocal like the defence forces personnel.\n\"There is no difference between the Army and paramilitary forces. Rather we bear more brunt throughout the year in counter-insurgency ops in J&K, Northeast and Naxal areas. There are hardly any peace postings for us like the Army. Why we should not be considered Armed forces,\"said a senior BSF official.\nThe para-military officials also claim that their name was changed from central paramilitary forces (CPMFs) to central armed police forces (CAPFs) under a well thought out design to show them inferior to the Army and they should be renamed as CPMFs.\n\"We will resolve the issue peacefully. It is a just demand and possible for the government,\" said association's general secretary, P S Nair.\nThe BJP government that has already agreed to OROP for three wings of defence forces maintains that the rationale of early retirement applicable for ex-servicemen is not correct for paramilitary personnel as till the rank of commandant they can retire at 57 years of age and from DIG onward, at 60 years.\nBut the paramilitary forces personnel consider this argument bogus as according to Nair, \"Over 35,000 paramilitary personnel have quit the forces between 2010 and June 2013 due to this discrimination. Unlike Army personnel, they only get minimum pension. The attrition rate is only expected to go up if such double standards prevail.\"\nBesides OROP, the Association wants an \"Ex-Servicemen status\", CSD Canteen facilities at par with the Defence personnel, a Paramilitary Welfare Board on lines of the Sainik Welfare Board and exemption from New Pension Scheme of 2004 which is contributory scheme.\n10-point memorandum to PM\nTo show their strength, the association plans to bring about 10,000 ex-paramilitary personnel for the sit-in.
