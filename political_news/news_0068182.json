(Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) September 30 at 5:22 PM The Sept. 27 Metro article “ Purple Line’s riders a question ” noted there are strong arguments that ridership predictions may have been dramatically inflated for the Purple Line transit project in Maryland. The article showed that the information was given to the public in a confusing way that could not be challenged. The area where it will be built is already very well served by public transportation and roads: Metrobus, University of Maryland buses, College Park and Silver Spring Metro stops, and on and on.\nDespite the denials in the article, it’s obvious to people who live in the area that the ridership predictions were set high to get the money and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) support for the project. I only wish we had this information six or eight months ago, before Mr. Hogan signed on to the Purple Line .\nVic Simon , Takoma Park\n●\nThe article “ Purple Line’s riders a question ” cited a Federal Transit Administration study indicating that only nine of 18 recent U.S. transit projects reached their ridership projections. Another review found that seven exceeded projections.\nWise practitioners use judgment to some extent in all forecasting. All forecasts involve some judgment, but judgments should not produce all forecasts. Maryland Transit Administration ridership forecasts were projections chosen from a series of possibilities based on currently plausible assumptions. As is common in observational and inductive forecasting, the MTA extrapolated from trends using time series and recent survey data. The FTA found its assumptions and methods reasonable.\nBut better data and forecasts will not resolve the confrontational standoff between opponents and supporters of this project. What should be clear is that light-rail systems are successful and cost-effective where they add transit trips but alleviate traffic congestion on existing urban corridors (as in Portland, Ore.), stimulate secondary economic development rather than trying to induce it in the first place (Baltimore’s did not) and generate substantial ridership and revenue. The Purple Line meets these criteria.\nGeorge Guess , Potomac\n●\nThe recent discussion of the predicted ridership for the Purple Line did not mention the low demand for public transit in the Bethesda/New Carrollton corridor.\nThe Metrobus service in this corridor has been reduced over the past decade for lack of riders. The J4 express bus service from Bethesda to College Park (which I ride routinely to the University of Maryland) operates only during rush hours. It usually leaves Bethesda with fewer than a half-dozen passengers and very seldom is more than half full during its trips. The Bethesda/Silver Spring Metrobuses (which I use often) are seldom full during the rush hours and are virtually empty the rest of the time, even though this service also continues to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and the Westfield Montgomery mall.\nMost of the proposed Purple Line stations do not have any parking areas, and these stations will serve only those who live within a reasonable walking distance. Given all these facts, it is not clear where all the estimated ridership will come from.\nRolf Sinclair , Chevy Chase", "external_links": ["http://www.purplelinemd.com/en/about-the-project/stations"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:23:35.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
