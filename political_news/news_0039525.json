Chances are, you’re reading this after returning home from church.\nI want to share something with you that is going to blow your mind.\nResearchers in Spain conducted an experiment to see how unborn children respond to sound stimuli. We already know that unborn babies start to feel pain around 20-weeks gestation, but up until now, we had no idea when they started responding to sound.\nSo, researchers conducted experiments playing music and then using an ultrasound machine to monitor 16-week old babies' responses.\nAs soon as the unborn babies heard the music, they started moving their mouths “as if they were trying to speak or sing.” That’s not my analysis. That is straight from the scientific study itself.\nYou can watch the video here . If anyone ever tells you that an unborn child isn't a person, show them this.\nTwo weeks ago, Democrats shamefully blocked a bill that would have protected babies like this. Republicans have given up. They’re not interested in actually winning this fight. They are only interested in pandering to you and saying that they “tried.”\nTrying isn’t good enough! Tell Congress to STOP Democrats from filibustering this common sense pro-life legislation!\nNot only did the Left vote against the 20+ week abortion ban (the point when babies feel pain and can survive outside the womb) but the Democrats also blocked legislation that would have forced doctors to care for babies born alive after botched abortions.\nSo even though a baby could survive and grow into adulthood, Democrats protected a woman’s right to abort it for whatever reason she wants. Then, if the baby ends up surviving the abortion procedure, Democrats protected a doctor and woman’s right to commit infanticide and let the baby die.\nThis is what we are up against. This isn’t about a video of Planned Parenthood executives selling babies’ body parts. This is about an entire political party so entrenched that they eagerly vote for infanticide.\nThe Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would have saved 27+ babies a day. These are babies that, if born alive, stand a good chance of surviving. The Democrats blocked this legislation from even coming for a vote on September 22, 2015.\nDo you know what that means? Since then, at least 513 survivable babies were murdered in the womb. These are babies who would survive outside the womb if given a chance.\nThe Republicans are master manipulators. They are experts at “doing something” and then letting the issue fade from the headlines. Both John Boehner and Mitch McConnell said that if we want to protect the unborn, we need a Republican President.\nIf we wait that long, we won’t be talking about 513 babies murdered. That number will swell to over 13 THOUSAND! These are babies that can survive outside the womb and realize, this number only represents 1% of total abortions.\nNo, we cannot wait another year. If Congress won’t fulfill its duty and protect the most vulnerable among us… If Congress will just sit back and let its members vote for infanticide… then We the People will rise up and take Congress back.\nBut we can’t do it alone. We need your help!\nFaxBlast Congress today demanding another vote to protect the unborn! Don’t let them condemn these innocent children to death!\nNot ready to give up on this,\nMax McGuire\nConservative Daily", "external_links": ["http://www.conservative-daily.com//feed/https://app.advocacytoaction.com/campaign.aspx?id=1499&#038;utm_source=blog&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_campaign=1499", "http://store.truthgear.net/collections/flags/products/3x5-culpepper-minutemen-liberty-or-death-dont-tread-on-me-flag-white", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/advocacytoaction.com/304_bfb003f6-4160-430b-99cf-1f329acccef2.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9AWjb0D8gw"], "published": "2015-10-11T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:01:28.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
