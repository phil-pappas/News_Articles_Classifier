I'm calling a drone Washington (CNN) South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham had a fairly cutting assessment Friday for why Ben Carson is doing so well in polls and other Republicans are doing so poorly. \"He's a lovely man, he's a great doctor. And everybody else thinks we suck,\" Graham said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday. \"So that's all, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, I can't understand what he's saying half the time. You know, he's a brilliant guy, but I don't think he has a clue about what's going on in the Middle East. So what can I tell you?\" Graham, who has been trailing at the back of the Republican field since he entered the race, also offered a blunt assessment of his own chances.

If I don't do well in New Hampshire, I'll have to reevaluate,\" Graham said. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:25:08.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
