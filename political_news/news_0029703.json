During this period, dozens of red and blue states decided to spend less money incarcerating nonviolent drug offenders and to use the savings on drug treatment and other programs aimed at reducing the likelihood that prisoners would re-­offend. In nearly every case, these states were able to cut both their incarceration and their crime rates.\nFar from offering a free lunch, presidential candidates from both parties are proposing that the federal government heed these happy results and seek to replicate this successful approach in Washington. They should be applauded, not criticized, for doing so.\nJulie Stewart , Washington\nThe writer is president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums.", "external_links": ["http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/multimedia/data-visualizations/2014/imprisonment-and-crime", "https://www.bja.gov/programs/justicereinvestment/success_stories.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:15:13.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
