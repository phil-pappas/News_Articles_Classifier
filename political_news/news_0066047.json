Many of the complaints center around continuous decreases in the per-mile rates drivers get, the elimination of fees charged if a customer cancels a booked trip and the inability for passengers to tip.\nSome people who signed up to drive for the mid-priced UberSelect platform also complained at being forced to take passengers from cheaper platforms. Some said they pay for more expensive cars so they can pick up passengers using the UberSelect platform, which provides higher profit.\n“They’re forcing us to take calls that don’t make money,” said Wade Spradlin.\nUber officials did not address specific questions about many drivers’ claims on Friday but said they welcome their feedback.\n“Each week, tens of thousands of drivers across the U.S. begin using the Uber app to make money on their own time, to reach their own goals,” said spokeswoman Debbee Hancock. “Drivers say they value the flexibility and the chance to be their own boss, and choose Uber over other options because it fits around their life and works for them.\nDrivers’ demands While the company refers to drivers as “partners,” many on Friday said that Uber treats them more like employees because it unilaterally changes prices and policies without consulting or warning them. Drivers said, though, that the company’s revenues are due to the low overhead that comes with classifying them as contractors.\nThe strikes in cities across the U.S. highlight brewing nationwide tensions between the popular company and its workforce. Drivers want the company to give customers the option to tip drivers, raise all fares 60 percent and set minimum charges and cancellation fees at $7 each. But it’s unclear what, if any, effect the strikes will have in North Texas or elsewhere.\nBoth UberX and UberXL, the two cheapest platforms on the app, were at surge pricing in downtown Friday, though it’s not known if that was related to the protest and strike.\nOne driver claimed that he was deactivated from the app after participating in a meeting about this weekend’s strikes, but a company spokeswoman denied that claim. Hancock said the company does not punish drivers who choose to sit out for a weekend or exercise their free speech rights.\n‘Financial crisis’ Many of the North Texas drivers’ complaints Friday echoed criticisms that arose last month when hundreds of drivers for the most expensive Uber platform went on strike and protested in Dallas. After a weekend-long strike, the company rescinded a directive to UberBlack drivers that they take cheaper fares or face being penalized for denying trips.\nBut UberBlack drivers in Dallas are much more organized than drivers for other platforms because many of them also work for limo companies, which have a cohesive professional association. While that association organized last month’s protest, it is not involved in this weekend’s strike.\nUber offers different levels of service through its single app. UberX is the cheapest and relies on people who drive sedans like Nissan Altimas or small SUVs like Mazda CX5s. A customer’s minimum fare for an UberX ride is $4.20. That’s up from $3.50 a month ago.\nMid-tier service UberSelect offers rides in newer and more expensive cars like Audi S4s and Lexus LXs. The minimum fare is $9.20.\nDrivers say they typically make 75 percent to 80 percent of fares — if the customer’s cost exceeds the minimum charge amount. Uber gets a larger share of minimum fares, drivers said. For instance, $2.20 of a minimum $4.20 UberX fare goes to the company, while $2 goes to the driver.\nAnother complaint is that the distance between drivers and the customers they are paired with has increased dramatically. Drivers said they used to only have to drive a few minutes to reach a passenger but are now being matched with people who are 20 minutes or more away.\nMeanwhile, new regulations in North Texas have increased the amount drivers pay for insurance and permits on top of what they were already paying for car loans, maintenance and upkeep.\nDrivers said on Friday that a combination of new factors means they’re now higher overhead while sometimes having to drive farther to pick up people. If that passenger is making a short trip, like in dense areas like Uptown, the driver ends up earning $2. And if they drive several miles only to have the customer cancel in hopes of rebooking and finding a closer driver, they end up making nothing.\n“It has put me into a financial crisis,” said driver Megan Butler.\nOn Twitter:\n @brandonformby", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brandonformby"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:01:57.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
