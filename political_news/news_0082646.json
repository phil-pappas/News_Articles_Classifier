Ford — $2.4 billion over budget and threatening to go higher.\nInitially planned in 2002, the ship was forecast to cost $10.5 billion when ordered in 2008. Now the price tag has ballooned to $12.9 billion — up more than 20 percent.\nSen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican chairman of the committee, said the ship — with a series of new systems — has become one of the most complex and expensive defense projects in history.\n“It has also become unfortunately one of the most spectacular acquisition debacles in recent memory — and that’s saying something,” McCain said Thursday.\nThe “original sin” was trying to do too much new in the carrier, he said, adding that the Ford failure cannot be repeated.\n“We cannot afford to pay $12.9 billion for a single ship,” McCain said.\nThe Gerald R. Ford honors the late president who guided the nation through the end of the Vietnam War. The Michigan congressman from Grand Rapids was named by President Richard Nixon as vice president after Spiro Agnew resigned and became president when Nixon resigned.\nFord served aboard the USS Monterey in the Pacific Ocean during World War II and was the first president to serve aboard an aircraft carrier.\nArizona’s senior senator said the defense’s acquisition programs are “dysfunctional” with “poor cost estimates” and “unrealistic business cases.” McCain said no one at the Pentagon has ever been held accountable for the problems.\n“Everyone is responsible so no one is responsible,” he said, adding that Congress did not do enough as well to hold the Navy accountable.\nMcCain noted that the first two ships are more than $6 billion over budget. The second carrier — named after John F. Kennedy — is now five years behind schedule and the Navy began building the second ship before it had even completed the work on the first ship. McCain says Congress must figure out what went wrong and determine if any reforms to defense purchases could prevent future failures.\nSen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the top Democrat on the committee, agreed that the program has been “plagued by delays” and cost overruns.\nThe Kennedy’s costs have risen by more than $2 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office says it could rise another $1 billion.\nThe Pentagon’s assistant secretary of defense for acquisition, Katharina McFarland, told the Senate they are working to correct the problems but it “will not be easy. The timeline and complexities associated with the construction of aircraft carriers are enormous and sensitive to a wide range of technological, economic, policy and business factors, many of which cannot be predicted in time to be readily mitigated.”\ndshepardson@detroitnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:00:21.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
