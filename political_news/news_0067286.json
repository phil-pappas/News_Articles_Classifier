The city will receive $1.8 million from the overall per capita distribution, plus an additional $850,155 as one of four casino host cities.\nCleveland will see $2.69 million, Cincinnati $2 million and Toledo $1.45 million, according to the taxation report available online.  \nThe state’s largest cities and counties get money on a per-capita basis. That totaled $7.9 million and $33.9 million, respectively, for July through September.\nAnother $22.6 million went into a fund distributed to public and charter schools, with $1.9 million apiece going to the Ohio Casino Control Commission and the Ohio Racing Commission. A law enforcement fund and problem gambling fund each receives $1.3 million.\nThe money comes from a 33-percent tax levied on casinos. The totals do not include revenue from the state’s seven horse track racinos which are regulated by the Ohio Lottery Commission.\n@ohioaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:29:38.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
