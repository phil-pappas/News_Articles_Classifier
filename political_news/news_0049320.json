Jerry Brown. \nSenate Bill 178, authored by Sens. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, and Joel Anderson, R-Alpine, was among a raft of bills Brown acted on Thursday -- including his veto of a law to help thousands of students stranded by the collapse of Corinthian Colleges -- as Sunday's midnight deadline approaches. \nA diverse coalition of leading tech companies and civil rights organizations backed SB 178, which some law enforcement organizations initially opposed. Google, Facebook, Apple and other tech giants have seen a surge in requests for data information from police. Brown vetoed a similar bill several years ago, so his position on the issue was unclear until now. \n\"For too long, California's digital privacy laws have been stuck in the Dark Ages, leaving our personal emails, text messages, photos and smartphones increasingly vulnerable to warrantless searches,\" Leno said. \"That ends today.\" \nBrown also took action on a number of higher education bills Thursday, signing into law Assembly Bill 288, authored by Assemblyman Chris Holden, D-Pasadena, which expands opportunities for high school students to be concurrently enrolled at community colleges, and Assembly Bill 1000, authored by Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, D-San Diego, which gives CSU students greater say over fee increases.

Still, he said it would be \"premature\" to create a legal assistance grant program, and that he wasn't comfortable adding new costs to the general fund outside of the budget process. \nThe bill also would have made it possible for some students to use grants to attend new colleges. \nThe news came as a disappointment to legal advocates who say they have been overwhelmed by students needing assistance. \n\"Students all over the state have been facing nearly insurmountable challenges as they try to manage their debt and find their way to other educational institutions,\" Angela Perry, Law Fellow at Public Advocates, said in a statement. \"...Without the benefits of AB 573, they will be left to fend for themselves.\" \nBrown also vetoed six other bills, including ones that would have created a dozen new superior court judgeships, made it easier for members of the Air Force to receive a type of Cal Grant and expanded the definition of proprietary security officer to include bouncers who work at night clubs and bars.
