'One of the patients, Seluleko Biyela had a dog bite recently then when he was taken to Eshowe Provincial Hospital he was told that there are no anti-dog bite vaccine. When I contacted the Matron at the hospital she told me that such vaccines are out stock and they will try to source them from other hospitals. This is totally outrageous and lack of leadership by Eshowe Provincial Hospital management. The hospital management must be held accountable,' said IFP Spokesperson on Health, Mrs Ncamisile Nkwanyana, MPL. 'It is horrible to be told that you cannot get the treatment you want from public healthcare facilities. There is absolutely no excuse for the dire and dangerous shortage of medications in KZN public hospitals. Doctors need to track down medication to make sure patients' needs are being met. It's like having a shortage of water,' continued Mrs Nkwanyana. 'If the MEC is at all serious about addressing this problem' he will ensure full transparency on the reasons why thousands of South Africans are not getting the healthcare they need and deserve. We call on MEC Dr Dhlomo to table a report to the Legislature's portfolio committee on how his department intends to address this matter and how to prevent a drug stock-out in future,' concluded Mrs Nkwanyana.
