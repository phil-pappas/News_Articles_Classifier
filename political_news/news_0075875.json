The group was highly impressed about the meeting involving the leadership of the two main political parties. \nVice Chairman of the group Alhassan Jamal called for continuous dialogue between the NPP and NDC in order to foster unity and partnership that can alleviate poverty in the Northern Region. \nAlhassan Jamal however appealed to government to ensure that their friends who are in prison custody over violence-related allegations are freed. \nNPP Northern Regional Youth organizer Alhaji Rashid COP admonished: \"We are all one. Politics shouldn’t divide us. Let's foster unity among ourselves. Poverty should be our enemy not political opponents”. \nThe Deputy National Youth Organizer of the NDC Kobby Balon called on the Youth to take advantage of government interventions for the youth to engage themselves in useful activities. \nBACKGROUND TO THE ISSUE \nThe Tamale High Court presided over by Justice Lawrence Mensah in 2013, sentenced a youth activist of the opposition New Patriotic Party, Yakubu Yahuza, to death by hanging. He was found guilty of murder and conspiracy to murder. Four other activists of the party Abibu Dagbana, Majeed Alhassan, Alhassan Sayibu and Imoro Gundaana, were also convicted for conspiracy to murder and where to serve 36 years in prison. The decision was a unanimous one taken by a seven-member jury. The five were arrested in February 2009 following a political clash between NPP and NDC youth in Tamale, resulting in the death of Rashid Alhassan, a youth activist of the NDC. Several houses, vehicles and motorbikes and other valuables properties in Gumbihini, Choggu and other surrounding communities in the Tamale metropolis were also set ablaze.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:17:08.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
