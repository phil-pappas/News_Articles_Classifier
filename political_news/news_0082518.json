House Republicans are frantically lobbying Ryan to run for speaker after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly ditched his bid Thursday for speaker, leaving a gaping hole atop the fractious Republican Conference and no obvious successor to John Boehner.\nThe Wisconsin Republican is getting bombarded with calls and one-on-one appeals from GOP lawmakers urging him to be the party's white knight. Boehner has had multiple conversations with the Ways and Means chairman. Even before he dropped his own bid, McCarthy told Ryan he should do it. And the list goes on: House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) spoke to him about it on the House floor, and Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) has also pushed Ryan to reconsider.\nIt's unclear whether the 2012 vice presidential candidate will. Soon after after McCarthy's blockbuster decision Thursday, Ryan released a statement that “while I am grateful for the encouragement I’ve received, I will not be a candidate.”\nBehind McCarthy's decision to bail By Jake Sherman , Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan\nBut then the arm-twisting began. When asked later in the day whether he would run for speaker, Ryan said, “I have no comment.”\nAmid the pressure, Ryan canceled all of his fundraising activity over the next 48 hours.\nGOP lawmakers are scrambling to find a replacement after McCarthy's sudden departure from the speaker's race and Boehner slated to leave Congress at the end of the month. Boehner, who said he will stay on as speaker until a successor is chosen, scheduled a Friday meeting with the Republican conference to figure out how to move forward.\nIt took no time for Ryan name ti surface, yet again, as the best candidate who could unite the divided conference and shepherd through the divided House must-pass legislation such as raising the debt ceiling and keeping the government funded.\n“He is uniquely gifted and qualified for that position,” South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said, who has also resisted calls to run for a top leadership job. He called Ryan the “smartest kid in the class.”\nCalifornia Republican Devin Nunes also is pressing Ryan to jump in.\n“I think Paul Ryan is the only eligible candidate,” Nunes said.\nAfter McCarthy's exit, who's in the running to replace Boehner? By Lauren French\nRyan, 45, said he wasn't interested in being speaker after Boehner's surprise resignation announcement earlier this month. Ryan cited his desire to spend time with his young family.\nAs the full-court-press for Ryan plays out, several other members are also considering bids for the top job. Georgia Republican Lynn Westmoreland and Texas Reps. Mike Conaway and Bill Flores are among the names that have been floated. Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) are also continuing their bids for the speakership.\nSome lawmakers have called for a “caretaker” speaker to wield the gavel until after the 2016 election. Retiring Reps. John Kline (Minn.) and Candice Miller (Mich.) were among the names mentioned as possibilities for an interim assignment.\nBut momentum for the “caretaker” idea had already begun to lose steam by late Thursday. Miller, for instance, said she wasn't interested in being interim speaker, and was against having a \"caretaker\" in the post, anyway.\nAnd the reality is any fill-in would face all the same intra-party factionalism that sank Boehner and McCarthy, while lacking the ability to cut long-term deals with them or Democrats. To many Republicans, a \"caretaker\" speaker is the worst possible option.\nBut not every House Republican believes Ryan is up to the challenge of becoming speaker.\n“I fully respect Paul Ryan’s position that he’s got a young family (and) that he remains committed to them,” Flores said. “We’ve got 246 great folks [in the Republican Conference], and I think there’s somebody in there we’ll find that can be a unifying leader that can advance a bold positive vision.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:37:01.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
