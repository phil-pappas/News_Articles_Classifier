Vaz was equally sharp on John Prescott, whom he had spotted chatting to Tory MP Edward Garnier in the cheap seats towards the back of the committee room. “Please be quiet, Lord Prescott,” Keith barked. John of Hull’s expression turned to thunder. \nThe session had begun with the police bickering among themselves about their handling of a specific rape allegation from a ‘Jane from Yorkshire’ against the late Lord Brittan. DCI Settle, who had been in charge of the original investigation and quickly concluded there was no evidence on which to proceed, said he had felt betrayed when a letter from Watson to the director of public prosecutions had resulted in the police reopening the investigation. “What have you been doing since?” Vaz asked. “Nothing much,” said Settle. Traffic duty, presumably.\nYou don’t get to be top brass in the Met without quickly learning how to dob your juniors in it, so assistant commissioner Patricia Gallan was quite happy to let her deputy, Steve Rodhouse, take all the difficult hits. Rodhouse did his best to sound earnestly professional as he described the decision to re-open the investigation as normal procedure rather than a panic measure to reassure the public that the Met hadn’t done a cover-up. But the panic in his eyes told a different story.\nThe cops were just the warm-up act, though. The main event was Watson, from whom the committee was determined to extract a proper apology to Lady Brittan for the comments he had made about her husband after his death. There was disappointment on the faces of some members of the committee when Watson readily agreed to make just such an apology within minutes of his arrival. They had come expecting a fight and were disconcerted to find there was none to be had: so, having got Watson in front of the committee for an hour, they had to contrive one.\nThe session quickly turned tribal with Conservative MPs out to portray Watson as an irresponsible self-publicist who had done no one a favour by claiming that dozens of former MPs had been paedophiles and rapists. Tory MPs in particular. “You haven’t been accusing MPs from other parties,” James Berry moaned, wondering why Watson hadn’t been screaming “paedo” at dozens of Labour and Lib Dem politicians. “I have been vocal about Lord Janner,” Watson replied, to no one but Berry’s surprise.\nVaz and David Winnick took a more softly, softly approach. Vaz went out of his way to point out that the committee must restrict itself to the ‘Jane’ allegations rather than any other allegations that might still be outstanding against Lord Brittan, thereby reminding everyone that there were further allegations outstanding. Winnick took a different tack by praising his new boss for his work in securing three convictions and wondering why the committee had failed to summon Zac Goldsmith, who had been equally – if not more – vocal about Lord Brittan. Even Lord Brittan’s family have been asking themselves the same question.\n“I have no idea why Zac has not been called,” said Watson. Quickly realising his error in referring to the Tory MP for Richmond by his first name in front of Keith, Watson tried to redeem himself only to compound his error by elevating the mayoral candidate to a peerage. “I meant Lord Goldsmith,” he said. Keith let that one through. After all, it’s only a matter of time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:10:01.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
