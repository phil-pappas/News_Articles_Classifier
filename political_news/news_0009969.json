McCarthy | News Political Reporter | @bobmccarthybn on October 12, 2015 - 7:52 PM Tweet ADVERTISEMENT \nRepublican challenger Raymond W. Walter isn’t tipping his hand about Wednesday’s debate against Democratic County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz. \nFor that matter, neither is the incumbent. \nBut it’s almost a given among political experts that an underdog like Walter – trailing in the polls, hampered by puny campaign funds and competing in overwhelmingly Democratic Erie County – needs to do something, anything, to gain the attention of a voting public that so far seems not even mildly interested. \nIt all adds up to an overwhelming – but fascinating – challenge for Walter. Indeed, a veteran debating expert, professor Charles J. Wigley III of Canisius College, said the techniques used by two seasoned lawyer/politicians grappling in the campaign’s only debate should provide for compelling television. \n“The best hope for Walter is if, at the end of the debate, people are thinking about the issues he has raised,” he said, “That’s a very good outcome for him.” \nFor Poloncarz, meanwhile, the trick is to ensure that voters are not focusing on the details raised by Walter, but on the big picture of his administration’s accomplishments. \n“Whose agenda are they focusing on at the end of the debate?” he said. \nWigley, a professor of communication studies and a college debate coach for many years, acknowledged Walter’s opportunity as the Amherst assemblyman vies for the slightest speck of attention. He sees the challenger attempting to accomplish three goals: \n• Establish two or three issues already critical to voters that need to be resolved. \n• Show that Poloncarz, for whatever reason, is unwilling to resolve those issues to the voters’ satisfaction. \n• Demonstrate that he can take the appropriate initiatives to address those issues. \n“Walter can present his best case by staying focused on the issues and getting Poloncarz caught up in the details,” Wigley said. “He should want the debate to end on affirmative ground – realistic change.” \nFor Poloncarz, he advises viewers to decide whether he has convinced them to focus on: \n• His reservoir of goodwill and trustworthiness. \n• Voters’ unmet needs and the importance of working toward his already established long-term goals. \n• What he has already accomplished in his first term. \n“Poloncarz can present his best case by staying focused on his own goodwill, his expertise, and shared values with the voters,” Wigley said. “In the debate, his worst mistake would be getting caught up in discussing issues raised by Walter throughout the debate.” \nIf he were coaching both, Wigley said, he would advise Walter to attack with details, and for Poloncarz to avoid details and concentrate on the big picture. \nBoth candidates are reported to be preparing intensely for Wednesday’s faceoff, with one source reporting at least one mock debate session within the Poloncarz camp. Both sides have also established specific objectives. \n“This one will not be a snoozer,” promised County Republican Chairman Nicholas A. Langworthy. “When it’s over, you will see a clear contrast. You will not be left empty-handed.” \nIn his campaign so far, Walter has concentrated on a proposal to alter the sales tax distribution formula to include more aid for towns – where the bulk of the county’s Republican voters live. Poloncarz scoffs at the notion because of a host of legal impediments not likely to be overturned any time soon. \nBut Langworthy says the GOP candidate will make his case Wednesday in a way that appeals to television viewers, and hinted that Walter will accuse Poloncarz of presiding over a liberal county government out of sync with most local voters. \n“This is the most liberal administration in the history of Erie County government,” Langworthy said. \nLangworthy also said Walter will question how Poloncarz can claim credit for the region’s recent economic gains, and will emphasize the role of the national economic recovery, as well as the Buffalo Billion program stemming from Albany. \n“He can’t point to one single accomplishment the state is not really responsible for,” Langworthy said, including relief from last November’s massive snowstorm, economic-development progress, renewal of the county’s stadium lease with the Buffalo Bills, and the Buffalo Billion. \n“When this is over, you’ll see one candidate telling us where we want to go and the other congratulating himself for how he handled the storm and the national economic recovery,” Langworthy added. \nCounty Democratic Chairman Jeremy J. Zellner said he believes that voters are familiar – and satisfied – with the county executive’s first term. He said Poloncarz is likely to highlight job creation and a general upswing in the area economy on his watch. He also expects Poloncarz to confront Walter’s “fair share tax gimmick.” \n“Ray is going to swing for the fences some in the next few weeks for sure,” Zellner said, “and I don’t see that getting traction.” \nZellner said Poloncarz will instead offer a simple message revolving around what he has accomplished in four years and “where he will take the community.” \nFrom what he can see of the pulse of the community, Zellner added, it “feels good.” \nThose who have been there before – including Democrats Daniel J. Ward and James P. Keane, who have unsuccessfully run for county executive – say that in addition to how the contestants explain the issues, viewers will watch how they handle themselves. \n“I think Walter has a tough race in a largely Democratic county against a strong incumbent,” said Keane, who lost to Republican Chris Collins in 2007. “Maybe he should just make the case and try to position himself for the future. Mark, meanwhile, should just be himself.” \nWard, who lost to Republican Joel A. Giambra in 2003, said he expects Walter to point out the “foibles and chinks in the armor” of his opponent. He must also remember that voters are disenchanted at the moment with all levels of government. \nBut he also thinks Poloncarz needs to set his own agenda. “He must concentrate on the big picture – beyond the immediate campaign,” Ward said. \nWednesday’s hourlong debate airs at 7 p.m. on WGRZ-TV, WNED-TV and WBFO radio, and will be streamed on BuffaloNews.com, WGRZ.com and WBFO.org. It is sponsored by The Buffalo News, WGRZ-TV, WNED-TV and WBFO radio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:08:07.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
