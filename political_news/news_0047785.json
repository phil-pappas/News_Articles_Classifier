People prone to making controversial statements have also been conveyed the party's unhappiness,\" he said.\nThe move came a day after one of BJP's oldest allies Shiromani Akali Dal termed the lynching of a Muslim man in Dadri last month over beef eating rumours a \"shame\" for the country and said what happened after that was \"damaging the Prime Minister more than anybody else\".\nAlso read:\nAmit Shah's summoning leaders over beef issue 'mere gimmick': Congress\nDeath penalty for those who slaughter cows: BJP lawmaker Sakshi Maharaj\nMuslims can stay in India, but have to give up eating beef, says Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar\nSAD MP Naresh Gujral had said, \"What happened after the lynching incident in UP is damaging the NDA, the BJP and damaging the Prime Minister more than anybody else.\"\nHe deplored that \"motormouths\" were not paying heed to even Prime Minister Narendra Modi and that no action was being taken against them.\n\"But unfortunately, no action has been taken against anybody...motormouths are not paying heed to what the Prime Minister has said. It is high time some action is taken against anybody so that a strong message goes all the way in Sangh Parivar that this kind of nonsense will not be tolerated,\" he had said.\nHowever, Congress dismissed Shah's exercise as \"mere gimmick\" and \"empty formality\" after the \"horse has bolted\".\n\"What is the point of closing stable door after horse has bolted? For 18 months such divisive and provocative statements and actions have been recurring with monotonous regularity.\nSo, after 18 months Amit Shah has found time to chastise MPs and ministers.\n\"It is obviously an empty formality. Modi has still not found time and continues to practice deafening silence. This has been a mere gimmick far from solving issues which amounts to admission of guilt,\" Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.\n Amit Shah Narendra Modi Beef row Dadri lynching Also Read UP government should make public the facts in Dadri case: Minister Narendra Modi gifts copy of Gita in Chinese to Xi Jinping at Sabarmati Ashram Narendra Modi to observe Navratri fast during maiden trip to US PM Modi neither sleeps nor allows us to sleep: Venkaiah Naidu", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Motormouths_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/nation-politics/article/amit-shah-reprimands-bjp-motormouths-over-controversial-remarks", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Motormouths_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:43:26.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
