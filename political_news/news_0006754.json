New Zealand families want solutions now. \n\"Labour followed the correct process when lodging this Bill and consulted with the Clerk of the House to ensure the wording and aims were substantially different enough from Phil Twyford’s previous Healthy Homes Bill, which failed by one vote, to allow it to be in the ballot. \n\"With National subsequently losing the Northland by-election they are down a vote and there is a good chance the bill will pass. It should not be delayed. \n\"Two of Labour’s Members’ Bills passed first reading last night and three more Labour bills were pulled from the ballot today. It’s clear National wanted to stop my Bill before it was read. \n\"The ruling raises serious questions about political interference. The Speaker must say whether this issue was raised with him by the Government after the Bill was drawn today or if he himself put pressure on the Clerk,\" says Andrew Little. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:55:36.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
