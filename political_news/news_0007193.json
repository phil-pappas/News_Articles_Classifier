I think it'll be a lot more intimate and informative for the simple fact there are a lot less candidates to answer questions. Should be good, I think Sanders will come out on top.

The Hillary selection process will begin on that date? I'll watch it for the lulz. ChesusRice and spandy like this. TBoneJack Well-Known Member I'll be watching. I think both Hillary and Bernie will do OK. I don't expect any major risks or screw-ups by either of them in the first debate. They are both polished politicians. They will be civil toward one another, not wanting to seem \"mean-spirited\". Direct debate attacks will be reserved for later debates by the candidate who's behind at that time. Both will play it safe in the first debate, read the reaction/results over the next couple days, and make adjustments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:25:44.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
