They already made all their little talking points and attack phrases, which is pretty easy because she is a woman (no need to drum up any irrational fear or hatred, because they already have irrational fear and hatred to strong women). But, now, they don't know what to do, because Hillary isn't running away with this. I guess the next best thing in their little minds was to claim victory for Hillary not polling well. See how that worked out for them? It would be funny if it wasn't true. That has nothing to do with it. The war against women? now that is a talking point. Hillary has been crooked since Nixon was President, everything she has done, and lied about, has been carefully planned out to make her President. In my opinion her as President would be a bigger mistake than Obama, and that is saying something.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:01:25.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
