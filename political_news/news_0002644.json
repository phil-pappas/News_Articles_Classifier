Although CAIR may be the nation's largest Muslim advocacy group, it is controversial since it was once named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorism financing case in U.S. history.\nOverall, Carson has raised $31 million from almost 600,000 donations since he launched his White House bid in May.\nMuch of the money comes from small-dollar donors or newcomers to presidential politics.\nCarson's camp said that proves the Republican establishment will have to take outsider candidates more seriously.\n\"Sooner or later, they'll have to realize there's a new reality or they'll pay the price,\" Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett said. \"The outsiders are not going away.\"\nThe two leading Democrats have exceeded the $20 million mark. Hillary Clinton's campaign has raised $28 million, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' team said it had pulled in roughly $26 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:33:49.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
