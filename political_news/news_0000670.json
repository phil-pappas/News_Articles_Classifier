Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan A defiant Tony Abbott exercised the \"prerogative of silence' when asked if he forgave Malcolm Turnbull, and said he was \"absolutely confident\" he would have won the election.\nThe former Prime Minister said he understood why voters felt \"bruised' by the leadership change, in an interview just as Mr Turnbull was performing one of his first big acts as Prime Minister, addressing a national reform summit in Canberra.\nOn leaving the job, Mr Abbott pledged not to undermine the new Liberal leader, promising \"no wreaking\" and \"no sniping\" .\nSpeaking on dumped Employment Minister Eric Abetz's controversial assertion that \"hundreds\" of Liberal members had left the party at the news of Turnbull's rise, Mr Abbott said he understood voters dismay at his downfall, but begged them to stay.\n\"I can understand why a lot of people feel bruised...[But] please stay in the party and fight for the things you believe in.\n\"I can understand why people are dismayed, the fact that we did what we said we would never do, we replaced a first term Prime Minister the way the Labor party did...but please we need to make the best of a difficult situation,\" he said.\nMr Abbott said he has exchanged a few text messages with Mr Turnbull since the spill, and has received a number of what he dubbed \"interesting texts\" from colleagues explaining why he was rolled.\nBut he could not say he had forgiven the new Prime Minister when pushed.\n \"Look that's a very good question, and it's probably one where I might exercise the former Prime Minister's prerogative of silence, there's obviously been a lot of dirty water under the bridge,\" he said.\n\"Malcolm didn't stay in the parliament to be someone else's Prime Minister.\"\nMr Abbott used the interview to continue to defend his legacy and insist he would have been re-elected.\n\"I am absolutely confident we would have won the election under my prime ministership. Under Mr Turnbull I am confident we will be very competitive,\" he said.\nMr Abbott slammed the possibility of a new conservative party forming after South Australian Senator Cory Bernardi failed to hose down speculation for a time that he might form one.\n\"The last thing we need is another conservative party.\n\"We had back in the late 90s a sort of rogue conservative party in the One Nation movement. and the impact of the One Nation movement was to bring the Howard government perilously close to defeat in 1998,\" he said.\nMr Abbott also laid into News Corp media outlets for not 'getting behind' his controversial 2014 budget.\n\"I'm a little disappointed that more of the people who said we need reform, we need cuts in government spending, we need long term structural change, did not get behind the 2014 budget,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/eQ6QpWx9EMa/embed/simple", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js", "https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/there-will-be-no-wrecking-no-undermining-and-no-sniping-tony-abbotts-final-statement-as-prime-minister-20150915-gjmxzv.html", "http://www.examiner.com.au/story/3393029/abetz-emails-lib-party-members-dont-quit/?cs=95"], "published": "2015-10-01T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:52:56.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
