Michael Brady (D-Brockton), campaigns at Alexander’s Family Restaurant in Brockton on Monday with U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Brady and state Rep. Geoff Diehl are each garnering plenty of support in their state Senate race. comments 52 shares Tweet Outside political groups, labor unions and the state’s Democratic elite are all storming into the race for the late state Sen. Thomas Kennedy’s seat, pouring time — and buckets of cash — into the campaign.\nForces arrayed in the battle between union-backed Democratic Rep. Michael Brady and Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl for the Brockton-centered seat include:\n• Labor unions and their PACs, which have poured nearly 20 donations into Brady’s coffers to help drive his $37,000 pre-primary haul, according to the latest campaign figures available. A PAC connected to 1199 SEIU, which represents state health care workers, also committed $2,000 toward “digital consulting” for Brady this week.\n• The Environmental League of Massachusetts also intends to flex its political muscle, announcing last week it has up to $15,000 to spend supporting Brady through a newly formed PAC.\n• Jobs First, a conservative political action committee that has dropped more than $15,000 in mailers into the campaign this week, backing Diehl and attacking Brady. The group, largely financed by Republican donor Christopher Egan, has now invested more than $20,000 into the race, and its president, Andrew Goodrich, said it’s “certainly not done” with less than two weeks until the Nov. 3 election.\nNearly two dozen Democratic state reps, including House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, have donated to Brady, and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren touted her endorsement of the Brockton Democrat on Monday.\nDiehl has raised more than $78,000 through late September — spending $71,000 of it — and held a fundraiser Tuesday with Gov. Charlie Baker. He’s also gotten help from the increasingly powerful Marlboro GOP Committee, which donated $1,000 and chipped in nearly $3,500 in field staff and canvassing help, according to campaign finance records.\n“He’s obviously got a lot of outside groups that have been doing work for him, donating to him, canvassing for him,” Diehl said about Brady. Diehl said of his own backers, “If those people are involved, they must see a great chance of success. I’m glad to have support wherever I can get it.”\nBrady acknowledged the fundraising gap, but said he’s also leaning on a raft of Brockton-based support.\n“I’ve had tremendous support from everyone running (in Brockton municipal races) and also elected officials outside of Brockton,” Brady said. “I haven’t heard one person who said he’s not supporting me.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Geoff+Diehl-Michael+Brady+state+Senate+race+getting+ample+outside+interest"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:31:55.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
