Surrounded by President Barack Obama on one side and wife Jill on the other, Biden said from the Rose Garden that he had run out of time to raise enough money and set up a campaign. He did not endorse Clinton or anyone else in the unsettled battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. \nHere's a look at some reactions to the decision. \n___ \n\" Joe Biden is a good man and a great vice president. Serving alongside him in the Senate and then the administration, I saw first-hand his passion for our country and our people... I am confident that history isn't finished with Joe Biden . As he said today, there is more work to do. And if I know Joe, he will always be on the front-lines, always fighting for all of us.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton \n___ \n\"The Vice President's decision not to enter the 2016 race is a major blow for Democrats, who now will almost certainly be saddled with their unpopular and scandal plagued front-runner Hillary Clinton ...his decision not to challenge Hillary Clinton greatly improves our chances of taking back the White House.\" \n—Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, in a statement. \n___ \n\"I thank (Biden) for his continued service to the nation and his support of the middle class...I also commend @VP's outlining of an agenda to make college free, fight economic inequality, close tax loopholes & protect dignity for all.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, via Twitter. \n___ \n\"I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.\" \n—GOP presidential contender Donald Trump , via Twitter. \n___ \n\"@JoeBiden is one of the most decent, compassionate public servants our nation has produced_I respect his decision & wish him the best.\" \n—Democratic presidential candidate Martin O'Malley, via Twitter.
