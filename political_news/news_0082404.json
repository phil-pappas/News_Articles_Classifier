Under the proposal, the mayor would earn a $30,000 annually and councilors would earn $14,000, and all would have optional benefits for retirement and health care. (Tony Hernandez/The Oregonian) Comments \nGresham Mayor Shane Bemis and City Council members will soon be given salaries after voters in May authorized paying elected leaders . \nThe city's Finance Committee , the citizen group put in charge of determining the wages, will discuss their proposal for a $30,000 annual salary for the mayor and $14,000 for council members during an Oct. 7 special meeting at the City Hall Conference Center on Northwest Eastman Parkway. \n\"It's a big decision and there's more public interest in this decision than in most of the things the Finance Committee covers,\" said Chairman Curt Hugo. \nThe committee, comprised of seven residents, works with City Council to adopt a budget every year. Committee members are appointed by the mayor and ratified by the City Council. \nThe committee reviewed a variety of data and reports, and received suggestions from community members during meetings, according to minutes and agenda packets . \nThe committee will vote on the salary proposal later this month, Hugo said. \nFor the mayor, salaries are capped at 45 percent of the money earned by the chairperson of the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners; City Council, salaries are capped at 45 percent of wages earned by Metro councilors. That equates to $67,817 for the Gresham mayor and $18,670 for councilors. \nIf approved, the city will pay councilors from its $187,000 contingency fund in the 2015-16 budget, officials said. \nEvery January, the committee will look at cost-of-living figures and other factors to re-evaluate the pay, Hugo said. Salary caps could increase if Multnomah County and Metro salaries also increase. \n\"It doesn't mean it's an automatic thing,\" Hugo said of potential increases in Gresham. \"It's just one of the factors we will evaluate in January.\" \nAny future pay increase will not be based on the performance, Hugo said. \n\"It is not our job to step between the voters and the city council,\" he said. \"The voters did not give the finance committee authority over their (elected leaders') performance or their job duties, only their compensation package.\" \nHere's a few more details confirmed by the city officials: \n• If approved, the city will backdate compensation to July 1, 2015, the beginning of the fiscal year. Optional benefits cannot be backdated. \n• Leaders will be given the option to enroll in the Public Employees Retirement System as long as they work at least 600 hours a year. If they choose to enroll in the retirement system, the city would pay its required share. The mayor/councilor would cover a 6 percent employee share. \n• Leaders will also be given the option to enroll in the city's self-funded health plan, dental and vision plan. The city will cover half of the coverage for a single employee. The costs to add family or other people would be covered by the mayor/councilor. \n• The city will end the $160 monthly stipend given to leaders once they start earning salaries. \n-- Tony Hernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:39:14.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
