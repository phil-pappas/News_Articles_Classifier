Although we want what is best for them, it is important to first of all understand how our decisions may adversely affect their futures. At first, some decisions for our children may be considered better than other decisions, but parents want what is best. Many of you have likely seen the media ads sponsored by Better Schools Better Jobs on Initiative 42. This is a ballot initiative to amend the Mississippi Constitution on education. Some are for the initiative and some are against it. Typically, there’re two sides to every story, and the truth is often somewhere in between. I have asked Rob Chambers, National Field Director for AFA Action, to research Initiative 42 and provide his findings, which are below: On November 3, 2015, Mississippians will vote on a ballot initiative known as Initiative 42, to decide if the state constitution should change what public entity has authority over educational policy. Currently, the constitution gives the Mississippi legislature authority over educational policy. If Initiative 42 passes, then one chancery court judge in Hinds County will usurp legislative control over education. The Bible teaches that the responsibility of educating children begins at home (Deut. 6:6-7). Because of this parents should be free to choose and hold accountable who they partner with. That is in the best interest of their child’s education. Because representative government through the Mississippi legislature provides the ideal safeguard for the liberty of parents for their children’s education, we oppose Initiative 42. We also urge that you vote against Initiative 42 on Nov. 3rd by: (1) voting “Against” amending the Mississippi constitution, and (2) voting “For\" Alternative 42A, keeping a single judge from controlling Mississippi education. Elevating a single court over the legislature violates the separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. Americans have seen this type of judicial overreach and tyranny before. Recently, the federal courts were used to promote the “progressive” agenda by redefining marriage and violating states’ rights. This type of secular, liberal agenda has made its way to Mississippi in the form of Initiative 42, but the agenda is to control K-12 educational policy through one judge in a Hinds county chancery court. The Mississippi Constitution, laws, and policies state that public education is established at the local level. You, as parents, grandparents and other concerned citizens, have local control over public education — both through the school board and through Mississippi legislative officials. If voters disagree with their school board member’s decisions and their legislator’s decisions on education, then they can remove them from office at the ballot box. AFA Action supports educational choice being left to the family and not in the hands of one judge. Again, AFA Action opposes Initiative 42 and we urge you to become an informed voter on the significant and problematic implications of Initiative 42.
