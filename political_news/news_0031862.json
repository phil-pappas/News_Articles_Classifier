And much else.\" \nMurdoch's use of the word \"real\" flabbergasted many online onlookers, some of whom concluded that the media mogul was questioning Obama's race and identity. \nWhat did Murdoch mean? \"We don't comment on his tweets,\" a 21st Century Fox spokeswoman said. \nMurdoch, 84, is the owner of Fox News Channel and a huge portfolio of other media brands, from the Fox broadcast network to the FX cable channel. He is the co-executive chairman of 21st Century Fox. He recently handed over the CEO reins to his son, James. \nMurdoch is an unusual user of Twitter, occasionally dashing off his thoughts about politics and world affairs without ever quite mastering the medium. \nHe followed the Carson tweet with one that said \"Read New York magazine for minority community disappointment with POTUS.\" He didn't link to it, but he was apparently referencing a column titled \"Has Barack Obama Done Enough for African-Americans?\" \nMurdoch has been boosting Carson in tweets for months. On Tuesday he plugged Carson's appearance on the Fox News program \"The Kelly File.\" \nLast week he wrote, \"Everywhere pundits keep underestimating Ben Carson. But public understand humility as admirable, listen to the multi-faceted strong message.\" \nBefore entering the presidential race, Carson was a paid contributor to the Fox News Channel. \nIn March, after Carson left the network but before he announced his presidential bid, Murdoch tweeted about Carson: \"Wonderful character, up from Detroit ghetto, sadly seems political naif.\" \nAs the months have progressed, Murdoch has turned more positive. \nIn August he celebrated Carson's rise in the polls, and said \"his life story should make every American optimistic.\" \nA week later he wrote that Carson's standing in the polls is \"improving every week,\" and said Carson is \"maybe the one to beat.\" He added, \"Irreproachable on background, achievements, character, vision.\" \nAfter an early September interview on \"The Kelly File,\" Murdoch said Carson was \"impressive, humble but tough.\" \nCarson was back on Fox News on Wednesday night, but his interview, on Sean Hannity's 10 p.m. show, was taped before Murdoch's controversial tweet. Carson didn't have any immediate response about Murdoch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:22:31.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
