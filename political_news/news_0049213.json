Google (ticker: GOOG GOOGL) made many analysts scratch their heads back in the day.\nA search engine? What does that produce? Isn't Yahoo! (YHOO) already doing that? Maybe Larry Page and Sergey Brin could Google \"how to make money with a search engine\" – at least that would be a start.\n\"In retrospect, Google was the ultimate ugly duck in that it was a nontraditional kind of business,\" says Yale Bock, president of Y H & C Investments in Las Vegas and a portfolio manager on Covestor. \"You might even include any Internet business in that category.\"\nThen again, some of those don't even get the chance to hatch properly, let alone become duck-ugly.\nStill other ventures in any sector grow into odd ducks – the kind of business so unglamorous or unusual , it's hard to imagine anyone getting excited about them. Bock owns stock in Collectors Universe (CLCT), which authenticates and grades autographs and sports memorabilia, along with silver and gold coins. While it might be a lot more hip to invest in the coins themselves, Bock has his eyes on a different kind of treasure. \"It's a fabulous business with healthy operating and cash flow margins,\" he says.\nOdd or ugly, if you're looking to hatch a nest egg, or money that (groan) ducks under the radar, here are seven more suggestions for places to look.\nSecondhand Las Vegas show tickets. There's something sort of melancholy about a company that deals in resale show tickets on the Las Vegas Strip. But Bock believes that TIX Corp. (TIXC) could easily parlay its Las Vegas presence into something bigger. Indeed, the stock has been flat over the past few years, with majority shareholders owning a substantial chunk. \"They're not a big grower,\" he says. \"But the model could very well be replicated in New York or London. … It could also potentially be a buyout candidate for something like StubHub or Ticketmaster.\"\nTreatment of obscure diseases. Summing up the core business of Apple (APPL) is simple and sexy: Apple makes computers, smartphones, tablets and MP3 players. And then, there's Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). \"Our analyst Gonzalo Arroyo had to repeat three times why we bought the stock: 'Alexion makes Strensiq to treat hypophashhatasia'\" – a rare bone disease. So recalls K.C. Ma, director of the George Investments Institute at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida. Stocks may get bypassed \"even when they have product or company names nobody can pronounce or remember,\" Ma says. Now say this three times fast: Money, money, money. ALXN stock is up more than 7,000 percent since its initial public offering 20 years ago.\nPull a stock out of the trash bin. Talk about a butt-ugly duck: Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) has made some highly publicized gaffes over the years, from missing out on the smartphone revolution to the bungling of former CEO Steve Ballmer, who left in 2014 – but not before earning the title of world's worst CEO from several prominent publications. But it appears Microsoft is back, up 67 percent since 2012. \"Microsoft was once in the trash bin of most investors: look at it now!\" says Kim Forrest, vice president and senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. \"We always understood Microsoft to be mainly focused on serving businesses; investors forgot that in the heyday of the company. It's back now as more investors understand its customer base and the likelihood for growth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:09:45.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
