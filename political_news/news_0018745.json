Investigators said Robinson was high on mushrooms and started punching Kenny as the officer came up the stairs to investigate what he thought was a disturbance.\nThe shooting sparked a number of large street protests. Ultimately, though, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne cleared Kenny of any criminal wrongdoing and an internal investigation concluded he didn't violate any police policies.\nBut in August, Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Kenny violated her son's constitutional rights and that Madison's police officers aren't adequately trained.\nCity attorneys filed a reply on Monday demanding the lawsuit be dismissed, arguing Kenny did nothing wrong and Robinson's death resulted from his own actions. They went on to argue Kenny is immune from the lawsuit because he took action as part of his official duties, which are discretionary in nature.\nKenny filed a reply on Friday making the same dismissal request. He argued he acted in good faith and Robinson's own actions caused his death.\nIrwin's attorney, David Owens, had no immediate comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:23:27.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
