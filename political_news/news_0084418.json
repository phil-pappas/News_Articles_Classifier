Two of them are currently serving as government appointees. \nThe Paramount Chief of the area, Awulae Annor Adjaye III, urged the assembly members to mobilise funds to develop their areas instead of relying on the Assembly. \nGNA Politics Follow Us it not about what they say about you its about how you feel and carry yourself.
