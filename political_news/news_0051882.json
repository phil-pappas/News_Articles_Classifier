Israeli police stand by the shrouded body of Palestinian attacker in Beersheba, Israel, Sunday after an Arab attacker armed with a gun and a knife opened fire in a bus station.\nBy Teresa Welsh Oct. 19, 2015 | 9:49 a.m. EDT + More An Eritrean national died late Sunday after being shot by an Israeli security guard and beaten by bystanders who mistakenly thought the man was a Palestinian assailant.\nThe guard shot the Eritrean man, identified as Haptom Zerhom, at a bus station in Beersheba in southern Israel, during an attack by an Arab Israeli wielding a gun and a knife. The attacker killed an Israeli soldier and wounded nine others before being killed himself. Surveillance footage from the bus station shows Zerhom crawling on the ground, being shot by the guard and being kicked while he lay in a pool of blood. An Israeli soldier and several bystanders tried to protect him.\nRELATED\nWhat the 'Third Intifada' Violence in Israel Really Means The actual attacker, identified by Israeli police as 21-year-old Mohannad al-Okbi , was also shot and killed.\nZerhom was not an Israeli citizen but was in the city to renew his visa. As an asylum seeker, he was allowed to remain in the country because forcing Eritrean nationals to return to their homeland would violate international law.\nThe incident was the latest in a series of attacks over the past several weeks that have left nine Israelis and 41 Arabs dead. Twenty of the Arabs are considered by Israel to have been attackers, with the remaining killed in clashes with Israeli forces as violent incidents have occurred nearly every day.\nTension regarding the Temple Mount has fueled much of the unrest. The compound in Jerusalem's Old City is considered holy by both Jews and Muslims but the current agreement allows only Muslims to pray there at Al-Aqsa Mosque. Rumors that the Israelis want to change that status quo at the site, which is administered by the Jordanians, have made Palestinians nervous. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied Israel has any intention of allowing Jews to pray there.\nSecretary of State John Kerry on Monday called the violence \"senseless\" ahead of meetings this week with Netanyahu in Germany and Jordanian King Abdullah and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, likely in Amman.\nKerry said he'll use the meetings to \"find a way of making certain that everybody is clear with what is happening with respect to the Temple Mount.\"\nRELATED\nState Department Criticizes Israel for Restricting Access to Holy Sites \"I don't have specific expectations except to try to move things forward,\" Kerry told reporters in Madrid Monday about the meetings with the Middle Eastern leaders. \"That will depend on the conversations themselves as to what it is that we're able to define in the context of steps that might be taken so people understand that in fact leaders are leading and making a serious effort to try and resolve the current ... conflict.\"\nOn Monday, Israel summoned the French ambassador to that country following a proposal that independent international monitors be placed at the Temple Mount compound. The French proposed a U.N. Security Council resolution designed to ensure the status quo at the complex is maintained, but Israel has expressed its \"firm opposition\" to the plan.\nThe U.S. also opposes independent observers at the site.\nTAGS: Israel Palestine Middle East world news", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeccbo%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeccbo%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeccbo%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Eritrean%20Mistaken%20for%20Assailant%20Killed%20in%20Israeli-Palestinian%20Violence", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeccbo%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Eritrean%20Mistaken%20for%20Assailant%20Killed%20in%20Israeli-Palestinian%20Violence&summary=The%20asylum%20seeker%20died%20of%20his%20wounds%20after%20an%20apparent%20case%20of%20mistaken%20identity.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeccbo%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Eritrean%20Mistaken%20for%20Assailant%20Killed%20in%20Israeli-Palestinian%20Violence", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeccbo%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:59:20.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
