McCarthy (R-CA) is seeking to succeed Boehner, and he is the heavy favorite. But there are doubt about whether he can convince hard-line conservatives to support him in the crucial floor vote, where the next speaker must gain a majority of all House members, Democrat and Republican.” \n“The change in plans comes as a blow to sitting Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), who told supporters Sunday he had secured enough votes to replace McCarthy as majority leader, and to Patrick McHenry (R-NC), who made the same claim to supporters of his bid to succeed Scalise as whip. The delay will give more time for conservatives who oppose the lockstep promotion of the current leaders to mount a challenge.”— Never miss a Political Wire post Your email address: * Please enter all required fields Correct invalid entries  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:18:19.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
