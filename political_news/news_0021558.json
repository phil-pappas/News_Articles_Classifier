The new official will work to identify trends that can be used to help shape a national strategy.\nThough Carlin routinely speaks about the threat posed by the Islamic State, his speech Wednesday is more focused on violent extremists inspired by racist and anti-government ideologies.\nHe says more Americans have been killed in recent years in attacks by domestic extremists than in attacks associated with international terrorist groups.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:11:34.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
