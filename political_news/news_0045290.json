A few weeks ago, Speaker of the House John Boehner, who became the primary target of blame for the party’s division, announced his resignation. The opportunity to elect new leadership should have been the first step towards uniting our party; however, that has been far from the case. Turmoil in the House seems to only have increased as we work to determine who is best fit to lead Congress. However, one thing upon which everyone can seem to agree on are the principles we would each want in the next Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Four Principles First, we need a proven conservative. Second, we need someone who has stood up to the Republican establishment. Third, we need someone who is willing to take on this President and his liberal agenda every single day. And lastly, we need someone who will bring us back to regular order and restore committee jurisdiction. Who Should the Next Speaker Be? Over the past weeks, I have listened to my colleagues about what they want to see in a Speaker. They want to see these principles in action and they want to see leadership. I went down the list of the 246 Republicans in the House and one name came up again and again: Congressman Marsha Blackburn. From her strong pro-life stance to her fight to protect our Second Amendment right to bear arms, Congressman Blackburn is a proven conservative fighter. Last year, she led the fight against amnesty in the House, as well as sponsored legislation known as the CLEAR act that gives law enforcement the tools they need to assist the Federal government in deporting criminal illegal immigrants from our country. She has an A rating from the American Conservative Union and a high lifetime conservative score from Heritage Action. She isn’t afraid to stand up to the establishment whether it’s in Washington, DC or at home. When her liberal Republican governor in Tennessee tried to pass a state income tax, she led the fight against it and WON. She doesn’t just fight to fight, she fights to win. Best of all, Marsha is a Mississippi native. She is from Jones County, went to Mississippi State, and married a U.S. Marine. What better person to unite our party, fight this president and his liberal policies, and lead the House of Representatives? It would be historic. #Blackburn4Speaker Marsha is a candidate that could lead the Republican Party once again. She is a results-oriented true conservative. She knows how to get the job done while maintaining her conservative values and principles. I am urging my friends in Congress to support Congressman Marsha Blackburn for Speaker, and hope others around the country will do the same. ### Posted October 9, 2015 - 3:59 pm YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
