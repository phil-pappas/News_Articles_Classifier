I think that example is pretty clear,\" he responded, without elaborating.\nWhen another reporter asked if he was comparing President Barack Obama to Hitler, Carson said, \"No. I am saying in a situation where people do not express themselves, bad things can happen.\"\nEarlier, Carson had said, \"If people don't speak up for what they believe, then other people will change things without them having a voice. Hitler changed things there and nobody protested. Nobody provided any opposition to him.\"\nMeanwhile, as he was leaving the event, a reporter asked Carson how he would respond to Hurricane Joaquin if he were in the White House.\n\"I don't know,\" he replied.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:50:06.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
