Administration regularly draws from left-wing 'idea factory' Published: 1 hour ago Text bigger President Obama (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) \nThe highly influential Center for American Progress, widely considered the “idea factory” for the Obama administration, has drawn up a blueprint for presidential executive action on gun control that goes beyond media descriptions of the proposal being weighed by the White House. \nSince the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, earlier this month, it’s been widely reported that President Obama is considering circumventing Congress with executive action to tighten federal law on gun sales. \nNBC News quoted administration officials saying Obama’s major gun-control proposal would set specific guidelines for who is legally defined as a licensed gun dealer, since all licensed dealers are required to conduct background checks before conducting any sales. \nGlenn Beck’s “Control: Exposing the Truth About Guns” presents a passionate, fact-based case for guns \nThe proposal, NBC News reported, would set quotas on yearly gun sales for individuals to qualify as legally being “in the business” of selling guns once they sell a certain number and thus become subject to all laws for gun dealers. \nThe news agency quoted sources revealing the White House is considering setting the quota at 50 or 100 gun sales per year as the threshold to trigger the requirements, although the sources added the administration has not formally settled on a specific number. \nThe reports of an executive action focus on a federal law that requires anyone “engage[d] in the business” of “dealing in firearms” to obtain a federal firearms license from ATF and become a licensed gun dealer. \nEvery licensed gun dealer is then mandated to conduct background checks prior to completing each gun sale. \nCurrently, the federal statute defines those “in the business” of gun sales as follows: \n“A person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.” \nGun-control advocates often express concern about weapons being sold outside of the federal regulations requiring background checks, meaning by unlicensed individuals, mostly online or at gun shows. \nWith little fanfare and nearly no news media attention, the Center for American Progress, or CAP, last week made specific recommendations for forthcoming presidential executive action in a report titled “Executive Action to Strengthen Background Checks by Addressing High-Volume Gun Sellers.” \nCAP reports often become incorporated in Obama administration policy. \nIn the report, CAP complained of what it sees as “the vagueness in the current regulatory definition” regarding who is in the business of selling guns. It’s a gray area the organization argues “has provided the opportunity for individuals to take advantage of the ambiguity and sell guns at a high volume without becoming licensed and, therefore, without conducting background checks.” \nCAP firstly advises that Obama define those who are considered legally “in the business” of dealing in firearms, with stipulations that go well beyond only quotas for the number of firearms sold during a 12-month period. \nCAP also wants the executive action to take into consideration and set specifics based on the number of guns offered for sale and the amount of money involved in sales transactions. \nBesides those qualifications, CAP also recommends the executive action defining those “in the business” of selling guns also should take into consideration factors such as: Renting tables at gun shows or flea markets Operating a virtual store online Frequency of sales activity Advertising the sale of guns Accepting credit card payments", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:39:39.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
