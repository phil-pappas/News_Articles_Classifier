Martin O’Malley, the governor of Maryland and a candidate running for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, went on The View and performed … a rendition of Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood.” Guesting on the talk show, O’Malley mentioned Katy Perry’s benefit concert for his rival, Hillary Clinton. Removing his blazer and lifting an acoustic guitar from where it had been placed, conveniently, next to him, O’Malley grinned, gamely.\nAnd then: He strummed. He sang. “ So, baby, now we’ve got b d blood... ” The women around him—at the table, in their audience—laughed. “ HEY! ” they all shout-sang, helping him out.\nWhich was all, despite the table’s pervasive pluckiness, extremely awkward. Even the ladies of The View , themselves no strangers to musical antics , visibly cringed at the governor’s display.\nAnd yet O’Malley, in going on a Popular Talk Show to perform a Currently Particularly Popular Pop Song, was simply ticking off boxes in a checklist that has been part of presidential politics for a very long time. Americans tend to like their politics leavened with a heavy helping of pop culture—and of music , in particular. Which is why, on a recent appearance on The Tonight Show , Carly Fiorina a-capella’ed her way through a song she wrote, she says, about her dogs . And why Mike Huckabee, a bass player, regularly sings-and-strums on his Fox News show . And why Ted Cruz, at a campaign event in Dallas in 2013, performed a version of “Amazing Grace” that was set, inexplicably, to the tune of the theme song from “Gilligan’s Island.” And why, at his inaugural gala in 2010, Chris Christie—a passionate Springsteen fan— performed “Born to Run.”", "external_links": ["http://theybf.com/2015/09/11/ciara-calls-seattle-her-home-sings-heal-the-world-on-the-view-bobby-browns-first-tv", "http://video-embed.nj.com/services/player/bcpid1949044328001?bctid=592524730001&bckey=AQ~~,AAAAPLMIP6E~,BRrRHTAljlHRdo2SPuH4cYpjTxdIZDlA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCCBkOmaHGA", "http://www.ew.com/article/2015/10/20/martin-omalley-the-view-bad-blood-taylor-swift", "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/06/for-2016-candidates-a-mix-of-musical-talents/?_r=0", "http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/video/carly-fiorina-sings-songs-about-her-dogs/2909969", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/mike-huckabee-performed-a-sexually-explicit-song-with-ted-nu#.bu68err4xN", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meqSBMId5vg"], "published": "2015-10-21T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:17:07.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
