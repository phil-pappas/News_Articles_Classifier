Anderson recently tore down two exterior walls, which they say left the building in imminent danger of collapse.\nAnderson had been issued a stop-work order in February.\nThe building had been built in the 1820s and once housed a one-story, double-door carriage house where horses were kept.\nThe Advocate couldn't reach Anderson for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:37:36.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
