Remember what they say about stock prices while you're browsing this: Past results do not indicate future results, but it's a place to start . It will come as no surprise that most of those political districts were created to keep one party or the other one out of business. \nThe numbers represent the average results for Republican and Democratic candidates in contested statewide races during the presidential elections in 2008 and 2012.

Texas has only one true swing district that could go either to a Republican or a Democrat, depending on the mood of voters: That's the 23rd Congressional District, where freshman Will Hurd , R-San Antonio, is the incumbent.
