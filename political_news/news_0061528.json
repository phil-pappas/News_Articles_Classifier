Educator Sunshine Linda Grund was there and said she wanted to meet with Supervisor of Election Bill Cowles to ensure all of the rules were being followed. \n“I hope people are out there voting. I’ve offered myself as a candidate. I just need citizens to show up and have their voices heard in this election” Grund stated. \nBusinessman and Veteran Paul Paulson also had over a dozen sign waivers rallying across the street, but none were authorized to speak to the media. \nThe limited polling that is available in the race has Dyer up approximately 20 points, however with the limited turnout, none of the candidates are taking anything for granted. \n“We’re going to continue to communicate and encourage people to turn out. I feel very good about our message and the only danger we have is if people feel complacent and think it’s already in the bag. We need to have people actually vote to have it in the bag.” said Dyer in closing.
