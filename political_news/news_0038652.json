The side judge is in charge of monitoring the game clock, which is kept on the stadium scoreboard.\nVernatchi \"will not officiate in Week 6 as a result of the failure to notice that the game clock was incorrectly started,\" league spokesman Michael Signora said Thursday. Signora added Vernatchi is being taken off the field for one week and then will return to referee Pete Morelli's crew.\nSuch a move is unusual for the NFL, which rarely publicly reprimands game officials.\nSignora said the status of the clock operator in San Diego, an NFL employee, is under review.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ins%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ins%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Side%20judge%20who%20missed%20clock%20runoff%20suspended%201%20game&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ins%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Side%20judge%20who%20missed%20clock%20runoff%20suspended%201%20game", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ins%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Side%20judge%20who%20missed%20clock%20runoff%20suspended%201%20game", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ins%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8ins%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:31:31.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
