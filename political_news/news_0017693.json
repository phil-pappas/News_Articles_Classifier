Paul Ryan is seeking unity in a place it's rarely found, telling House Republicans he will serve as their speaker only if they embrace him by week's end as their consensus candidate. \nIt's a big \"if\" for a House GOP that's careened from one crisis to another in recent years, with a compromise-averse band of hardliners forcing a partial government shutdown two years ago, ultimately driving out the current House speaker, and scaring off his No. 2. \nThat left Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice presidential nominee, to get dragged reluctantly into seeking a job he never wanted. As he announced late Tuesday that he would seek the speakership, Ryan made clear that he would do so only with conditions. He wants the endorsement of the major caucuses of the House, including the hardline Freedom Caucus. \nThat's the group whose threats against Speaker John Boehner pushed him to announce he would resign by month's end and forced Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to abruptly drop his campaign to replace him. \nComing days will tell if Ryan can win their support or become their latest victim. \n\"I came to the conclusion that this is a very dire moment, not just for Congress, not just for the Republican Party, but for our country. And I think our country is in desperate need of leadership,\" Ryan said. \n\"What I told members is if you can agree to these requests and if I can truly be a unifying figure, then I will gladly serve, and if I am not unifying, that is fine as well - I will be happy to stay where I am.\" \nThe 45-year-old Ryan gave his colleagues until Friday to express their support. Members of the Freedom Caucus quickly made clear they remained to be convinced. \n\"I think he has to campaign for it. We've heard one speech,\" said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa. \"We're willing to listen but it's the beginning of the conversation as far as I'm concerned.\" \n\"I think there are other candidates in this race, and I want to hear what they have to say,\" said another Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado. \nThe other candidates, nearly a dozen, all lack Ryan's stature and broad support and it's not clear if any of them could gather the needed backing to become speaker. \nRyan had avoided getting drawn into the speaker's contest, saying he would prefer to stay on as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, which he's described as his dream job. \nBut with chaos ahead and the prospect of even more of it if he passed on the job, Ryan reconsidered under pressure from party leaders. Congress is hurtling toward an early November deadline to raise the federal borrowing limit or invite a first-ever default, and a deadline to pass spending legislation or risk a government shutdown will follow in early December. \nRyan laid out a number of conditions under which he would serve, aimed at defusing an atmosphere of constant chaos and crisis that has hung over the House as tea party-backed lawmakers pushed for confrontation with the White House and demanded changes that the strictures of divided government never could deliver. \nHe said he encourages changes to rules and procedures - something eagerly sought by members of the Freedom Caucus who claim they've been shut out of legislating in the House. But he said any such changes must be made as a team, with input from all. Ryan also sought a change in the process for a \"motion to vacate the chair\" - the procedure conservatives were threatening against Boehner, which would have resulted in a floor vote on his speakership and ultimately drove him to resign. \n\"He said he's willing to take arrows in his chest, but not in his back,\" said Rep. Peter King of New York. \nRyan himself told lawmakers in the meeting that in the wake of Boehner and McCarthy, \"I won't be the third log on the bonfire.\" \nAnd Ryan made clear that family comes first and said he would be spending less time on the road than Boehner, who traveled nearly every weekend raising money for the party. Ryan, by contrast, has three school-age kids in Janesville, Wisconsin, and wants to be able to continue to spend plenty of time with them. \n\"I genuinely worry about the consequences that my agreeing to serve will have on them. Will they experience the viciousness and incivility that we all face here on a daily basis?\" Ryan said. \"But my greatest worry, my greatest worry is the consequence of not stepping up, of someday having my own kids ask me, 'When the stakes were so high, why didn't you do all you could do, why didn't you stand and fight for my future?' \" \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Alan Fram and Andrew Taylor contributed.
