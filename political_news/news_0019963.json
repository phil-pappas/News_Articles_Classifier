He was relatively invisible in the last Republican presidential debate and seems unable to break past the dominant presence of New York billionaire Donald Trump, retired Baltimore neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.\nYet more than three months before the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, independent analysts and those close to Kasich say that, unlike Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Kasich has every reason to remain in this turbulent Republican presidential race.\n>> Keep up on political news and insights with our Dispatch Politics newsletter.

I’m not sure there’s any magic bullet here.”\nFergus Cullen, former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican party who has not endorsed a presidential candidate, said, “It’s really a crowded field, and all the candidates are struggling to show they are making progress. Who isn’t stuck a little bit?”\nAn NBC News/ Wall Street Journal /Marist poll released last week showed 6 percent of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire say they support Kasich compared to 21 percent for Trump, 16 percent for Fiorina, 11 percent for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and 10 percent for Carson.\nThat same poll showed Kasich at 12 percent in September, meaning his support is eroding despite spending more than $5 million in television ads.\n“It seems like his biggest hurdle is people don’t know who he is, and that is not doing him any favors,” said Dan Birdsong, a political-science professor at the University of Dayton. “He was up for a while. Now he’s down again.”\nYet independent analysts such as John Green of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron say it is “way too early to write Gov. Kasich off.”\nAnd Kasich has collected coveted endorsements from former New Hampshire Republican Sens. John Sununu and Gordon Humphrey.\n“I think he has made a lot of progress over the summer and put himself in contention here,” Cullen said. “He has been locking down many establishment figures who might have gone with Bush.\"\nWhen asked last week about the polls, Kasich replied, “Front-runner? I don’t think that really means much right now unless we were having a national primary tomorrow, which we’re not.”\nHe appears particularly annoyed at the attention lavished on noisier candidates such as Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Kasich said last week in Washington, “People stand on a street corner and shout for change, but if you don’t get it done, what did you achieve?”\nKasich originally figured on competing with Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for the more moderate votes in New Hampshire. That strategy largely depended on Bush failing to connect to moderately conservative voters who might not want a third presidency from the same family.\nBush, in fact, has run a lackluster campaign. But Kasich could not have anticipated the meteoric rise of Trump, Carson and Fiorina. Trump dominated the first Republican presidential debate in Cleveland with his take-no-prisoners style and, in the second debate in California, Fiorina dazzled voters with her ability to deliver stinging shots against Trump.\n“I don’t think Trump or Carson supporters have Kasich as their second choice, but Fiorina is causing him serious damage,” said Charlie Arlinghaus, former executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Party.\nIn addition, Kasich’s support in New Hampshire has tumbled at the same time that Bush has unveiled a massive TV blitz in the state, relying on his overwhelming financial advantage to launch a war of attrition.\n“He’s trying to kill Kasich off,” said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “They’re trying to kill off the credible candidate in a party that really desperately wants to pick somebody other than Bush. Kasich is one of the best alternatives.”\nKasich also has groped to settle upon a message that could catapult him to the top, veering from being the pragmatic problem-solver to the rebel who wants to shake up the establishment.\n“Sometimes a really good candidate doesn’t get the attention and visibility that they need, and that seems to be happening to him right now,” said Paul Beck, a professor of political science at Ohio State University. “It’s still early, and if he can stay in there, he has the opportunity both in Iowa and New Hampshire and later on down south to be able to gain more visibility.”\nAnd while Kasich has raised enough money to fuel his campaign and retain a solid staff, he has made clear there are limits. In an appearance last month in Hilton Head, S.C., Kasich said he “ never in my entire lifetime ever had any personal debt, and I don’t really see any reason to do that now, so we’ll either raise the money and live within our means or I won’t stay in it.”\nFor Kasich, the key is “to have enough money to run an aggressive campaign through Christmas,” said Arlinghaus. “At this point, you are trying to establish yourself so by the end of the year you are one of the five candidates to think about.”\nCullen agreed, saying as the New Hampshire primary draws closer, Kasich could rise. “The Carson stuff isn’t going to last,” he said. “Everyone has good feelings toward him, but he’s not prepared to be president of the United States. The support you see in the polls will melt away and go to other candidates.”\n“I think the Trump stuff will melt away as well,” he added. “At the end of the day, I don’t think Trump will be there. But Kasich will be when voters are making up their minds.”\njwehrman@dispatch.com \n@jessicawehrman \njtorry@dispatch.com \n@jacktorry1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:00:41.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
