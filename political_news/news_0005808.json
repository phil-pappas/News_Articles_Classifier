More Think-tank queries PM’s ‘war on poverty’ \nHe announced an extra £2bn for 2015-16 in last year’s Autumn Statement, and has pledged £8bn a year more by 2020. However, the latest figures suggest the sum is likely to be insufficient to sustain the service at current levels. \nThe figures, which cover the period April 1 2015 to June 30 2015, show hospitals running up a combined deficit of £930m, with more than three in every four hospitals unable to balance their books. \nAn analysis of the performance of more than 150 foundation trusts in England, issued by Monitor, the regulator, shows that over the same period they missed national waiting times targets, including accident and emergency, routine operations and some cancer treatments. \nTrusts also struggled to deal with an increase in demand for diagnostic tests, partly due to staff shortages and ineffectively organised services, says Monitor. \nThe main reason cited by hospitals for overspending was higher than expected pay costs due to an over-reliance on expensive agency staff to raise nurse numbers. \nDavid Bennett, chief executive of Monitor, said the latest figures showed the NHS “simply can no longer afford operationally and financially to operate in the way it has been and must act now to deliver the substantial efficiency gains required to ensure patients get the services they need”. \nThe Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA), which represents finance directors, said it had been “182 days since the government vowed to inject £8bn of much-needed extra funding into the NHS and we still await confirmation as to where and when this investment will be made”. \nAnita Charlesworth, chief economist at the Health Foundation, said the deficits were more than double the level seen at the same time last year. \nHowever, despite NHS costs spiralling upwards there was “no published national plan to improve efficiency and contain costs. Hospitals cannot do this alone. There is an urgent need for action and leadership from the centre”, she added. \nShe reiterated calls, also made by the King’s Fund, for a ringfenced “transformation fund”, perhaps drawn from the NHS capital budget, to help hospitals deliver efficiency improvements. \nThe British Medical Association described the deficits as “staggering” and said the NHS was facing “a funding crisis the likes of which we have never seen”. \nBMA representative Dr Ian Wilson said the extra funding promised by the government was “barely enough for the NHS to stand still. The result is a health service that is buckling at the seams, relying on emergency bailouts and with no real solution to the £22bn funding gap facing it”. \n“With winter just around the corner, there is a real risk to the quality of patient care as pressure on services and staff will only intensify,” added Dr Wilson.
