So New Zealand First is urgently putting forward a bill to stop such anti-democratic behaviour,\" says New Zealand First Spokesperson for Trade Fletcher Tabuteau. \n\"The International Transparent Treaties Bill will give Parliament or Select Committees the right to examine and review the terms of the TPPA and other international treaties before or during negotiation. \n\"There is need for a higher level of transparency when small, privileged and often out-of-touch groups get to negotiate these deals on behalf of the wider public,\" says Mr Tabuteau. \n\"We must not allow the goodwill of New Zealanders to be abused by the government in secret treaty deals like TPPA.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:53:29.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
