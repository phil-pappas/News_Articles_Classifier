Not that they needed it. The group had been living on campus together for three weeks, and already felt like family.\n“We all just mesh well together. It's like an ecosystem,” said Sideeq Waziri, 17, who dreams of becoming an inventor. “I think we all just have similar goals and aspirations.”\nTheir common goal? Getting to and through college, no matter the obstacles.\nAnd if all goes according to plan, they will, thanks to Cooperman College Scholars , a program that supports a select number of motivated low-income students in Essex County, New Jersey, including Waziri and 76 others. They are the first cohort to benefit from hedge fund CEO and philanthropist Leon Cooperman’s $25 million investment in them.\n[ RELATED: What Low-Income Students Need to Know about Paying for College ]\nThe 77 were chosen from a pool of 300 applicants, according to Twinkle Morgan, the program’s executive director. The students, mostly black and Hispanic, attend high schools that can’t necessarily give them the support they’ll need to get to college.\nCooperman’s efforts come at a time when the odds are stacked against low-income students. In 2013, only 45 percent of low-income high school graduates enrolled in college, as compared to 58 percent in 2007. And getting into college is just the first step. Once enrolled, low-income students struggle to adjust and often drop out .\nCooperman Scholar Sideeq Waziri, left, and pre-college program director Shawn Jenkins talk about college. Those in the bottom quartile of income have only a 9 percent chance of graduating college by the time they’re 24. In other words, there’s a 91 percent chance that a low-income student won’t earn a bachelor’s degree by age 24.\nIn Essex County, only 27.5 percent of residents over age 25 have a bachelor’s degree. In Newark, where a majority of the Cooperman scholars attend public school, it’s around 9 percent .\n“Not all of the students from the public high schools here have access to really great resources, like an incredible fully functional science lab, or a robust internship program,” said Shawn Jenkins, the educator who directs Cooperman’s pre-college programs. “We’re trying to create the opportunities for kids who already have the talent. It’s not brain surgery. It’s a very simple idea : The talented people are everywhere; all you have to do is give them the opportunity and they will thrive.”\nCooperman’s team members choose students they believe will graduate from college if provided additional help, including early exposure to a college campus, SAT/ACT prep courses and assistance with applications and financial aid forms. If scholarship awards don’t cover all their college costs, Cooperman’s donation will help make up the difference. And once Cooperman scholars are in college, the program will offer counseling and mentoring support.\n[ READ: The Hard Work Has Just Begun ]\nGetting a head start\nFor three weeks last summer, the first class of Cooperman scholars lived on campus at one of the four partner colleges: Rutgers—Newark, Rowan University, Franklin & Marshall College and The College of New Jersey. The four separate cohorts took courses taught by college faculty at the school to which they were assigned. Cooperman officials worked with the scholars’ parents, explaining the college application process and helping the parents compile the financial documentation they’ll need in the months ahead.\nThe scholars had jam-packed days and tons of homework. They studied English literature, math and sociology. They learned how to write and structure essays. They visited and toured businesses such as Bloomberg L.P . and Audible Inc . And they took workshops in college readiness and financial management.\n“I don’t want to go back to high school,” Waziri said afterward. “I want to go to college already.”\nIf the scholars are admitted to and enroll in one of the four partner schools next spring, Cooperman will pay up to $9,000 toward their tuition, books and other fees. If they choose another college, he will offer up to $2,000. The amount of the gift is based on Cooperman officials’ calculations predicting how much each student will likely be awarded in financial aid.", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/world", "http://coopermanscholars.org/", "http://www.audible.com/pap", "http://hechingerreport.org/colleges-need-to-support-low-income-students-or-risk-greater-economic-disparity-but-can-it-be-done/", "http://www.city-data.com/county/Essex_County-NJ.html", "http://www.pellinstitute.org/downloads/publications-Indicators_of_Higher_Education_Equity_in_the_US_45_Year_Trend_Report.pdf", "https://www.tcf.org/assets/downloads/tcf-CarnevaleStrivers.pdf", "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/01/15/college-enrollment-among-low-income-students-still-trails-richer-groups/", "https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d14/tables/dt14_302.30.asp", "http://nclc2025.org/sites/default/files/files/building_a_city_of_learning_through_collective_impact.pdf", "http://www.nclc2025.org/25-2025"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:21:06.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
