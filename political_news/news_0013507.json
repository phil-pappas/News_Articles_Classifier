While analysts had expected modest growth of 4 percent in the coming fiscal year, the big-box retailer forecast a decrease of 6 to 12 percent.\nOne way to look at this is to say the reasons for Walmart’s decline are complex. Many analysts have expected for years that Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, would falter . The financial crisis served Walmart well , as its el-cheapo reputation made it a hub for skint shoppers. But with the economy in a long (if still slow) recovery, there’s an increasing desire among shoppers for more tailored experiences. Nothing seems more antithetical to the era of bespoke, small-batch goods than Walmart—though this artisanal cheese and fruit basket , at just $78.99, looks pretty good. Web commerce has cut into Walmart’s margins, and competitors like Target have caught up. And while the company has resisted unions, it has been forced to sweeten its pay packages , which reduces some of its competitive advantage.", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-14/wal-mart-tumbles-after-predicting-drop-in-fiscal-2017-earnings", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/30/big-box-store-dying_n_5630572.html", "http://www.walmart.com/ip/Artisanal-Cheese-and-Fruit-Basket/41895804", "http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2008/02/the_walmart_puzzle.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:37:53.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
