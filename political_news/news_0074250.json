The BJP chief also said that if the BJP -led NDA formed the next government in Bihar, unemployed youth in the state would not have to “head for Delhi and Mumbai”. \nHe said that Bihar needed a government that could work “shoulder-to-shoulder” with the Centre to take the state forward on the path of development and stressed that the BJP -led alliance was the only one that could do so. The first phase of the polls were marked by bitter exchanges between the RJD and the BJP . Lalu Yadav was involved in war of words with Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Clearly signifying how important is the elections for the two parties. The first phase polling for 49 seats begins on October 12. The battle for Bihar has now truly well begun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:40:00.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
