(Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)\nSANTA FE – Secretary of State Dianna Duran will have more time to prepare her defense against charges that she used campaign donations to cover personal spending at casinos, after a district judge decided Thursday to push back scheduled court proceedings and allow more motions to be filed.\nDuran’s attorney had requested the extension, arguing she needs more time to prepare motions and review 20,307 pages of documents – mostly bank records – provided by Attorney General Hector Balderas’ office, which is prosecuting the case.\n“The defense has a right to challenge the evidence, and we need to have the time to do that,” Erlinda Johnson, Duran’s attorney, said during Thursday’s court hearing on the delay motion she had filed.\nState District Judge Glenn Ellington granted the request, describing the case as “complex litigation,” but did not provide the full 60-day extension sought by Duran. Instead, he pushed back a preliminary hearing in the case that had been set to begin Oct. 30 until Dec. 1, a 32-day extension.\nThe Attorney General’s Office had argued against the motion, with an AG’s attorney claiming Duran had not shown sufficient cause for an extension to be granted.\nThe charges against Duran, a Republican who became secretary of state in 2011, have generated national headlines and prompted renewed calls for changes to New Mexico’s campaign finance laws.\nDuran is charged by the Attorney General’s Office with 65 violations, including fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. Although the amounts allegedly withdrawn at eight casinos run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, the counts against her revolve around 19 transactions totaling about $13,000.\nDuran pleaded not guilty to most of the charges last month. A new felony identity theft charge was tacked on last week, alleging the person Duran listed as her campaign treasurer during her 2010 election bid – former state Sen. Don Kidd, a Carlsbad Republican – did not know his name was being used and had no role in verifying Duran’s campaign reports.\nMeanwhile, a special legislative committee has also been created to investigate the charges against Duran and weigh possible impeachment.\nAfter Thursday’s hearing, Duran’s attorney told reporters the secretary of state looks forward to fighting the charges against her, despite having already been “convicted by the media.”\nShe also said she intends to file a motion to dismiss the charges in the coming days, which is expected to include arguments the AG’s Office violated Duran’s right to privacy in accessing her bank account records without a subpoena or court order.\n“We will be presenting to the judge that there were some constitutional violations and some statutory violations in gathering this evidence,” Johnson said. “The proper channels were not utilized in conducting the investigation.”\nDuran was present for Thursday’s hearing but did not speak to reporters.\nThe next court hearing in the case is scheduled for Oct. 23. At that hearing, the judge is expected to take up a motion filed by Duran’s attorney seeking to have the Attorney General’s Office removed from the case.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/c01_jd_09oct_duran-640x425.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:11:21.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
