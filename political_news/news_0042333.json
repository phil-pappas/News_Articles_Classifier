But the sheer dismissal of Trump is wishful thinking and doesn’t comply with historical fact. \nAll summer, for example, the general public was urged to take the poll results lightly being this far away from 2016’s presidential election. Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) campaign manager Terry Sullivan told POLITICO: “Show me the candidate who was first place in August who ended up winning in February.” \nGladly, Mr. Sullivan. \nTo name a few: Ronald Reagan in August 1979, Walter Mondale in August 1983, Michael Dukakis (tied for first) in August 1987, Bob Dole in August 1995; George W. Bush in August 1999 and Mitt Romney in August 2011. \nIn fact, most candidates who were in first place the summer before an election year went on to be the nominee. \nInsisting the presidential race is more like a turtle’s race rather than a hare’s, Rubio told CNN the goal was to “…be in first place in February, not in August or September.” \nBut the way things are looking for Rubio’s campaign, he’ll need to start taking leaps toward first place in the polls, as opposed to his recent decline over several polls. \nTrump’s reign over the polls mustn’t be dismissed. \nThe billionaire’s total domination of the polls proves to be significant — not to be confused with “insignificant” — but his supporters’ intensity may be troublesome. Intense voters man phone banks and talk fence-sitters into voting for their guy. \nBut when did you hear any voter give their vote of confidence about any Republican recently? \nHere’s what some voters were saying: \n“I am totally committed to [Donald Trump] and would probably not actively work for the Republican nominee if it is not Trump.” — E.M. Gingrich of California. \n“I believe that the nominating of [Donald Trump] is the Republican Party’s last chance. More importantly, his election is our last chance as a nation of strength and individual freedom.”— Steve Schalk of New Mexico. \n“The greatest hope for the survival of this nation may rest in the election of [Donald Trump] as president.”— George O. Miles of Kansas. \nNow, of course, Donald Trump’s name was put into the quote in exchange for Reagan’s, as these quotes were from a 1979 Washington Post poll published in July back in 1979. \nWhat’s scary is that there are Trump supporters echoing said statements that were made similar in reference to Reagan. You could see Trump voters saying something of the sort, couldn’t you? \nBut even Reagan didn’t dominate the polls the way Trump has recently. In the Post’s poll, Reagan was at 27 percent, compared to 13 to 15 percent for everybody else. Since announcing his run for the next seat in the White House nearly four months ago, the business mogul has been polling around 20 percent to 30 percent, with nearly every other candidate stuck in single digits. \nSure, numbers like that are bound to fall now and then, but the press seizes any opportunity it can get its hands on to suggest Trump’s reign is coming to end. \nPerhaps the media gets excited every time we see a dip in the polling, just like when Reagan’s numbers “slumped”: \n• The Wall Street Journal , Oct. 30, 1979: “Douglas L. Hallett, former aide to Pres Nixon, claims Ronald Reagan’s decline in opinion polls and his inability to attract support of opinion-leaders suggest there are strong doubts regarding his ability to confront tough foreign and economic problems.” \n• The Washington Post , Jan. 12, 1980: “Reagan to Keep a Low Profile Despite Slipping in Iowa Poll” \n• The New York Times , March 12, 1980: “Nearly 1/3 of Democrats and Republicans polled after they leave polling places [in Florida] rate Ford a better candidate than any of Republicans in race.” \nFor the record, Reagan’s minor slippage in the Iowa poll showed Reagan’s support fold from 50 percent to 26 percent. The actor went on to lose the Iowa caucuses, but even that wasn’t the end for Reagan. \nNews organizations, nationwide political corespondents and supporters suggest that Trump may be polling at 30 percent, but that’s likely his “ceiling.” \nEven if it is, 30 percent is nothing to sneeze at. But why isn’t 9 percent Rubio’s ceiling? Why isn’t Ben Carson’s ceiling 22 percent? \nAlthough the political lingo has altered since 1980, Reagan supporters were given the same warning about their candidate only being able to attract a minority of fanatical voters: \n• In December 1979, The Economist suggested that Barry Goldwater’s 1964 defeat “underlined the old warning that candidates easily nominated are by no means those with the best chance of being elected.” \n• In Feb. 1980, The Washington Post political reporter Haynes Johnson questioned whether Reagan’s “loyal legions will stay with him to the end, and if so whether they will be able to avert a final crash.” \n• As late as March 2, 1980, Gerald Ford claimed he heard “there’s a growing, growing sentiment that Gov. Reagan cannot win the election,” and we “can’t afford to have a replay of 1964.” \nIt took Reagan winning 206 delegates to George H.W. Bush’s 47 to finally convince Republicans to begin endorsing him “to head off any perception,” as The Washington Post worded it, that he couldn’t win the general election. \nReagan dominated the polls and later took the Oval Office by storm. \nDonald Trump could follow in the actor’s footsteps. \nAfter all, history often repeats itself.
