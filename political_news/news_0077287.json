Dr. Arjun Srinivasan is associate director for health care-associated infection prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Disease. For much of his career, Srinivasan ran the unit that investigated infectious disease outbreaks in hospitals and other health care facilities. Today, he leads CDC's effort to improve the use of antibiotics in hospitals.\nCDC estimates that more than 2 million people each year are infected with antibiotic-resistant organisms, resulting in approximately 23,000 deaths annually. In 2014, CDC recommended that all acute care hospitals implement \"antibiotic stewardship programs.\" Srinivasan, who will be speaking at the upcoming U.S. News Hospital of Tomorrow conference, talked with U.S. News about the risks of resistant infections and the role antibiotic stewardship programs play in preventing them. (The interview has been edited for length and clarity.)\nWhat is antibiotic stewardship?\nWe can't control the way bacteria develop resistance. And, as a physician, I can't control how fast new antibiotics come on the market. What I can do is improve how I use antibiotics. That's where antibiotic stewardship comes in. These programs can both optimize the treatment of infections and reduce adverse events associated with antibiotic use.\n[ READ: U.S. Hospitals Overuse, Misuse Antibiotics, CDC Says ]\nWhy is this necessary?\nWe are at a crisis moment with respect to antibiotic resistance. For some patients, we've completely run out of antibiotics that work. We have patients in hospitals in the United States who have infections that their doctors can't treat. This is something that fundamentally threatens our ability to deliver modern medicine. So much of modern medicine has become very dependent on treating infections. For example, [consider] cancer chemotherapy, when we weaken someone's immune system with powerful chemotherapy … To continue to do [these treatments], we need to manage infections. Improving the use of antibiotics is one of the most fundamental things we can do.\nDr. Arjun Srinivasan leads the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's effort to improve the use of antibiotics in hospitals. What's required for antibiotic stewardship?\nCDC has developed seven core elements needed for antibiotic stewardship programs. … The elements are: Hospital leaders must be committed and willing to supply resources; an effective program leader who is accountable for getting results; a pharmacist with antibiotic expertise; a recommended action, such as re-evaluating patients' need for antibiotics after a set period of initial treatment; monitoring of antibiotic prescribing and resistance patterns; regular reporting of information on antibiotic use and microbial resistance to doctors, nurses and relevant staff; and education for clinicians to convey critical information about optimal prescribing and antibiotic resistance.\nHow many hospitals in the U.S. have antibiotic stewardship programs?\nAbout 40 percent of hospitals in the U.S. say they have implemented all seven of the CDC's core elements, based on responses to questions we added to the National Healthcare Safety Network Annual Facility Survey, which involves about 4,000 acute care hospitals in the U.S. that voluntarily submit patient-safety data to CDC.\n[ SPECIAL REPORT: Hospital of Tomorrow ]\nHow difficult is it for hospitals to monitor antibiotic use?\nObviously, [approaches] that are built into the system are much, much more likely to get done than things that busy providers have to remember every day. We've seen a lot of success at hospitals working through their pharmacy, laboratory or electronic health records, putting into place systems to alert providers to issues [involving] antibiotic prescribing. For instance, a provider might get an alert indicating that someone is getting an antibiotic intravenously but other medications orally. It prompts the provider to see whether this person might be a candidate for a switch. … The balance [to strike] is to make sure you have just the right number of alerts; if you have too many, people ignore them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:34:40.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
