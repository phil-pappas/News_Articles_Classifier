And with respect to the Middle East, we've got a 60 country coalition that isn't suddenly lining up around Russia's strategy. To the contrary, they are arguing that, in fact, that strategy will not work.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:02:15.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
