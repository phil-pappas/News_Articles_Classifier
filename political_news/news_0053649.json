Confira!\nPosted by Dilma Rousseff on Sunday, September 27, 2015\nBrazil‚Äôs Bulgarian President\nOn October 31, 2010 Dilma Rousseff became Brazil‚Äôs f irst female head of state , and amidst all of the celebration and hubbub one fact could not be ignored‚Ä¶ Dilma Rousseff was of Bulgarian origins. Her father, Petar Rusev (changed later to Rousseff when he moved to Brazil) had fled Bulgaria due to his strong left wing views and made a new home in Brazil where Dilma was born. However, Rousseff‚Äôs strong body of work as key advisor to President Lula da Silva of Brazil along with her revolutionary background offset her mixed national heritage and propelled her to a win for the presidency despite having never run for or held political office before.\nRevolutionary Beginnings\nRousseff got her start as a Marxist activist in Brazil fighting against what she saw as an oppressive right wing authoritarian government. She protested against the government for almost twenty years, first as an economics student at university, and later on as a leader of a prominent Marxist resistance group, who dubbed her the ‚Äú Joan of Arc of resistance .‚Äù\nIn a plot seemingly out of a movie, Rousseff helped plan and execute a robbery of 2.5 million USD from a former governor of Sao Paulo which she then used to fund for revolutionary activities. However, she was captured in 1970 and tortured for 22 days before being jailed and released in 1973. From there she began working off and on for government before becoming the Minister of Energy in 2003 and implanted an ‚Äúelectricity for all‚Äù goal that would help endear her to working class and poor Brazilians in the 2010 election. Rousseff‚Äôs activities as a revolutionary, combined with her beating lymphatic cancer in 2009 before she ran for office, have given her a reputation as a tough leader and has helped her establish a strong reputation as a leader.\nTime as Leader\nIn her time as President, Rousseff has struggled to maintain the prosperity that was implemented under President Lula and has seen Brazil struggle to take the next step to economic superpower that many had predicted. The economic growth that Brazil experienced in the lead up to the global recession in 2008 has largely faded away, and while Rousseff has helped create 5 million jobs during her time in office the collapse in the commodities market has caused Brazil‚Äôs economy to contract severely and lost much of its power.\nThe people of Brazil have also turned on the Brazilian government, feeling that the expenses dictated by the World Cup in 2014 and the upcoming Rio Olympics are too lavish and that government is ignoring the people. Despite this, Rousseff won re-election in 2014 by a narrow margin largely on the promise of continuing the generous social welfare service that has helped create Brazil‚Äôs middle class.\nCorruption and economic downturn\nNow, in 2015 Rousseff‚Äôs campaign promises look even more unrealistic as Brazil faces hard choices on how to cover its public debts without cutting social services all on top of dealing with a projected 2.3% decrease in GDP this fiscal year. To make matters worse, Rousseff has been implicated in a scandal involving kickback payments in the state owned oil company known as Petrobras that Rousseff charged during her time as energy chair for President Lula. This scandal has had its own economic consequences, projecting to have cost Brazil up to 1% of its total GDP in a time when Brazil can ill afford it.\nAs Rousseff‚Äôs public approval has fallen to 8% many doubt whether or not she will be able to solve Brazil‚Äôs rising fiscal issues, and complain that Rousseff lacks the charisma and leadership skills to build consensus within the Brazilian legislature. Rousseff has faced torture, imprisonment, and cancer yet now she faces perhaps the biggest challenge in her life as a political figure. Brazil‚Äôs economy has officially fallen into recession, and when the free fall stops is anyone‚Äôs guess.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/UNGA?src=hash", "http://www.novinite.com/articles/123972/The+Amazing+Story+of+Dilma+Rousseff+-+Brazil", "https://www.facebook.com/SiteDilmaRousseff", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RefugeeCrisis?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/coldwar20_en/status/648498103474081792", "http://t.co/sTkIfzwzLz", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISIS?src=hash", "http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.677848", "http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21663157-government-economic-holeand-still-digging-brazil-prepares-make-grave-fiscal-error?zid=309&ah=80dcf288b8561b012f603b9fd9577f0e", "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/27/dilma-rousseff-victory-brazils-election-celebration-may-be-short-lived.html", "https://www.facebook.com/SiteDilmaRousseff/videos/997068913680033/"], "published": "2015-09-29T01:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:47:52.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
