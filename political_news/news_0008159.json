He said he \"would have discussed\" payments with Mr Melhem and Mr Robinson.\nMr Gilhome said he did not see a conflict of interest in giving money to the union to support training and offset the costs of the Victorian branch for Mr Melhem's travel around the country for the union. He said payments to the union stopped in 2005.\nHe admitted one invoice for $5500 for \"paid education\" in the early 2000s was \"false\" and was in reality in accordance with the company's agreement to pay for 12 of its workers' union memberships for a year, following a union demarcation dispute at its Spotswood plant.\n\"It was quite a common thing in those years for companies and the industries generally to pay for membership for some unions in order to have jobs going on,\" Mr Gilhome said.\nIt follows evidence from several Thiess John Holland senior executives earlier in the week concerning $300,000 in payments, delivered as $100,000 a year, by the company to the union in exchange for a favourable enterprise bargaining deal for the $2.5 billion EastLink road project in Melbourne in the mid-2000s.\nFalse invoices Former Thiess John Holland executive Julian Rzesniowiecki told the inquiry on Tuesday four of 28 invoices he authorised, amounting to around $100,000 in payments to the union, were false.\nMr Rzesniowiecki said the invoices were to disguise the company's funding of an on-site union organiser, in line with a pre-existing agreement between the company and the union that was forged by Mr Shorten and another senior executive Stephen Sasse.\nMr Shorten's representative Neil Clelland QC sought to discredit Mr Rzesniowiecki's testimony in a second day of evidence on Wednesday arguing he had not been frank with the commission in his evidence about there being a pre-existing agreement.\n\"I don't accept that,\" Mr Rzesniowiecki said.\nMr Rzesniowiecki said the AWU had made a claim for money and that Mr Shorten was present at a December 2004 meeting where the arrangement was discussed.\nMr Sasse told the inquiry on Monday he negotiated with Mr Shorten in the lead-up to the bargaining deal, around about September and October 2004, over funding the on-site organiser.\nMr Sasse said it appeared the $300,000 in payments to the union approximated the $300,000 he initially discussed with Mr Shorten and that the \"relevant documentation was deliberately falsified\".\nMr Shorten told the commission in evidence on July 8 and 9, he did not recall any discussion with Mr Sasse about funding an organiser.\nMr Shorten denied any involvement in, or knowledge of, the AWU's issuing of bogus invoices to the company saying that he left details of the project to his successor as AWU national secretary, Cesar Melhem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:25:07.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
