Bowe Bergdahl face neither jail time nor punitive discharge for walking off his Army outpost in Afghanistan in 2009, Senator John McCain , chairman of the committee that oversees promotions of senior military commanders, said that Sergeant Bergdahl was “clearly a deserter” and that he would convene a hearing if the sergeant was not punished.\nMr. McCain’s statement drew a sharp rebuke on Monday from Sergeant Bergdahl’s lawyer, because the four-star Army general who will ultimately decide the fate of Sergeant Bergdahl is considered likely someday to face a hearing for his next job before Mr. McCain’s committee. Sergeant Bergdahl’s lawyer, Eugene R. Fidell, accused Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, of improperly seeking to influence the outcome of a major military prosecution.\n No Jail Time Is Being Sought for Bowe Bergdahl, Lawyer Says OCT. 11, 2015 Mr. McCain made the comments in an interview with The Boston Herald on Sunday in Pelham, N.H., where he was campaigning on behalf of one of his top allies, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.\nPhoto Senator John McCain Credit Evan Vucci/Associated Press “If it comes out that he has no punishment, we’re going to have to have a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee,” the newspaper Quote: d Senator McCain as saying about Sergeant Bergdahl.\n“And I am not prejudging, O.K., but it is well known that in the searches for Bergdahl, after — we know now — he deserted, there are allegations that some American soldiers were killed or wounded, or at the very least put their lives in danger, searching for what is clearly a deserter,” Mr. McCain told The Herald. “We need to have a hearing on that.”\nUnder military rules, Gen. Robert B. Abrams, the commander of Army Forces Command at Fort Bragg, N.C., will ultimately decide what charges the sergeant will face. General Abrams, who also has the power to vacate any eventual conviction against Sergeant Bergdahl, is seen inside the military as someone likely to be nominated for other commands, which would require approval from Mr. McCain’s committee.\nMr. Fidell said in an interview on Monday that Senator McCain’s comments in New Hampshire could influence how General Abrams and his advisers proceed and that the remarks might sway other people who could play a role in the case, including military jurors.\n“Senator McCain’s comments constitute unlawful congressional influence,” Mr. Fidell said in a filing on Monday before the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.\nThe Army has charged Sergeant Bergdahl with endangering the troops ordered to search for him after he disappeared in June 2009 — a charge that could mean life imprisonment — and with a count of desertion that carries a five-year maximum sentence. Sergeant Bergdahl was released in May 2014 after President Obama approved a deal exchanging him for five Taliban detainees in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.\nIn an emailed statement, Dustin Walker, a spokesman for the Armed Services Committee, said the committee “will continue its longstanding oversight of the entire matter of Sergeant Bergdahl, not just his conduct, but also the administration policy that led to the release of five high-value Taliban detainees without congressional notification, as required by law.”\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n “Chairman McCain,” the statement added, “wants the legal proceedings to run their course before making a determination how best to continue the committee’s oversight work.”\nAt a preliminary hearing last month in Texas, the Army’s investigating officer, Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, testified that jail time for Sergeant Bergdahl would be “inappropriate” and that the investigation had found no evidence to support claims that the sergeant had intended to defect to the Taliban or that any soldiers had been killed while specifically searching for him. General Dahl also testified that Sergeant Bergdahl had not intended to leave permanently, but that he had planned to hike 18 miles to a larger military base to inform a senior commander of what he believed were serious leadership problems in his unit.\nAfter that testimony, the independent Army lawyer who presided over the hearing, Lt. Col. Mark Visger, issued a recommendation that Sergeant Bergdahl face no jail time and no punitive discharge, according to Mr. Fidell. Army Forces Command officials have declined to comment on details of the case, saying they “continue to maintain careful respect for the military-judicial process, the rights of the accused, and ensuring the case’s fairness and impartiality.”\nLoading...
