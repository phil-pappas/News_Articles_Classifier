Fire and EMS personnel with the help of D.C. police, transport a man to an ambulance in July. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) By Editorial Board September 30 at 7:23 PM AFTER A D.C. ambulance transports someone to a hospital, it takes on average 45 minutes to process the patient. During that time, the ambulance is out of service and unable to respond to other, often more pressing emergencies. That lost time can have life-and-death consequences for a city scrambling to keep up with a spike in calls for medical help . That is why Fire Chief Gregory Dean wants to enlist private ambulances for less serious calls, an idea that has worked well for other cities.\nMayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) is asking the D.C. Council to approve a plan developed by Mr. Dean for private ambulances to supplement the department’s fleet of 49 ambulances. Under the plan, fire department personnel would still be deployed to every call for help and would decide if the patient’s condition required immediate transport to a hospital. If not, a private ambulance under contract to the city would be called to take the patient to the hospital. A patient with a twisted ankle or a rash might wait, while those experiencing chest pain or severe trauma would not. City medics would stay with the patient until the private ambulance arrived, within (city officials say) no more than 10 minutes. The current policy of patients being billed for ambulance transport would apply.\nUse of private ambulances is common in many jurisdictions on the West Coast, including Seattle, where Mr. Dean was chief and which is considered a model in providing quality emergency treatment. Mr. Dean stresses that the private ambulance service would have to meet department standards and performance requirements and would be regulated by the city’s health department. The program would be run on a pilot basis for 120 days, followed by a competitively bid contract for one year with an option to renew after an evaluation.\nMr. Dean inherited a deeply troubled department that will need other reforms if it is to improve service. This early proposal is a sensible step that will help ease an immediate crisis. Council members should not stand in the way.\nRead more about this topic:\nThe Post’s View: Pulling the alarm on D.C. fire\nThe Post’s View: D.C. Fire owns its mistake.
