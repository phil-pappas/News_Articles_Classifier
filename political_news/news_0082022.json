He has served our nation with distinction and honor,” Sundheim, a former California Republican Party chairman from Los Altos Hills, said in a news release. “He has been a mentor of mine for over a decade. I can think of no higher honor than to have him play such an important role in our campaign.” \nShultz said Sundheim embodies the idea that “there is no limit to what a person can achieve if they do not care who gets the credit. … He has the integrity, compassion and resolve to be a great Senator.” \nShultz is one of only two men to have served in four different Cabinet positions: as Secretary of Labor (1969-70), Treasury (1972-74) and State (1982-89) and as director of the Office of Management and Budget (1970-72). \nSundheim is vying with fellow former California Republican Party Chairman Tom Del Beccaro ; Assemblyman Rocky Chavez , R-Oceanside; California Attorney General Kamala Harris , a Democrat; and Rep. Loretta Sanchez , D-Santa Ana, in next June’s top-two primary to succeed U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. Another Republican, Santa Monica businessman Al Ramirez , is exploring a run . \n[You can leave a response , or trackback from your own site.] Willis James \nGeorge Shultz is 94… This indicates that we can expect a vigorous campaign put forth by Sundheim. \nWho will be the other co-chair, Edwin Meese, or perhaps S. I. Hayakawa? JohnW \nLOL — George is an amazing specimen. WW II USMC in the Pacific. Meese is a mere 84. S.I. He be dead, but would be 109. He could still be named another co-chair posthumously.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:24:31.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
