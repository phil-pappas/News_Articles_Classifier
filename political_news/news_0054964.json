Fancying that he’s presenting an objective “scientific” case in favor of raising the minimum wage, Mr. Ryan simplistically (we might say dogmatically) takes for granted that a higher minimum wage results only in higher wages for all low-skilled workers. He ignores, quite unscientifically, the downsides – such as greater unemployment and harsher working conditions – that economic scientists have long warned (backed by a great deal of empirical evidence ) are the unavoidable consequences of minimum wages.\nA brief in support of the minimum wage written in complete ignorance of the familiar and chief scientific argument against the minimum wage has, regardless of its title, zero credibility – scientific or otherwise.\nSincerely,\nDonald J. Boudreaux\nProfessor of Economics\nand\nMartha and Nelson Getchell Chair for the Study of Free Market Capitalism at the Mercatus Center\nGeorge Mason University\nFairfax, VA 22030\nIf Mr. Ryan genuinely brought a scientific turn of mind to his concern for the happiness of poor people, he would at least have considered the possibility that a higher minimum wage – by causing some low-skilled workers’ pay to fall to $0.00 per hour – would make such workers less, rather than more, ‘happy.’", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?i=fbKMDGgamtw:GjQj10UML48:gIN9vFwOqvQ", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?i=fbKMDGgamtw:GjQj10UML48:F7zBnMyn0Lo", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?d=yIl2AUoC8zA", "http://cafehayek.com/2015/10/its-science-this-case-for-the-minimum-wage-is-mere-superstition.html", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?a=fbKMDGgamtw:GjQj10UML48:gIN9vFwOqvQ", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?d=dnMXMwOfBR0", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?i=fbKMDGgamtw:GjQj10UML48:V_sGLiPBpWU", "http://feeds.feedburner.com//https://www.thenation.com/article/its-science-raising-minimum-wage-would-make-america-a-happier-place/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262515083", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CafeHayek/~4/fbKMDGgamtw", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?a=fbKMDGgamtw:GjQj10UML48:yIl2AUoC8zA", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?a=fbKMDGgamtw:GjQj10UML48:dnMXMwOfBR0", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?a=fbKMDGgamtw:GjQj10UML48:F7zBnMyn0Lo", "http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/CafeHayek?a=fbKMDGgamtw:GjQj10UML48:V_sGLiPBpWU"], "published": "2015-10-16T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:10:21.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
