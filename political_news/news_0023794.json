More Nobel award for discovery of DNA repair \nThe Dialogue, formed in 2013, was an important participant in Tunisia’s political transition as it stood on the brink of civil war, helping to ratify a new constitution and set up its electoral commission. Tunisia remains the only success story of the so-called Arab spring even though it has suffered a spate of murderous attacks by Islamist militants. \nThe Nobel committee hailed the Dialogue for its “decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia in the wake of the Jasmine Revolution in 2011”. \n“The quartet paved the way for a peaceful dialogue between the citizens, the political parties and the authorities and helped to find consensus-based solutions to a wide range of challenges across political and religious divides,” the Nobel committee said in its announcement. \nThe quartet is made up of the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), the Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts, Human Rights League and the Order of Lawyers. \nHoucine Abassi, UGGT secretary-general, told the Associated Press that he was “overwhelmed by the news”. \n“It’s a prize which crowns more than two years of efforts deployed by the quartet when the country was in danger on all fronts,” he said. \nThe Nobel committee said the quartet was instrumental in steering Tunisia back on to the road to democracy at a time when the country was “on the brink of civil war”. \nThe quartet intervened in 2013 when Tunisia’s democratic process was unravelling, pitting secular sections of society against an Islamist-led transitional government headed by a prime minister from Nahda, the main Islamist party. \nRead more \nTwo assassinations of secular politicians that year by Islamist extremists from fringe groups unleashed huge demonstrations and gave rise to calls to disband the elected assembly drafting a constitution. \nThe intervention by the quartet led to a compromise agreement that allowed the completion of the constitution and the installation of a technocratic government that oversaw parliamentary and presidential elections. Nahda agreed to removing references to Islamic law from the constitution. \nThe country is now governed by a secular president and a coalition government made up of secular parties and Islamists. The four groups that shepherded the dialogue through no longer operate in concert. \nTunisia’s experience stands in contrast with other countries in the region that saw popular unrest intended to unseat longstanding dictatorships, such as war-ravaged Syria and neighbouring Libya. But it still faces mounting threats from extremism. The economy was damaged by two attacks this year that killed 60 foreign tourists carried out by gunmen affiliated to Isis. \nHuman rights groups have criticised the provisions of a new terrorism law, and activists are angry about what they see as attempts by the government to undermine a transition justice process that would expose violations by regimes before the revolution and seek compensation for victims. \n“The Nobel is a good message but Tunisia still has problems and more efforts and more effective support from the international community are needed,” said Omeyya Seddik, analyst with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue. “The national dialogue played an important role, but this award should not just be a cause for celebration. It should spur more efforts because the situation is still very fragile.” 2014: Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistan schoolgirl who was shot by the Taliban, and Kailash Satyarthi, Indian children’s rights activist, ‘for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:08:34.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
