E-commerce site Mytheresa.com decided to partner up with Tommy Hilfiger on a capsule collection inspired by the designer's greatest hits from that time period. Modeled by Suki and Immy Waterhouse, the collection consists of nine logo-heavy pieces reinterpreted in luxe fabrics. This means they definitely cost more than the cotton tee you wore circa 1995 — the price ranges from $198 for the crop top to $654 for a bomber.
