SanDisk, Silicon Valley Bank and ABC7 have signed on as Celebration Sponsors, along with Inspiration Sponsors Riemer & Braunstein and BD Biosciences. Star Supporters include Deloitte, Ernst & Young, PwC, Rambus and the San Jose Earthquakes. The Light The Night Walks across the country have helped LLS invest important funds for breakthrough research and provide access to life-saving treatments for blood cancer patients.\n\"The support of our sponsors and their generosity to LLS is a big contribution to the fight against blood cancers,\" said Lauren Wickman , Light The Night Campaign Manager. \"With their sponsorship funds, LLS is able to support cutting-edge cancer research and directly help families within the San Jose community.\"\nThe Light The Night Walk is a powerful and unique LLS fundraising campaign, which brings together families and communities to honor blood cancer survivors and loved ones lost to the disease. The event also shines a light on the importance of finding cures and providing access to treatments for blood cancer patients. The walk is a family-friendly, non-competitive two-mile walk route and is accessible to all fitness levels. During the walks, participants carry illuminated lanterns – white for survivors, red for supporters and gold in memory of loved ones lost to cancer. The 2015 San Jose Light The Night Walk will be held on Saturday, October 24 at 5 p.m. P.T. , at Discovery Meadow in San Jose .\nThrough its efforts, LLS has invested more than $1 billion in cutting-edge research to advance therapies. Thanks to research, survival rates for patients with many blood cancers have doubled, tripled and even quadrupled since the early 1960s. Yet, despite these advances, about one third of patients with blood cancer still do not survive even five years after their diagnosis. The efforts of Light The Night participants are helping LLS to improve survival rates and create a world full of cancer survivors.\nTo form a Light The Night team or to learn more, please call The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Silicon Valley & Monterey Bay Area Chapter at (408) 490-2666 or visit www.lightthenight.org/gba .\nAbout The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\nThe Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ® (LLS) is the world's largest voluntary health agency dedicated to blood cancer.
