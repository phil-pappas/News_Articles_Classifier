She's collecting more big-dollar contributions than any candidate in either party among 26 states.\nAn Associated Press review finds that Republican Ben Carson was the second-best fundraiser in 10 states among those who gave at least $200 this election cycle. The retired neurosurgeon is ahead of former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.\nSome candidates draw most of their campaign money from small donations. But Clinton's larger checks underscore her fundraising advantage among generous donors important to expensive campaigns.\nThe 22 major presidential candidates have raised $274 million so far for their official campaigns - not counting money from super PACs that can raise unlimited dollars. Clinton's campaign alone accounts for more than a quarter of that haul.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
