Paul Ryan would be “crazy to take the [House] Speakership” unless he “worked out a deal” with fellow republicans.\n“Sure you can win the vote for the speakership but that’s not a problem,” said Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor. “Problem is do you have any guarantees from the Freedom Caucus that they are going to back you on the debt ceiling, on the budget, on reconciliation, on all of that that’s coming up.\"\nKrauthammer added the conservative group that helped force the resignation of Speaker John Boehner will most likely back Ryan if he goes for speakership.\n“I would assume he’d get that. Otherwise, it would make no sense for him to jump in.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:52:52.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
