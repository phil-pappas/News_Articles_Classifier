Last year, they said, the winter walleye harvest was 3,100 pounds. \nNew data, they said, shows \"pounds of spawning-age walleye and numbers of walleye from the 2013 year class were above established benchmarks.\" \nState Rep. Dale Lueck, R-Aitkin, said: \n\"This decision is a relief for hundreds of businesses around Mille Lacs. Ice fishing is a key to bringing tourists to our area in the winter, and I'm grateful that this year's allowed harvest will be even higher which might help offset some of the decline in revenue due to the early close of the walleye harvest this year.\" \nDon Pereira, DNR fisheries chief, said: \nâ€œThis decision allows anglers and businesses to look forward to some harvest opportunity during the upcoming winter angling season that begins Dec. 1.\" \nHe said a final details on the limits will come next week, after another meeting of the Mille Lacs Fisheries Advisory Committee. Officials will monitor the data and in January assess whether the harvest level has to be adjusted for the rest of the winter. \nAnd in late winter, the committee will determine a harvest level for the coming year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:29:10.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
