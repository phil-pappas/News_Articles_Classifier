Women make up 51% of the population.\n'Policing by consent' \"This comes on top of existing statistics showing that there are only two BME [black and minority ethnic] chief officers in England and Wales, and 11 forces have no BME officers above chief inspector rank,\" Mrs May will say.\n\"This is simply not good enough.\"\nShe will add: \"Increasing diversity in our police forces is not an optional extra. It goes right to the heart of this country's historic principle of policing by consent.\n\"We must ensure that the public have trust and confidence in the police, and that the police reflect the communities they serve.\"\nImage copyright PA Image caption Black people were found to be six times more likely to be stopped and searched Rob Beckley, from the College of Policing, said the organisation was trying to improve the \"recruitment, development, progression and retention of BME officers and staff\".\n\"This will be a long and sustained journey,\" he said.\n\"There are no quick fixes and while attracting more BME candidates to the police service is vital, development of existing officers and staff is also key.\"\n'Knee-jerk reaction' The speech in Birmingham will also criticise claims that a rise in knife crime has been caused by a reduction in police stop and searches, calling it a \"knee-jerk reaction on the back of a false link\".\nChanges were made after figures showed only about 10% of more than a million searches had led to an arrest, with black people six times more likely to be stopped than white people.\nHer remarks on stop and search come after Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he believed a rise in knife crime in London could be connected to large reductions in stops and searches from his officers.\nIn June, he told the BBC: \"If we are getting to the stage where people think they can carry knives with impunity, that can't be good for anyone.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E8CB/production/_86259595_86259594.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7FB7/production/_86259623_stopsearch_pa.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:05:30.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
