That ends Tuesday night as she faces down four of her declared opponents in a two-hour debate in Las Vegas. But looming in absentia is the undeclared and undecided potential candidacy of Vice President Joe Biden, who has publicly and privately struggled with whether to run for months. He’s still not yet running and he won’t be debating, but CNN went so far as to bring an extra lectern to Nevada, just in case he decided to show at the last minute.\nNo dice: he’ll be watching the debate on television from his Naval Observatory residence in Washington.\nStill, the Sin City showdown represents a potential inflection point in the race. It is a chance for Clinton to turn the page on the email-server story that has consumed much of her candidacy. It is a chance for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her chief rival in the polls, to expand his appeal beyond the progressive base that has sent thousands to his rallies and powered him to a surge in early-state polls. And it is a rare opportunity for the rest of the field to make any impression at all on the national stage.\nThe debate, held at the Wynn resort and casino in Las Vegas before a live audience of more than 1,000 at roughly 9 p.m. Eastern Time, is expected to be devoid of the high drama and high ratings that marked the first two Republican debates, mostly because there will be no Donald Trump on stage hurling insults (Trump has promised, however, to post about the debate live on Facebook and Twitter). More than 700 reporters from across the country and world are credentialed to cover the debate in Las Vegas.\nFor most of the night, Clinton will likely be under the brightest lights. In the second GOP debate, Trump got a total of just under 19 minutes of airtime; Clinton could double that figure on a stage with half as many candidates and so much of the focus on her.\n2016\nHillary donors worry: 'All the energy is with Bernie' By Kenneth P. Vogel\nEven as her image has taken a hit since she declared her candidacy almost exactly six months ago, she remains a heavy front-runner, ahead in national polling by nearly 20 percentage points. Clinton will stand center stage, with Sanders to her right and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley to her left. O’Malley has run aggressively in Iowa and New Hampshire but found little traction so far. Two other ex-elected officials who have campaigned far less often, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, will occupy the stage’s periphery.\nArguably, the biggest threat to Clinton is the person not in the room — Biden. His allies have continually pushed back the timetable for his announcement about whether he'll jump in the race, and he may wait until after Clinton's high-stakes testimony next week before the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Even without a formal declaration, Biden is polling in the strong double digits and could further erode Clinton's lead if he makes a serious go of it.\nBut on Tuesday night, few are expecting fireworks. The front-running Clinton has little incentive to take direct shots at her rivals. Sanders has said he won’t launch personal attacks and has pledged not to run a negative campaign. And though O’Malley might have the most incentive to throw punches and has done so on the campaign trail, he also must introduce himself first to the country.\nNotably, the debate’s moderator, CNN’s Anderson Cooper, has said he won’t tee up candidate-on-candidate confrontations, as his CNN colleague Jake Tapper did repeatedly at the last Republican debate. “I’m always uncomfortable with that notion of setting people up in order to kind of promote some sort of a face-off,” Cooper said on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” over the weekend. “I think these are all serious people. This is a serious debate. They want to talk about the issues. And I want to give them an opportunity to do that.”\nFellow CNN anchor Don Lemon, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash and CNN Español anchor Juan Carlos Lopez will also be asking the candidates questions. Trump, whose bombastic presence brought record ratings to the first two GOP debates of 2015, has predicted the Las Vegas showdown will be a snoozer. “I think people are going to turn it on for a couple of minutes and then fall asleep,” he scoffed earlier this week on Fox.\nBehind the scenes, the run-up to Tuesday's debate was a much smoother, quieter affair than the last Republican showdown, which was also hosted by CNN. With more control over logistics than at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, check in and security was less chaotic. The Wynn hotel provided a dramatic and opulent backdrop, with staffers holding signs directing attendees to the debate area through the maze of the casino and shops. Cake pops were being handed out by waiters in the three press filing rooms. The only major complaint from reporters and operatives: The bathrooms are outside of the security line, meaning a trip back through Secret Service to reenter the debate area, though once the candidates are on stage, the security will be moved.\nWhat a win looks like By Gabriel Debenedetti\nThe more disruptive force to the event could come from the outside, with the Republican front-runner trying to turn the debate into The Trump Show, promising to update both Twitter and Facebook with real-time retorts to what the Democrats are saying on stage.\nThere are plenty of nuanced policy differences for the Democratic candidates to spar over, including guns, trade, and the regulation of Wall Street. Whether from the moderators or her rivals, Clinton is likely to be pressed about her relatively recent opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline and her even more recent opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, both of which aligned her with the liberal Democratic base.\n“It won't be a debate of attacking each other on personality,” predicted Nevada Sen. Harry Reid ahead of the debate. “It's substance.”\nGabriel Debenedetti, Hadas Gold and Sarah Wheaton contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:28:25.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
