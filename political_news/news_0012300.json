His death in 2013 death, reportedly due to illness, was covered up by the insurgents until July this year.\n Afghan Taliban Mullah Omar mujahideen World Also Read US drone strike kills 5 in Pakistan Air strike kills Islamic State 'chemical weapons expert': US Pakistan school massacre survivors leave on 'healing trip' What was the world up to while India voted?", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/world-neighbours/article/rare-new-picture-surfaces-taliban-founder-mullah-omar", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Mullah-Omar.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Mullah-Omar.jpg", "http://shahamat-english.com/omar-iii-from-the-slum-to-emirate", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:06:19.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
