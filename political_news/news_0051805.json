That meant the governor was given the responsibility of naming a replacement to serve at least until the end of the term. And Gov. Sam Brownback apparently doesn’t think the citizens of this judicial district need to know what candidates he considered for the appointment. \nHe last week named Assistant Reno County Juvenile District Attorney Cheryl Allen to fill the post. Allen speculated that seven other candidates were considered. But the public doesn’t know. Brownback’s office declined an open records request by The Hutchinson News for a list of the other applicants. \n“We do not release the names of those who have applied to be considered as candidates to protect the confidentiality of their interest in the position and to ensure we have the strongest possible pool of qualified applicants to serve our citizens,” Eileen Hawley, a spokewoman in the governor’s office, said in reply to the request. \nThat’s a legitimate argument for not disclosing names of candidates for other gubernatorial appointments. We don’t expect to know all the people considered for appointment to the governor’s Cabinet, for example. \nBut this is an elected position in Reno County. The voters will have the opportunity to select the magistrate judge in next year’s election, and they might well choose Allen. But in the interim, the governor is acting as a proxy for the voters, and he’s giving a leg up to Allen, putting her in a more favorable position to run for re-election. This should be a process that’s completely transparent to the voters of this judicial district. \nThe Kansas Open Records Act supports this. Government has an exemption for personnel records, but, again, the magistrate judgeship in Reno County is a position elected by the people, not hired by staff. \nThis flawed argument by the governor’s office already has been tested in court in a similar case in Saline County. There, voters elected to expand their county commission from three to five members a good idea, by the way and the governor had to appoint commissioners to fill the two new positions until the next election. And, like in Reno County, the Brownback administration refused to release the names of all those who applied. \nThe Salina Journal and Associated Press sued to open the records, and a Shawnee County judge last month ruled in their favor, finding that the applications were not exempt under the open records act. \nThat ruling seemingly applies to the Reno County situation, too; however, the governor’s office said last week it would appeal the decision. \nThe governor might well have picked the best candidate for the magistrate judge opening in Reno County. But voters don’t know that without the context of knowing the other options. And it is important to establish a legal precedent here in favor of open government. When we have positions that are elected by the people, the process always should be completely transparent to the people. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:44:13.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
