The new product will be available by mid-2016, followed by a complete transition to HFO-blown insulation by 2017.\n\"The move to hydrofluoroolefins marks an industry shift to curb greenhouse gas emissions produced by hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in many spray foam blowing agents today,\" said Paul Valle , President and CEO at Demilec, who made the announcement at the Industry Leader Roundtable organized by The White House Council on Environmental Quality.\n\"As leaders within our industries, it's imperative that we look at the big picture to identify ways that we can reduce our own impacts on the environment, as well as help others do the same with the products we make,\" Valle added.\nMany of the world's top environmental scientists believe greenhouse gases to be a major contributor to global warming. According to the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy, HFCs are 10,000 times worse for climate change than carbon.\nDemilec has an established focus on sustainability. Its closed-cell products currently contain more than 20 percent renewable, recycled content. This year, Demilec will recycle the equivalent of 35 million plastic bottles into its products.\nAbout Demilec\nDemilec has been recognized as an industry leader in using innovative technology and advanced science to create a line of open-cell and closed-cell spray foam insulation and coatings for more than 30 years. Demilec focuses on meeting market demands for more energy-efficient products and serves a range of industries, including industrial, residential, commercial, agricultural, original equipment manufacturer, education, water, oil & gas, energy, military and civil.
