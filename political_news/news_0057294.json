I can think of few better reasons to use this power than to stop moves to cut vital support for millions of working families.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-22T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:24:16.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
