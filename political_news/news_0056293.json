The price of the generic drug rose from $13.50 to $750 after Turing Pharmaceuticals, led by 32-year-old former hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli, acquired the drug in August.\nClinton said in the letters that Turing has not lowered the price of Daraprim, despite promises last month from Shkreli to do so, Reuters said . She wants the FDA to expedite any pending reviews of Daraprim generics so that they reach the market soon, and called for changes in law to ensure similar situations don't happen again.\nA big reason that Shkreli has been able to raise the price of Daraprim is that there is no other generic competition. The drug has been around for decades and only has a few thousand prescriptions. But if generic alternatives reach the market, they can sell Daraprim at a lower price.\n  U.S. jet in Afghanistan hit by small-arms fire The F-16 was able to land safely after the incident on Oct. 13, said Capt.

She put out a plan to combat high prescription drug prices, as has her Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nTuring did not return a request for comment.\nShkreli has said on Twitter and in other public comments that any additional funding or profits would go towards creating a new treatment for the parasite. But several doctors have said that they don't need a new treatment, just a more affordable one.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Texas cuts funding to Planned Parenthood Texas is the latest state to try to strip federal and state dollars from the women's health provider.\nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham • 10/19/15 1:06 PM Top Story Is the GOP really still a party?  \nBy W.
