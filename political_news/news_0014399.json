And it found a Connecticut ban on a non-semi-automatic Remington 7615 unconstitutional. \nThe laws were opposed by groups supporting gun rights, pistol permit holders and gun sellers. \nLawyers did not immediately return messages seeking comment. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:13:33.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
