The Communications Workers Union (CWU) issued a statement saying the privatization underscores the Tory party's commitment to austerity “ideology” over the interests of the British people. “This fire sale nails the lie that the Tories stand up for the interests of ordinary people,” said CWU general secretary Dave Ward. “By their actions today they have made it abundantly clear that they are only interested in privatization dogma and making the rich richer—even when their actions place public services at risk.” Sadly throughout my time as a postal worker, the union failed to offer an alternative to all the various versions of state-ownership that Royal Mail had experienced. No thought was ever given to one of its earliest postions that it should be follow the proposals of GDH Cole to create a Guild Socialist model of organization.\n“I have no country to fight for; my country is the Earth, and I am a citizen of the World.” – Eugene V.
