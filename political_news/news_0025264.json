Goodwill polled thousands of Americans by phone and in person to find out what's hot and what's not. The survey led to many surprising findings:\nSurvey respondents preferred do-it-yourself costumes (51 percent) over packaged costumes (27 percent). The trend shows people are more interested in creating original looks or being creative and unique by blending accessories. There's a surge in popularity for group, family and couples costumes this year, especially among millennials. Of those planning to wear costumes, 19 percent will look for group, couple or family costumes and 31 percent of millennials plan to participate in those costumes this year. Goodwill customers like the idea of merging two or more traditional costumes to create unique looks. For example, a zombie-princess, pirate-cat or another merged creation. This reflects the trend toward do-it-yourself, creative and original costume designs. To determine your unique costume creation using your initials, visit Goodwill's Halloween costume generator. Respondents revealed what not to wear: They will avoid risqué/overly sexy costumes (60 percent) and political costumes (35 percent). For the second year in a row, respondents deemed zombie, pirate and vampire costumes as the most popular choices.\nGoodwill has more than 3,000 stores in the United States and Canada that are full of the items needed to create unique costumes on a budget.
