Brown. “City residents and/or visitors to Buffalo can stop looking for cash or credit or debit cards if they choose this option.” \nThe city would install “Pay by Cell” throughout the city, but all parking spots would also have traditional meters or “Pay and Display” boxes for those who don’t have smartphones, city officials said. \nThe city is also upgrading its 125 “Pay and Display” boxes to a 3G network, which will enable the machines to operate more quickly, said Kevin Helfer, the city’s Parking Commissioner. \nThe Buffalo News works to promote civil conversation in the comments section below.
