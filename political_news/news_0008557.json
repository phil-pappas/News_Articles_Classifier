Of the 20 runs scored by the Chicago Cubs in their 3-1 series victory over the St. Louis Cardinals, 10 of the Cubs’ runs came as home runs. Add the runners on base for those homers, and the total rises to 15 runs scored via Chicago home runs. Six of the homers came Monday with the wind blowing out of Wrigley Field. Long ago, when I was playing high school football, a teammate told me the wind blew in more often than out at Wrigley. When i challenged him on it, he said he knew because his dad was a bookie who took bets on Cubs’ games. With that added fact, there were now two things from that conversation I hadn’t previously known. I shut up. I have kept track of the Cubs all of my adult life, in part because they played their games during the day for much of my life, and between radio and for a time TV you could pick up their games as background during work on afternoons. But there’s been no such broadcast avenue in recent years, the two Chicago papers don’t allow free easy access on the Internet any longer and I’ve been left to tracking their minor-league moves through the gurus at Baseball America when their publication arrives in the mail. Those gurus did see this coming, by the way. So when friends asked in August and September whether the Cubs would hang on and get a wild-card slot in the National League playoffs, I told them they were in a comfortable spot. Being Cubs fans, they never seemed to get too comfortable, however. So here’s a look at the origins of the Cubs’ playoff lineup. \nDexter Fowler: He plays a fast centerfield. He started with the Colorado Rockies, drafted in 2004, broke into the majors in 2008. He was a solid .260s hitter with a .300 season in 2012. The Rockies traded him to the Houston Astros during the winter between the 2013 and 2014 seasons. He played in 2014 for Houston. The Cubs picked up Fowler on a free-agent contract for $9 million for one season. He’s hit .250 and a career-high 17 home runs in 2015. \nJorge Soler: He plays right field. He is one of the players from Cuba who have filtered into Major League Baseball during the past decade. Some years ago, then-Chicago announcer Harry Caray one game remarked that he didn’t like the Cubs’ uniform redesign because “Cubs” looked like “Cuba” in the script lettering across their shirt tops. Soler was a big investment for the Cubs when they signed him in 2012 for $30 million over nine years. He debuted in the majors in 2014 at age 22. So far, in 125 games, he’s batting .268 with 15 home runs. \nKris Bryant: He plays third base. The Cubs drafted him in the first round in 2013 out of the University of San Diego as the No. 2 pick overall. He made his majors debut this year. This rookie season he’s batted .275 with 26 home runs. \nAnthony Rizzo: He plays first base. The Boston Red Sox drafted him in 2007 and after the 2010 season traded him to San Diego. In early 2012 the Padres traded him to Chicago in a deal that netted the Padres a promising young pitcher named Andrew Cashner who’s now in the majors as well. Rizzo broke into the majors with the Padres in 2011 at age 21. Chicago put Rizzo into their lineup as a regular at 23. They gave him a seven-year contract worth $41 million. During his four years with the Cubs he’s batted .268 and hit 101 home runs. \nStarlin Castro: He was going to be the Cubs’ shortstop of the future but he now plays second base. He grew up in Chicago’s system, signed at age 16 from the Dominican Republic. He was 20 years old when he made his major debut in 2010. In his years in the majors he’s hit .281 with 62 home runs. His contract runs through 2019 at eight years for $60 million. \nKyle Schwarber: He is a catcher by training, but you’ve seen him in left field as well this fall. At 6 feet tall and 235 pounds, he doesn’t fit the typical OF physical profile. His bat has been the reason he’s out there. In this rookie season, he’s batted .246 with 16 home runs — in 69 games. The Cubs picked Schwarber in the first round of the 2014 draft out of Indiana University. He was the No. 4 overall choice. \nMiguel Montero: He is a catcher, period. At age 32 he’s the steady hand the Cubs brought aboard last winter after years of trying to develop a catcher. Montero had played all of his career before the trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks. The D-backs signed him as a teen-ager out of Venezuela in 2001 and he debuted in the majors in 2006. In those 10 seasons in the majors he’s batted .262 with 112 home runs. That includes this season with the Cubs, for whom he’s hit .248 with 15 homers. \nJavier Baez and Addison Russell: Baez started as shortstop Tuesday night after Russell suffered a left hamstring injury while running the bases against the Cardinals. Russell is the regular shortstop. The Cubs traded two starting pitchers, Jason Hammel and Jeff Samardzija, to the Oakland Athletics to get Russell in July 2014. He was the first-round draft pick of the A’s in 2012 as No. 11 overall. Russell broke into the Cubs’ majors lineup this year at age 21. He batted .242 with 13 home runs in 142 games. Baez meanwhile can play all of the infield spots. The Cubs acquired Baez in the first round of the 2011 draft at No. 9 overall. He debuted in the Cubs’ major lineup in August 2011 at age 21. Over two seasons he’s played in 80 games in the majors and he’s hit .201 with 10 home runs. \nAustin Jackson and Chris Coghlan: The two outfielders have been steady for the Cubs this year. They are the types of players who are talented but haven’t been headline-makers. The New York Yankees drafted Austin in 2005 in the eighth round and a three-team trade landed Austin in Detroit starting with the 2010 season. He stole some bases and hit some home runs. The Seattle Mariners traded for him in 2014 in another three-team deal. He came over to the Cubs on Aug. 31 this year. He’s a lot like Dexter Fowler, a .273 hitter with 55 home runs over his six years as a pro. With the Cubs so far he’s batting .236 with one home run. Coghlan was the National League rookie of the year in 2009 at age 24 for the Florida Marlins, who drafted him in the first round in 2006. To this point he hasn’t been able to build on that strong early start. The Cubs signed Coghlan as a free agent for the 2014 season. In five years as a Marlin, he hit .270 with 21 home runs. In two years as a Cub, he’s hit .265 — with 25 home runs. \nI don’t know the histories and roles of Chicago’s scouting system and front office, but Theo Epstein joined the Cubs as president for baseball operations in October 2011. He previously put together two World Series championship teams for the Boston Red Sox, where he was hired as general manager in November 2002. He brought in Joe Maddon as manager for the Cubs for this season. Maddon managed the Tampa Bay Rays from 2006 through 2014 and won the 2008 American League championship. \nThe Cubs’ five starting pitchers this season came from other teams as well. The Cubs obtained Kyle Hendricks in a 2014 trade with the Texas Rangers. Jason Hammel, who previously pitched for Tampa Bay, Colorado and Baltimore, came to the Cubs as a free agent for the 2014 season, was traded to Oakland in the Addison Russell deal, and came back to the Cubs a second time as a free agent for this season. Jon Lester pitched eight seasons for Boston until a 2014 trade to Oakland and signed with the Cubs for 2015 as a free agent. Dan Haren is with his eighth team at the majors level after Miami traded him to the Cubs in July this year. Jake Arrieta became one of the best pitchers in the majors after his trade from Baltimore to the Cubs in 2012; the Cubs also picked up reliever Pedro Strop in that deal. Another 2012 steal came when the Cubs used what’s known as the Rule V (5) draft to snatch reliever Hector Rondon from Cleveland. When St. Louis gave up on reliever Jason Motte, the Cubs signed him as a free agent for 2015. Overall the Cubs’ bullpen is a mix of hard throwers who tend to strike out three batters for every one they walk. \nIn an odd way, you can trace the rise of the Chicago Cubs to the financial demise of the Chicago Tribune newspaper’s parent company, the Tribune Co., which had owned the Cubs until bankruptcy in 2009. The current owners are members of the Ricketts family. The father, J. Joseph Ricketts of Omaha, founded Ameritrade; one of the children, Thomas S. Ricketts, a Chicago investment banker, is the principal owner of the Cubs. Some might call this an amazing story. They would seem to be right.
