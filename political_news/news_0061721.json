Mary Fallin that he'll step down and retire effective Nov. 1.\nGlanz was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday on two misdemeanor counts. One accuses Glanz of refusing to perform his official duties by not quickly turning over information about volunteer deputy Robert Bates during an internal investigation.\nBates, Glanz's longtime friend and a former insurance executive, has said he mistook his handgun for a stun gun before shooting a restrained man in April.\nFallin's spokesman, Alex Weintz, says the governor will announce a date later Friday for a special election to fill the post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:46:15.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
