One such question came on Wednesday in Kolkata when he was asked if he had any plans to play his last international game at Eden Gardens, the venue that the bowler from Jalandhar regards as his next home.\nHarbhajan, who did not feature in the lone T20I that India had played at this venue, is remembered for his hat-trick and 13 wickets in the 2001 Test against Australia. In seven Tests at the Eden, Harbhajan has taken 46 wickets while in six ODIs, he has only three.\n\"I have not planned anything (about retiring at Eden) but yes, whenever I would think, I would like to play my last game at the Eden. But that has got to be in a Test,\" Harbhajan said.\n\"Playing cricket in Eden is always special. This is like coming home and playing cricket. If people say cricket in England is at Lord's, then in India for me this is the best place to play cricket. I have got some great memories playing here and hopefully I can continue to do well here,\" Harbhajan, who has 24 wickets in 27 T20Is and an economy rate of 6.34.\nHe hoped for a turn around in India's fortunes in the final game on Thursday. \"We have lost the series but we still have a lot to play in the final game. Hopefully, we will win tomorrow and from there onward it could be a different story,\" Harbhajan said.\n\"The ODIs are coming up and then the Tests. We want to play our best game on Thursday and we want to put up our best show. Once we start winning, we will be a difficult side to beat,\" he said.\nWant to make it 3-0: Miller\nMeanwhile, South African batsman David Miller has said that his team was all pumped to make a clean sweep. \"I think it is a massive point. We are 2-0 up and are determined to make it 3-0. The momentum and confidence is a big thing in international cricket. Our preparations have been really good. We've been trying to check all the boxes and hopefully we come out on top on Thursday,\" said Miller on the eve of the Eden T20I in Kolkata.\n\"India are an amazing T20 side with huge players. It gives us a lot of confidence moving forward coming close to the World Twenty20,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:40:09.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
