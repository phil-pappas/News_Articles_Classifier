The Utah Republican, first elected to Congress in 2008, is launching a campaign less than a week before the Oct. 8 leadership elections for the House GOP Conference. The date for a floor vote to pick the next speaker has not been set yet.\nMcCarthy (R-Calif.) is the overwhelming favorite to win, and it’s unclear how many votes Chaffetz can garner.\nChaffetz's office would not comment.\nThe last-minute move by the fourth-term lawmaker underscores frustration among some members of the Republican Conference with the current choices to lead the conference after Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) leaves at the end of the month. Boehner announced last week he is resigning effective Oct. 30 amid growing discontentment among conservatives with his decisions on major policy questions, including government funding, the Ex-Im Bank and boosting the debt ceiling. All of those issues confront Republicans this fall.\nBoehner secretly urged Gowdy to run for leader By Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan\nRep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) is the only challenger who has announced that he will run against McCarthy.\nChaffetz earlier this week made headlines when he backed his close friend, Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), for majority leader during an interview on Fox News. Gowdy, a McCarthy friend and ally, has ruled out seeking any leadership job.\nWays and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Wis.), the only other serious threat to McCarthy's ascension to speaker, has also ruled out seeking the job.\nChaffetz's planned run comes just a few hours after he called on McCarthy to apologize for his remarks this week that the Benghazi panel’s work has hurt 2016 Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the polls. Those remarks were seen as bolstering Democrats’ long-running argument that the committee has as much to do with politics as it does investigating the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attacks.\nChaffetz, an affable lawmaker who assumed his Oversight chairmanship at the beginning of this Congress, has wielded his gavel to investigate allegations that Planned Parenthood is profiting from the sale of fetal tissue, as well as the Secret Service and IRS Commissioner John Koskinen’s actions following the tea party targeting scandal.\nVideo of Jason Chaffetz at Generation Next event Chaffetz, 48, has also investigated the Benghazi terrorist attacks and the “Fast and Furious” gun running operation that went awry — an Oversight committee probe that led to then-Attorney General Eric Holder being held in contempt of Congress.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:06:25.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
