We know the people involved. So it just makes sense to have a group of seasoned cops and supervisors target those individuals – and that’s how we’re going to push violence down further than it is now.” \nO’Neill said that rather than doing “jump outs” and making street arrests, this unit will concentrate on gathering intelligence. \nThe new Citywide Anti-Crime Team will be an offshoot of the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, formed to focus on counter-terrorism issues and provide a permanent group of police personnel to deal with crime spikes and trends, officials said. \nThe unit is composed of two lieutenants, four sergeants and 16 police officers, according to O’Neill. \n“A lot of what they’re going to do is investigative work based on intel gleaned from people we lock up, from data that we have,” O’Neill said. “These are people that want to be there and are dedicated to this type of work.” \nNo weapons seizures have been reported yet by the unit, which has been working for about two weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:39:21.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
