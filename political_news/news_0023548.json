He said he would remain majority leader, a post he has held since August 2014. \nHouse Republicans scrambled to identify a replacement who could bridge their divisions. A move to draft House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan had made no headway as of the end of the day. \nRyan, Republicans' leading voice on fiscal matters and their 2012 vice presidential candidate, said shortly after McCarthy's announcement that he would not run for speaker. But Republican lawmakers later said they were still urging him on. \n\"My statement stands. I haven't changed anything,\" Ryan later told reporters in the Capitol. \"I've got nothing to add right now.\" \nBoehner, who planned to retire from Congress on Oct. 30, said he would stay on the job as speaker until a replacement is elected. It was not clear whether an Oct. 29 vote for speaker in the full House would still take place. \nUnder the leadership of Boehner, an Ohio Republican who relied on McCarthy as an ally, Republicans stumbled into a 16-day government shutdown in 2013 and waged a debt-limit standoff with Obama that brought the country to the brink of default in 2011, leading to the United States' first-ever debt rating downgrade. \nCongress faces another deadline to lift the debt limit on Nov. 5 and another potential shutdown threat in December. \nThe next speaker will have to navigate some of these issues while answering to a newly assertive conservative wing at a time when the party is trying to show voters they can govern effectively ahead of the November 2016 presidential elections. \nIn several closed-door meetings this week, McCarthy told Republican lawmakers he would run the House in a more inclusive manner than Boehner had. \nBut he failed to convince the 40 or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, a group aligned with the Tea Party movement that calls for lower taxes, less federal spending and reduction of the national debt and federal budget deficit. \nThe caucus decided to back a rival of McCarthy, Representative Daniel Webster of Florida. \nMcCarthy also faced criticism for suggesting last week that a congressional probe of the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, was designed to hurt Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Clinton was secretary of state at the time of the attack, which killed four Americans. \nHouse Republicans' inability to merely pick a leader comes after Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, also a Republican, had gone to great lengths to demonstrate that their party can effectively run Congress and should be trusted with the White House in 2017. \nThe two lawmakers who had challenged McCarthy for the post, Webster and Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, said they were still in the race and others likely will enter. \n\"It was just absolutely stunning what happened,\" Chaffetz said. \nRepublican Representative Walter Jones earlier this week asked the speaker candidates to step aside if they had committed any personal \"misdeeds\" that could embarrass the party, without naming any specific concerns. \nAsked whether that request was a factor in his decision to quit the race, McCarthy, flanked by his wife and children, said, \"No. Come on.\" \nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest urged Republicans to raise the debt ceiling promptly. He said \"there's been a rupture in the Republican Party\" between moderates and a vocal conservative minority. \n\"It does threaten their ability to make a strong case to the American public that they have what it takes to govern the country,\" Earnest said at a news briefing. \nSenator John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, warned that his party must put an end to the turmoil or risk voter backlash next year. \n\"If this turmoil continues I can surely understand why people would wonder what's going on in the Republican Party,\" McCain told MSNBC. \n(Additional reporting by David Lawder , Roberta Rampton , Doina Chiacu , Susan Heavey and Lisa Lambert ; Editing by Grant McCool and Ken Wills ) U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), flanked by his wife Judy (L), explains his decision to pull out of a Republican caucus secret ballot vote to determine the nominee to replace retiring House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), on Capitol Hill in Washington, October...
