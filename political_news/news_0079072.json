President Obama said that the shooter was \"sick.\" Many of the conservative pundits refer to these criminals \"deranged\" and \"suffering from mental illness.\" I don't disagree. But aren't we deranged for allowing this sort of cancer to spread throughout our land rather doing everything we can to arrest it's advance? Why do we accept this sort of terrorism? \nWhat will it take for us to realize that we are being terrorized? This shooter and others have targeted Christians before shooting them. Does it need to go a step further? Will it take a jihadist explicitly killing Christians in the name of Allah on American soil for us to understand that we need to restrict access to firearms? Will it be the perception that the threat is external that will prompt us to react? Why can't we see that a domestic threat is still a threat? Why can't we react based simply on the loss of human life? \nAnd ultimately, when will the God -- Allah, Jehovah, or whatever -- given lives of these victims trump the profits of gun producers? Those who are pro-gun fiercely claim their right to bear arms. Well, what about the victims' \"inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,\" as determined by our Declaration of Independence? Do we just skip over the first one, Life, without which you can't even have liberty or happiness? \nHow do these very same people protect so fiercely the lives of an embryo while sacrificing the lives of kindergarten children, college students, teachers, those working at the Washington Naval Yard and those enjoying a movie? Or that of a United States Member of Congress? How don't they see the hypocrisy? And why don't they see that the proliferation of firearms (and gun manufacturers' profits) is directly linked and correlated with the incidence of mass shootings? Why don't they see that NRA has engineered and amplified their belief that the Second Amendment needs evangelical defending, and that it has done so for it's own financial benefit? \nThis debate over policy is a game with life or death consequences -- in fact, not a game at all. The winners win money and political points. The losers -- victims, survivors, witnesses and those of us who have become numb to it all -- lose lives, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and ultimately, human decency. \nSo here's my last question: Why is this even a question? \nFollow Keisha Sutton-James on Twitter: www.twitter.com/Ksuttonjames More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:21:40.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
