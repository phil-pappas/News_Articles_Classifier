It is a mammoth merger, which creates a giant that will dominate the brewery industry with a whopping 30% of the global beer drinking market. Agreed in principle, this is a $ 100 bn (â‚¬ 878 bn) deal in which the US Anheuser-Busch InBev will acquire the British SABMiller.\nOn Monday evening, the two companies agreed to bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Corona and Peroni, Grolsch, and Pilsner Urquell. Other major brewers, such as Heineken and Carlsberg, will pale in comparison.\nIn the US, the emerging company will control 70% of the market and maybe forced to shed some assets. The EU may also press for assets sales in Eastern Europe. In China, the company will be a market-leader. South Africa has warned that it will be reviewing the agreement and its implications for tax revenues and may seek to block it.\nThe main rationale behind the deal for the US company is market entry in some of the most dynamic markets in the world, most prominently Africa, but also Asia and Latin America, just as developed economies become saturated.\nThe merger is facilitated by the availability of cheap liquidity. The new corporate Colossus will be bigger than Disney, Nestle, Coca Cola, and just about the size of Facebook.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:51:36.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
