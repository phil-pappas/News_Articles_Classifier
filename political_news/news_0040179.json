Alabama requires photo identification to vote. \n“This is a blast from the Jim Crow past,” she told about 700 people at a luncheon of the Alabama Democratic Conference, the largest caucus of the state Democratic Party. \nClinton also mocked Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush for their opposition to restoring Voting Rights Act provisions struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013, and she chided Ohio Gov. John Kasich for curtailing early voting in his state. \n“What part of democracy are these Republicans so afraid of?” Clinton asked. \nNeither her criticisms nor her positions were new. But the venue offered her a chance to champion voting rights to an important constituency. \nAlabama is among almost a dozen states stretching from Virginia to Texas that are scheduled to vote early in the nominating process in 2016. In a number of those states, Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia and Louisiana, blacks could make up a majority or close to a majority of the Democratic primary electorate. \nThe front-loaded Southern schedule is actually a byproduct of Republicans’ domination in the region. GOP leaders who run statehouses here wanted their constituents, nearly all of them white conservatives, to have greater influence in choosing the Republican nominee. \nYet that also elevated Southern Democrats, largely black voters. It’s a constituency Clinton has cultivated for decades and addressed effortlessly as she dropped local references into her remarks and spoke about people she’d met in the area as far back as the 1980s. \nShe never mentioned her closest competitor, but it was an approach that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders cannot match. \nThough Sanders is strong in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire, surveys suggest he trails Clinton significantly in Southern states.
