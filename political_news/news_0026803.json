He planned a trip to Virginia Beach earlier this month, but cancelled it due to expected severe weather and flooding. \nTrump, who provided live commentary of the Democratic debate via Twitter, marveled at how different the gathering of five Democrats had been from the first two Republican showdowns, which were marked by frequent clashes. \n\"There was no attack!\" he said of Clinton's treatment, describing the last Republican face-off as \"like a reality television show.\" \nTrump's hourlong speech was also interrupted at one point by a group of about a dozen rowdy protesters who began jumping up and down, screaming \"Stop Trump!\" They were quickly pushed to the back of the crowd by angry Trump supporters and escorted out of the building by Trump security officials and police officers. \nEarlier on Wednesday, Trump's campaign released on an online ad also targeted Sanders, portraying the Vermont senator as too weak to lead. After a series of scary-looking images including Islamic State militants, an announcer declares, \"The world is a dangerous place. We need a tough, strong leader.\" \nIt then cuts to video of Sanders being interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters at an event, accompanied by circus music, as the announcer says, \"And it's not this guy.\" \nWhile the two stand at very different sides of the ideological spectrum, their positions, including denouncing certain free trade deals and railing against the influence of money in politics, sometimes overlap.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:13:11.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
