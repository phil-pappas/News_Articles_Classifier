The remaining 92 cases are from Santa Clara County. \nBut county authorities said the outbreak appears to be peaking. \n\"What we're beginning to see is a leveling off,\" Santa Clara County Director of Public Health Dr. Sara Cody said. \nTwo men who were sickened after eating at Mariscos San Juan restaurant on 4th Street in San Jose sued the owners for negligence Wednesday. Both were hospitalized but since have been released, though they allege they still suffer lingering effects. \nThe owners have not been available for comment, but county authorities said they are cooperating with the investigation. \nShigella infections can be very serious and, in rare cases, fatal, county officials said. The bacteria cause severe diarrhea and are easily transmitted, most often when an infected person doesn't wash hands after using the bathroom and then handles food. \nCounty health officials suspect the disease was spread by a contaminated food handler, but the source remains under investigation. County officials have collected stool samples from Mariscos owners and employees, but does not expect lab results until next week, Cody said. \nCheck back for more updates to this story.
