Are those who signed on to put this abomination on our ballots to amend our constitution even aware that its passage would tie the hands of the Legislature so that they will be unable to balance the state budget? Are you aware that in the last four years, total education funding for MAEP and the 30-plus education budgets outside MAEP have increased at the highest rate in all of state history? Initiative 42A is the relief answer, as it allows us to keep the budgeting decisions out of “the courts” hands and to keep it as the constitution calls for now in the hands of those YOU elect to the Legislature.
