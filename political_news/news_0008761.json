It's a false and fabricated chargesheet and there is no incriminating evidence against any of the accused so they are discharged. The chargesheet is full of distorted facts and an attempt has been made to mislead the court,\" the judge said.\nThe \"CBI Director is directed to make an inquiry against erring officials,\" the court said.\nThe court had, on August 31, reserved its order after hearing arguments on framing of charges against the accused.\nShyamal Ghosh, a 1965-batch retired IAS officer, was the Telecom Secretary between February 7, 2000 and May 31, 2002.\nThe CBI had earlier argued that Ghosh had given additional spectrum to the telecom companies at \"throwaway prices\" causing a huge loss to the exchequer. He had countered the agency's arguments, saying private firms were not the only beneficiaries of surplus radio waves, but the state-run MTNL and BSNL had also benefitted. He also contended that it could not be said that allocation was done primarily to benefit private companies and asserted that he had not abused his official position in any manner.\nSimilarly, the accused firms had also countered the loss-to-exchequer theory presented by the CBI, saying they were allotted \"spare radio waves\" which would have incurred gains to the government.\nIn its chargesheet, the CBI had alleged that Ghosh had \"deliberately\" and with \"malafide intention\" not obtained comments of then Member (Finance) of the Department of Telecommunications on the issue despite the matter involving huge \"financial implications\".\nAll the accused were chargesheeted for the alleged offence of criminal conspiracy (section 120-B) of the IPC and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\n 2G case CBI nation Also Read TSRTC will operate 3,855 special buses for festival rush Special I teams formed to take up investigations in Vijayawada Special Investigation Team to look into Maharashtra youth case RTI activist: BDA sold flats at high price, made Rs 1000 crore illegally", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/CBI_5_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/CBI_5_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151015/nation-current-affairs/article/court-slams-cbi-fabricating-charges-against-accused-2g-case", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:04:21.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
