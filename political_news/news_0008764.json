So I do think that it's going to be hard to dig out of something like that,\" Priebus told the Examiner. \"I don't anticipate that. I think ... history is on our side.\"\nThe chairman went on to discuss issues surrounding Hillary Clinton and the \"vastly improved\" efforts undertaken at the RNC, adding that the \"whole big picture\" looks good for the GOP in 2016.\nThis is not the first time Priebus has hinted at the troubles facing the GOP on the national stage. In June , Priebus told radio host Laura Ingraham that a third straight presidential loss for the party would result in them relinquishing their spot as a national party.\nThe complete interview with the RNC chairman will appear in the Oct. 26th edition of the Washington Examiner magazine.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Bush gears up for the SEC primary in Tennessee Jeb Bush has a 57-person delegate team spread across each of Tennessee's nine congressional districts.\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 10/16/15 1:12 PM Top Story Cummings blasts Republicans over Huma Abedin interview Cummings said he hoped the committee's work would not be subject to more \"very targeted leaks.\"\nBy Sarah Westwood • 10/16/15 12:13 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:39:40.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
