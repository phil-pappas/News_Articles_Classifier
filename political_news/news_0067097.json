Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) after meeting with the House Freedom Caucus on Oct. 21. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) By Michael Gerson Opinion writer October 22 at 8:28 PM Follow @mjgerson Having tested the thickness of the political ice, Paul Ryan seems convinced it will support the weight of a House speaker. Given the nature of the Republican coalition (in parts fractious, restless and heedless of political reality), he will end up in the water. But perhaps not immediately, and perhaps not until after considerable accomplishment. The most knowledgeable, thoughtful conservative in the House is now likely to lead the House, which is the sign of an institution still capable of random acts of sanity. And the manner of Ryan’s victory is worth considering, because it is the only way that Republicans will regain the presidency.\nWhat might be called the Ryan Test — give me a meaningful job with a reasonable prospect of governing success and a shot at personal happiness or leave me the hell alone — applies most immediately to the workings of the House.

The weakening of committees in both the House and Senate has been a source of dysfunction, encouraging frustrated, angry, political freelancing — and crackdowns on political freelancing that cause further bitterness.\nBut the Ryan Test has a larger application. Ryan is essentially asking conservatives within the GOP: What is your actual goal? Is it to govern in the public interest according to a conservative vision while building a political coalition capable of supporting needed reforms? Or is it the expression of outrage, rooted in a right-wing populism that is in fundamental (and continual) revolt against the political establishment?\nThis has been the main question posed to Republicans since the", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@mjgerson"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:21:48.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
