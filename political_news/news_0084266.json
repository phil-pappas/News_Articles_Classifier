Unemployment in Germany increased in September, according to data released Wednesday by the Federal Labor Agency.\nSpecifically, Germany went from 2 million to 2,795 million or from 4,5% in August to 6,4% in September. This level of unemployment is still the lowest level since Germany’s reunification but indicates a negative trend. German unemployment pales in comparison with the 10,9% Eurozone average.\nOne interpretation is that Germany is affected by the deceleration of the currently not-so-emerging markets. Germany is more exposed to China than all other EU member states, particularly as regards to cars and the engineering industry.\nIn 2014, China accounted for 6,6% of Germany’s exports. That was Germany’s 4 th biggest market following France, the United States, and Britain.\nSince, the US has overtaken France. But, in 2015, China was as important as Greece for German exports. Also, China weighs on markets to which Germany is exposed, including Brazil.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:51:56.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
