So far we have received only media reports about the incident and the follow up actions like compensation and enhanced police patrolling in the area,\" Chairman of National Commission for Minorities Naseem Ahmad told PTI.\n\"The weekly meeting of the Commission is due on coming Tuesday and by then we will, hopefully, receive the report of the local administration to decide our next step,\" he said.\nThe normal practice is that the Commission waits for a report by the local administration before stepping in any matter concerning minorities although its not a rule, the Chairman of Commission said.\n\"Once the report is obtained by us, we will discuss it and decide the next step in the matter including a visit of the village of the deceased,\" he said.\nAhmad said the Commission had written to Gautam Buddh Nagar'S DM Nagendra Prasad Singh the next day of the incident to give a report on the lynching of 50-year-old Mohammed Iqlakh which took place on September 28.\nThe National Commission Chairman, without commenting on the response of the state machinery and local administration after the incident, said, \"Its not a question of our satisfaction. We have so far only media reports and we will act once we get the report of the administration.\"\n Dadri lynching National Commission for Minorities Dadri lynching report nation Also Read Mafia thrives, state loses its sand Parliament panel rejects Governmentâ€™s proposal to try juveniles as adults Policeman who charged Amit Shah for alleged hate speech transferred Gujarat Congress shifts state office to bring 'good luck'", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/nation-current-affairs/article/minorities-commission-yet-receive-report-dadri-lynching", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Dadri.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Dadri.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:50:23.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
