In recent videos, interviews and in a memo released today, the Kentucky senator is trying to get the word out that his campaign is still breathing, and he's not planning to pull the plug anytime soon.\nIt's a sign of the tough times that have befallen the Paul campaign -- which is currently buried in the polls and struggling to raise money -- that he's been forced to show proof of life to counter speculation that he's dropping out of the race.\nThe latest example came Thursday when Paul campaign chief strategist Doug Stafford and campaign manager Chip Englander released a lengthy public memo laying out all the reasons why the Kentucky senator (referred to as \"SRP\") has no plans to quit.\n\"Ground game and political organization have a disproportionate impact in primaries and especially caucuses - and SRP has the best organization in America,\" the memo began. The top Paul staffers argue that media attention has focused too much on lackluster polling for Paul and not enough on the robust ground organization the campaign is putting together.\n\"The media can be forgiven for not grasping the significance of the ground organization we are building because it is not highly visible except on the few occasions we mobilize (and win). Some reporters have covered the fact that SRP always comes in first when people are actually voting, although most have ignored it altogether,\" Stafford and Englander wrote. \"What makes less sense, though, is that the media plays up any drop in the polls SRP experiences, while ignoring his momentum and the precipitous decline of other candidates.\"\nThe upcoming Republican presidential debates, Englander and Stafford continued, will also give Paul a boost because \"viewers will be able to decide the narrative for themselves. While each of the first three debates experienced 5-6 week breaks between them, the next two debates are separated by only 13 days - a significant opportunity for SRP to have some repetition before voters for the first time.\"\nShortly after the memo's release Thursday, the Kentucky senator went on CNN for a one-on-one interview with Wolf Blitzer. There too he was confronted with questions about how much longer he could stay in the race given his fundraising (he raised $2.5 million in the last quarter, down from $7 million previously) and weak polling. Paul said counting super PACs, his real fundraising number was more like $20 million.\n\"I do think though that raising $20 million is not an insignificant amount of money. Also we have about 150,000 donors. So this is a significant movement...We do get a little bit prickly and annoyed when people are saying, 'well didn't he only raise $2.5 [million], why is he still in the race?' Well really to put it in perspective we've raised $20 million, have 150,000 donors. We also have something significant to add: right now everybody's talking about no-fly zone over Syria and Iraq -- Hillary Clinton's for it, most of the Republicans are for it,\" Paul told the CNN host. \"I think it's the world's dumbest idea and a recipe for disaster and a recipe for war. If I'm not in the race that voice doesn't get heard.\"\n2016\nTrump threatens to pull out of next GOP debate By Alex Isenstadt\nPaul senior adviser Steve Munisteri explained that Paul has been puzzled by the candidates who dropped out months before the first votes are cast.\n“Rand says around the office, ‘I don’t understand why [Wisconsin Gov. Scott] Walker dropped out. I don’t understand why [former Texas Gov. Rick] Perry dropped out. I don’t know why anyone would drop out until you get to the caucuses,” Munisteri told POLITICO in early October.\nPaul's prickliness surrounding the issue was on display earlier this week when the campaign livestreamed most of Paul's day on the campaign trail in Iowa. At one point, while answering questions, Paul was forced to acknowledge questions about whether he would drop out soon.\n\"The third question, most popular question from Google is, is Rand Paul running for president? And uh, I don't know. Wouldn't be doing this dumbass livestreaming if I weren't. So yes, I still am running for president,\" Paul said. \"Get over it.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:31:56.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
