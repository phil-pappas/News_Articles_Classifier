By Lauren Camera Oct. 9, 2015 | 6:00 a.m. EDT\n+ More As the former superintendent of Tennessee schools, Kevin Huffman oversaw the implementation of the state's $500 million Race to the Top grant, which ushered in significant education policy changes. Among them, the adoption and implementation of the Common Core State Standards and aligned state tests, the expansion of charter schools, new teacher evaluation and compensation systems based in part on student test scores, and an aggressive school turn-around effort for the state's worst schools.\nHeading Tennessee schools during such a tumultuous period of change garnered Huffman more than his fair share of critics, many of whom attacked him for what they considered a brash leadership style and for asking too much of teachers and students too fast. At one point, nearly 60 school district leaders called for his resignation.\n[ READ: Education Reforms Are Here to Stay ]\nHuffman announced he was stepping down in November 2014, and Republican Gov. Bill Haslam tapped Candice McQueen, the then-dean of Lipscomb University's College of Education, one of the top performing teacher preparation program in the nation, as his replacement. The pick garnered cheers from both the education reform camp that supported Haslam, as well as his harshest opponents.\nIn just under a year, McQueen has done much to repair the fractured relationship between the state and Huffman's most vocal critics. But the major education policies implemented under Haslam are largely intact. And the state is now regarded as the fastest-improving on math and reading in the country.\nU.S. News recently talked with Huffman about his experience in Tennessee and where he thinks the state's education system is headed. Excerpts:\nWhen you were asked about the job, you knew you were being hired to put in place some really difficult policies. Was this something that took convincing or were you eager to try to take this on?\nI was very excited coming in. One of the reasons I was excited was because the policy changes on the horizon were what I believed in and there was seemingly a broad swath of support for the work. The creation of the Race to the Top application put a lot of people on record as supporting a move to higher standards, a move to evaluations based partially on student performance, and a move to taking on aggressively the lowest performing schools in states. That combination I believed would work, but also that this is something a lot of people in the state affixed their name to.\nDid you feel like the odds were always going to be stacked against you?\nObviously some of the stuff we were doing was hard. I probably overestimated the extent to which people said, 'We're going to do this and I support this,' meant they would be willing to do it when the time came. I was overly optimistic on that front. â€¦ I also think it would have been hard for anybody in hindsight to foresee the pushback on the [Common Core] standards. When I came in, I don't think anybody was saying in 2011 that all the states have that been working with the Common Core standards since 2008 will have all sorts of political challenges. That was not on peoples' radars at all. While you could have imagined pushback coming from teacher evaluation and accountability and school turnarounds, I think the standards piece was a wing of political pushback that very few people imagined would reach the crescendo that it did.\nIs there anything you think you could have done better to get the public more on your side?\nYeah, tons of things. I came in in the tail end of the 2010-2011 school year and Tennessee had signed up to deliver teacher evaluations in the 2011-2012 school year. When I stepped in, we already had summer training that was planned for the coming year. Our communication directly with teachers could have been much better prior to the first year of teacher evaluations. We spent a lot of time and energy training administrators on teacher evaluations and banking on administrators carrying the message to teachers. In hindsight that is one area we could have been much more proactive about. However much you think you need to communicate, not just about the change but also the rationale for the change, you need to communicate it two to three times more.\nWas there ever a moment when you thought to yourself maybe this is too much change too fast?\nI believe if we could go back in time and knowing what we learned down the road, communicate and take it straight to the teachers in a stronger way right out of the gate, it would have been more palatable to a lot of people. We could have made it less hard.\n[ ALSO: Teachers' Unions Look to Clinton to Save Them ]\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan loves to use Tennessee as an example of a state that made courageous changes and is now seeing that impact in the form of increase d student achievement rates. Do you think that's here to stay?\nI don't think Tennessee is declaring victory. We had major gains last time around on [the National Assessment of Educational Progress], which was great. We've seen increases on state test scores, increases on math and good growth in high school in the last couple of years. I think if you go into classrooms in Tennessee today you see better teaching than you did five years ago, which I think is a big deal. The state has made big strides. It's delivering a better education than it had before. But Tennessee is a state that clearly could be in the top half of the country and it's not there yet.\nWhat was the transition like to Candice McQueen taking the reins? Did she call you up and ask for advice?\nCandice is incredibly smart and competent. We don't talk on a regular basis. But I announced I was leaving in November and then didn't leave until January, so I had good opportunity to overlap with her and spend time in transition. There's no doubt it's her show now. She obviously has a long-standing relationship [with the education community in Tennessee]. Frankly, it was a good time for a change. It was a good time for people to be focusing on the work and the policies and not focusing on the people and the personalities. One of the things that became frustrating at the tail end of my term is that as things become politicized, you see people making decisions about what they support and not support based on whether other people support or don't support them and not the merits.\nAnything else you think is important that you'd like people to know about your time as state chief?\nI think that there's sometimes a tendency to [say] the bomb thrower goes in and detonates things and then they get the nice person to come in behind them. Sometimes there is a misconception that, 'Gosh if person X just went in and was nicer things would have been different.' But that's not always the case. If you're doing really hard policy change, you're going to have people take some shots at you.\nThe Report Thank you, your email has been submitted.\nSubscribe to our\nNewsletter Stay informed with exclusive content sent\ndirectly to your inbox.\nTAGS: education education policy K-12 education Teach for America", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdz8z0%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdz8z0%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Polarizing%20Education%20Chief%20Looks%20Back%20on%20His%20Tumultuous%20Reign", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdz8z0%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdz8z0%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Polarizing%20Education%20Chief%20Looks%20Back%20on%20His%20Tumultuous%20Reign", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdz8z0%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdz8z0%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Polarizing%20Education%20Chief%20Looks%20Back%20on%20His%20Tumultuous%20Reign&summary=Kevin%20Huffman%20led%26nbsp%3BTennessee%20schools%20through%20a%20period%20of%20dramatic%20change.&source=U.%20S.%20News"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:10:06.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
