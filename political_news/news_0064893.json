Meanwhile, the political climate has turned around and the last polls on Sunday, October 11 th indicate that he could negotiate if not exactly win his reelection. On the other hand, the PP risks coming third.\nThe Spanish PP is nowhere near its 2011 peak of 44,6%. Nor are the Socialists (PSOE) for that matter, who in 2011 held a 28,9%. In 2011, the combined vote of the traditional pan-European pendulum stood at 70,4%. Sunday’s polls indicate that PSOE and PP have a combined vote a 47%, losing a combined 23%.\nStill, PSOE is leading PP by a fraction, that is, 23,5% to 23,4%. That is the first poll to show a PSOE lead since the beginning of September. Throughout September and the first week of October, most polls had the PP leading the race by 4-9%. Electoral behavior is volatile.\nBut, the most radical trend, according to the polls, is the emergence of Ciudadanos (”citizens”) as a third party in Spanish politics with 21,5%. The centrist social liberal party has not only overtaken Podemos, whose current support stands at 14,1% but is a fraction away from becoming the number 2 in Spanish politics.\nThe PP knows that an absolute majority is no longer possible, and its lead over PSOE is closing. But, since May, the liberal Ciudadanos have set precedents of cooperation in local government with both the PP and PSOE. The PP believes that a deal with Ciudadanos is possible.\nWhile PP benefits from a surging GDP and a considerable drop in unemployment, the party’s reputation has been marred by ongoing revelations of a financial scandal, as well as a legacy of tough austerity measures.\nCiudadanos are running on an anti-corruption ticket, endorsing fiscal consolidation, less state, less taxes, and national unity. An alliance that will include Mariano Rajoy as a Prime Minister may be too hard a deal to broker. Still, this is precisely what the PP is after. Rajoy could yet negotiate another term in government, or his party could end up third for the first time since Spain’s transition to democracy.\nThe key is first place. Thus far, PSOE’s leader, Pedro Sánchez, is favorite to win the electoral race and form a coalition government with Podemos. PSOE and PP are both fighting Ciudadanos for voters. Addressing the PODEMOS constituency with too left a discourse could cost PSOE critical votes.\nHowever, Ciudadanos are but a fraction away from securing second place, precisely because they draw voters left and right of the center. Whilst PP must heed to the right and PSOE to the left, Ciudadanos represents a “purist center,” vulnerable but also flexible and thus far not stained by the inevitable compromises of power. Certainly, the center is now too crowded space for Podemos.\nEstablished in 2005 in Catalonia as a pro-unity party, Ciudadanos secured 18% in regional elections on September 27 th , which were widely regarded as a proxy referendum on independence. They are now becoming a force to be reckoned with on a national level, having in recent weeks an increasing appeal on conservative voters. Many regard Ciudadanos as a re-founded PP, without the luggage of the Franco regime and corruption. If they manage to become one of the two, then Spanish politics will change dramatically, but remain essentially the same.\nIf PP holds on to the first place, Spanish politics may remain the same in form and substance. If it loses, it may change in form; in substance, the dominant cleavage will remain center-left versus center-right.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:47:27.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
