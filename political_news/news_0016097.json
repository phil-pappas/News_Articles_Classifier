Rogosin, a Member of the NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System, is unique in being both non-profit and the only small dialysis organization (less than 200 dialysis units) participating in the new CEC Model. Rogosin's End-Stage Renal Disease Seamless Care Organization (ESCO), called Rogosin Kidney Care Alliance, is one of thirteen ESCOs participating in the CEC Model.\n\"Everyone at Rogosin feels privileged to be participating in the testing and evaluation of the new CEC Model as an End-Stage Renal Disease Seamless Care Organization. We believe it will benefit and improve care management and patient outcomes,\" said Barry Smith , MD, PhD, President & CEO of Rogosin. \"What we learn as an ESCO is certain to be of benefit in our better management of not only advanced renal disease, but complex chronic illness more generally,\" he added.\nAn ESRD Seamless Care Organization (ESCO) is a group of dialysis facilities, nephrologists, and other health care providers working together with Medicare to coordinate and improve the quality of care for patients. The goal is for enhanced care coordination and more patient-centered care, ultimately improving patient outcomes and satisfaction. In a major paradigm shift, ESCO owners are clinically and fiscally responsible for all care offered to patients in the ESCO programs, and not just dialysis care or care specifically related to a patient's kidney disease.\nRogosin Kidney Care Alliance (RKCA) is committed to a patient-centered approach and has an interdisciplinary care team and relationships with other service providers in place for the benefit of patients and their caregivers. The RKCA ESCO serves a population of approximately 400 Medicare ESRD beneficiaries who receive dialysis services from two dialysis facilities of The Rogosin Institute: The Rogosin Kidney Center, located on the East Side of Manhattan and Rogosin Kidney Center Queens, located in Woodside, Queens.\nMedicare patients receiving dialysis treatments in a Rogosin facility will receive a letter notifying them of their participation in the new model of care. As a result, they will not experience any changes in their health insurance coverage or benefit options. What they should experience is better care.\nThe statements contained in this document are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of CMS.
