It undercuts that relationship so I never on a difficult issue, never say what I think finally until I go up in the Oval with him alone.” \nJoe Biden Aide Sends Letter Detailing Vice President’s Looming 2016 Decision \nThis tracks differently from how the vice president described the decision in years past when he publicly admitted he opposed the raid that resulted in the al Qaeda founder’s death. \n“He got to me. He said, ‘Joe, what do you think?’ And I said, ‘You know, I didn’t know we had so many economists around the table.’ I said, ‘We owe the man a direct answer. Mr. President, my suggestion is, don’t go. We have to do two more things to see if he’s there,” Biden recalled in 2012. \nBiden lauded the president’s final decision, saying, “He knew what was at stake, not just the lives of those brave warriors, but literally the presidency.” \nBiden’s potential 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton wrote about Biden’s skepticism of the raid in her book, “Hard Choices.” In last week’s debate, Clinton talked about the raid as she touted her role advising the president. \n“I think while you’re talking about the tough decision that President Obama had to make about Osama bin Laden, where I was one of his few advisers,” she said. \nGet real-time updates as this story unfolds.
