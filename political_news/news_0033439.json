The referendum asks voters to consider scrapping a two-term limit and 70-year-old age limit for candidates.\nElectoral commission president Henri Bouka encouraged people to get to the polls Sunday, after what he said was a slow start. About 200 stood in line at a poll in Brazzaville.\nPoliticians campaigning against the referendum had called for a campaign of \"civil disobedience,\" but by the end of the week called for calm. Four people were killed on Tuesday during violent demonstrations.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:01:02.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
