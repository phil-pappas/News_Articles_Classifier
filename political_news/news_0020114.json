After being attacked by ink they reportedly abused him. \nUnfazed by the threat Kulkarni had said the event would continue as scheduled despite threats from the Sena. Kasuri is scheduled to attend the launch of his book ‘Neither a Hawk nor a Dove: An Insider’s Account of Pakistan ’s Foreign Policy’ at 5.30 p.m in Mumbai ’s Worli area. \nKulkarni, Chairman of Observer and Research Foundation, a foreign policy think tank, had met Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray at the latter’s residence Matoshree. It is understood that the meeting was futile and Kulkarni left Matoshree without getting any assurance from the Sena leader whose party’s threat to disrupt Pakistan ghazal singer Ghulam Ali ’s concerts led to cancellation of his events in Mumbai and Pune recently. \n“I have requested Uddhav Thackeray that Shiv Sena should not oppose the book launch event. I also told him that the event will proceed despite Sena’s threat,” Kulkarni said . \nKulkarni has served as speechwriter for BJP veterans Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L K Advani, and was a key aide to both BJP leaders. The Shiv Sena has threatened to disrupt the launch of Kasuri’s book “ Neither a Hawk nor a Dove: An Insider’s Account of Pakistan ’s Foreign Policy ” . \nThe threat came days after a warning from the Shiv Sena led to the cancellation of concerts in Mumbai and Pune by acclaimed Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali . Kulkarni said Kasuri is his guest and he had taken a principled stand to go ahead with the book launch. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has complete security for the event. Kulkarni had tweeted that the conflict between India and Pakistan can be resolved only through dialogue. He said the book launch was a small endeavour to keep the process of dialogue alive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:10:05.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
