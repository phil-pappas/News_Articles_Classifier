Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton take part in the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas. (Joe Raedle/Getty) \nLAS VEGAS — The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said it raised $1.3 million Tuesday in the four hours after the Democratic debate began. \nSanders appears to have successfully parlayed his most-talked about moment during the debate — telling Hillary Rodham Clinton that “the American people are sick and tired of talking about your damn e-mail” — into a sharp uptick in donations. \nA Sanders solicitation e-mailed to supporters while the debate was still going on included a video of the moment and seeks donations “before Bernie steps off the stage.” \nIn the video, Sanders argues that there are far more important things to discuss than Clinton’s use of private e-mail as secretary of state. Among them, he said, were the collapse of the middle class and the number of young people looking for decent jobs. \nSanders, a self-described democratic socialist, said the money raised Tuesday reflects the enthusiasm for his campaign. During the previous quarter, Sanders said that he raised $26 million.while Clinton raised about $28 million.
