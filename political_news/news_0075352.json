Maggie Hassan to run for US Senate The Associated Press CONCORD, N.H. â€” \nNew Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan has announced she's running for the U.S. Senate. \nIn an online video released Monday morning, the Democratic governor says she's running to get a response from Washington that matches progress New Hampshire has made in promoting business innovation and expanding economic opportunity. She says Washington has given in to powerful special interests and lobbyists \"who rigged the system for themselves and against the middle class.\" \nThe second-term governor is the first Democrat to announce she's in the race to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte. The 57-year-old Hassan is considered the best challenger for Ayotte in a swing state that could be pivotal in the contest to control the Senate. \nAyotte was elected in 2010. She says she expects a \"very spirited campaign.\" Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:54:51.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
