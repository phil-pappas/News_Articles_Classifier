Jeb Bush has picked up three points to be in fifth place, at 8%. His favorability rates have also improved 8 points since August. \nOn the other hand, Carly Fiorina's post-debate bounce has seemingly ebbed, as she dropped from 10% in August to 5% in Monday's poll. \nMonmouth surveyed 400 likely Republican Iowa caucus-goers from October 22-25 for the poll. which has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:39:37.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
