All other candidates are received less than 10 percent in both states. \nSouth Carolina and Nevada are the third and fourth states to vote or hold a caucus during the Republican primary process.\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina are both performing better in those states than the rest of their Republican rivals.

And Trump is ahead in all four.\"\nTrump's appeal, Luntz said, is that he \"finds the line and then crosses it and jumps a mile beyond it.\" His support also runs deep, and most voters say they're determined to stick with him no matter what he does. That makes it tough for candidates like Rubio and Bush to gain a foothold. \nHe's mostly reserved his attacks for other Republicans, but Trump offered some analysis of the Democratic debate at an event in Richmond, Virginia, where he called Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders a \"maniac.\"\n\"I watched Hillary last night [saying] we're gonna give this, we're gonna give that,\" Trump said. \"The poor woman she's gotta give everything away cause this maniac that was standing on her right is giving everything away so she's following that's what's happening. This socialist slash communist.\"\nHe told the audience Sanders would \"tax you people at 90 percent\" and \"take everything.\"\n\"Nobody heard the term communist, but you know what, I call him a socialist/communist, okay?
