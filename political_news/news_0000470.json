Noting that Donald Trump had vowed to drop out of the presidential race if his poll numbers collapse, Fox News’ Megyn Kelly asked Bush, \"What would it take to make you get out?\"\n“I’m not getting out. I believe we have a plan to be very competitive in the early states. We have the resources to stay with this,” Bush told Kelly. “I’m campaigning hard, I’m campaigning with heart, I’m campaigning in a way that will draw people towards our cause.”\n“This is the beginning of a hard race. I never thought it would be easy and it certainly hasn’t been. ... I believe that I’m gonna win the nomination,” he said.\nKelly pointed out that Donald Trump’s poll numbers have remained high for months. “No one has ever had this kind of a lead for this long of time and then gone on to lose the nomination,” she said.\nTrump: Clinton sounded 'terrible' in Benghazi hearing By Nick Gass\n“Well let’s talk about it in March, we’ll see what happens,” Bush responded.\nKelly asked if Bush's moderate stance on immigration is hurting him with Republican primary voters.\nBush responded that people had been misinformed about his immigration stance, and said that once they know the facts, Trump’s poll numbers will drop.\n“This guy is totally unique. He’s not a serious candidate, he’s a great entertainer,” Bush said.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:32:58.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
