(Teri Weaver | tweaver@syracuse.com) \nKessner lost last month to Pam Hunter in a Democratic primary for the 128th Assembly District. \nKessner raised nearly $9,000 in the challenge, according to her last filing, which was due before the primary. She spent a little more than $3,000, those older filings show. \nIn the final days of that Democratic race, Kessner made a television ad. That spending does not show up on the reports already filed with the state. \nA call to Kessner this morning was not immediately returned. \nHunter now faces Republican John Sharon in the Nov. 3 general election. Stott, a Democrat who also lost in the primary, remains on the ballot on the Conservative Party line. \nThe 128th Assembly District includes parts of Syracuse and the towns of DeWitt, Onondaga and Salina. The seat was left open after Sam Roberts left to become the state's commissioner for welfare and disability programs. \nContact Teri Weaver anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2274", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:01:45.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
