It is still not known how much was raised to print the diaries or the actual cost of printing the diaries. \nDr. Clement Apaak who says he played a role in the process of determining the choice of the company, revealed any company is free to present a proposal to print the diaires. \nJIT Magazines and Diary Services were selected because they presented an attractive improvement on previous copies of the diary, he explained. \nGovernment's attempt to clarify how the state procures diaries has raised more questions than answers about the ethical use of state symbols. \nGovernment officials, Deputy Communications Minister Felix Kwakye Ofosu, presidential staffers Stan Dogbe and Dr. Clement Apaak came out to explain that the state does not “spend a dime, a cent or even a pesewa producing” the diaries. \nGovernment was responding to claims by the 2016 flagbearer Nana Addo who during a party conference in Holland made reference to a media report that $10million was spent by the state on the diaries. \nNana Addo attempted to use this claim as an example of misplaced spending priorities of the ruling NDC government. \nBut government communication was quick to tear into the presidential candidate for making this claim without evidence. \nAddressing the ensuing controversy, Veteran journalist Kweku Baako Jnr has backed calls for the 2016 NPP Presidential candidate to apologise if he has no evidence to support his claim. \n“He has to be asked. If he has the answer he must provide it. if he doesn’t have he has to explain himself. If it means a retraction and an apology, he renders it.” \nBut Kweku Baako says government’s clarification that the diaries are printed by private companies at no cost to the state, leaves more questions than answers. \nThe Managing Editor of the New Crusading Guide newspaper said it is “mind-boggling” for the Presidency to bless the practice even if it was also done by previous governments. \nAccording to Kweku Baako Jnr, the monies raised by private companies thorugh the use of the presidency are “technically public funds”. \n“How much was raised? You don’t know? You don’t care?....so if they raised 20million and applied 10 million and used the other 10million for their own activities that’s agreed by government?” he charged. \nKweku Baako Jnr also questioned the process used to select the eventual printing company. \n“How did those companies get to know that they needed to make proposals? Was there a notice requiring this? If the notice was done ,when ,where how?” \nAccording to Kweku Baako, the presidentially sanctioned process of printing diares reveals the Presidency is “so mediocre and inept” SHARE THIS STORY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:56:11.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
