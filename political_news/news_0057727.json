The panel received little attention until March 2015, when it was revealed that it had been given emails about Libya from a personal email account that Mrs. Clinton had exclusively relied on when she was secretary of state. Q . What questions will Mrs. Clinton face about the Benghazi attacks? A . Lawmakers are likely to focus on Mrs. Clinton’s response to early warnings of increasingly dangerous security conditions in Benghazi — warnings that department officials failed to heed, an independent inquiry into the attack concluded in December 2012. That inquiry sharply criticized the State Department for a lack of seasoned security personnel and for relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound. But the report did not place blame on anyone higher than the level of assistant secretary. Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that she was briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi State Department post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it. Q :. What do we still not know about the Benghazi attack? A . Republicans contend that the administration has not provided an answer about why Susan E. Rice , the national security adviser who at the time was the United States ambassador to the United Nations, went on national television the Sunday after the attacks and provided an inaccurate account about what occurred. Ms. Rice said that the attacks were spontaneously spawned by an anti-American video and were not preplanned by terrorists. Mrs. Clinton will probably be asked about the administration’s initial narrative about the attacks. And, she will likely be asked why the administration had Ms. Rice appear on television instead of the secretary herself. Q . If the committee is investigating the attacks, why is Mrs. Clinton going to be asked about her emails? A . The emails about Libya that the committee received had never been provided to any of the congressional committees that investigated the attacks. Mr. Gowdy has said that he has the right to investigate Mrs. Clinton’s email arrangement because the committee’s charter calls for him to look into how the administration complied with other congressional inquiries into the incident. Mrs. Clinton and Democrats on the committee have said that Mr. Gowdy has no right to investigate her emails because they are not related to the attacks. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:13:18.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
