The coalition letter encourages Congress to continue to “exercise its power of the purse granted by the Constitution” and “freeze funding in any spending bill” for the fiduciary rule until the DOL withdraws the rule.\nThe coalition letter is addressed to House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Mitch Leader McConnell. The letter is also being sent to members and committees who oversee the Department of Labor and banking and financial services.\nView the coalition letter\nBackground material:\nObamacare for Your IRA Team Obama 'Protect' Your Retirement Account the Way It Has 'Protected' Your Health Care Comments of CEI and FreedomWorks Foundation to Department of Labor Savers Oppose 'Fiduciary Rule' Obama Labor Department Claims Will 'Protect' Them Date: Thursday, October 22, 2015 Publication Type: News Releases Issues: Banking and Finance", "external_links": ["http://cei.org//https://cei.org/content/coalition-letter-urging-congressional-leaders-defund-department-labors-fiduciary-rule", "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2015/07/06/don-t-let-them-obamacare-your-retirement-account.html", "http://cei.org//https://cei.org/expert/john-berlau", "http://cei.org//file:///C:/Users/christine.hall/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/6YIL1NTG/%C3%98%09https:/cei.org/content/cei-comments-labor-department-fiduciary-rule", "http://spectator.org/blog/63847/savers-oppose-&#039;fiduciary-rule&#039;-obama-labor-department-claims-will-&#039;protect&#039;-them", "http://cei.org//file:///C:/Users/christine.hall/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/6YIL1NTG/%C3%98%09http:/www.nationalreview.com/article/417525/obamacare-your-ira-john-berlau"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:53:59.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
