When the shots rang out, Parr pushed Reagan inside the presidential limousine and it sped away for the White House.\nAfter Reagan complained of chest pains and showed blood on his lips, Parr redirected the limousine to George Washington Hospital. As it turned out, Reagan had been hit in the chest and was bleeding internally. Doctors later said that any delay would have cost the president his life.\nIn a statement Friday, former first lady Nancy Reagan called Parr \"one of my true heroes.\"\nParr was born on Sept. 16, 1930, in Birmingham, Alabama. An Air Force veteran, he joined the Secret Service in 1962. He retired in 1985 and became an ordained minister.\nHe is survived by his wife, Carolyn, and three daughters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:48:34.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
