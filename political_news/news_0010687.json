If we vote to leave, then the £350 million we send to Brussels every week can be spent on our priorities like the NHS.\n“I want to see a campaign which brings together those from all parts of the UK, who want to take back control of our countries’ laws to the British Parliament.”\nJohn Mills, the millionaire businessman and Labour’s biggest donor, said a No vote in the In-Out referendum would enable Britain to “make our own trade deals and control our own public services”.\nTory MP Steve Baker, who co-chairs Conservatives for Britain, pointed out it backed the Prime Minister in his attempt to renegotiate the UK’s deal with Brussels but that it also supported a cross-party campaign that could fight the referendum if the EU did not agree to Mr Cameron’s terms on reform.\n“I personally support the Vote Leave campaign,” declared the Buckinghamshire MP. “I will be voting to leave unless, at the very least, the Prime Minister secures the end of the supremacy of EU law.”\nThe Out campaign said its treasurers would be Mr Mills alongside Peter Cruddas, the former Tory Party treasurer, and Stuart Wheeler, ex-Ukip treasurer and one of its major donors.\nAmong its business backers are John Caudwell, co-founder of Phones 4u, Joe Foster, who founded Reebok, Luke Johnson, Chairman of Patisserie Valerie, Lord Kalms, former Chairman of Dixons, and Scots businessman Alastair MacMillan, of White House Products in Renfrewshire.\nShare article The Out campaign’s website – voteleavetakecontrol.org - went live at 10pm on Thursday. Vote Leave said it would make an application to the Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog, for designation as the “official Leave campaign when the time comes”.\nMeantime, the In Campaign will launch on Monday. A source said: \"We are the optimists; we want Britain to be strong, outward-looking, confident and inside the EU.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:51:24.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
