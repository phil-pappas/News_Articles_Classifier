As did defensive end Kenny Anunike (knee), Omar Bolden (foot) and Kayvon Webster (ankle), who was ruled out of the Lions game.\nPeyton Manning walked through drills early, but was listed on the injury report as having taken his non-injury-related day off, per Kubiak's plan for him.\nLouis Vasquez also was given veteran's time off, Kubiak said, although he officially was listed on the injury report as not participating because of a lingering knee injury that limited him last week.\nWard gets defensive honors In his second game back from his suspension, safety T.J. Ward made nine combined tackles against the Lions, second on the team and enough to earn Broncos defensive player of the game.\n\"I'm really proud of T.J.,\" Kubiak said. \"He missed that first week, and when players go through that, I think they get humbled and see how much they really miss what they have. He's come back and played really well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:45:03.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
