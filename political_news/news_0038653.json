Officials wanted documents on what type of financial support the company provides to patients and on its pricing decisions.\nValeant has been in hot water after Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., questioned why it raised the price of two generic heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel by up to 200 percent.\nThe Canadian drug maker also said it responded to a letter from Sen.

However, it did not say that it would lower the price of the drugs.\nThe company said in its letter to McCaskill that the two drugs are used in hospitals and not by consumers. It added that hospitals get rebates for the drugs, which helps mitigate the cost.\nValeant also argues that the prices of the two drugs have been rising steadily, even before they were acquired by the drug maker.\nDrug prices have become a top concern for Americans, according to several polls. Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Sanders have sought to address the issue, with Clinton offering a plan and Sanders introducing legislation in the Senate.\nValeant is the latest generic maker to receive criticism for its prices. Turing Pharmaceuticals recently sparked a public outcry after it raised the price of a decades-old anti-parasite treatment called Daraprim by about 5,000 percent.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Fed official acknowledges confusion over interest rates 'We probably haven't been doing that well' in communicating, New York Fed president says.\nBy Joseph Lawler • 10/15/15 1:07 PM The price hikes represent a growing trend in the generic drug industry, in which companies acquire a drug that has been on the market for a while and has no other generic competition.
