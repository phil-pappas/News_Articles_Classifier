A video posted by the group showed panicked residents fleeing. \nAnother Syria-based activist, who goes by the name Bebars al-Talawy, says at least 15 people were wounded. \nRussia began launching airstrikes Wednesday, targeting mainly central and northwestern Syria, strategic regions that are the gateway to President Bashar Assad's main strongholds. \nMoscow says it is targeting the Islamic State group and helping the Syrian government to fight terrorism, but at least some of its airstrikes have hit Western-backed rebels.
