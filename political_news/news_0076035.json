He recounted several stories about the rundown home during his time as prime minister, from 1993 to 2003.\n“I was there with my wife and we had to put in the bedroom an electric heater. And, bam! The electricity would go in the middle of the night because it was too much,” said Chretien. \nHe also remembered a hot July afternoon when he and then-U.S. Vice-President Al Gore sat in his sweltering, non-air-conditioned living room. \n“(Gore) had his vest, plus his coat, and I had in the window a little machine that you turn with your hand. That was the air conditioning of the prime minister of Canada.”\nChretien admitted he was hesitant to spend anything on home repairs while he was living at 24 Sussex.\n“The difficulty we have in Canada, when you spend that on the house, the press writes that the prime minister spent money.”\nHe recalled a time when he almost called the media to come to the residence and see for themselves a bucket that was collecting water from the leaky roof. The roof was eventually blown off in a storm -- and subsequently replaced -- before he had the chance to call the press though. \nFellow former prime ministers Brian Mulroney and Paul Martin have also expressed concerns about the building’s state. And in 2008, then-Auditor General Shelia Fraser wrote that repairs had become “urgent,” citing “toxic” asbestos. \nPrime Minister Stephen Harper did not want to move out for the year-long period required to finally make the $10 million in fixes to the 34-room, 10,000-square-foot mansion.\nAnother housing alternative for the Trudeau family is Harrington Lake, the official summer residence of the prime minister, located a 30-minute drive outside Ottawa. \nRelated Stories Trudeau may delay moving into 'crumbling' 24 Sussex Photos Former prime minister Jean Chretien speaks to CTV's Question Period on Oct. 25, 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:38:07.149+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
