Clink!\" He added, \"It's a very unfair system.\" The leading Republican candidate has repeatedly called the former Secretary of State's email situation in which she used a private server to send emails \"a criminal problem.\" Clinton has repeatedly said she never knowingly sent or received classified materials on her email account and has done nothing illegal.
