For more information a homeowner in a newer subdivision is urged to contact the Construction Defect Center at 866-714-6466. http://ConstructionDefectCenter.Com\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273556\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151002/273557\nThe Construction Defect Center has identified a potentially huge problem for homeowners in single family home subdivisions built since 2009 when it comes to construction defects. The problem is homeowners in newer subdivisions in states like California , Washington , Arizona, Colorado, Oregon , Nevada , or New Mexico rarely even know each other, let alone discuss common problems they may have with their home's. http://ConstructionDefectCenter.Com\nThe Center says, \"We have seen instance after instance where a newer subdivision might have defective plumbing pipes, defective windows, defective roofs, defective siding, or stucco, and the homeowners in the subdivision never talk about these common issues, and as a result it is the homeowner, not the homebuilder that gets stuck with the repair bill. These repair bills could easily be over ten thousand dollars per home, especially if we are talking about re-piping a home, replacing all of the windows, residing, or re-roofing a home.\n\"Once we have confirmed a serious construction defect issue with a homeowner in a newer subdivision we will do our best to locate the most skilled, and experienced local, or regional construction defect law firm and then use their inspectors to determine how widespread the problem is in that specific subdivision. In all likelihood the inspections will identify other issues as well. Our bottom line is we don't want homeowners in these single family home subdivisions stuck with the repair bill for repairs that should not be their problem.\"\n\"If you are a homeowner in a single family home in a subdivision built after 2009 that has noticed issues with your home's plumbing, exterior siding, or stucco, your roof, hardwood flooring, windows, or electrical system, and you have put off doing anything about it, please call us at 866-714-6466, and we will try to determine if you are not the only one in your subdivision with these issues.\" http://ConstructionDefectCenter.Com\nMetro Area Subdivisions Targeted by the Construction Defect Center's Construction Defect Initiative:\nCalifornia : San Jose , Sacramento , Los Angeles , South Orange County, San Diego , Riverside Washington : Seattle , Tacoma , Federal Way , Everett , Vancouver , Bellingham Colorado : Denver, Colorado Springs , Durango Arizona : Phoenix , Tucson , Prescott Nevada : Las Vegas , Reno Oregon : Portland , Salem New Mexico : Albuquerque , Las Cruses, Santa Fe For more information a homeowner in a newer subdivision built after 2009 with potential serious construction defects is welcome to call the Construction Defect Center at 866-714-6466 to see if they qualify for their initiative. http://ConstructionDefectCenter.Com\nContact:\nM.
