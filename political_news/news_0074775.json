It was opposed by justice secretary Michael Gove, whose predecessor Chris Grayling had pursued the contract. Tory sources said the policy was initiated by his predecessor Ken Clarke.

Other cabinet members including foreign secretary Philip Hammond are understood to have initially supported the contract, arguing that it would help to cement Britain’s relationship with Saudi Arabia. \nA separate contract to train Saudi police officers in the UK is still in place . \nThe decision to withdraw the bid came after Mr Gove in September shut down Just Solutions International, a scheme to sell civil servants’ expertise to foreign governments on a commercial footing. \nLord Falconer, a former Labour lord chancellor, has written to the National Audit Office, calling on it to investigate the sums spent on JSI and alleging “a lack of transparency” over its structures and funding. \nHe asked Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, to ensure “that the interests of the taxpayers have been properly safeguarded in this case and to provide guidance for such activities in future”. \nLiberal Democrat peer Lord Lester this week called on Theresa May, home secretary, to publish the details of her department’s relationship with Saudi Arabia, while human rights campaigners Amnesty International said “many questions remain unanswered”. \nControversy over the justice contract has been brewing for months. \nSolicitor and Financial Times legal columnist David Allen Green — who has been scrutinising the deal since the start of this year — called on the government to publish the memoranda of understanding that set out “the key relationship” between the two countries on criminal justice and human rights matters. \n“The lack of transparency means we do not know what the agreed processes and arrangements are,” he said. “Until [they] are disclosed, it is difficult to accept at face value UK assurances about championing human rights in Saudi Arabia.” \nLord Falconer told the FT: “We haven’t seen any accounts in relation to [JSI], we don’t know how it carried on its business and, perhaps most significantly, we don’t know the extent to which public money was used to fund the bids.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:58:11.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
