EDT - In this photo taken Sept. 9, 2015, Kevin Esvelt poses for a photo at Harvard University's Wyss Institute in Boston. The hottest tool in biology has scientists using words like revolutionary as they describe the long-term potential: wiping out certain mosquitoes that carry malaria, treating genetic diseases like sickle-cell, preventing babies from inheriting a life-threatening disorder. Esvelt's projects include genetically manipulating a mosquito species to fight malaria.
