More ways for felons, gang members, the mentally ill and other favorite gun toters of the right wing to get away with murder. Just attend a gun show,buy your assault weapon and then stick it under your coat as you go shopping. G DDDD idea. So you are saying that felons, gang members, and the mentally ill are currently carrying firearms in holsters on the outside of their clothes. Interesting that the state wants them to start hiding their firearms under their clothes.

You won't ever get how the right promotes the sale of guns to felons, gang members and the mentally ill by NOT closing loopholes in the gun laws which allows them to buy the guns at gun shows. You guys are much more focused in on such fear based propaganda from the NRA like \"They want to take your guns away.\" Such chicken little shit from you big bad men.

Left wing illiterates have never made an anti-gun argument not based on lies. Left wing illiterates have never made an anti-gun argument not based on lies. Seriously. , such allegations. Now, where are the facts to back this up? Every anti-gun post you have copy and pasted. Originally Posted by Jimmyb Every anti-gun post you have copy and pasted.

I think I have your number 0, right? I've made my points and they stand unchallenged. Originally Posted by Jimmyb I've made my points and they stand unchallenged. You have no points and I'm done with you. You don't respect yourself enough to have a substantial and fact filled discussion. Why should I respect you enough to have anything more to do with you? YOU consider yourself a joke. Me, too. Quote: The legislation makes Maine the most recent of several states to enact some form of what Second Amendment rights advocates call Â“constitutional concealed carry. \" Vermont, Alaska, Arizona, Wyoming, and Kansas do not require a permit for concealed carry. In Wyoming, the law applies only to state residents. Although Montana and Arkansas are also sometimes cited as having constitutional concealed carry, the laws in those states are more limited. In Arkansas, permit-less concealed carry within a vehicle is legal while on a \"journey\" outside of one's county. In Montana, concealed carry without a permit is legal outside of official city or town boundaries if the carrier is engaged in outdoor activities in which guns are used for protection or recreation. Other states with some form of limited permit-free concealed carry include Idaho, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. \"Constitutional concealed carry\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:44:10.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
