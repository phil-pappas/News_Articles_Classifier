Considers 16 Weeks Paid Family Leave NBCWashington.com FILE PHOTO The D.C. Council is considering requiring employers to offer as much as 16 weeks of paid family leave, but even some supporters of family leave, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, are trying to figure out how the proposal would cost businesses and the government. At a lunch forum honoring women in the Washington area, Bowser told News4 she supports paid family leave programs, but she stopped short of embracing the new council proposal.

I think certainly everybody wants to support families, but we have some questions for the district government itself and our 33,000 employees.” The 16 paid weeks -- the most in the nation among states and cities -- would help families care for newborns, aging relatives and family emergencies, activists say.

She acknowledged the costs of the program must be clarified for employers. “No question it's going to help our workers in this city,” Kaplan said. “As a non-profit I have to figure out what that means in terms of the money part of this.” Bower said she will work with council members to crunch the numbers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:52:28.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
