Telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad refused to be drawn into the debate and left it to the Haryana CM to explain matters. He said, \"We (BJP) do not want to say anything beyond what the CM himself said\" and added that, \"We (the party) honour the plurality of this country.\"\nUrban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu added, \"The views expressed by Khattar are not that of the party. I will talk to him and will advise him. It is wrong to say like that.\" Naidu further said it is not correct to link anyone's eating habits to religion. \"This is not the BJP's position...It is not correct to link eating habits to religion. People have to keep in mind the sentiments of others and eating is a personal choice of people.\"\nOn his part, the Haryana CM said his remarks had been plucked out of context. Khattar said he had expressed his view that in a society like India, everybody needs to sensitive to other's feelings. While people have rights, these need to be exercised keeping in mind the feelings of others, he said.\nThe Congress hit out at Khattar with AICC spokesperson Rita Bahaguna Joshi questioning his motive. \"While the ashes of Dadri lynching in UP have not cooled, the chief minister of a neighbouring state makes a provocative statement. Is it a conspiracy?\" Joshi said.\nShe pointed out Khattar had merely regretted and not apologized for his statement. \"The PM too did not condemn but only regretted the Dadri lynching,\" the spokesperson said.\nDubbing the CM's statement as against the spirit of the constitution, Congress said he was needlessly provocative talking about cow slaughter as it was banned in the country since 1955. \"Now, how do you ban what is banned? Why is he threatening?\" Joshi said, asking which Muslim had ever spoken about eating cow.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:24:31.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
