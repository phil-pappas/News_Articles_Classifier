(Andrew Harnik/Associated Press) October 12 at 5:00 PM Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson made one good recommendation: The idea of unarmed civilians swarming and overpowering a shooter worked, for example, during the 1993 Long Island Rail Road massacre [“ Carson cites Holocaust in defense of gun rights ,” news, Oct. 9]. But it works only when the shooter has to stop to reload. If he has a large magazine, opportunities to overwhelm him will be few and far between, causing more deaths.\nMr. Carson’s position inexorably leads to a tight legal maximum on magazine size. But don’t expect him to advocate that. As soon as he realizes he’s violating tea party political correctness, expect him to turn tail and reverse field.\nBob Sherman , Gaithersburg\n●\nBen Carson’s statement that “the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed” was foolish and uninformed.\nAdolf Hitler did not come to power through the use of guns. When the German legislature was split between the National Socialist Party and the Communists, President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor. Hitler quickly took control of the country through the Sturmabteilung ( SA ) and began his vicious anti-Semitic campaign. Members of the SA may have carried guns; however, they didn’t need to use them.\nDer Stürmer, an outrageously anti-Semitic weekly, was posted by the Nazis at almost every streetcorner, especially in Berlin. Jewish lawyers were ordered fired by their private employers. Jewish youngsters were ordered expelled from public schools. Books and pamphlets with allegedly communist or anti­Nazi texts had to be burned by their owners or the SA. Individuals deemed a threat to the Nazis were confined in concentration camps.\nIf armed Jews had sought to halt any of this, they would have been arrested, prosecuted and executed.\nI know, for I was there.\nFritz R. Kahn , Washington\n●\nBen Carson should stick to surgery rather than drawing flawed historical lessons. One of the scourges of the Weimar Republic was the excessive presence of guns. Armed militias challenged the regime, and many leading citizens were assassinated. If the overflow of guns had not weakened Weimar and eliminated many democratic leaders, Hitler might never have come to power.\nFewer guns and more gun control during Weimar might have prevented Hitler’s rise altogether, and thus the Holocaust. A little more factual grounding could do wonders for Mr. Carson’s policy prescriptions.\nPeter Schoettle , North Bethesda", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/08/nyregion/gunman-kills-5-on-lirr-train-19-are-wounded.html", "http://www.britannica.com/topic/SA-Nazi-organization"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:29:14.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
