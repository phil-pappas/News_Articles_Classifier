Terrorism analysts say they are already seeing signs of fresh militant anger toward Moscow, which could raise the domestic political cost to Putin for his foreign intervention and further complicate the decisions facing U.S. policymakers.\nSuch attacks would serve as revenge for Putin’s defense of Syrian ruler Bashar Assad against a rebellion fueled by militants tied to al Qaeda and the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\n“There are very public calls on social media by terrorist groups to attack Russian targets,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. “It could very well result in a renewed focus on attacks in the Russian homeland.”\nA senior U.S. intelligence echoed that assessment, saying that “extremists are feeding off Moscow’s actions.”\nThe intelligence official added that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is likely to use social media to encourage lone-wolf attacks inside Russia similar to those recently seen in Europe and the U.S. In May, ISIS issued its first Russian-language online propaganda magazine, and a pro-ISIS website and social media channel, Furat Media, has been translating ISIS messages from Arabic into Russian since June.\nIn July, militants based in southern Russia pledged allegiance to ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and declared the region an ISIS governate.\nRussia’s Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, estimated in July that around 2,000 Russian citizens with Islamist leanings are fighting alongside ISIS in Syria. Moscow fears those fighters may pose a threat if and when they return home.\nMayor in Crimea extends warm invite to Donald Trump By Nick Gass\nSome analysts caution that Putin could use an increased militant threat, or actual attacks inside Russia, to further tighten his grip on power and restrict civil liberties.\nBut many Russia experts agree with Obama’s mid-September assessment that Russia is “threatened in many ways more than we are” by ISIS. “They’ve got large Muslim populations that historically have caused a lot of problems inside of Russia,” Obama added.\nRussia’s Muslim population is typically estimated at between 12 and 14 percent in a country of nearly 150 million people, and is growing faster than the country’s non-Muslim populace.\n“That’s why everyone is scratching their heads so much. How does he think he’s going to handle this?” asks Fiona Hill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of a Putin biography, Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin.\nPutin may feel that he has faced down Islamic terrorists before, only to emerge stronger.\nIn 1999, a series of apartment complex bombings killed nearly 300 people in Moscow and other cities. Then an acting prime minister hoping to succeed Boris Yeltsin as president, Putin blamed Islamic militants seeking vengeance for Russia's brutal military campaign to suppress the Chechen republic's bid for independence from Moscow. Vowing to hunt down and kill terrorists “in the outhouse” if necessary, Putin led a bloody crackdown in the region.\nHis poll numbers surged and the episode cemented Putin's place as Russia's next president, Hill says.\nPutin largely managed to crush the Chechen independence movement. But he wasn't able to prevent horrific terrorist attacks, as militants — including Chechnya's notorious female \"Black Widow\" suicide bombers — struck airports, subways, hotels, and even more chilling targets.\nIn 2002 Chechens captured a Moscow theater during a performance; a subsequent gassing and storming by security officers left 129 hostages died. Two years later, Chechens seized an elementary school in Beslan, where a military assault left 385 dead, including dozens of children.\nObama avoids a showdown in Syria By Michael Crowley\nPutin responded ruthlessly, vowing the “total annihilation” of terrorists in his country, and was hailed as a strong and decisive leader at home. After two female suicide bombers struck the Moscow subway in March 2010, one former U.S. ambassador to Russia wrote that Putin's circle \"remains seemingly impervious\" to political damage from terrorism.\nAttacks in major Russian cities have recently subsided. But has failed to extinguish a festering insurgency throughout the North Caucasus mountains on Russia's southern border, whose roots date to the 19th century.\nOne hotbed is Russia’s Dagestan province, a home to radical Islamic clerics and a travel destination of Tamerlan Tsarnaev shortly before the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.\nDagestani radicals were blamed for twin suicide bombs in the Russian city of Volgograd which killed 34 people in December 2013. The attack cast a shadow over the Sochi Olympics that winter, around which Putin boasted he had built a “ring of steel” to defend against terrorism.\nIn July, Sunni radicals in the region pledged their allegiance to ISIS and announced what they call the Wilayat Qawqaz, or Caucasus governate. Two weeks later, Russian security services stormed one suspected terrorist hideout and killed eight alleged militants in a firefight.\n“Over the last 15 years, Russia has experienced a lot of jihadist violence, most of it from Chechens, Dagestanis and others from the Caucasus,” said Daniel Benjamin, who served as a top Obama State Department counter-terrorism official and is now at Dartmouth College. “It's a good bet they'll be seeing more as a result of their deployment to Syria.”\nEven as he calls for a global fight against Islamic radicals, however, Putin has taken steps to placate his country’s Muslim population.\nJust days before beginning air strikes in Syria, Putin attended the opening of a giant new mosque in Moscow, which he called larger than any in Europe. Flanked by Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas, Putin called for a crackdown against the Islamic State, which he said is “compromising a great world religion.”\nISIS is “trying to recruit followers here in Russia, too,” Putin said, adding that “Russia’s Muslim leaders are bravely and fearlessly using their own influence to resist this extremist propaganda.”\nThat may be more difficult now that Russia is bombing ISIS fighters and other Sunni militants on the Syrian battlefield. Dozens of Saudi Arabian clerics recently signed an online call for Muslims to join a holy war against Assad and his allies, Russia and Iran. The statement, which likened the Syrian conflict to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s, did not explicitly call for terrorist attacks within Russia.\nBut terrorism experts say that risk is now much higher.\n“Russia’s airstrikes, increase in assistance to the Assad regime, and alliance with Iran in Syria have elevated Moscow’s profile among jihadists,” said Seth Jones, an expert on radical groups at the Rand Corporation. “Anti-Russian social media activity from jihadist groups has dramatically increased.”\nTo be sure, Sunni militants were hostile to Russia well before Putin’s bombing campaign began, thanks to Moscow’s years of indirect military and financial support for Assad.\nIn one 2014 video, ISIS fighters gloated over their capture of Russian-made jets at a Syrian air base they had overrun.\n“This message is for you, Vladimir Putin!” said one fighter in the video. “These are the aircraft you sent to Bashar [Assad], and we’re going to send them to you. Remember that!”\nObama: Putin hasn't won anything By Michael Crowley\nSome experts caution that such talk may be bluster, and say that Obama administration warnings of terrorist attacks in Russia may be overstated.\nBenjamin noted that ISIS has been content to fight for territory in Syria and Iraq and target its hated Shiite rivals in the region.\nAnd Matthew Rojansky, a scholar at the Wilson Center in Washington, said that a surge in Russian nationalism would make it harder for ISIS to recruit converts among Slavic Christian Orthodox Russians, who have been responsible for past attacks and whose ethnicity draws less suspicion from security services.\nRojansky added that Russian Islamists currently appear more likely to join the fight in Syria than to find cracks in Moscow's iron-fisted security services. But, he added, many of those fighters will eventually return home.\n“In the short run, my guess is they’re not not any more vulnerable today than they were two to three years ago,” Rojansky said. But, he added, “in the long run, they definitely have reason to be worried about what comes from Syria. ”\n<div", "external_links": ["http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/will-the-moscow-attacks-help-putin/"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:21:52.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
