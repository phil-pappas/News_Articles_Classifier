He has never really been part of the Democratic establishment and could care less about it.” Podesta told multiple media outlets last week that it was time Biden made a decision about whether he’s running for the presidency. \nFormer top adviser to President Obama, David Axelrod, seemed to agree with Podesta. After pointing out the filing deadlines that come up in November, he said he thought “particularly within the Democratic community there’s a growing impatience with this period of reflection,” he said in an interview with John Dickerson on “Face the Nation” Sunday.” Text smaller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:19:48.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
