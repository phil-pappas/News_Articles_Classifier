But that didn't keep away the fans, many who dressed as zombies, or \"walkers,\" as they're called on the series.\n\"The Walking Dead\" is about people trying to survive in a zombie apocalypse.\nIt premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n___\nOnline:\nhttp://www.amc.com/shows/the-walking-dead\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
