Gun control advocates took to the airwaves Sunday to push stricter firearms laws in the aftermath of another horrific mass shooting on U.S. soil.\nMark Kelly, the husband of ex-congresswoman and gun violence survivor Gabby Giffords, led the charge, as emotions remained high following the massacre at Umpqua Community College, in Oregon, that left 10 dead including the shooter.\n\"We have laws that make it easy for domestic abusers and stalkers to get their hands on guns,\" Kelly, who founded Americans for Responsible Solutions — a group favoring stricter gun control laws — said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\"There's one basic and pretty simple solution. Members of Congress and elected leaders in state legislatures around the country can certainly do something about it,\" he said. \"We really need to call up Washington, D.C. and ask members of the House and Senate to take action on this issue,\" he added. \"(We) need to close these loopholes that make it very easy for the mentally ill to get firearms.\"\nMark Zaleski/AP Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has spoken out against tougher gun laws in the days since the Oregon shooting. \"The idea is where there are more guns, people are less safe. If you have a gun in any kind of situation where things start to get heated, there's a higher likelihood that somebody's going to get shot,\" Kelly said, an idea that was directly refuted just moments later by 2016 Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\"You could make the case that, the school that we just saw, you know, went through, and I see it was a gun-free zone. And you were not allowed to have guns at all in that particular area. And you could make the case that it would have been a lot better had people had guns because they had something to fire back,\" Trump said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\"I can make the case that if there were guns in that room other than his, fewer people would have died, fewer people would have been so horribly injured,\" he added for good measure, before framing the issue as a problem with mental health, not gun laws.\nMike Sullivan/AP Police search students outside Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., Thursday, following a deadly shooting at the college. \"But, you know, no matter what you do, guns, no guns, it doesn't matter. You have people that are mentally ill. And they're going to come through the cracks. And they're going to do things that people will not even believe are possible,\" he said.\n\"I don't think it's about laws,\" he continued. \"The strongest, the most stringent laws are in almost every case the worse places. It doesn't seem to work. It's a tough situation.\"\nHis comments came just three days after a Chris Harper Mercer shot dead nine people, and himself, in Roseburg, Ore.\nBRIAN SNYDER/REUTERS U.S. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s reaction to the horrific shooting in Oregon? \"Stuff happens.\" An irate President Obama, following the shooting, unleashed his harshest attack yet on pro-gun advocates.\n\"Somehow this has become routine,\" Obama said Thursday. \"The reporting is routine. My response here at this podium ends up being routine. We've become numb to this. It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get a gun.\"\nRepublican 2016 candidate Jeb Bush weighed in too, with a remarkably nonchalant approach that has infuriated many across both parties.\n\"Look stuff happens,\" the struggling candidate said Friday, arguing against more gun control. \"There's always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something and it's not always the right thing to do.\"\nRelated Stories Treven Anspach’s final moments used to save classmate's life Oregon shooter's suicide after rampage was planned: survivor Rudy Giuliani holds stance on gun control EXCLUSIVE: Mom of Ore. shooter stockpiled guns Jeb Bush on Oregon college shooting: ‘Stuff happens'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T21:54:53.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
