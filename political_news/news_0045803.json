Kesari, an ex-deputy campaign manager, faces five charges including conspiracy and obstruction. Both have pleaded not guilty. \nProsecutors say the men concealed payments to former Iowa Sen. Kent Sorenson after he jumped from the Michele Bachmann campaign to the Paul campaign. Defense attorneys have questioned the authenticity of presented evidence and the credibility of Sorenson, who testified in court. \nAttorneys for both sides finished closing arguments Tuesday.
