(AP Photo/Majdi Mohammed)\n 4:55 a.m. EDT + More JERUSALEM (AP) â€” A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli in the West Bank before being shot and killed Monday, the Israeli military said.\nThe Israeli was stabbed in the neck and \"severely wounded\" at an intersection near the city of Hebron, and the Palestinian was shot and killed at the site, the military said.\nPolice spokeswoman Luba Samri said initial reports indicated the Israeli was a soldier, but the military declined to provide details about the person's identity. Israeli media identified the wounded Israeli as a 19-year-old.\nIt was the latest incident in weeks of almost daily Palestinian attacks against Israeli civilians and security forces. In the past five weeks, 10 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, mostly stabbings, while 51 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, including 30 said by Israel to be attackers and the rest in clashes.\nThe latest violence is linked to tensions over a sensitive Jerusalem holy site revered by Jews and Muslims. Palestinians have accused Israel of trying to expand the Jewish presence at the site in violation of decades-old arrangements. Israel adamantly denies such allegations, saying they amount to incitement to violence.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZejvzv%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZejvzv%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZejvzv%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZejvzv%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Israeli%20army%3A%20Palestinian%20stabs%20Israeli%2C%20is%20shot%20dead&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZejvzv%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Israeli%20army%3A%20Palestinian%20stabs%20Israeli%2C%20is%20shot%20dead", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZejvzv%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Israeli%20army%3A%20Palestinian%20stabs%20Israeli%2C%20is%20shot%20dead"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:24:05.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
