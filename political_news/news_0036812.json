But the British Ministry of Defense said two Royal Air Force members were among those killed when the Puma Mk 2 helicopter crashed while landing at the headquarters of the NATO Resolute Support Mission, which is training Afghan security forces.\nThe mission statement said the helicopter “crashed due to a non-hostile incident” around 4:15 p.m. Sunday at Camp Resolute Support, Kabul.\nThe alliance said the incident is under investigation, but did not provide further details.\nEarlier, U.S. Army Col. Brian Tribus, a military spokesman, said an “incident” involving a NATO aircraft and an observational balloon had taken place “in the vicinity of the Resolute Support base.”\nThe balloon was severed from its mooring in the incident, he said, without providing further details.\nThe helicopter appeared to strike the monitoring balloon as it landed at the NATO base, according to Najibullah, an Afghan security guard who witnessed the incident. Like many in Afghanistan, he goes by one name.\nThe helicopter “hit the cable of the security balloon over the base, It seemed like the cable was turned around the helicopter rotor,” he said. Najibullah said the helicopter went down and then black smoke rose from the area.\nA second helicopter circled around the area three or four times and then landed at a nearby airport, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:12:11.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
