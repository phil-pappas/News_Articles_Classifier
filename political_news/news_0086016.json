Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota sponsored the bill and was the only Democrat to support it. \nHeitkamp said the bill would lower or stabilize gas prices, support jobs and increase U.S. influence abroad. Despite the largely partisan committee vote, Heitkamp said she is optimistic that Senate Democrats will support efforts to lift the export ban. The ban was imposed in the 1970s amid an energy shortage. \nThe House Energy and Commerce endorsed a similar bill last month. \nThe White House said it opposes both bills.
