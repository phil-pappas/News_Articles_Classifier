Next stop: the Benghazi Committee\nBy James Warren Oct. 21, 2015 | 2:00 p.m. EDT + More Yes, boy and girls, it's Gowdy Doody Time.\nRep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, on Thursday gavels to likely disorder the long awaited House select committee hearing on Benghazi, the latest in the rich tradition of congressional spectacles that often go nowhere.\nIndeed, America had far more positive anticipation when \"Buffalo Bob\" Smith led a cheering throng of kids in the theme song of \"Howdy Doody,\" a 1950s mega-TV hit named after a puppet with 48 freckles (yes, civics mavens, this was before Alaska and Hawaii were admitted to the Union).\nLet's give a rousing cheer,\nCause Howdy Doody's here,\nIt's time to start the show,\nSo kids let's go!\nThis week's Gowdy Doody Show is rather more solemn and draws its unwitting inspiration from Edward Bennett Williams, a long-ago powerhouse Washington attorney: The town, he said, regularly needs to burn a witch.\nPlease, everybody, welcome Hillary Clinton to this week's festivities!\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Benghazi ]\nThe investigation started as a dissection of the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks by Islamic militants on two U.S. compounds in Benghazi, Libya. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans died.\nWe've paid for nine different congressional and internal probes and Gowdy's has morphed into a look at Clinton's emails and her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Its work alone has cost about $4.6 million – if only such GOP ardor was exhibited in pursuing President George W. Bush's weapons of mass destruction claims against Saddam Hussein – even though it hasn't even interviewed most of the defense, intelligence and White House officials it promised.\nInstead, it is primed to take testimony from a small army that includes Clinton, speechwriters and the guy who oversaw the server.\nGowdy and his Hillary-suspicious Republicans are so sensitive to the claim of political pandering that they have strategized privately about their own decorum and presenting themselves as sober legislators. It's like my six-year-old prior to his first grade class going to a suburban Chicago pumpkin patch Monday: Everybody promised to be on their best behavior on the bus.\nThe actual history here is pretty clear. Republicans were the first to politicize the tragedy, while the Obama administration was evasive in not portraying it as a terrorist attack.\nBenghazi was testament, too, to gross management failures by the State Department. But Clinton hasn't accepted much responsibility and her private server only raised questions. Meanwhile, the House panel has gotten nowhere fast and confronts the shrewdest of witnesses, Clinton, who was obviously on her game during last week's Democratic debate.\nIt all amounts to a waste of taxpayer dollars to generate fleeting headlines that few will read. Living in Chicago can be therapeutic: Beyond the Fox News-Rush Limbaugh echo chamber, Benghazi is not of interest.\nBut you can still find some anthropological utility in assessing a Capitol Hill staple, the melodramatic legislative hearing.\n[ READ: The GOP Will See a Big Benghazi Backfire ]\n\"The key to making a good Congressional hearing is to keep the spotlight on the witnesses and not on the members,\" says John Feehery, a former top aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert and then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. \"When they get all emotional or mad, which they often do, they look like jerks. So the key is to keep it low-key. Just the facts, ma'am.\"\nFollowing the money has been a staple for productive hearings, notably those investigating the Watergate break-in during the Nixon years and Iran-Contra during Ronald Reagan's presidency.\n\"The problem with Benghazi is when you follow the money you really don't get a lot,\" says David Rogers, one of the finest congressional reporters, who plied his trade for The Wall Street Journal before moving to Politico. \"We are in a war with terrorists, shit happens in all wars, and shit happened here.\"\nDue to his own Vietnam War combat experience, he finds it all rather obscene. Stevens was brave, took risks and got killed. Two others walked to a bunker and were killed. Bad stuff just happens.\n\"The GOP got a search warrant to find who was responsible for Benghazi failures and while in the suspect's house found something else,\" says Rogers. \"But there's no evidence that her breaking protocols by having her own server got people killed.\"\nSo forget Watergate and Iran-Contra. Maybe this is all a bit closer to Whitewater, where an investigation into Arkansas land deals morphed into one about presidential sex and proving Bill Clinton lied (not a crime).\n\"I don't think I'm being partisan to say that [the House investigation into] Benghazi strikes me as a hit job, part of a coordinated attack on both Obama and Hillary,\" says Jim Jaffe, a former longtime top aide to Dan Rostenkowski, the late onetime Democratic congressional kingpin. \"The incident was another unhappy and unfortunate one-off event. There's no reason to believe it will come up with anything to prevent a repeat, and no reason to believe that's their goal.\"\nBut, as with Buffalo Bob and Howdy Doody, it is time to start the show.\nTAGS: Clinton, Hillary Watergate politics Congress Gowdy, Trey", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeeu3l%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeeu3l%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeeu3l%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Hillary%20Clinton%27s%20Benghazi%20Appearance%20Recalls%20Whitewater%2C%20Not%20Watergate", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeeu3l%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Hillary%20Clinton%27s%20Benghazi%20Appearance%20Recalls%20Whitewater%2C%20Not%20Watergate&summary=Hillary%20Clinton%27s%20appearance%20before%20the%20Benghazi%20Committee%20recalls%20less%20Watergate%20than%20Whitewater.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeeu3l%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeeu3l%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Hillary%20Clinton%27s%20Benghazi%20Appearance%20Recalls%20Whitewater%2C%20Not%20Watergate"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:24:34.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
