I think it is wrong and I will never do that. It is an insult on people’s intelligence if you are going to be paying money telling them to vote for you. Allow the people to make an informed decision on what they want and who they want. It’s wrong to pay people to do that.” \nThe daughter of former President Jerry John Rawlings is seeking to unseat the incumbent Member of Parliament (MP), Nii Armah Ashittey, when the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) goes to the polls on November 7, 2015. \nTwo other candidates are also seeking to unseat the incumbent MP. \nZenator commenting further bemoaned the lack of development in the Korle Klottey constituency, citing youth unemployment and sanitation issues as the two key areas that needed immediate attention. \n“A lot of people in the constitutency are not happy with the current state of affairs and that is why we are here. If everything were rosy, we wouldn’t have many people vying for this particular seat.” \nThe NDC goes to the polls on November 7 to decide on candidates for the 2016 Presidential and Parliamentary elections. \nAbout 6000 branches of the party will be opened for the election during the primaries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:24:43.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
