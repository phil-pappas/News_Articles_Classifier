This year's more ambitious goal is made possible largely due to rapid global adoption of Chemours' flagship Opteon™ low GWP refrigerants.\nIn 2015, Chemours commercially released three new low GWP refrigerants under its Opteon™ XP product line. In addition, the company introduced its new low GWP foam expansion agent, Formacel™ 1100, which saw its first residential installation in 2015 at a high-end, energy efficient home in Austin, Texas . Chemours also has seen continued growth of Opteon™ YF (HFO-1234yf) refrigerant for automotive applications, and now expects more than 18 million cars will be on the road using HFO-1234yf by the end of 2016.\n\"For more than 85 years the fluorochemicals business within Chemours has provided innovative refrigeration and foam expansion solutions to help meet our customers' changing needs,\" said Thierry Vanlancker , President of Chemours Fluoroproducts. \"Our Opteon™ low GWP fluorochemicals are the latest innovation and represent a long-term solution for both our customers and the environment.\"\n\"We see Opteon™ as a significant opportunity to align Chemours with the U.S. government in its attempt to drastically reduce the impact that greenhouse gases have on the environment,\" added Vanlancker. \"With our increased estimated reduction of 300 million CO2 ton equivalents by 2025, the global adoption of Opteon™ represents a clear path toward moving the world away from high global warming potential HFCs.\"\nThe Opteon™ family of fluorochemicals from Chemours is based on hydrofluoroolefin technology. These products represent a breakthrough in low global warming potential (GWP) solutions developed to help meet increasingly stringent global regulations while in many cases delivering improved performance compared to incumbent products. Chemours and its suppliers have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to bring these new products to market and will continue to invest as the need for low GWP solutions grows throughout the world.\nTo address the growing need for Opteon™ products, Chemours recently announced it has doubled its capacity of HFO-1234yf in China . As the world's HFO-1234yf capacity leader, Chemours is uniquely positioned to support its customer's needs of low-GWP products for commercial refrigeration, as well as other applications including mobile and stationary air conditioning, foam expansion agents, specialty fluids and propellants.\nAs the industry's leading supplier of more environmentally sustainable refrigerants, foams and aerosol propellants, Chemours is investing in the development of new products to help meet the growing demand for low GWP products throughout the world. The company and its suppliers have plans to invest hundreds of millions more in the next five years to bring online additional capacity of these more sustainable, high-performance products that serve a wide range of applications.\nFor more information, visit us at opteon.com .\nAbout The Chemours Company\nThe Chemours Company helps create a colorful, capable and cleaner world through the power of chemistry.
