Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden, even though Biden hasnâ€™t officially jumped in the race. \nClinton leads at 46 percent, Sanders has 27 percent and Biden has 16 percent. \nIn the race for the GOP nomination, the CBS News poll reveals Donald Trump maintains the lead with 27 percent while Dr. Ben Carson closely trails behind with 21 percent. \nIn the single digits, Sen. Ted Cruz has 9 percent, Sen. Marco Rubio follows with 8 percent, and former Gov. Jeb Bush and businesswoman Carly Fiorina both hold 6 percent. Gov. Mike Huckabee has slipped considerably from 8 percent in August to 2 percent in October. \nSpeaker of the House John Boehner announced he will be leaving Congress at the end of the month, and new numbers show poor marks even from his own party. \nThe CBS News poll shows 23 percent of both Republicans and Democrats approve of the job he is doing, while 52 percent disapprove. Twenty-four percent don't have an opinion, according to the poll. \nPresident Barack Obama's approval rating has been largely unchanged since January, and his overall job approval rating remains mixed: 45 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing as president and 46 percent disapprove.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:48:19.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
