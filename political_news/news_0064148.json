Three responded by filing the missing forms and paying fines, while one former Rutherford mayoral candidate has yet to pay his levied fine, according to the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission (ELEC).\nComplaints were brought against East Rutherford council candidate Edward Ravettine, a Democrat, and Rutherford council candidates Jack Manzo and Mark O'Connor, who ran on a ticket together as Republicans, for not filing required campaign reports for the 2013 primary. All three were incumbents who won their re-election bids in November 2013. In addition, ELEC made a decision in February 2015 concerning Rutherford Independent mayoral candidate John Grande for his 2011 general election campaign, fining him a combined $6,877 for failing to file required forms.\nThe ELEC office released its most recent listings of enforcement actions on Oct. 7. Those findings include the 2013 election; records for the 2014 election and 2015 primary are not yet available.\nIn its complaints, ELEC claimed Manzo, O'Connor and Ravettine had not filed their Report of Contributions and Expenditures (Form R-1), or in lieu of that form, a Candidate Sworn Statement or a Joint Candidates Committee Sworn Statement (either Form A-1 or Form A-2), for their 29-day pre-election, 11-day pre-election and 20-day post-election reports. The commission levied the complaints in May.\nBy law, candidates are required to file a Report of Contributions and Expenditures (Form R-1) by outlined deadlines before and after the election. The reports would identify contributions received and expenditures made in the election and such details as who the candidate's donors were, contribution amounts, contributors' employers if aggregated donations exceeded $300, and expenditures. Details such as the campaign fund's remaining balance are included in the post-election report. Those found in violation are required to file a written answer and have the opportunity for a hearing, the complaints read.\nAt its Feb. 17 meeting, ELEC made a final decision on the complaint brought against Grande for his 2011 Rutherford mayoral campaign. \nAccording to the decision, as of that meeting, Grande had not filed his 29-day Form R-1, or Form A-1 in lieu of the first, or a joint candidate Form A-2 document for the 2011 election. \nThe commission found Grande to be in default for failing to submit a written response. It issued a $6,800 fine, noting that ELEC imposed the maximum statutory penalty because Grande persisted on not filing the required report. It also imposed $77 in sheriff service fees.\n\"In the absence of reports, the public is deprived of campaign finance information concerning respondent's [Grande's] financial activity in the election in contravention of the public policy of the [Campaign Reporting] Act,\" the decision read. It also ordered the candidate to file Form A-1, Form A-2 or Form R-1 for that election.\nTwo counts for failing to file certain reports were dismissed based on the absence of evidence that Grande had spent more than $4,000 in the election, the document read. \nThe candidate had the right to appeal the decision by filing a notice within 45 days of the decision.\nGrande waved his right to an appeal, and ELEC is waiting for the former candidate to pay the fines, said Joseph Donohueâ€š ELEC Deputy Director.\nGrande did not respond to an invitation by the South Bergenite to comment on the matter. \nELEC made its decisions concerning the Rutherford candidates at its Sept. 15 meeting.\nFollowing the complaint being issued, O'Connor submitted the missing Form A-2, which the commission noted was 812 days late, and a sworn statement by his attorney indicating that the candidate had not spent any funds on his 2013 primary candidacy, ELEC's final decision read. The commission imposed a $275 fee for the late filing, which he paid.\n\"We didn't raise any money in our primary, and we didn't spend any money in our primary,\" which was uncontested, O'Connor said. \"The only thing that we received from ELEC was that we were being fined, the complaint said. We did not receive anything from them that we hadn't filed this one-page document.\"\nIt was a mistake and not an omission intentionally done, O'Connor said. He added that he would have appreciated a notice from ELEC prior to the official complaint, either to their campaign mailbox which he continued to check or to their homes, where the complaint was mailed. \nFiling a joint statement with O'Connor, the commission noted that Manzo's outstanding Form A-2 had been submitted 812 days late. Manzo also gave a statement from his attorney indicating that he had spent no funds in the 2013 primary and made a $275 payment for fees imposed by ELEC, the final decision read.\n\"We failed to send in the form saying there was no account, no money raised and no treasurer. We didn't realize that we had to send in a form saying there was no money, being new to this [in 2013]. Now we know,\" Manzo said. \nThe required forms for O'Connor and Manzo's 2013 general election campaign were filed on time, ELEC records indicate.\nManzo said it's disappointing that a paperwork mixup can result in fines, something that may dissuade others from running for their local public offices, which is already a big commitment of time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:26:08.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
