Three were supporting Dr. Zanetor Rawlings and one threw her weight behind the incumbent Member of Parliament, Nii Armah Ashietey. \nSome were seen on the platform of the aspirants campaigning for them, constituency chairman Alhaji Mohammed noted \n“They have been excluded from the vetting process for taking side,” he confirmed to Joy News, one cannot be “a player and referee” in the same game. \nAbout 109 aspirants are expected to be vetted by the panel comprising regional and national executives of the party today. \nMeanwhile, General Secretary of the NDC, Johnson Asiedu Nketiah, said the vetting committee would consider a candidate’s suitability when measured against the national constitution and party‘s own constitution. \nHe said the party will “put smaller weight” on its own procedures to avoid situations where people try to disadvantage “ordinary party members”.
