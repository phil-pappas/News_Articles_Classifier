Steve Israel (D-NY) , a fan of the New York Mets. \nThe Mets beat the Dodgers 3-2 in their NCLS playoff series. \nThe Mets went on to sweep the Cubs and secure a spot in the World Series. The Dodgers can try again next year. \nYesterday, Schiff took part in the Benghazi Committee's 11-hour hearing of Hillary Clinton. \nToday, he's singing the New York Mets' fight song. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:56:59.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
