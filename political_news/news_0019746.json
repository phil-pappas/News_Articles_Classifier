They recognise the importance of safeguarding the Niuean language and culture for future generations,\" Mr Lotu-Iiga says. \nAt the last Census there were just under 24,000 people in New Zealand who identified as Niuean. The majority of them were born here. The number of Niuean speakers has declined since the previous Census. \n\"Niue Language Week is about finding opportunities to increase the use of the Niuean language at home, work and in the community,\" Mr Lotu-liga says. \n\"I encourage everyone to attend a Niue Language Week event and learn more about Niue language, music, culture and heritage.\" \nThe 2015 line-up of seven Pacific language weeks started with Samoa Language Week in May and ends with Tokelau Language Week later this month. \nA list of events marking Niue Language Week can be found at www.mpia.govt.nz \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:16:57.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
