Ted Strickland in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate. The winner in the March primary will take on incumbent Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican, in November 2016.\nBut the line beneath the subject line is what matters: Sittenfeld's campaign, which sent the announcement, actually raised only $229,000.\nThe rest -- $370,000 -- came from a super PAC that by law must operate independently of the candidate. That super PAC, New Leadership for Ohio, already announced its recent totals, in fact.\nSittenfeld's fundraising has gone south since he announced he was running -- and since the Ohio Democratic Party, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and most establishment Democrats said they were backing Strickland.\nThe real numbers: Sittenfeld reported raising $757,044 between January and March, according to Federal Election Commission data. He reported raising another $272,136 from April through June.\nAnd in his FEC report covering July through September, to be filed with the FEC next week, he'll list $229,000, according to information beneath his headline and subject line today.\nIn fairness, it's not unusual for a campaign to start with a bang and see its fundraising lag in subsequent quarters. Portman's fundraising total rose in this year's second quarter but fell in the quarter that just ended.\nBut Portman's third quarter receipts were nearly 10 times those of Sittenfeld. And in his announcement of those receipts, Portman did not count any sums from a super PAC, Fighting for Ohio, that allies may have raised to support his re-election. That's because the super PAC is a separate legal entity and the candidate is not supposed to control what it does.\nStrickland, the man Sittenfeld must beat to get the Democratic nomination, is not expected to release his quarterly figures until next week. Donations to his campaign are expected to lag Portman's but exceed Sittenfeld's.\nWith his third quarter's $229,000, Sittenfeld ended the period with $784,000 cash on hand, said spokesman Dale Butland.\n\"Summer is always a hard time to raise money, and it's not unusual for campaigns to see their fundraising totals drop a bit from what they were in previous quarters. The fact that two 'pro-PG' entities could swim against the tide and bring in nearly $600,000 during this period is truly heartening,\" Butland's release said.\nButland said in a telephone interview that the campaign was totally transparent. While it boasted that Sittenfeld supporters donated $600,000, it made clear throughout the release that the independent super PAC -- a group not directly connected to the campaign -- took in the biggest share.\n\"We weren't trying to fool anybody,\" he said.\nBesides, he said, the super PAC and the campaign share an interest: to elect Sittenfeld to the Senate.\n\"In the end, I think that what most people look at is 'who's going to have the most money to get the message out,'\" Butland said. Both the campaign and the super PAC have said, independently, that they intend to do so.\nSaid Neil Kammerman, a founder of the super PAC, in a separate interview, \"We are totally behind PG.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:48:12.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
