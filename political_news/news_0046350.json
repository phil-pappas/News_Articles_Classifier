The Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity suggests the state partner — as other states, including Pennsylvania have done — with a private company willing to finance, design and manage the replacement of worn-out bridges for a set contract amount. Among the potential benefits the center listed in a report scheduled for release on Friday: \"Removing the risk [to] taxpayers of likely cost overruns ... . Requiring no major new revenue streams, such as tolls, taxes or fees ... . Removing project management from the R.I. Department of Transportation (RIDOT), which has recently come under intense public criticism for ongoing internal inefficiencies ... . Delivering bridge and road repairs in a more timely manner ... . Potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in overall project costs.\" The debate over Rhode Island's crumbling bridges has centered, so far, on the new tolls Governor Raimondo is seeking to levy on large trucks, at multiple highway locations. Her plan: to raise an additional $500 million for bridge repairs with a $600 million toll-financed revenue bond that would cost taxpayers — without a public referendum — a projected $1.1 billion over 30 years. As an alternative, a group of Republican legislators has suggested moving hundreds of millions of state dollars, annually, from less critical line-items in the state budget to pay-as-you-go bridge repairs. Mike Stenhouse, CEO of the Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity, poses this question: \"Why would we want to give $500 million for such an important project to an agency as troubled as RIDOT?\" \"Yet another over-budget, low quality government boondoggle would waste hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars, benefiting the same special-interest insiders who have prospered from decades of mismanagement and corruption at the highly inefficient R.I. Department of Transportation,\" the center argues in its report. To reduce taxpayer costs, the center suggests the General Assembly provide a \"case-specific exemption from project labor agreements (PLAs), minimum apprenticeship requirements, and 'prevailing wage' laws.\" \"With these exemptions, the contractor could hire subcontractors at market rates, avoiding existing closed-shop and artificially inflated wage requirements,\" the center suggests. Using the same interest-rate assumptions Raimondo's team used, the center believes its public-private partnership proposal could knock the total project cost — including interest — down from $1.1 billion to $570 million. As to where the state would get the money to make the contractually guaranteed payments to the contractor, the center anticipates \"strategic\" spending cuts, but \"some revenue may also be derived from increased truck registration fees, if necessary for political reasons.\" Sound good? This was the response from Raimondo spokeswoman Marie Aberger: \"We appreciate more and more people speaking out every week about the urgent need to address our crumbling infrastructure. But public-private partnerships don't come with a magic payment stream. Any plan to improve roads and bridges requires a funding source. \"The Pennsylvania example cited by this report is funded in part by increases in Pennsylvania's gas tax and registration fees. In contrast, RhodeWorks levies the burden of funding the infrastructure repair on the users that are creating the damage, the majority of which are out-of-state trucks — rather than a broad-based tax increase on all Rhode Islanders.\" The Center for Freedom & Prosperity — currently chaired by 2012 Republican Congressional candidate Michael Riley — agrees with Democrat Raimondo on the critical need to do something to fix the roads and bridges. But the center objects to Raimondo's toll-plan on numerous grounds, among them: \"It perpetuates the wasteful spending, cronyism and bureaucratic failures rampant at the RIDOT ... . It benefits Wall Street financiers with over $500 million in interest costs, which do not directly improve the quality of life for Ocean Staters ... . It places R.I. taxpayers and ratepayers at even greater financial risk of bearing future responsibility for toll revenue shortfalls or project cost overruns.\" By offloading \"the debt, risk and delivery of the project to a private sector partner,\" the center believes its proposal could cut the 10-year project completion timeline by at least half, and the overall construction cost, including the $43 million anticipated price tag for tolling gantries in Raimondo's plan, from a potential $543 million to $268 million. Beyond that, the center contends its approach would eliminate many of the uncertainties in Raimondo's tolling plan, including \"impossible predictions\" about driver \"behavior\" to avoid paying the tolls. \"Moreover ... Rhode Islanders would live under the constant fear that new tolls on them are always a single vote of the legislature away.\" The report cites Pennsylvania as a state where the alternative it suggests has \"saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\" In Pennsylvania, Plenary Walsh Keystone Partners won a competitive bid to design, replace and maintain 558 deficient bridges, with financing from a $721.5 million \"tax-exempt private activity bond (the largest in U.S. history), along with $59 million of equity investment.\" Under the Pennsylvania plan, \"the average replacement bridge under the project is expected to cost $1.6 million, as compared to the PennDOT estimate of $2 million per bridge under the traditional delivery option, a significant savings ... before factoring in the 25 year maintenance and rehabilitation 'warranty'.\" The report puts little credence in the benefits touted in a recently released economic-impact analysis of the toll proposal, commissioned by the Raimondo administration, including 6,487 new jobs, $521 million in personal income. \"Despite a report from an insider government vendor, many are concerned that the governor’s plan would place yet another tax on Rhode Islanders — in the guise of highway tolls — putting unnecessary downward pressure on an already depressed state economy and placing taxpayers and drivers at further risk for inevitable cost overruns,\" the center's report says. The center describes itself as a free-enterprise public policy think tank. kgregg@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:16:25.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
