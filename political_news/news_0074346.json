I honestly do not believe this investigation was set up to go after Hillary. I believe it shifted that way,\" Podliska said. Podliska's claims are another blow to the House Benghazi investigation, but Republicans say he's lying.\nGOP Rep. Trey Gowdy, the committee chairman, said Podliska was fired \"in part, because he himself manifested improper partiality\" against Clinton.\nGowdy also said Podliska's accusations only came after he \"demanded money from the committee\" in mediation, which the committee \"refused to pay.\"\nDemocrats say Podliska's claims square with their view that the committee's chief goal is to destroy the likely Democratic nominee for president. They believe House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy all but confirmed their view when he made this statement earlier this month:\n\"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today?\"\nInternal documents obtained by CBS News show that the committee originally planned to hold nine hearings this year to hear from eyewitnesses, intelligence officials, and the secretary of defense.\nNone of those hearings has taken place, and only one is scheduled for later this month -- with Clinton as the lone witness.\n\nPlay Video CBS Evening News \"60 Minutes\" interview: President Obama Is the U.S. taking a backseat to Russia in Syria? Steve Kroft asks President Obama in an interview for “60 Minutes.” \nPresident Obama argued the scrutiny of Clinton's private server has been overblown on \"60 Minutes.\"\n\"You know, she made a mistake. She has acknowledged it. I do think that the way it's been ginned up is in part because of politics.\"\nRepublicans say they had to scrap some of the planned hearings because they've had difficulty procuring some of the relevant documents from the administration, and that they always intended to do most of their work behind closed doors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:27:32.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
