It is humiliating for the ministry that handles labour relations to have such an accusation levelled at them. \n\"It is also rank hypocrisy that a ministry which last year gifted huge salary increases to senior management now refuses any pay rise for rank and file staff. \n\"Clearly the Joyce jinx has struck again. He’s not the fixit man he claims to be and has got too much on his plate. Hopefully John Key will relieve him of a couple of portfolios in the new year. \n\"Meanwhile he is failing miserably to reach critical targets such as lifting exports as a percentage of GDP to 40 per cent. He needs to lift his game or scale back his empire,\" says David Clark. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:27:24.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
