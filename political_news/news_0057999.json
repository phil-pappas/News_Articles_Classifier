Led by the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), the nation's leading nonprofit, public-private partnership promoting online safety, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), NCSAM marks its 12 th anniversary this October. Launching the month with the recognition that securing the Internet is a global imperative, the General Secretariat of the Organization of American States (OAS) will also host an international event in Washington, D.C. promoting a culture of cybersecurity among its member states' 250 million Internet users in Latin America and the Caribbean as well as other countries around the globe. OAS is a long-time STOP. THINK. CONNECT. partner and has championed participation in education and awareness by a diverse group of stakeholders in Latin America .\nThe theme of the month resonates with young people internationally. According to the recently released Cyber Safety for the Digital Generation survey by the Raytheon Company , 82 percent of young adults globally believe that keeping the Internet safe and secure is our shared responsibility. They are clear on the roles everyone should play in keeping them safe and secure online:\n75 percent think they themselves should be significantly involved; 69 percent think the commercial websites they visit and use should be significantly involved; 51 percent think the government should be significantly involved; 47 percent think the people they interact with on social networks should be significantly involved. \"We live in a global, digital age where people, networks and devices are increasingly interconnected, and everyone needs to be taking steps to use the Internet safely and more securely,\" said Michael Kaiser , NCSA's executive director. \"Practicing good cybersecurity empowers Internet users to reap the benefits of connectivity with greater confidence. National Cyber Security Awareness Month succeeds when we work together to build a safer, more secure and trusted Internet. Awareness month is a must.\"\nNCSAM 2015 also marks the fifth anniversary of STOP. THINK. CONNECT., the preeminent global cybersecurity education and awareness campaign. Driven by NCSA, the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) and DHS, which leads the federal government's campaign, STOP. THINK. CONNECT. continues to extend its international impact with a simple but increasingly important message to stay safer and more secure online. The campaign's partners include 271 large companies, small- and medium-sized businesses, colleges and universities, regional banks and a collection of other organizations as official partners. Currently, STOP. THINK. CONNECT. has official partnerships in Canada , Australia , Panama , the European Union, India , Japan , Mexico and other countries and regions, with its materials translated into five languages - Spanish, French (Canadian), Portuguese (Brazilian), Japanese and Russian - and several more translations on the way.

THINK. CONNECT. across the globe. When industry, government and civil society work together, we can help every digital citizen access and act on the information they need to be safer and more secure online.\"\nReady, Set, Get #CyberAware\nUnder the umbrella theme of \"Our Shared Responsibility,\" NCSAM 2015 will explore five weekly themes addressing a cross section of cybersecurity issues. They include STOP. THINK.

Get two steps ahead : Turn on two-step authentication ? also known as two-step verification or multi-factor authentication ? on accounts where available.
