He is a bi-pedal bear and he can only walk upright. He is missing one front paw and the other is permanently injured. He roams the local neighborhoods that he calls home in NJ looking for his next meal. He does not have the capability of running from what he may consider a threat, he cannot climb trees as most black bears do. He sticks to the local neighborhood because he cannot compete with the much larger bears in the area or navigate some of the tough mountain terrain. He lies down in the middle of the road with exhaustion â€¦Tell the NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife that we want to help Pedals get to sanctuary and tell them to make the right decision and let the sanctuary bring him to safety. Sign this petition and support Pedals to go from a struggling life to a peaceful place where he will be cared for the rest of his life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:30:42.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
