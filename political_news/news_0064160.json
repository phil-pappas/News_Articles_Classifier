WASHINGTON — Paul Ryan is in for House Speaker — with conditions.\nRyan told GOP members in a closed-door meeting Tuesday night that if the three major groups representing the moderate and conservative wings of the party endorse him, he'll run for Speaker.\nThe announcement means if the hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus come along, Ryan is likely to replace House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio).\n\"If the members agree with his requests and share his vision, and if he is a unity candidate-with the endorsement of all the conference's major caucuses-then he will serve as speaker. He will be all in,\" his spokesman Brendan Buck said in a statement.\nMembers of the moderate Tuesday Group said they're almost certain to back him, and those in the conservative but not as hardline Republican Study Committee said the same.\n\"I feel like he's a unifying person, a very bright person, we know that he's a very positive person,\" RSC member and Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) said, promising he'll push his group to support Ryan.\nBut the big question is whether the Freedom Caucus members who gave Boehner fits — and helped drive House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from the race to replace him earlier this month — will go along. Many pushed through the crowd of reporters in the basement of the Capitol building refusing to say anything or saying they needed time to think about it.\n\"I'm going to the gym,\" was all Freedom Caucus member and Rep. Curt Clawson (R-Fla.) would say when asked about his thoughts on Ryan's conditions. \"My initial thought is I'm going to clear my head in the gym.\"\nRelated Stories Harry Reid praises Paul Ryan for working well with Democrats House GOP facing budget chaos without a speaker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:42:28.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
