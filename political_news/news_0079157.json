Punching up traditional dishes with modern, fresh touches.\nThink of this recipe as a turning point. In 2009, Alon Shaya opened Domenica, a Northern Italian restaurant, in New Orleans’ Central Business District. Two years later, Pizza Domenica followed. With his third restaurant, Shaya, the chef went in a different direction. “At Domenica, a lot of Italian dishes were starting to look Israeli,” he said. “That’s when I realized it was time to open Shaya.”\nHence this comforting combination of curried chickpeas and charred eggplant, Mr. Shaya’s final Slow Food Fast contribution. “At Domenica we stuffed eggplants with olive oil-braised vegetables,” he said. “But it was at Shaya that this dish came into its own.” Here, halved eggplants broil until they blister then get a topping of spiced chickpeas, roasted red peppers, onions and garlic. Garnishes of parsley, cilantro and scallions provide fresh contrast and color.\nFor Mr. Shaya, nailing this dish was a matter of cooking what came most naturally. “Growing up, I loved being in the kitchen when my grandmother visited from Israel,” he said. “I still remember the smells of peppers, tomatoes and eggplants roasting over an open flame.” You won’t soon forget it, either.\nCharred Eggplant With Curried Chickpeas Total Time: 30 minutes Serves: 4\n2 medium eggplants 1 medium red pepper ¾ cup olive oil, plus more for garnish ½ medium red onion, diced 5 cloves garlic, minced Salt ½ tablespoon white-wine vinegar 1¼ tablespoons curry powder 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, plus more for garnish 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro, plus more for garnish 2 tablespoons thinly sliced scallions, plus more for garnish 1. Use a small knife to score eggplants’ skin with 5 slits each. On stove top over medium-low flame, roast eggplants and pepper, turning with tongs, until tender and charred all over, about 15 minutes. Remove eggplants and pepper from heat and let cool. Cut away pepper’s stem and seeds, and scrape off char. Cut pepper into 1½ -inch dice.\n2. Heat broiler. Warm 6 tablespoons olive oil in a medium sauté pan over medium heat. Sauté onions, diced red peppers, garlic and a pinch of salt until garlic lightly browns, 6 minutes. Add vinegar and cook until evaporated, about 30 seconds. Add curry powder and chickpeas. Sauté until beans warm through. Off heat, stir in parsley, cilantro and scallions.\n3. Meanwhile, halve eggplants and season flesh with salt and remaining olive oil. Arrange eggplants, cut-side up, on a baking sheet and place under broiler. Cook until tops caramelize, about 6 minutes.\n4. To serve, top eggplant halves with curried chickpeas. Garnish with additional olive oil, herbs and scallions. Serve with flatbread, rice or a salad.\nMore in Eating & Drinking Europe (Finally) Wakes Up to Superior Coffee Recipe for a Life-Changing Soup Cook Up a Shelling Bean Feast Recipes for Getting the Best Return on a Surplus of Vegetables Champion of Breakfasts: What’s the Winning Egg Sandwich Recipe?
