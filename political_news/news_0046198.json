The campaign launch was laced with pomp and pageantry, with Ezenator riding on horseback to the campaign ground like Jesus' triumphant entry into Jerusalem. \nThe aspiring parliamentary candidate also rode on horseback during a recent health walk that climaxed the rally at the Mandela Park at Osu in Accra. \nDr Rawlings asked the NDC faithful to shun those who would seek to buy their votes during the rally which climaxed her campaign launch. \n'The power is yours; you have the power. Don't let anyone pay you to take away that power,' she said. \nContinuing, she assured residents of the constituency that she would, through wide consultations, put together a development plan for the electoral area which she would implement when she came to power. \nThe plan, she explained, would focus on issues the constituents themselves had raised during her engagement with them, which cover education, sanitation, health and employment. \nDr Ezenator said, 'There are several corporate institutions and companies in the constituency. I will impress upon these companies to have a quota system in place where all of them will be required to provide employment for the constituents.' \nEzenator Rawlings has been active in the constituency for some time now, as if to dispel the charge by her opponents that she had never partaken in matters affecting the electoral area until now, and therefore not qualified to vie to represent the party – something her supporters have denied. \nShe also organised a clean-up exercise recently during which her father showed up to lend her (Ezenator) moral support as he did yesterday. \nHer father's equestrian gene appears to be in her. She was on horseback in her campaign walk along the streets of Osu yesterday, attracting inquisitive onlookers. \nShe intermittently engaged street-side onlookers in talks about the importance of keeping fit through aerobics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:27:34.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
