The focus of the survey was to learn more about their attitudes and behaviors when it comes to distracted driving.\nThe survey revealed that nearly all teens, over 90 percent, say they understand texting while driving is distracting, yet 44 percent say they do it. When asked to choose the top three things that would deter them from reading or responding to text messages, concern about crashing was the number one answer (51 percent), followed closely by getting caught by police (50 percent). Other common responses included:\nArriving safely at my destination (33 percent) Knowing someone who has caused a crash while texting (23 percent) Stories about crashes caused by texting (17 percent) Getting caught by parents (13 percent) Friends encourage safe driving (10 percent ) Parent/teen safe driving contracts (6 percent) New drivers, because they are especially vulnerable to crashes, should be focusing all their attention on their drive. Yet phones are not the only distraction teen drivers told us they must contend with when they're behind the wheel. Besides texting, teens reported searching for music, interacting with a navigation system/GPS, talking with passengers while behind the wheel and other activities which could potentially divert a young driver's attention away from the road.\nTalking with a passenger (94 percent) Listening to navigation system/GPS (79 percent) Searching for music (73 percent) Accessing the internet on their phone (36 percent) Reading social media (29 percent) Taking pictures with their phones (27 percent) \"As nearly all teenage drivers now own smartphones, we must continue our work to understand and address the wide array of distractions that young people face,\" said Chris Mullen , Director of Technology Research at State Farm. \"This survey shows us some of the perceptions that influence distracted driving behavior for teens, reinforcing the need for consideration of the best educational, technological, and legislative solutions, and continued parental support to help curb these types of behaviors among teens.\"\nThe State Farm survey revealed that distracting behaviors become more common among older teens, with those ages 18-19 much more likely than those ages 16-17 to report participating in the activities listed in this study.\nDriving situations can play an important role in teen drivers' decisions to participate in cellphone-related distracted driving behaviors that involve looking at the cellphone and interacting with the screen and/or buttons.\nSixty-seven percent of teen drivers who use their cellphone while driving reported that being stopped at a red light makes them more likely to use their cellphone compared to when the vehicle is in motion. Three-quarters of teens said they were less likely to use their cellphone when adult passengers were in their vehicle compared to 58 percent who were less likely to use their phone when other teens were present. At least two-thirds of teen drivers reported being \"a lot less likely\" to use their cellphone when driving in poor weather conditions such as rain, fog, snow, or ice.

Survey responses were received from approximately 1,000 teens who identified themselves as having a valid driver's license. Nearly all of the teens (96 percent) responding to this survey reported owning a cellphone, and almost all of those teens (94 percent) said they owned a smartphone and drove a median five hours per week.\nAbout State Farm ®\nThe mission of State Farm is to help people manage the risks of everyday life, recover from the unexpected, and realize their dreams.
