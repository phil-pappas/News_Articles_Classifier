Azem Agouna Bermandoua, who called it a triple bombing.\nA group of female suicide bombers hit the market in Baga Sola when it was at its busiest Saturday, killing at least 16 people, said director general of Chad's gendarmerie, Gen. Banyaman Cossingar. A second group of suicide bombers killed at least 22 people at the nearby refugee camp, he said.\nFor months, Baga Sola has been home to thousands of people who already had fled deadly Boko Haram attacks in Nigeria. The village is in the Lake Chad region near the border with Nigeria.\nWhile Boko Haram has attacked Chad's capital before, Saturday's bombings appear to be the largest and most elaborate staged yet in the country's lake region.\nThe extremists have stepped up attacks in Nigeria and neighboring countries including Niger, Cameroon and Chad since Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari took office in May pledging to halt the 6-year-old uprising that Amnesty International says has killed 20,000 people.\n__\nAhmed reported from Dakar, Senegal.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
