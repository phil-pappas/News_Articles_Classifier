What campaigners rely on is survey data from Mexican consumers who have told researchers that their sugary drink purchases have decreased since the introduction of the taxes. In reality, the Nielsen sales data – which is actual sales – shows that the Mexican sugar tax did not impact on sales volumes. It effect it is a nice earner for politicians for no gain.” \n“We’re all for measures such as the ones announced today to curb obesity. What we’re against is measures that raise revenue for politicians and public health campaigners, cost the poor, and do little if anything to curb the problems with those over-consuming.\" \nThe Taxpayers’ Union report on sugar taxes Fizzed out: why a sugar tax won't curb obesity is available for download at http://taxpayers.org.nz/fizzed_out New Zealand Taxpayers' Union \nNew Zealand's grassroots campaign for lower taxes and less government waste \nThe New Zealand Taxpayers' Union is an independent activist group, dedicated to being the voice for Kiwi taxpayers in the corridors of power.
