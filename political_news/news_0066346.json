But tracking the pure number of tweets about a candidate doesn’t necessarily give a full insight as to whether those mentions are good or bad. Using software that intelligently interprets positive, neutral or negative sentiment, as well as volume of tweets, Clarabridge is able to shed light on how the candidates’ statements are coming across. tracking the pure number of tweets about a candidate doesn’t necessarily give a full insight as to whether those mentions are good or bad. \nClarabridge measured sentiment among Twitter users on several key issues including the economy, gun control, foreign policy, immigration, climate change and questions surrounding Hillary Clinton’s email server, scoring that sentiment on a scale from -5 to +5, with a 0 being neutral. They chose Twitter because, “it is the most up-to-date opinion sharing platform,” according to the company. \nThe company also chose to only compare the two Democratic frontrunners, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Independent Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders, though they said they would have included Vice President Joe Biden, who is still considering a run for President, had he decided to participate in the debate. \nHere are some of the most notable results: Overall \nBernie Sanders was more well received than Hillary Clinton. Sanders’ +.03 sentiment score topped Clinton’s -.02. Clinton overall came off as more polarizing, evoking strong feelings one way or another, while Sanders was significantly more neutral. Clinton was more polarizing, with higher positive and negative sentiment, while Sanders' high neutral and positive made him the more popular candidate online. - Infographic via Clarabridge Foreign Policy \nUnsurprisingly, the former Secretary of State was strong on foreign policy. Clinton rated a sentiment score of +.43, and 38% more tweets on the issue that the other candidates. However, as an issue as a whole, foreign policy was a Democratic area of weakness, with the lowest overall sentiment of any issue at -.59. Hillary's Weaknesses \nHillary Clinton’s two most evident weaknesses were also unsurprising, ranking negatively on the fallout from Benghazi and the issues surrounding her private email server. These have been the two most public criticisms of Clinton and the indicators show they are still negatively affecting her. Gun Control \nMost pundits pointed to Sanders’ defense of his past support for certain gun rights, which he attributes to representing a rural state, as the most damaging part of the debate for him. However, while this may hurt him with the Democratic base, he performed better in overall sentiment, with a -.1 compared to Clinton’s -.33. What has been described as Sanders’ achilles heel seems to be less of an issue for him than many political watchers believed. Student Loan Debt \nStudent loans and college affordability is a winning issue for Sanders. His forcefully pitched plan for free public college resonated with Twitter users, prompting 98% more comments and .3 points higher than Clinton, who has also made affordable higher education a pillar of her campaign. This could also be reflective of the demographics actively using social media during the debate—younger voters struggling with post-college debt. Black Lives Matter \nAgain, a forceful statement of support for the Black Lives Matter movement earned Sanders more reaction online, garnering 58% more tweets than Clinton’s response to the same question: “do black lives matter, or all live matter.” \nSee the highlights here: The need-to-know for your day in DC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:09:34.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
