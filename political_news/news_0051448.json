That knowledge is strengthening the impulse to dig in and fight now. As Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal put it through the warmup GOP debate at the Reagan Presidential Library on Wednesday, &#8220If we cannot defund Planned Parenthood now, if we cannot stand for innocent human life just after these barbaric videos, it is time to be done with the Republican Celebration.&#8221 In no way mind that the &#8220barbaric videos&#8221 are just a pretext to attack a group that social conservatives have lengthy despised.\nThe reality is that power remains divided and the parties polarized in the nation’s capital. Senate Democrats have adequate members to filibuster any bill they don’t like, and even when a disputed bill has created it via, President Obama has located adequate allies in Congress to sustain a veto. Yet the GOP’s tea celebration wing continues to agitate for much more confrontation &#8212 for instance, by refusing to provide money for any government applications in fiscal 2016 unless each and every federal dollar for Planned Parenthood is reduce off. If Republicans try to impose such a situation, they’ll be met either with a Senate filibuster or a presidential veto, and the government will shut down.\nAssuming Congress finds a way around the Planned Parenthood impasse, the spending bills for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1 face a bigger dilemma. A 2011 budget law imposed what was known as the sequester, a set of tough spending caps that Republicans have now proposed to circumvent, but only for defense. Obama told lawmakers months ago that he would veto any spending bill that does not lift the caps for non-defense applications as properly, but there is been no progress toward a deal. In truth, Republicans have shown tiny interest even in negotiating.\nThe two-week shutdown that Republicans forced in 2013 didn’t appear to hurt the party in the 2014 election, so it is attainable that lawmakers could not see a downside in forcing another a single. But carrying out so would not only hurt the thousands of federal workers and contractors who’d acquire no spend it would deny constituents all &#8220nonessential&#8221 solutions, such as housing subsidies, compact-organization loans and environmental testimonials of building projects. And worse, it would hit the brakes on the U.S. economy and rattle international markets. Leaders from both parties and the Obama administration have to have to perform out a compromise now, and spare us getting to watch this undesirable film again.\nStick to the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-ed-shutdown-20150918-story.html"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:47:16.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
