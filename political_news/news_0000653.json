The BMW 5 series used 49% per cent more fuel, the Peugeot 308 hatchback used 48% more fuel, the Renault Megane used 45% more and the Volkswagen Golf used 41% more.The report also suggested new European cars are spewing out on average 40 percent more carbon dioxide than laboratory tests show, \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:44:54.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
