Iran also announced the conviction of American reporter Jason Rezaian, who has been held in an Iranian jail for more than a year.\nRep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., said these moves demonstrate that the Obama administration has failed in its negotiations with Iran.\n\"[T]he administration has shown a dangerous naivety regarding who it is dealing with,\" Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement. \"The administration didn't get Jason released when it had the leverage of the nuclear agreement. It must redouble efforts to get Jason and the other imprisoned Americans home now.\"\n  Iraqis preparing to retake Ramadi, for real this time Col. Steve Warren said Iraqi ground forces are encircling almost the entire city.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/13/15 1:02 PM Rezaian, an Iranian-American reporter for the Washington Post, has been held in an Iranian prison for 447 days, according to a Post report . Iranian officials announced over the weekend that he was convicted in a trial not open to any outside witnesses, though it's still unclear on which charges he was convicted.\nRezaian faced four charges, the most serious of which is espionage. He faces a maximum sentence of 20 years, the Post reported.\nSpeaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Iran's opaque handling of Rezaian's trial proves that the country should not be trusted to inspect itself, as required by the nuclear deal negotiated in July.\n\"President Obama's gamble that a nuclear deal would lead to a more responsible Iran has already failed,\" he said in a statement.\nIran tested its newest long-range ballistic missile over the weekend, dubbed \"Emad,\" or Pillar. The move prompted many to speculate whether the launch violated the nuclear deal, but Iran claimed that it did not, saying the country has always retained a right to advance its own national security.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner U.S. military: Russia's 'reckless' strikes actually helping ISIS Russian airstrikes in Syria have opened the door for the Islamic State to expand its foothold.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/13/15 12:41 PM Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said these two issues show that while the administration claimed the nuclear agreement would improve and strengthen relations with Iran, the opposite seems to be happening.\n\"Iran's increasing malign behavior in the past few weeks is the dangerous, yet predictable consequence of the administration's long habit of ignoring and downplaying the broader threat that Iran poses,\" said McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"The president needs to give up on his failed policy of acquiescing to Iranian power and start doing significantly more to counter it.\"\nTop Story Planned Parenthood to stop accepting cash for fetal tissue \nPlanned Parenthood will no longer accept payments  \nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham • 10/13/15 10:32 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:05:41.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
