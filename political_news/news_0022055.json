You are handing over lands as per your wish to foreign Singapore and private companies. I do not wish to come (to the foundation ceremony) as a protest against your attitude and not to support you in this scam,\" Reddy said in an open letter to Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu.\nThe Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly said he has come to know from media reports that he is going to be invited for the function.\nThe foundation stone for the AP's capital city Amaravathi would be laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 'Vijaya Dasami' on October 22.\nThe state government has said it is organising the event by sending out invitations to several VVIPs in the country and by involving farmers and common people across the state to promote a sense of belongingness with the capital city.\nThe YSRCP president mentioned several reasons in the open letter for him not attending the event.\nHe charged that the state government was building the capital by \"snatching away multi-cropped and fertile land from farmers against their wish\" for developing the city.\n\"Why Section 144 (of CrPC) and Section 30 is in force in the capital region? If people are happy, why these sections are in force? Why these prohibitory sections are being used for the last one year,\" he said.\nThe government is making \"wasteful expenditure to the tune of Rs 400 crore\" for a one-day event, he alleged.\nObserving that his party is not against construction of capital city, Reddy said he is opposing the event as it has become a \"real estate business\".\nStates: Andhra Pradesh Jaganmohan Reddy chandrababu Naidu Andhra Pradesh South Also Read Chennai salutes app entrepreneurial skills Isro, Nasa tie up on earth science measurements Chennai: One held for setting fire to Tasmac shop Kasargod women win hearts of foodies in France", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151015/nation-current-affairs/article/wont-attend-foundation-laying-ceremony-andhra-pradesh-capital", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/13gnt07_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/13gnt07_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:24:17.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
