Chris Christie, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders also spoke.\nRELATED: Donald Trump's bipartisan chops? Rebuilding an ice-skating rink\nIn answering her question Trump said he would be a better president for women than any of the other candidates running, but Batchelder wasn't satisfied, pressing the candidate for specifics.\n\"I want to get paid the same as a man, and I think you understand that. So if you become president, will a woman make the same as a man and do I get to choose what I do with my body?\" Batchelder said, as the crowd applauded her.\n\"You're going to make the same if you do as good a job. And I happen to be pro-life. OK? I'm pro-life,\" Trump answered.\nTuesday morning Trump fired back at Batchelder on Twitter saying , \"The arrogant young woman who questioned me in such a nasty fashion at No Labels yesterday was a Jeb staffer! HOW CAN HE BEAT RUSSIA & CHINA?\"\nThis is not the first time Batchelder has challenged a presidential candidate with questions related to how women are treated.\nAt a town hall in September in Manchester she questioned Bernie Sanders on how he would handle the issue of sexual assault on college campuses, saying she herself had been a victim of it.\nSanders thanked Batchelder for her courage in standing up and sharing her story.\n\"I know that's not an easy thing to do, but you made that decision, that you were not going to take it and you were going to stand up and talk about what happened to you and a whole lot of woman in this country,\" Sanders said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/653897939933364224", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:06:05.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
