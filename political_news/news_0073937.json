J. Rawlings and J. A. Kufuor to buttress on the need for all to leave the EC alone to work. \nThe NDC Deputy Communications Director pointed out that the EC has given the political parties letters to converge and defend their positions at the Alisa Hotel on the 29-30 October, 2015. \nHowever, the Member of Parliament for Asante Akyem North Constituency, Kwadwo Baah Agyemang who was a co-panel member was amazed by the comment of the NDC communications director. \nHe could not believe the Christian Council, a religious body that he said intervened in 2012 General Elections at the time the country was at the verge of breaking could be warned to stay off the debate on having a clean electoral roll. \n\"Today the NDC is warning the clergy, civil societies, former Presidents and all Ghanaians to shut up on the need to change the voter register...,?\" he wondered. \nThe Asante Akyem North MP was convinced that the NDC has a hidden agenda about the register.
