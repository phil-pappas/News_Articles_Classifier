You increased workers salary also by 10 percent. So why the over 100 percent increase after the people have paid 80 percent last year?” he asked. \nHe argued that “if anything at all, the margin of increase should have marched the inflationary increases in this case 17.5 percent, so why is the President asking for over 100 percent increment?” \nHe criticized the President’s management of the economy saying it is partly to blame for the over 100 percent increase. \n“The two major variables that go into the determination of utility bills are foreign exchange issues and inflation. If the President and his economic management team are not able to manage this economy well and you see your currency depreciating for [which] reason whatever was raised for ECG and VRA to import their inputs the value of whatever was given to them has been devalued because of your incompetence, do we have to suffer for it or do you rather have to improve on how you manage our economy?” \nAccording to him, but for the depreciation of the cedi, perhaps this 100 percent increase would not have arisen. “Imagine if the cedi had been stable … so he’s passing his incompetence to us, that is why we have to say no”. \nHe said increases in utility and taxes without a corresponding increase in salaries create a fertile ground for corruption. \n“The President thinks the easiest way to raise money to resolve this issue is to go to the consumers forgetting that the consumers also have a limit as to how far they can go. Have you increased their salaries by that much, if you haven’t where are they going to get the difference from? These are some of the things that lead to corruption. \n“…Imagine his salary is increased by 10 percent and all these things are increased beyond 10 percent how would that person bridge that gap? The person may end up finding money from wherever sources to make up for the difference. That is what is making the fight against corruption a lot more difficult for all of us in this country because we only look at collecting taxes from the people without thinking about where they will get the resources to pay for these things” he argued.
