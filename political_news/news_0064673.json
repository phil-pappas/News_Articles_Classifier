Jim Clyburn, D-S.C. × The biggest Lowcountry “get” in the Democratic race for the White House is going to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nOnline\nFor more political coverage, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android .\nLess than 24 hours after Riley’s first choice — Vice President Joe Biden — bowed out, Riley said he will support Clinton for president.\nUp until this week, Riley had told everyone in the state’s political circles that he would be a lock for Biden if the VP opted to get in the race.\nBut once Biden chose against it, Riley said he made contact with the Clinton campaign Wednesday night to say he would be in her camp.\n“I respect her very much,” Riley said Thursday. “I think she would make an excellent president.”\nThe mayor said he met both Bill and Hillary Clinton in the 1980s when he had a leadership role with the U.S. Council of Mayors. At the time she was an advocate with the Children’s Defense Fund and spoke out in support of preventing teenage pregnancies, he said.\nRiley said Biden had been his first choice, saying a friendship had grown out of his time in the Obama administration stemming from Charleston-related issues. Biden already had deep connections in South Carolina tied to friendships with former Sens. Fritz Hollings and the late Sen. Strom Thurmond. He has been a repeat visitor to the area as well for vacations and breaks.\nBiden’s exit is expected to send other sidelined Democrats Clinton’s way and free up new sources of campaign cash as well.\nClinton is scheduled to be in Charleston next week to speak to the Charleston branch of the NAACP’s 98th annual Freedom Fund Banquet as the keynote speaker.\nSeven years ago, Riley skipped on backing Clinton in favor of then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama. At the time Riley said he had been carefully watching the entire Democratic field, which he called “stellar,” but he ultimately decided Obama was the best.\nReach Schuyler Kropf at 937-5551.", "external_links": ["http://www.palmettopolitics.com/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palmetto-politics/id897497885?ls=1&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:58:31.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
