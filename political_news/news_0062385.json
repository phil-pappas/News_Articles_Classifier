In August, the State Department admitted to a federal judge that Abedin and others close to Clinton used private accounts to conduct government business, and that they were unable to search those accounts for official records.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:21:46.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
