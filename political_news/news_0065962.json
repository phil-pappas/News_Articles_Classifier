The next speaker?\nBy Rachel Brody Oct. 21, 2015 | 2:30 p.m. EDT + More Could Rep. Paul Ryan put the House GOP back together again? After flat-out rejecting the post earlier this month, the Wisconsin congressman and House Ways and Means Committee chairman said Thursday night he'll now consider running for House speaker – but only with the express support of his fractured party. \"This is not a job I ever wanted or I ever sought,\" Ryan said . \"I came to the conclusion that this is a very dire moment, not just for Congress, not just for the Republican Party, but for our country. I think our country is in desperate need of leadership.\"\nRyan's decision comes after much coaxing from Republicans, as the party has scrambled to fill the void that resigning Speaker John Boehner will leave behind. Almost two weeks ago, California Rep. Kevin McCarthy withdrew suddenly from the race, citing the same party divide as did Ryan in his decision to drop out, saying, \"[I]t has become clear to me that our Conference is deeply divided and needs to unite behind one leader.\"\n[ SEE: Political Cartoons on the Republican Party ]\nAaron Blake at The Washington Post says Ryan seems to have found the only \"good way\" to agree to run for the speakership. Asking for specific endorsements from the moderate, conservative and hardline Republican groups secures Ryan three crucial political wins, writes Blake. First, he's got an out. \"[I]f there is literally any discord over his potential ascension, he can blame it on other people and bow out,\" he offers. Second, he's giving the hardline Freedom Caucus a \"considerably less sexy\" option by forcing their yea or nay vote to play out before Ryan's formal run, instead of on the House floor in the caucus' usual dramatic fashion. And third, Ryan's hard-to-get act has him sitting pretty. Writes Blake, \"Ryan is covering his bases and making his party come to him.\"\nBut Erick Erickson at Red State thinks Republicans should stay right where they are. Ryan isn't simply asking for agreement within the party; he's asking to \"neuter the ability of the majority to replace the Speaker of the House,\" writes Erickson. The blogger points to Ryan's expressed commitment Thursday that, if elected, he'd seek to end a rule allowing a simple majority to remove a sitting House speaker . \"House conservatives would be insane to agree to these terms,\" he says. \"It would gut their ability to pull the House Republicans to the right.\" A vote for Ryan by conservatives, he writes, is a vote to \"sign their own death warrant.\"\n[ READ: Kevin McCarthy Drops Out of House Speaker Race, Pundits React ]\n\"Right off the bat this conveys a sense of a coronation more than an election,\" writes Jazz Shaw at Hot Air. \"What Paul Ryan is asking in exchange for rescuing the party from itself is essentially the cancellation of any sort of competitive election or airing of competing ideas,\" he argues, and that's not democracy. Shaw concedes that Ryan is an admirable guy and good politician, saying the congressman \"comes to his office with an earnest desire to serve his district and the nation.\" Still, \"we hold elections for a reason,\" says Shaw. Even with a party as admittedly distressed as the Republicans are, he writes, it would \"be a mistake to rush rashly into the arms of a savior if the price is disastrously high.\"\nMeanwhile, Ryan has already secured support from at least one notable, albeit \"unwelcome,\" figure, writes Politico's Burgess Everett: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. \"He appears to me to be one of the people over there that would be reasonable,\" the Nevada Democrat said Thursday. \"I don't agree with him on much of what he does. … But generally speaking we've been able to work with him.\"\nShould the GOP Unite Behind Paul Ryan?\nYes No View Results Yes 100.0% No 0.0% Total Votes: 1 View Poll\nTAGS: Ryan, Paul House of Representatives Republican Party conservatives Congress", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/20/paul-ryan-is-being-very-smart-about-running-for-speaker/", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZees5p%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.politico.com/blogs/the-gavel/2015/10/harry-reid-endorse-paul-ryan-house-speaker-214970#ixzz3pDTW8sgR", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZees5p%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/PRyan/status/652162738270027776", "http://time.com/4080753/paul-ryan-house-speaker-full-statement/", "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/10/21/the-house-needs-a-speaker-but-not-an-emperor/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZees5p%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Paul%20Ryan%20Sets%20Terms%20for%20GOP%20Speaker%20Run%2C%20Pundits%20React&summary=Paul%20Ryan%27s%20run%20for%20House%20speaker%20comes%20with%20strings%20attached.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ryan-nears-decision-on-speakers-race-as-congress-returns/2015/10/20/b0e4998c-7687-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZees5p%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZees5p%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Paul%20Ryan%20Sets%20Terms%20for%20GOP%20Speaker%20Run%2C%20Pundits%20React", "http://www.redstate.com/2015/10/21/paul-ryan-wants-house-conservatives-to-sign-their-own-death-warrant/", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZees5p%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Paul%20Ryan%20Sets%20Terms%20for%20GOP%20Speaker%20Run%2C%20Pundits%20React"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:25:30.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
