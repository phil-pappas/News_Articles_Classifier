The program will feature a series of 45-minute breakout sessions in the morning, a keynote address by Professor Charles Porter , and a wrap-up session in the afternoon by New Braunfels Utilities.\nAlthough 97.5 percent of the Earth is water, only less than one-half percent of that is actually clean, drinkable water. With Texas' ever-growing population, it is more important now than ever to make conscious and deliberate efforts to safeguard this precious resource. This water strategies forum will provide valuable and up-to-date information on the preservation of water supplies in the state and a meaningful discussion on the future of water availability in south central Texas .\nMorning sessions will be provided by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority, the San Antonio Water System, the Texas Water Development Board, the Edwards Aquifer Authority, the Canyon Lake Water Service Company, the National Weather Service and the newly created Trinity Groundwater Conservation District. Charles Porter , professor, author and expert on water rights and real estate, will deliver the luncheon keynote address. Porter teaches global water policy courses at St. Edwards University and his book explores the history of water rights in Texas . New Braunfels Utilities will deliver the afternoon session, focusing on their work to provide quality water to their customers.\nTickets for the water strategies forum are $25 each and include lunch and refreshments throughout the day. Tickets can be purchased at www.WaterStrategies.eventbrite.com .
