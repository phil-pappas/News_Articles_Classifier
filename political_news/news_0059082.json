Photo by Bill Wechter\nHarvard University graduate Francisco Hernandez sat at home in San Diego last week, unemployed and watching television at 2 in the afternoon.\nIt wasn’t his choice. The undocumented 2009 valedictorian of the Lennox Math, Science and Technology Academy should have been teaching his students at the Gary and Jerri-Ann Jacobs High Tech High charter school in San Diego.\nGranted a work permit under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program enacted by President Barack Obama’s executive action on immigration in 2012, the 24-year-old noncitizen was abruptly told last Monday he was no longer authorized to hold his job.\nGoFundMe: Here’s how to help Hernandez\nDoesn’t blame school\nHernandez, who came to Lennox in the first grade and grew up there, doesn’t blame school officials for sending him home. His DACA work permit expired just weeks ago as he waited for officials to approve a new work permit, which he is eligible for under the federal Violence Against Women Act because his mother was a domestic violence victim.\nApproval from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services could take another three months, leaving him without income to pay his rent, make his car payment and buy food.\n“I’ve been left in limbo,” said Hernandez, who graduated from Harvard in 2013 with a bachelor’s degree in psychology.\n“There’s nothing I can do except worry about counting every penny that I have now. I’m scared I’m going to lose everything I’ve worked hard for.”\n‘Dreamers’ seek work permit renewals\nLike Hernandez, thousands of young undocumented immigrants across the country who obtained identification cards and work permits in 2012 requested renewals this year, only to discover the system is overwhelmed.\nDACA, the president’s quick fix for so-called “Dreamers,” allows undocumented immigrants who were under 16 when their parents brought them to the United States — and younger than 31 in June 2012 — to apply for work permits. “Deferred action” means they would not likely face deportation.\nObama’s controversial action during the 2012 presidential campaign remains just as contentious in the 2016 campaign, with a wide range of positions among the candidates. GOP frontrunner Donald Trump wants to deport 11 million undocumented workers to Mexico or their home countries, while Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is pushing to expand Obama’s program with more protections and a path to citizenship.\nAdvertisement\nReaders responded with donations\nIn 2009, many South Bay residents responded with donations when Hernandez’s success story, in which he overcame one obstacle after another, was published in the Daily Breeze .\nThough he first entered the U.S. legally in first grade, his visa expired and he eventually returned to Mexico for a couple of years. When he came back to America, he ventured through the desert to cross the border illegally.\nAs a young boy, Hernandez grew up in a violent home in Lennox, where his abusive father was prosecuted for beating his mother.\nHernandez, who sometimes stood in the corner and covered his ears to quiet the screaming, excelled in the classroom at Buford Avenue Elementary School, where he made the honor roll, and at the Lennox academy, where he moved to the top of his class, became student body president and earned a 4.0 grade-point average.\nEventually, his father — who was granted amnesty in 1986 — left his wife and children behind for another woman.\nMother diagnosed with illness\nAs Hernandez’s mother raised him, she was diagnosed with Takayasu’s arteritis, a rare condition causing blood vessel inflammation that damages the aorta. She underwent surgery and regular hospital visits, and she could not work.\nShe eventually died of a massive stroke in October 2008, putting Hernandez’s college plans in jeopardy. Fearing Hernandez’s promising future would be derailed, teachers at his school rallied around him. Martial arts teacher Erica Delgado, her husband and daughters offered to house Hernandez for the rest of the school year. He accepted.\nAs the school year continued, Hernandez applied to several universities and was accepted at four University of California campuses: Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Davis and Berkeley.\nNeeds financial aid for college\nBut without federal financial aid, which he was not eligible for because of his immigration status, Hernandez had no way of paying for college. He applied to Rice University in Texas, near his sisters’ residence, but was turned down. Stanford, Yale, Princeton, Northwestern and Notre Dame all rejected him.\nFinally, Harvard, the last school to reply to his applications, sent a letter accepting Hernandez into its student body. Harvard offered a full-ride scholarship.\nHis story did not stop there. Although on scholarship, Hernandez still needed an income, but he could not get a job without proper documents. He resorted to dancing in an exotic club to make money, and raising funds online to help him with expenses.\nWatching efforts for immigration reform closely, and fearing he could be deported, Hernandez submitted a petition under the Violence Against Women Act as an immigrant child of an abusive parent with legal status. If approved, he would be granted deferred action status, making him a low priority for deportation and allowing him to apply for a work permit.\nWhen Obama took executive action on DACA in 2012, Hernandez’s VAWA petition was still pending, so his immigration attorney at the time suggested he apply for a work permit through DACA.\nReceives permit to work\nThe DACA petition was approved and he received a two-year work permit. A short time later, his VAWA petition also was approved. With his work status appearing settled, he graduated and was hired to teach Spanish at the San Diego high school. He recently started his third year and hoped to eventually get a green card, but that might take seven years.\n“I love being an educator,” Hernandez said. “My goal is to be an educational psychologist. That’s how I got through my problems. Ultimately, I want to become a school psychologist in juvenile detention centers.”\nWhen Hernandez recently applied for a DACA renewal without the help of an attorney, federal officials denied his request, saying he now had deferred action status through VAWA, so his work permit had to be processed under the VAWA provisions, said his current attorney, Brooke Alexander Parr.\nHernandez has applied but it will take several months to secure the work permit.\nSchool had no choice\nHernandez said his school’s director had no choice. He wanted to keep Hernandez on staff, but could not without a work permit. Hernandez was placed on a leave of absence Monday, and terminated Thursday.\nHernandez said he wanted to go to school to say goodbye to his students, but the director told him it was best not to upset the students.\n“I’ve been a wreck, knowing I can’t even say goodbye and tell them how proud I am of them and to do their best with the new teacher,” Hernandez said. “This completely sucks. They tried everything. I appreciate it but there is nothing they can do. It’s not their fault.”\nSchool officials inform students\nOn Friday, school officials notified the students. Hernandez sent a letter to them, explaining his immigration issue.\n“You have made me so incredibly proud to be an educator, and I couldn’t have asked for a more amazing group of students to have this semester,” he wrote. “Thank you for inspiring me and pushing me. This all makes it so much harder for me to have to step away for the time being.”\nHernandez recently was accepted into the USC School of Social Work to pursue a master’s degree in mental health and school psychology. He was not eligible to apply for federal aid, so he deferred his course work for a year.\nHernandez hopes he can get his job back once his work permit comes through, possibly in January.\n“Our immigration system is broken,” Hernandez said. “Hardworking people like me who mean nothing but the best, who see this country as their own, get screwed every day.”\nAbout the Author Daily Breeze crime reporter for 23 years.
