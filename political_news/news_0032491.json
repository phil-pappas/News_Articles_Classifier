It also ensures the company sticks with the District's clean energy goals. Concerns over Exelon scrapping the city's plans to invest in cleaner forms of electricity once it acquired Pepco, as well as concerns over price hikes, scuttled the deal in August.\nComplicating the merger, however, a recently formed D.C. public utility has proposed buying all of Pepco's assets and turning it into a publicly owned utility as an alternative to the Exelon merger. Still, the settlement agreement is expected to bode well for Exelon.\n\nTop Story GOP lawmakers: Has EPA fired anyone for toxic mine spill?
