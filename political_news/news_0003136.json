It examines the likely adverse consequences of the new nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1, and maps out policy options by which policymakers in Congress and the Executive Branch can best mitigate them.\n\"The new deal with Iran does not signal an end to the challenge that Iran poses to the United States and American strategic interests,\" says AFPC Vice President Ilan Berman , who served as a member of the Task Force, and as its coordinator. \"Rather, it opens a new – and arguably even more challenging – phase in our Mideast policy. We hope that this document arms the country with new ways by which it can manage the problem.\"\nDownload the full text of the report, entitled A Nuclear Deal With Iran: Managing the Consequences , free of charge from AFPC's website.\nAbout AFPC: Founded in 1982, AFPC is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to bringing information to those who make or influence the foreign policy of the United States and to assisting world leaders with building democracies and market economies.
