Until then, GDP growth is likely to recover more gradually at 7.6% in FY16 (7.8% previously), 7.8% in FY17 (8.3% previously) and 8.2% in FY18; still among the highest in the world,\" added the report.\nThe April-June quarter GDP slipped to 7% from 7.5% in the preceding quarter.\nReserve Bank on September 29 effected a more-than-expected interest rate cut of half a percent to boost the economy.\nThe apex bank had also lowered its economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.4% from its previous projection of 7.6%.\nHSBC expects CPI inflation to slow down to 4.8% in the current financial year but is likely to rise to 5.5% in the financial year 2017 on the back of low base and improving growth.\nMoreover, current account deficit, is expected to narrow further to 1% this fiscal taking cue from weak global commodity prices. According to HSBC, an extended El Nino effect is a risk to its forecast, as it could depress rural growth further and stoke food prices.\nThe key risk to medium-term growth is a slackening in the reform process and the inability of public investments to \"crowd in\" the private sector, it added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:31:51.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
