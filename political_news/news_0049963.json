Five years later, the GOP establishment is understandably skeptical of again committing to the former high-flying businesswoman. As Fiorina makes her pitch to Capitol Hill lawmakers and political operatives on Wednesday evening, portraying herself as an outsider and polling well in the presidential race, she faces a tough challenge securing the kind of establishment support that could be needed to run a long and successful campaign.\nIt’s a quest complicated by the easily-assembled attacks on her stewardship of Hewlett-Packard and her staggering loss in 2010 to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), even after the National Republican Senatorial Committee poured in $8 million to aid her.\nSen. John Cornyn, who chaired the NRSC in 2010, indicated that Republicans are open to giving her another chance on the national stage. He blamed demographics, not Fiorina, for the 10-point loss to Boxer.\nTrump-Bush feud fizzles as race shifts to serious By Eli Stokols\n“I got to know her well when she ran for the Senate and I think a lot of her,” Cornyn, now majority whip, said. “California is just, let’s say, an uphill battle. It just turned so blue it wasn’t meant to be.”\nAs a major fundraiser for the party, Cornyn is the type of figure Fiorina is hoping to make an impression on. But he won’t be at the Capitol Hill Club on Wednesday for the intimate members and chiefs-only event for Fiorina that Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.) is hosting (Cornyn was unaware it was happening).\nOther influential voices, including four of of the Senate’s six female GOP senators, won’t be there either; most cited scheduling conflicts or said they to didn't know she was in town. A do-or-die government funding vote in the House intersected directly with her visit.\nFiorina may have a buzz in the national polls, but on Capitol Hill her campaign is an undercard to Washington's drama.\n“Her what? Oh no, I had no idea,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska when asked about the Fiorina event. But the moderate Murkowski then added that Fiorina is in the conversation for candidates she’d consider supporting: “She is clearly filling that space where people want to see a strong Republican woman out running for the highest office in the land.”\nSuch is the current state of relations between Washington Republicans and Fiorina. They like her stage presence and the diversity she brings to the field along with Ben Carson, who is African-American, and Cuban-American Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.\nBut Fiorina is still a largely unknown quantity in the Capitol.\n“It’s helpful for her to come here. I’m already on the phone talking to my donors and party activists – and I’m going to help her build a campaign structure,” said Rep. Candice Miller of Michigan, one of two female Republican House members to endorse Fiorina (the other is Rep. Lynn Jenkins of Kansas).\n“She sees it as timely now to come onto the Hill … setting herself up because some of these other [candidates] are ready to fall,\" Miller added.\nCrunch time for candidates By Hadas Gold and Alex Isenstadt\nBut few lawmakers say they know Fiorina know her aside from chance encounters and watching her in the second Republican presidential debate. This is Fiorina’s opportunity to change that, but she’s unlikely to leave Wednesday night’s gathering at The Capitol Hill Club with many new backers.\n“Sharp lady,” said Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, the state’s highest ranking Republican. But Ayotte won’t be there on Wednesday and feels no hurry to endorse, even though Fiorina is on her roster of possible GOP candidates who could win her support. “I don’t feel the need to [endorse], but we’ll see.”\nThe other prominent early state female GOP senator, Joni Ernst of Iowa, said in an interview she’s interested in hearing more from Fiorina on Wednesday. Fiorina’s polling in Iowa has caught Ernst’s eye, even if the freshman senator has no immediate plans to wield her influence in the Iowa caucuses and make an endorsement.\n“She’s exciting. A lot of people are interested in her candidacy. She’s a fresh face for us,” Ernst said “I’m excited about a lot of our candidates. We have a lot of opportunity on our side and there’s not so much selection on the other.”\nFiorina is fourth in Iowa and third nationally, gaudy numbers for a candidate who got blown out in California and has never held elected office. This delights Democrats to no end: If Republicans select Fiorina as their nominee, they say it’s a sure win.\n“The more people that help her and the more that she is a leading candidate, the better it is for the Democrats,” Boxer said in an interview. “I had more Republican support than I ever had before. She makes Mitt Romney look middle class.”\nIndeed, this speaks to a central problem that Fiorina faces. There are so many options that influential senators and members of Congress are largely keeping their powder dry, which in turn deprives some leading candidates of important surrogates on the Hill to boast about contenders’ accomplishments and defend them from attacks.\nFiorina has that in Jenkins and Miller, who is actively working to build support for Fiorina. Miller said since she endorsed Fiorina after a Republican confab in Michigan earlier this month. She said she has heard from several other female lawmakers who want to speak with Fiorina as she could be their “second choice” when other GOP presidential contenders drop out of the race.\n“There are more (drop-out) announcements to come,\" said Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri, who hosted a fundraiser for Fiorina during her 2010 Senate run. Wagner is supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\nPoll: Wisconsin voters reject Walker By Nick Gass\nIf other foes begin leaving, Fiorina will have to act fast to poach presidential surrogates from the Hill.\n\"That’s what I’d be doing if i was running for president, trying to get support from representatives around the country,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who is also attending Fiorina’s visit.\nOperatives working with Fiorina said they expect more female lawmakers to back her soon, but she'll have to work for it first. Capito said she intended to see how Fiorina might help West Virginia’s energy industry, and Murkowski said she’d have to consider Fiorina’s strong anti-abortion and anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric in any endorsement decision.\nAs much as Fiorina is running as an outsider, she mingled with Cornyn at the NRSC five years ago and, if things had gone her way, Fiorina would be serving in the Senate with four other GOP presidential candidates.\n“The whole outsider stuff, you guys like to play with that. I think the American people are going to listen to where these candidates are on the issues,” said Sen. Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Fiorina \"has a great message. She has an understanding of the issues.”\nBut those kind words have a limit. Fischer isn’t endorsing anytime soon, either.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:40:00.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
