More than 500,000 people have arrived in the European Union this year, seeking sanctuary or jobs and sparking the EU's biggest refugee emergency in decades. (AP Photo/Muhammed Muheisen)\nAssociated Press Oct. 9, 2015 | 2:40 a.m. EDT + More ATHENS, Greece (AP) â€” The latest developments as hundreds of thousands of people seeking safety make an epic trek through Europe. All times local.\n___\n9:40 a.m.\nGreece's coast guard says it has rescued 542 people in 12 search and rescue incidents from Thursday morning to Friday morning.\nThe rescues occurred off the coasts of the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Agathonissi and Farmakonissi, the coast guard said.\nHundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and poverty in their homelands have reached Greece so far this year, the vast majority on rickety boats or cheap inflatable dinghies from the nearby Turkish coast. Although a short sea journey, it can be fatal as the unseaworthy and overloaded boats sometimes sink.\nVery few of those arriving in Greece want to stay in the financially stricken country, instead moving north through the Balkans to more prosperous European Union countries such as Germany, Austria and Sweden.\n___\n9:30 a.m.\nGreece's coast guard says a wooden boat carrying a large number of refugees or other migrants has run aground on the small eastern Aegean island of Leros, while an infant died after the inflatable dinghy he was in partially sank off the coast of Lesbos island.\nThe wooden boat, carrying about 100 people, ran aground Friday on the northeast coast of Leros, the coast guard said. Those on board were being taken to shore by coast guard and private vessels that arrived to help.\nIn the Lesbos incident, the coast guard rescued 56 people from the sea Thursday night after the rear part of their dinghy burst, partially sinking the boat. A 1-year-old boy was recovered unconscious and transported to a hospital, but rescuers were unable to revive him.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
