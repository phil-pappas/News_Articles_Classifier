For news in the meantime, how about following @informemphis on Twitter?\nHello, 2016: In the post-Memphis election haze, it’s worth noting that there will again be elections in 2016, albeit barely on the hyper-local level. (I say barely because, yes, the General Sessions Court Clerk’s job is on the calendar.)\nYet an even year means races for state House, state Senate (Districts 30 and 32) and the U.S. Congress. And it’s the latter that has drawn attention recently, particularly as it relates to 9th District U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen .\nRicky Wilkins , who took Cohen on in last year’s Democratic primary but was handed a two-to-one loss, told me this week he’s still thinking about another go at it. “I’m not that far down the road yet,” Wilkins said of his decision-making. And Justin Ford , the County Commissioner who toyed with a city mayoral run before switching paths to the City Court Clerk’s race and ultimately finishing fifth in an eight-candidate field, is also thinking about it.\n“If I can raise $75,000 before January 1, or going into Valentine's Day, $100,000, then definitely we'll be in the Congress race,” he said.\nTo be sure, those are hardly the only names swirling through the rumor mill, which will start to get more and more active in the next few weeks and months.\nDid you see our maps? Thanks to Jason Viera in our digital department and this week’s release of data by the Commission, we have some shiny new maps to illustrate how each mayoral candidate fared across the city in last week’s election.\nI put the maps together with my own analysis of the splits in this piece that posted Thursday afternoon. Here’s the overall map:\nDon Johnson has a couple of other maps:\nHere's the #Vote901 map you have all been waiting for: City Court Clerk! @kyleveazey @Who__Arted @Kerry901 pic.twitter.com/kS95SUZW5Q\n— Don Johnson (@htmldon) October 15, 2015 Council District 5 precinct wins, Morgan v Springer, Prog vs Con maps @kyleveazey @Who__Arted @Kerry901 #Vote901 pic.twitter.com/hQ6rj8pxRO\n— Don Johnson (@htmldon) October 15, 2015 Not politics, but still interesting: The folks who run Memphis International Airport’s very fine Twitter presence put this out yesterday:\nHere’s a movie we made using @flightradar24 on a Thurs night.
