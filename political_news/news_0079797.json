This fall, the state's largest network of public colleges, overseen by the Tennessee Board of Regents, changed the way those students approach remedial work. \nIn the past, students have been required to take remedial classes as a \"prequel\" to college-level work, Tristan Denley, TBR's vice chancellor for academic affairs, told members of the state Senate's K-12 Education Subcommittee. For instance a student who entered community college without college-level math skills would have to take a remedial algebra class before he or she was allowed to take statistics. \nData suggest this model drives most students away from higher education. Only 12.6 percent of community college students who take remedial classes graduate with a degree or certificate within three years. \nTo improve chances for students arriving on campus this fall, TBR introduced a statewide co-requisite model that requires students to take remedial classes at the same time as credit-bearing courses. For instance a student who needs remedial math would take that course the same semester as college-level statistics. Colleges work now so TN Promise students succeed later \nTennessee is one of the first states to attempt this at a statewide level, but Denley told the senators that localized pilots have suggested it is a more successful approach. Sixty-nine percent of students who followed a pilot of the co-requisite model last fall were still enrolled in school this year, Denley said, compared with a 47 percent year-to-year retention rate for students using the traditional model. \nYear-to-year retention is a “notoriously difficult number to move,” Denley said. “This is a night-and-day difference.” \n\"We certainly hope that in the future we will have to use this kind of (model) less and less as students come into the system more and more prepared,\" Denley said. \"At least in the interim, we will have a successful strategy.\" \nSubcommittee chairman state Sen. Todd Gardenhire said the meeting was called to consider ways lawmakers can help shrink the number of students who graduate from high school without being college-ready. \n\"I really came into this without an end agenda,\" said Gardenhire, R-Chattanooga. \"We're looking for suggestions from people in the field if there's something we as legislators can do.\" \nThe subcommittee will meet Tuesday with more officials in K-12 districts to discuss their challenges. \nReach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and on Twitter @tamburintweets. 3 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1LeNkOr TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:13:01.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
