Specially trained detection dogs, including Bradley the Spaniel (from Wagtail, pictured), went on patrol with trading standards, police and licensing officers during intelligence-led checks at five off-licences across the borough on 24 September. The team seized 285 illegal items from two off-licences and a van near one of the premises. The haul included cigarettes, hand rolling tobacco and chewing tobacco with an estimated retail value of Â£2,400. All of the products broke the law by not carrying English health warnings. Officers also took eight bottles of vodka for inspection after doubts about their authenticity. The shopkeepers concerned are now helping officers with their enquiries. Dean Cooke, senior trading standards officer who led the operation for Slough Borough Council, said: 'The smuggled tobacco trade is illegal and it undercuts local shopkeepers who sell the legitimate products at the normal price. 'We were very disappointed to find illegal tobacco at some of the premises, despite the extensive work we do around the borough to put to a stop to such activity. 'It reinforces our need to do such checks using whatever tools we have at our disposal, including the finely tuned noses of our friends over at Wagtail.' Councillor Sohail Munawar, commissioner for social and economic inclusion, with a responsibility for trading standards, said: 'This operation reminds us that illegal and counterfeit products, which can be harmful to customers, are an ongoing problem. 'I urge people to help us stamp out this illicit activity by reporting anyone they suspect of being involved.' Report illegal tobacco activity to Slough trading standards via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service by calling 03454 040506 or using the incident report form online. distributed by This content was issued by Slough Borough Council on the 2015-10-08 and was initially posted on www.slough.gov.uk.
