It's been a struggle for me my whole life, and especially just being in the entertainment industry. Standing on a stage in front of people, I can't perform my best or be confident if I'm not sure — if I'm pulling at something [I'm wearing]. And sometimes I would just want to throw in the towel and be like, \"I'm not gonna go do standup tonight.\"\nShe says that it wasn’t until she worked with her Trainwreck stylist Leesa Evans that she understood how important it is to dress in a way that actually makes her feel good:\n\"My sister and I, we both have always dressed badly,\" she explained. \"Leesa had given me this gift of showing me how to dress and feel good. And she didn't have to do this, she just did. She shopped for my sister also, and seeing my little sister wearing a little blazer and a shirt and looking just like a strong, beautiful woman, it was ... to see this person I care the most about being given those tools was really moving for me.\"\nSince we can't all have stylists, Schumer is teaming up with Goodwill of Southern California to help \"educate and inspire women through fashion.\" While the details are slightly vague, we can only imagine this means emphasizing the importance of owning one pair of jeans that makes your butt look like it was hand-molded by the gods and one dress that your mother approves of.", "external_links": ["http://www.hulu.com/embed.html?eid=0umwp7oja-hhagdcbzdqlw&partner=nymag&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fwatch%2F858518"], "published": "2015-10-17T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:52:22.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
