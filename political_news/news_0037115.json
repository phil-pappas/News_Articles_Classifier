Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont,, left, and Hillary Rodham Clinton laugh during the CNN Democratic presidential debate, Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas.\nBy Lauren Boyer and Max Miceli Oct. 13, 2015 | 11:04 p.m. EDT + More Couldn't stay awake for the first Democratic presidential debate of 2016?\nYou didn't miss much.\nWhile the five candidates on stage couldn't be dismissed as a total snoozefest, they were hardly the fireworks show of the prior GOP debates .\nHere's how it unfolded:\n1. Are you a capitalist? A fired-up Bernie Sanders responded with passion.\n2. Lincoln Chafee is all about change. In 2007, he left the GOP to win a term as Rhode Island governor, serving as an independent. When questioned about his record, his response prompted a joke about \"soft granite\" from moderator Anderson Cooper.\n3. Shots fired.\n4. Nobody puts Jim Webb in the corner, but when they do, the former U.S. senator, a decorated Marine, gets feisty. \"Anderson can I get into this discussion?\" he asked, visibly perturbed, after disappearing from the screen for about 10 minutes.\n5. Hillary Clinton's email scandal has been a constant source of drama for the former secretary of state since news broke in March that she used a personal email and private server during her time in office. Even her opponent is sick of hearing about it.\n6. Do #BlackLivesMatter or do all lives matter? Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley relayed his point best.\n7. Just say it, Hillary: You're all OLD.\n8. While Sanders called for revolution and the \"largest voter turnout\" in the world, Webb was there to burst his idealistic bubble.\n9. The most boring conversation about weed we have ever heard. Clinton wouldn't take a position on pot legalization but touted her support of medical marijuana.\n10. What enemy is Clinton most proud of making? We saw this one coming.\nTAGS: 2016 presidential election politics", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe66tw%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=The%20First%202016%20Democratic%20Presidential%20Debate%2C%20Explained%20in%2010%20Quotes", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe66tw%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/03/411327420/5-things-you-should-know-about-lincoln-chafee", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe66tw%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe66tw%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe66tw%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=The%20First%202016%20Democratic%20Presidential%20Debate%2C%20Explained%20in%2010%20Quotes&summary=%27The%20American%20people%20are%20sick%20are%20tired%20of%20hearing%20about%20your%20damn%20emails%2C%27%20Bernie%20Sanders%20said%2C%20standing%20up%20for%20opponent%20Hillary%20Clinton.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe66tw%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=The%20First%202016%20Democratic%20Presidential%20Debate%2C%20Explained%20in%2010%20Quotes"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:23:20.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
