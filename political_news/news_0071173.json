Trump at a news conference in New York City last month. Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times After months of name-calling, Jeb Bush and Donald J. Trump have finally found a name that they can agree on: the Washington Redskins. Last week, Mr. Bush weighed in on the long-running debate about whether the football team’s name should be changed out of respect for Native Americans. Speaking on SiriusXM’s POTUS channel, Mr. Bush said the Redskins should be left alone, saying “I don’t find it offensive.” Native American groups were angered, and Democrats called it another example of Mr. Bush’s insensitivity. But in this case, Mr. Trump says he thinks that Mr. Bush is right. “Honestly, I don’t think they should change the name, unless the owner wanted to,” Mr. Trump said in an interview. Mr. Trump. who has made bluntness a hallmark of his presidential bid, said that the Redskins moniker was yet another issue of unnecessary political correctness.
