Total Views Kejriwal expresses concern, blasts PM, LG Two minor girls were reportedly gangraped in Delhi on Friday, a week after the horrific rape of a four-year-old girl in the capital. Both girls were admitted to hospital with severe injuries. In the first case, a two-and-a-half-year-old girl was allegedly raped by two men who abducted her from outside her home in west Delhi's Nihal Vihar area. No one has been arrested in this case so far. In the second incident, a five-year-old girl was allegedly raped by three men in east Delhi's Anand Vihar area when alone at home. All three accused in this case have been arrested. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal expressed concern about the \"repeated rape of minors\" in the city and asked what Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung are doing about it. SC strikes down judicial appointments act The National Judicial Advisory Committee Act, which aimed to give the government a role in appointing judges, was struck down as unconstitutional by a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Friday. The collegium system, in which a few judges make the appointments, was reinstated. However, two of the five judges noted that the collegium system for picking judges lacks transparency , accountability and objectivity. Justices J Chelameshwar and Joseph Kurien said the system needs to be overhauled as candidates were often excluded or denied opportunities “for subjective reasons”. CBI seizes Rs 20 crore in Rail Neer scam The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday unearthed a major scam in the supply of packaged drinking water to passengers of the Indian Railways. The investigative agency seized Rs 20 crore in cash from private caterers, who in collusion with railway officials were duping passengers by supplying cheap packaged drinking water instead of the mandatory \"Rail Neer\" at the same cost, thereby making huge profits. A case has been registered against two senior railway officials and seven private companies under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The CBI said the total amount of loss to the exchequer is yet to be calculated. RTI replies should be timely, transparent: Modi Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that right to question the government is the foundation of democracy. Modi added that more openness in governance will help citizens and there is no need for secrecy in this day and age. “RTI replies should be timely, transparency and trouble-free,” he told his ministers. The Congress, however, accused Modi of having double standards, saying the prime minister had turned away his wife Jashodaben's RTI query on her security cover. Maggi clears court-mandated tests All samples of Nestle’s Maggi noodles have passed tests ordered by the Bombay High Court, reported PTI on Friday.

The court had said Nestle India could re-launch the product if the results were clean. Maggi noodles had been banned by the FSSAI and the Maharashtra Food and Drug Authority for containing excessive lead.
