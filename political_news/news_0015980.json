Gerald Ford, (R-Mich.), the minority leader, to his hideaway office at the Executive Office Building. He told him that Vice President Spiro Agnew had evidently received illegal payments in his White House office. By the time Ford had returned to the House chamber, the word was out: “Agnew has resigned.”\nThe next day, Nixon met at the White House with Ford and Sen. Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the Republican leader, to discuss filling the vacancy under the recently ratified 25th Amendment. He asked them to have each of their GOP colleagues send him their top three choices for the office.\nNixon wanted to appoint John Connally, the treasury secretary. But after meeting with the Democratic congressional leadership he concluded that Connally would have a hard time being confirmed. At Camp David, Nixon prepared an announcement speech with four endings — one each for Nelson Rockefeller, Ronald Reagan, Connally and Ford.\nIn reviewing the suggestions of various party leaders, Nixon found that Rockefeller and Reagan were tied, Connally was third and Ford last. However, among members of Congress, including such Democrats as Sen. Mike Mansfield of Montana, the majority leader, and House Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma, Ford came in first.\n“They were the ones who would have to approve the man I nominated,” Nixon noted. As Albert later asserted, “We gave Nixon no choice but Ford.”\nWith a deal in the works, Ford ruminated on the turns of political fortune. “Life plays some funny tricks on people,” he said. “Here I have been trying . . . for 25 years to become speaker of the House. Suddenly, I am a candidate for president of the Senate, where I could hardly ever vote, and where I will never get a chance to speak.”\nSOURCE: WWW.SENATE.GOV\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:41:10.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
