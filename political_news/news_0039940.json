Koch met Clinton at a New York gala at the Central Park Zoo. What happened next is now a topic of dispute.\nStory Continued Below\n“Hillary was her gracious self; Koch, not so much,” wrote Clinton antagonist-turned-enforcer David Brock in a recently released book called “Killing the Messenger; The Right-Wing Plot to Derail Hillary and Hijack Your Government.”\nBrock wrote that Koch, the billionaire who helms a network expected to spend hundreds of millions of dollars attacking Clinton's presidential campaign and those of other Democratic candidates, \" expressed admiration for (Clinton’s) service as secretary of state.” But, in Brock’s brief account, Koch pivots quickly from small talk, explaining gruffly, “I’m going to spend a lot of money to defeat you” before “turning on his heels and vanishing into the crowd.”\nOn Thursday, the gala's host remembered a much friendlier conversation.\n“Mr. Koch walked over to the Clinton table after the remarks and graciously congratulated Secretary Clinton on her award and thanked her for her service as secretary of state,\" said Cristian Samper, president and CEO of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which hosted the gala honoring Clinton for her family foundation’s commitment to saving elephants and other wildlife. The gala also drew appearances from her daughter, Chelsea, and her husband, former president Bill Clinton.\nDavid Koch, a leading benefactor to New York’s medical and cultural institutions, attended as a guest, according to Samper, who described Koch in a statement provided to POLITICO and other media as “a supporter helping to raise awareness about and to end the crisis facing elephants due to the ivory trade.”\nSamper recalled that Chelsea Clinton, who spearheaded the Clinton Foundation’s fight against the ivory trade and spoke briefly at the gala, piped up, mentioning that she served on a nonprofit hospital board with Julia Koch, David Koch's wife. “The conversation turned to Mr. Koch's philanthropy and support for medical research and education,” Samper said. “There was no conversation about politics, and I never heard him make any comments about campaigns.”\nBrock did not comment on Samper's differing account, and spokespeople for Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation did not respond to questions about the encounter.\nThe Wildlife Conservation Society has worked with the Clinton Foundation on its efforts to save Africa’s elephants and is listed as a foundation donor of $25,000 to $50,000.\nThe Clintons routinely requested that other nonprofit groups donate to the $2-billion Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation to secure speaking appearances from members of the former first family.\nBut spokespeople for the Wildlife Conservation Society did not respond to questions about whether it donated to the foundation in exchange for Hillary Clinton’s gala appearance. They also did not respond to questions about whether David Koch has donated to Wildlife Conservation Society.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.wcs.org/press/press-releases/wcs-gala-2014.aspx", "http://freebeacon.com/politics/charity-prez-david-brock-mischaracterized-gala-encounter-between-clinton-and-koch/"], "published": "2015-10-01T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:30:34.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
