The Priorities USA web ad , titled \"Swipe Right for Hillary,\" will go up the day of the first Democratic debate and will position Clinton, the party's front-runner, against Republicans, not the Democrats she will square off with in Las Vegas. The ad shows Republican candidates Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson making comments about women's health and abortion laws. \"Although, I am not sure we need a half a billion dollars for women's health issues,\" Bush says, a comment that earned him considerable scorn from Democrats when he said it in August. A finger then comes on screen and swipes left, pushing Bush off screen. The format is used by Tinder, a popular dating app that lets men and women swipe left to reject someone and right to accept them.

The finger then returns on screen to swipe right for Clinton. The five figure ad buy will run in Nevada and nationally and will be targeted to women voters. \"In 2016 Nevadans will have a clear choice between a Republican candidate obsessed with taking away women's healthcare decisions and a committed advocate for their best interests in Hillary Clinton,\" said Justin Barasky, Communications Director at Priorities USA. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> From Our Partners", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:50:04.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
