We talked for half an hour. He was rather engaging in that one-on-one setting, much lighter than most people saw in the debates. We talked about the Memphis-Ole Miss game, about that campaign he just wrapped up, and about the city’s financial picture. (The latter, for quite some time.)\nListen there, or read some excerpts here .\nStrickland, in answering questions about his campaign, alluded to one of the big remaining questions we have from it. Namely: What were the racial voting splits? We won’t know that until we get more data from the Shelby County Election Commission, such as the full turnout report and the precinct-by-precinct report.\nAnd even then, we won’t know , we’ll just have a very educated guess.\nStrickland said his internal goal through the campaign was not just to get more white vote than A C Wharton , but to get more black vote, too. (Paging Capt. Obvious!) “I don’t know if it happened, it may not have,” he said, “but we were doggone close.”\nA question: Would you listen to regular podcast interviews like that with local newsmakers?\nMeanwhile, at the county building: The County Commission met Monday and batted around the idea of having its own attorney . That did not come to pass as expected, but the commission did change the threshold contracts must meet to require commission approval, from $100,000 to $50,000.\nAs our Linda A. Moore has reported before, there’s context here: The commission is engaged in a peculiar quarrel with second-term Republican Mayor Mark Luttrell , and these are two of the fronts. First Word, buried for a summer in the city government, may have to go across the street soon and shine some more light on this.\nAt Smart City Memphis, some more perspective on this , including this excerpt:\n“In other words, these are strange days in Shelby County Government, where its legislative body was only a decade ago pointed to as a model for decorum and effectiveness. It’s now deteriorating so much that Memphis City Council is held in higher esteem (and it’s traditionally had the lowest approval rating in our community).”\nDebate time: CNN’s two-hour Democratic presidential debate is tonight at 8 p.m., and Politico presents everything you need to know about it . Steve Steffens has a more comprehensive list of local watch parties .\nAbout the House Freedom Caucus: U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee sheds some light on the House Freedom Caucus , in the news so much these days because of the Speaker of the House turmoil.\nHow’d they do it? I didn’t want this story , which posted a few days ago, to get lost. Jennifer Pignolet , who covers education for us, saw Middle College High School on both the state Reward List and a National Blue Ribbon list, and decided to visit to find out why. It’s a great read.\nThings you should read: Three Shelby County men are among the applicants for the Tennessee Supreme Court’s vacancy, including Election Commission chairman Robert Meyers and Juvenile Court CAO Larry Scroggs . … A fellow congressman wrote an op-ed pushing Marsha Blackburn for House Speaker.\nWhy we're here: InforMemphis' First Word is a politics-first start to your day.
