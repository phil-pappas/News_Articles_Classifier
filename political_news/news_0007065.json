A total of 12 lifeguards have been employed permanently by the City and over 100 trained and accredited lifeguards are in the process of being employed on a seasonal contract basis. These lifeguards will be deployed to the various beaches between 08:00 and 16:30 daily during the upcoming school holidays. Read more below: The City of Cape Town's Sport, Recreation and Amenities Department is employing permanent and seasonal lifeguards in order to improve beach safety over the holiday season. In addition to 12 permanent lifeguards and over 100 seasonal lifeguards, 100 beach monitors will be deployed during the upcoming school holidays. The team of lifeguards and beach monitors will be on duty at the various beaches between 08:00 and 16:30 daily for the duration of the upcoming school holidays. Thereafter, the team will be deployed over weekends until the peak season. 'Our intention in making the shift towards offering a number of lifeguards a City employment contract is two-fold. Firstly, we believe that this structure will mean that we can continue to provide a lifesaving standard of the highest quality, to the utmost of our ability. Secondly, we believe that lifeguards will be provided with better career path opportunities. Additionally, the provision of law enforcement training in the future will improve the ability of lifeguards to access year-round employment, instead of just seasonal employment,' said the City's Mayoral Committee Member for Community Services and Special Projects, Alderman Belinda Walker. An essential requirement for appointment as a beach lifeguard is the possession of a valid Lifeguard Award, as well as experience in Surf Lifesaving. The 100 beach monitors are in addition to the many law enforcement personnel who vigilantly patrol the City's beaches and assist lifeguards in preventing drowning incidents. The beach monitors will be responsible for helping to prevent irresponsible and dangerous behaviour along the coastline. These monitors will patrol the areas of coastline not covered by lifeguard services in order to prevent people from swimming in areas where there are no lifeguards present. The presence of these beach monitors is crucial if the City is to effectively prevent drowning incidents. 'I am confident that the team members employed to ensure the safety of beach-goers are competent and well qualified to provide this essential service. However, we want to emphasise that beach safety does not begin and end with lifeguards. It is a shared responsibility between our beach safety staff and our beach-goers. Many drownings are linked to the consumption of alcohol before swimming or people swimming in dangerous areas not supervised by lifeguards. We urge residents not to allow family members and friends to go into the water if they have consumed alcohol and to report any intoxicated beach-goers to the lifeguard or law enforcement officer on duty. 'While the City does provide lifeguards and law enforcement personnel, this service cannot take the place of a parent or guardian's supervision of children. On peak days, the high number of people visiting our beaches and pools makes it very difficult for lifeguards to keep a watchful eye on all swimmers all of the time. The lifeguards are under constant pressure to keep a keen eye out for anyone in distress. Parents need to be on high alert when their children are playing in or near the ocean, a river or a pool. Children can also get lost on crowded beaches and parents are urged to be particularly vigilant,' added Alderman Walker. The following hotspot beaches will be covered by lifeguard services during the coming spring holidays: Clifton, Camps Bay, Fish Hoek, Muizenberg, Kogel Bay, Strand, Macassar, Monwabisi, Mnandi, Strandfontein and Blue Waters. During the peak summer season, this service will be boosted by accredited members of lifesaving clubs and the National Sea Rescue Institute.
