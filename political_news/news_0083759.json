Increased and new user charges which are little more than stealth taxes, will further compound the transfer of the burden of taxation on to the individual, with the lowest paid the hardest hit.\n– Marina Mauger, NASUWT Jersey Secretary The march starts in Howard Davis Park at 10:30am and ends with a rally at People's Park.\nLast updated Fri 2 Oct 2015 Politics Jersey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:24:52.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
