You can think whatever you want to think, you can think you’re a frog, you can think you’re a cockroach, you can think you’re a cow and you may moo all day long, but the long and the short of it is you’re not, you’re a male. If you’re born with male parts, you’re a male, your sex is male, your gender is male no matter what you think. And this idea that we’re going to give special rights and privileges based on a person’s perverted thinking about whether or not they’re a man or a woman is just absolute nonsense.\nHotze later said that the ordinance will let “perverted men” be “as strange, as weird, as perverted, as deviant as you want to be,” which led him to berate Caitlyn Jenner.\n“You can be like Bruce Jenner and dress up like a woman and get on a stage and talk with a low voice and get an award because you had courage to dress like a woman,” he said. “That’s the most asinine thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I thought to myself when they gave him that award and those people stood up and cheered for them, ‘Have they got rocks in their heads? What’s going on here? Is everything in the world is upside down?’”\nHe added that the Bible predicted that the “fruitcakes” defending Houston ordinance would then criticize people like him as “perverted” and “the ones who don’t think straight.”", "external_links": ["https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/166/692_955x533_731518969_555x309.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMrqTrt6rSw", "http://www.rightwingwatch.org/category/people/steve-hotze"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:44:28.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
