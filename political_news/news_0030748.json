A group of Marshall residents has filed a lawsuit because their new mayor didn’t quit his day job. \nThe group of residents in the Searcy County community of about 1,300 said Kevin Elliott should have given up his $36,000-a-year job as head of the city’s water department when he took office in January. That’s according to a lawsuit filed in Searcy County Circuit Court by attorney Jerry Patterson of Marshall. \nInstead, Elliott, “caused a resolution to be prepared and presented” to the city council that made it appear that the council hired him to be chief of the water department, the lawsuit said. \nThe now-controversial resolution was approved in January. \nElliott is paid $15,000 as mayor. \nNow Elliott is “in the unique position of being his own employee as well as his supervising officer,” the lawsuit said. \nNot only is the arrangement a conflict of interest, but it is illegal and should be voided, the plaintiffs argue. \nAnd the salary that Elliott has continued to receive for working at the water department “is an illegal exaction of public funds” that should be returned to the city, the lawsuit said. \nThe plaintiffs also are seeking other unspecified amounts for damages, including court costs and attorney’s fees. \nElliot wasn’t available for comment on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:06:28.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
