Appearing on the Ellen show has become a way for politicians to connect more with voters; Hillary Clinton appeared on the show last month and both Barack Obama and Bill Clinton have both gabbed with the talk show host.\nThe Vermont socialist who is usually very protective about his private life answered a slew of questions that he was forced to answer correctly, as DeGeneres donated $1,000 to breast cancer research for every truthful answer.\nSanders answered that as kid he wanted to be a social worker, he has been handcuffed by police (but only one time during a protest), he prefers boxers to briefs, and if he were to name a flavor of Ben & Jerry's it would be called \"Bern Baby Bern.\"\n  Bush and Rubio squabble while Trump runs away with it After Bush announced his fundraising total, his campaign started a spat with Rubio over who did better.\nBy Byron York • 10/16/15 6:19 AM Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ But the appearance wasn't all laughs. Sanders talked about the problems of \"millionaires and billionaires\" with \"tremendous greed\" who make it difficult for Americans to get ahead. The pair also discussed his debate performance as well as Sanders' appeal as a fringe candidate who doesn't play by the usual political rules.\nSanders told the crowd, \"I have been in many, many political campaigns in my life and I have never run a negative political campaign ad in my entire life and I've been attacked a whole lot.\"\nPresidential candidate @BernieSanders \nTop Story RNC chair: Republicans are 'cooked' if defeated in 2016 The Republican Party has become a \"a midterm party\" that struggles with the presidential elections.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/16/15 12:01 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:33:25.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
