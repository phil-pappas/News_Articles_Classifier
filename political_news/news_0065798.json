Before this decision, nursing and medical students were given the option of receiving clinical training on comprehensive women's health care services at Planned Parenthood clinics.\nAlthough the university does not attribute its decision as a result of political pressure, the move followed the Missouri's Senate Interim Committee on the Sanctity of Life's investigation of the St. Louis Planned Parenthood affiliate this summer, under the leadership of Missouri Republican Sen. Kurt Schaefer. Since then, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster said in a report that he finds no evidence of the facility's wrongdoing, but Schaefer has said the report was \"incomplete\" and his investigation would continue.\n Mary Jenkins, a spokesperson for the University of Missouri Health System, wrote in an email to the Columbia Missourian that one medical resident shadowed a nurse practitioner at the Planned Parenthood in Columbia back in 2010, but no medical students had worked there since that year. And she confirmed that the College of Human and Environmental Sciences and Planned Parenthood still have an active contract for social work students interested in completing fieldwork in policy-making.\n And the cancellations may not last long. Teresa Snow, a spokesperson for MU Health Care, a part of University of Missouri Health System, confirmed with Cosmopolitan.com that, since the announcement of the cancellations earlier this year, the Sinclair School of Nursing has formed one new site agreement with a Planned Parenthood clinic in Independence, Missouri, and is negotiating two more in Columbia, Missouri.\nStill, with the constant politicized pressure surrounding women's health care, many students are concerned about what their education will look like without the Planned Parenthood option. Cosmopolitan.com talked with six students about these recent changes.\nEmma Frank, 26, second-year medical student \"I had looked forward to the possibility that I could reach out to the community as a medical student and gain unique experiences. I have always supported Planned Parenthood, and I see it as a place where patients can receive affordable, compassionate, and quality health care. Not only would experience at Planned Parenthood allow me to learn unique approaches to health care, I would be able to practice developing relationships with a certain population of patients who are seeking help during the times they are most vulnerable. It is disappointing that our learning opportunities can be limited by political pressure. Regardless of the feelings I have about Planned Parenthood specifically, I strongly believe our learning opportunities should extend to the greater community and not be limited by political pressure.\"\nMelanie, 26, second-year medical student \"From the schools that I looked at, [MU] has a very progressive, patient-centered curriculum. We are learning how to talk to patients from day one, and they put us in intentionally uncomfortable situations just so that from the very beginning, as future physicians, we're learning about the population of people that we're going to be encountering. I wasn't expecting something like this, considering that curriculum and knowing that it's a publicly funded education. Of course I was forgetting that the public funding was coming from the state of Missouri that can sometimes be a little, let's say, not progressive about health care thinking.\n\"At some point in my career, no matter if I'm a dermatologist or a pediatrician, no matter what I do, I'm going to have a patient that has had an abortion. And understanding from the standpoint of being there and actually seeing what goes on is so crucial for me to be able to provide that care. Even if I never perform an abortion, understanding how that process works is huge, because I'm going take care of women in my life, no matter what I do. The tradition of training a physician is all about exposure; it's all about being able to have a little bit of knowledge about all the different areas so that when you specialize and you're dealing with a specific patient, you have an understanding of everything that they've gone through in their health up until that point. Considering the number of women in this country that do have abortions, it's incredibly negligent to think that we don't need that knowledge and we don't need that understanding.\"\nEvan Clark, 23, second-year medical student \"If you're a guy and you say, 'I want to do ob-gyn,' some people are like, 'Oh, that's creepy; why would you want to do that?' But if you're interested in that as a physician, it's because you want to provide that type of health care. Just from a medical standpoint and also socially, women face many more issues than guys have to worry about, and those health concerns often get left behind. They also have a bunch of old white guys telling them what they can and cannot get. I think there's a wide agreement on that across medical students. I have conservative friends; we disagree on many things, but we agree that women's health care and health care for everyone should be our upmost priority. Planned Parenthood recognizes that priority, and it's important medical students have the option to study somewhere that puts women first.\"\nAmanda Gingrich, 20, nursing student, first clinical semester \"I don't think that many understand how these actions affect the education of students, specifically nursing students. Many overlook the fact that Planned Parenthood provides so many aspects of teaching to students including cancer screening, family planning, and information about birth control implants such as IUDs. One of the things we hear about every day in our classes and clinicals is how to do preventative medicine and screenings to look for signs of a problem before they arise. We also really focus on aspects of patient education so that patients can better understand the prevention or their disease. From my knowledge of Planned Parenthood, it is especially unique because it provides care and wellness education to those who would maybe not be able to afford these services on their own. The fact that precancerous screenings, birth control, and family planning can be offered to those who aren't as financially stable as some is incredible and does so much good.\"\nDina van der Zalm, 28, third-year masters of social work/masters of public health student \"The activist part of me is angered that, once again, predominately older white men are telling me what I cannot do. This time, it is with my education and mind, but it is as infuriating as telling me I need to think three days before being able to make decisions about my body and access an abortion. If I were a med student prepped to begin a placement in January, I would now need to scramble to find where the university would approve me doing my internship.\n\"As a student, I am shocked at how quickly Mizzou caved to political pressure, altering the course for students who came here planning to work with Planned Parenthood and now have to find something else to do. Keep in mind that there are active students who started school while these contracts were in place — those students, more than any of us — have certainly been cheated. We are setting up cohorts of young professionals to be less competitive in their fields and unprepared for real-world experiences that they could have gained through a placement at Planned Parenthood. Every health professional will encounter women, and given how many women will get an abortion at some point in their lives, being able to offer compassionate, informed, comprehensive care is a must.\"\nFollow Hilary on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mizzou-planned-parenthood_55fad485e4b00310edf5f7c3", "http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/local/state-investigation-focuses-on-decades-old-relationship-between-mu-planned/article_de825b18-5bd9-11e5-b5d3-8b294f78e0ba.html", "https://www.ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/2015/plannedparenthood09-15.pdf?sfvrsn=2", "https://twitter.com/Hilary_Weaver", "http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/koster-no-evidence-of-planned-parenthood-wrongdoing-in-missouri/article_e150799b-0371-55de-98b0-ac613a83ec75.html"], "published": "2015-10-27T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:16:34.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
