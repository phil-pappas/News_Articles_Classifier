Happily, the newness of this moon allows us to rectify mistakes, especially since it's the first full week after Mercury in retrograde made boondoggles of commerce, communication, and travel. The new moon tonight is a cosmic reset button that will empower you to repair and restore what’s messed up, messy, and missing. Add harmony and compassion, if only a little bit and in your own way, right now.\nThe planetary weather report: Use these guidelines to unlock the stars, not to be locked down by them.\nMercury in retrograde is over, but its aftermath can linger. It’s like how we don't (or is it can't?) turn away from the scene of a grisly accident on the street. Watch the impulse to be cruel and let people flail or wallow in their own messes. You may not be inclined to let a colleague locate a missing file or correct a wayward cell in MS Excel if she is being pissy about it. But of course, you should. We're all in the same boat, one way or another, and with Mercury in Libra, the scales of justice (and mercy) could be out of your favor or against you at a moment's notice. So do it for yourself, if nothing else.\nThe tense, high-wire walk between loving Venus and dreamy Neptune on Friday will help with your ability to be compassionate. Or, at least, allow you to find the right cocktail to help you drink some of your ruthlessness away. (This won’t help if you’re a mean drunk. If that’s the case, drink near somewhere you can sleep it off comfortably.) Read on for your individual Sky Code.\nLibra (September 22 to October 21)\nThis week's new moon is your last one until next year, so this time of renewal and reset is specially made for you. The super “blood moon” eclipse from a few weeks ago clarified a lot of what hasn’t been working in your life, so it is time to take the next step. Mercury is now direct in Libra, which will help you figure out exactly who and what just ain’t part of your future. It's time to pinpoint one action step you can take to move on with a new phase of your life. Don’t attempt to move too fast, though. There’s still a lot to soak in, and it all doesn’t have to be figured out this week.\nScorpio (October 22 to November 21)\nYou could be uncharacteristically indecisive this week, perhaps even changing your mind on things that seemed sure deals last week. It's not a time to push through with bravado or bullshit, though. Your vulnerability and silence is what’s going to see you through. Lively Venus, take-charge Mars, and jolly Jupiter are rounded up in the sector of your chart that deals with friends and groups, so you'll have lots of opportunities for fun, but make time to spend time alone with your own thoughts — or not thinking at all — this coming weekend. Embracing your feelings will be the first step toward finding your reset button.\nSagittarius (November 22 to December 21)\nYou can charm, champion, or chump someone, especially with your knowledge and insight, and it's lovely that the cosmos have given you these skills. No one can invisibly guide important relationships like a Sag. However, choose your approach wisely. Charm helps someone feel good in the moment and you get your way, but what if you need to build long-term trust with that person? Chumping someone is good for a stress-relieving laugh, but, again, it’s not going to help you in the long term. Championing is a bigger commitment, and should be taken up with care, as championing someone reflects on you. Don’t do it because you feel you have no choice, but because it’s the best choice.\nCapricorn (December 22 to January 20)\nThis new moon influences the career, advancement, and status area of your chart, and your creative juices are flowing now because of the abundance of planets in Virgo. There are both short- and long-term strategies you need to execute now in order to move up the ladders and mountains you want to climb. The short-term goals should be one or a few action steps you can see happen within the next two weeks, just before the next true full moon. Keep those simple and achievable, and save the lion’s share of your gust and energy for your long-term creative projects. Most important, weed out ideas that are clogging your progress.\nAquarius (January 21 to February 18)\nLet's be honest, Aquarius: You are behind the eight ball with work, and the only way you’re going to catch up is by wisely investing time, energy, or money to do it. And remember, there are no shortcuts. The first choice is likely not the best or only one. Your inclination may be to spend a lot of money in order to get on point quickly, but resist. The tense standoff between money-conscious Venus and dreamy Neptune shows that you should research your options before you spend a lot of dough.\nPisces (February 19 to March 20)\nThis week, stay the course. With the dynamic tension between accommodating Venus and pie-in-the-sky Neptune, you risk getting suckered into either/or scenarios or making useless ultimatums. Partners, clients, and customers might have you believe that one can only be practical or visionary, not both. You know that's not true, so employ your vision and heart to make those distant dreams or wishes a reality. If there’s a will, then believe there’s a way — and it may be a surprising one.\nAries (March 21 to April 19)\nWith communications master Mercury moving forward in the part of your chart that deals with relationships and one-on-one dynamics, you now have a chance of talking yourself out of recent foul-ups or, I'm sorry to say, some new ones that could happen this week. You might be tempted to think that you can bulldoze your way out of any hitches, but softhearted Venus’s tug-of-war with intuitive Neptune says that you’ll have to be open and gentle with yourself and others. And take the high road: Don’t compromise your own peace of mind or integrity to make yourself look great or “right” at someone else’s expense.\nTaurus (April 20 to May 21)\nYou slacked off during this Mercury retrograde, perhaps in the interest of something that seemed important at the time, like efficiency, pleasing someone else, comfort, or plain ol' laziness. Now that fastidious Mercury has stopped backsliding, you can, too — so it's time to return to the routine of a tidy, orderly desk, a regular workout regimen, or whatever helps you be at your best. Energizing Mars teaming up with exuberant Jupiter on Saturday can help with that. However, with beautiful Venus striving to luxuriate in the soothing waters of Neptune, make sure to find a little time to chillax this weekend.\nGemini (May 21 to June 20)\nAs the go-to planet for your sign, Mercury moving forward in Libra has extra significance for you, especially as it concerns your \"brain children\" (ideas) or your actual children (if you've got some). With affectionate Venus in nitpicky Virgo, it might be tempting to pick out what’s wrong, and to correct as a way to show love. But look for things you can say to help either the fruit of your womb or your mind’s loom feel supported and efficient, not lacking or wayward. Rather than pick apart a report for its grammar and syntax, suggest changes to improve its flow and impact. Use your penchant for thinking up ideas at a gallon-a-minute to come up with ways to build, not tear down.\nCancer (June 21 to July 21)\nBetween the super “blood moon” eclipse a few weeks ago and the recent Mercury retrograde that ended last week, you’ve probably had a topsy-turvy few weeks, Cancer. Use the new moon to ground and center yourself. Try to limit the drama to streams of other people’s problems delivered one episode at a time to you, on your couch, in your pajamas and slippers. If reality intrudes, focus only on doing what must be done. Don’t overdo things in the name of being likable or nice — put yourself and your comfort first.\nLeo (July 22 to August 21)\nThink twice before you splurge on anything this week, especially if you feel like you deserve it. Of course you deserve it, but must you deserve it now?! The law of attraction works powerfully through shapely Venus, but she’s looking at herself (and your finances) through elusive Neptune’s distorted mirror. You’d do better to check over your bills and look out for overcharges or perhaps a payment that’s slipped your mind. That doesn’t mean you don’t deserve any sweetness or goodness in your life, but don’t go big with it.\nVirgo (August 22 to September 21)\nTap deep to keep the saintly virtues of patience and mercy in flow throughout the week, because supplies could run out. You may be dealing with others who seem to have just discovered they have opposable thumbs and can walk upright. Breathe. Mercury’s forward motion in peace-making Libra is reminding you that peace of mind is as important as straightening up the broken pieces. Remember that history is on the side of the efficient and adaptable (i.e., you).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:16:22.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
