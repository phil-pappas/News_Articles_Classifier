Why is it that every opportunity we get, we ask someone else to give us money to fund our development projects? Question: why did President Mahama ask the World Bank President Kim to fund a SADA poverty reduction project given all the controversies surrounding SADA and recent allegations of waste of public funds? \nWith all the God-given resources we are blessed with, why are we where we are - a nation ridden with debt, disgraced by corruption in high places and held down by illiteracy and poverty? \nEntrepreneurial, incorruptible leadership is needed. Or else, we get perpetually caught in the Matthew Effect where the resources we have are continuously taken away from us. \n◄ Matthew 25:29 ► \n\"For whoever has will be given more, and they will have abundance.
