The take on Utley's takeout", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "By MIKE FITZPATRICK, AP Baseball Writer\nNEW YORK (AP) — This much is certain: Anyone who bemoans that baseball's gone soft never covered second base with Chase Utley bearing down on a potential double play.\nWhat's not so clear is whether Utley's takeout slide Saturday night, the one that broke the right leg of New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada and created all this postseason clatter, was a dirty play.\n\"It's hard baseball, man,\" said closer Kenley Jansen, Utley's teammate on the Los Angeles Dodgers. \"The game has started to become too sensitive.\"\nOf course, that's not how the seething Mets viewed it after Tejada was carted off in an air cast.\n\"Before he could get the ball out of the glove, he's getting tackled,\" infielder Kelly Johnson said.\n\"Slide would be generous,\" snarled an irritated Daniel Murphy.\nUmpires on the field ruled it a legal play. But after reviewing it \"from all conceivable angles,\" Major League Baseball executive Joe Torre called it an illegal slide and suspended Utley for two playoff games Sunday night.\nThe infielder plans to appeal, according to his agent, which could keep Utley eligible to play this week.\nThe Mets released a statement saying they \"completely support the decision\" and \"feel this was the appropriate course of action.\"\nNo matter where your allegiance might lie, it was a flash-point play that immediately dropped jaws and grabbed attention for several reasons.\nFirst, runners rarely go in that hard at second base these days, although Utley long ago earned a notable reputation for it.\nSecond, it led to a serious injury.\nAnd third, it was the turning point in a playoff game that millions were watching.\nSo there's no doubt, Utley flipping Tejada at Dodger Stadium will become this generation's reference point for famous takeout slides — a flashback to a bygone era when middle infielders were wiped out with such force more frequently.\nThink of Pete Rose barreling into Bud Harrelson, sparking a brawl between the Reds and Mets in the 1973 NL Championship Series. Or Hal McRae upending Willie Randolph during the 1977 Royals-Yankees ALCS.\nAnd this one had all the qualities of a sports injury that won't soon be forgotten — like Rose running over Ray Fosse at home plate, or Lawrence Taylor snapping Joe Theismann's leg on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nThus, the debate raged on, with current and former players from all around the majors weighing in on social media and television.\n\"I hate the fact that people keep saying he plays the game hard. Everybody on the field plays the game hard,\" said ESPN analyst Alex Cora, a middle infielder during his playing days. \"There's a way you should play the game, and this is not the way.\n\"There's no way you can do that,\" he added. \"If Chase Utley doesn't retire and he's playing next year, he's going to get drilled. He's going to get one in the ribs.\"\nBy now, most everyone with any interest has seen a replay of the violent collision that swung Game 2 of the NL Division Series in Los Angeles' favor.\nWith the Dodgers trailing by a run in the seventh inning, Utley slammed into Tejada at second base to make sure the Mets could not complete a double play that would have kept them ahead. Utley went in high and hard, crashing into Tejada's legs and flipping the shortstop head over heels.\nThe tying run scored, Tejada was wheeled off with a fractured fibula and the Dodgers rallied for three more runs in the inning, going on to a 5-2 victory that evened the best-of-five series at one apiece.\n\"I feel terrible that he was injured. I had no intent to hurt him whatsoever,\" said Utley, an All-Star second baseman who knows firsthand the perils of turning two. \"You have to try and break up the double play. That's winning baseball.\"\nBut did it cross the line?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:36:03.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
