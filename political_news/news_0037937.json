Share article \n“In the meantime I would urge landlords with HMOs in these areas to apply for a HMO licence” \nMore details on the scheme can be found on at southampton.gov.uk.

If so please provide details of who's responsible for this so the occupants can raise their concerns....I'm sure SCC would like to lead by example on this front?? Some of their accommodation wouldn't suffice for a kennel! In fact many of the private HMO properties would be a far better option than SCC's alternative. Please can some of Political figures that constantly canvass and plague our letter boxes stop going on about HMO's and start to focus on SCC itself. Including their planning department that is ruining our city with ugly oversized and overcrowded student accommodation. Starting with the outrageous proposal of more student battery blocks on the old bus depot site in Portswood! Where residents were promised housing if the sainsbury store was agreed to! Students don't want to live in BATTERY STYLE ACCOMODATION! What's SCC doing about their inadequate accommodation? Is anyone inspecting their stock of housing?
