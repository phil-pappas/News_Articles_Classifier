Even though it's important to eliminate unnecessary care, it does nothing to lower the cost of producing the care that's needed. After the waste is removed, it reverts back to the same phenomenon.\nRELATED\nAre Doctors Exposing Heart Patients to Unnecessary Cardiac Procedures?\nWhen Henry Ford shortened assembly time from 12 hours to 93 minutes, boosting productivity and producing reliable, less-expensive cars, not only did he create a product that was seen as cost effective, but he also revolutionized the way people live. Today, the way the U.S. health care industry operates flies in the face of the principles Ford established to boost productivity. In fact, the way health care operates today is like Ford trying to persuade the American public to make fewer, more expensive cars – with extras that people really don't need – rather than making more vehicles at a lower cost. The issue isn't that care is too expensive, but that people aren't getting their money's worth. Clearly the time has come for health care to focus on increasing productivity to lower the cost of producing units of care.\nLike education, health care is a labor-based industry that depends on experts to deliver care. It's always been based on a simple formula: One doctor must see one patient to get a desired outcome. This formula is why professional labor is the single-most-expensive component of care . As a result, health expenditures will increase faster than GDP growth because wages will rise at the same rate. At the same time, demand will grow as a result of scientific discovery and an aging population. The only way to change that trajectory is to reduce our reliance on expert labor.\nReversing the cost trend will depend on finding ways to deliver care with fewer professional resources. This means developing operating models that do three things: move work from more-expensive to less-expensive labor, shift tasks back to the patient and move work to digital technologies, such as virtual health, either as an enabler or delivery mechanism.\n[ SPECIAL REPORT: Hospital of Tomorrow ]\nVarious health care studies consistently show that individuals expect personalized care with compassion; technical perfection is expected but not enough. People want care on their own terms and an experience consistent with other aspects of their lives. They expect care to be simple, transparent, coordinated, personalized, secure and seamless—and these expectations don't stop at the doctor's office door.\nHow Virtual Health Can Help\nAs health care systems around the globe face the common challenge of balancing capacity and demand, virtual health solutions can help improve the care of both under-served patients and those already receiving sufficient care. In an American Hospital Association survey, 76 percent of consumers ranked access to care ahead of the need for human contact with providers. The take-away is that well-executed virtual care can complement in-person interactions and improve both physician capacity and the patient experience.\nMuch of a physician's time during a typical in-person office visit is spent gathering and reviewing patient information, considering treatment options and interacting with the patient. Often, a patient shares information with a doctor in bits and pieces at different points of the exam, increasing the likelihood of misinterpretation on both ends.\nWhat if part of a \"typical\" doctor's visit could happen before the actual office visit? Common consumer devices, such as sensors and digital scales, could capture and send a patient's biometric information to a clinician beforehand. Through a secure portal, a computer-generated medical assistant would guide a patient through standard intake questions, such as family medical history, and ask what issues or concerns need to be addressed during the visit. Then, using a diagnostic engine to analyze the combined data, clinical options would be suggested to the doctor prior to the appointment.", "external_links": ["http://www.aha.org/"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:58:36.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
