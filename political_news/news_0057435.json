Tax preparers also agreed to roll out stricter login requirements to better protect taxpayer data.\nThe new safeguards mark the latest effort in a new information-sharing strategy among the IRS, state tax authorities and the private tax preparation industry to halt a surge in tax refund fraud. So far, 34 states and 20 tax preparation companies have signed on, but more are expected to enroll later.\n“We have never had this level of cooperation or sharing,” IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said at a briefing Tuesday. “We will collect [information] in real time, and we will pull it together and share it back out so everyone has access to that information.”\n[ IRS says breach of taxpayer data far worse than it first thought ] \nIdentity theft has been a major theme for the agency this year following a spike in suspicious tax filings and an attack from hackers who stole personal information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers. The IRS is also coping with a surge in phone related scams from fraudsters pretending to be from the agency to intimidate taxpayers into making payments or giving up personal information.\n[ Why criminals are after your tax returns and what you can do about it ] \nKoskinen said the new safeguards will be as “non-burdensome as possible” for tax preparers and require “relatively incremental steps” for taxpayers.\n“Filing season is going to be much more secure than in the past,” he said.\n[ IRS has not done everything it can to protect its computer networks from hackers, watchdog says ] \nTax authorities and software providers have come up with a list of 20 data points about tax returns that could be shared to help the IRS and state tax agencies verify tax returns and spot fraud.\nWhile declining to go into specifics, Koskinen said the kind of information that would be shared includes whether a return was submitted from a location or device where multiple tax returns were filed. The groups will also look at how long it takes to file and prepare tax forms to spot returns that may have been mechanically generated, he said.\nTax preparation firms agreed to stricter login and validation requirements that can cut down on incidents of criminals taking over taxpayers’ accounts to steal personal information. For instance, software companies agreed to add three security questions and to require more secure passwords that are at least eight characters long, including upper case and lower case letters, numbers and special characters.\n[ Is the IRS doing enough to protect taxpayer data? ]\nSoftware companies agreeing to the changes will also let customers know when a second tax return has been filed using their Social Security number. They’ll tell customers if a change has been made to their account, to make it easier for them to know if a fraudster has accessed their account.\nBut the new efforts won’t address one issue that came up earlier this year: What should tax software providers do when fraudsters use their programs to file phony returns? Intuit, the maker of the most popular tax filing program TurboTax, previously shared information about suspicious returns with the IRS but with a time lag that security experts said would have made it difficult for the agency to catch the fraud before the refunds were paid out.\nNow, companies will share that information on a weekly basis, if not sooner, allowing the IRS to be more nimble in adjusting its fraud filters. But it will still fall on the IRS and state tax authorities to accept or reject a return. Tax preparation companies are not required to shut down accounts even if it appears that they’re used primarily for filing fraudulent tax returns.\nRead more: \nWho’s to blame when fraudsters use TurboTax to steal refunds?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:35:14.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
