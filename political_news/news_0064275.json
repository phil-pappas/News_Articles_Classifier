We should write those rules, opening new markets to American products while setting high standards for protecting workers and preserving our environment. That's what the agreement reached today in Atlanta will do,\" the president said in a statement.\nThe 12 nations involved in the trade deal finished their work Monday morning after a weekend of marathon negotiating sessions in Atlanta. Congress has passed legislation called Trade Promotion Authority that will allow them to give a thumbs up or thumbs down vote on the deal, but not amend it in any way.\nMr. Obama pledged in his statement that Congress and the American people \"will have months to read every word\" before he signs the deal. But he is in a rare position of having more Republican support than Democratic support among lawmakers.\n\nPlay Video Politics Obama: My Democratic critics on free trade are \"wrong\" President Obama says the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership would boost the U.S. economy, not undermine it. \nDemocratic presidential candidate and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was quick to condemn the deal after it was announced Monday, saying the trade agreement will \"hurt consumers and cost American jobs.\"\n\"This agreement follows failed trade deals with Mexico, China and other low-wage countries that have cost millions of jobs and shuttered tens of thousands of factories across the United States,\" Sanders said. \"In the Senate, I will do all that I can to defeat this agreement. We need trade policies that benefit American workers and consumers, not just the CEOs of large multi-national corporations.\"\nHillary Clinton, who praised TPP when she was Mr. Obama's secretary of state, ultimately snubbed Mr. Obama by saying earlier this year that he should have listened Democratic concerns. Clinton said the president should \"make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible, and if we don't get it, there should be no deal.\"\nClinton has not weighed in since the agreement was completed.\nAnother vocal opponent is Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who has described himself as \"totally against the trade deal\" and suggested the negotiators were incompetent. He has also not weighed in since the agreement was announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:41:55.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
