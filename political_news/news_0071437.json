RUGABER and CALVIN WOODWARD The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nHillary Rodham Clinton offered some revisionist history Tuesday night when insisting she's not a flip-flopper on a trade deal that she heartily promoted as secretary of state but turned against last week as a Democratic presidential candidate. \n\"I did say, I hoped it would be the gold standard'\" of trade agreements, she said of the Trans-Pacific Partnership when asked about her changing positions in the Democratic presidential debate. \nActually, Clinton did not say anything about hope in her many speeches around the world in support of the trade deal. \nOn Nov. 15, 2012, in Adelaide, Australia: \"This TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) sets the gold standard in trade agreements, to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\" \nIn Honolulu, Nov. 10, 2011: \"There is new momentum in our trade agenda with the recent passage of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and our ongoing work on a binding, high-quality Trans-Pacific Partnership.\" \nShe pitched the deal in Vietnam, Washington and beyond without qualification. \nClinton said in the debate that when she looked at the final agreement last week, \"it didn't meet my standards.\" \nThe final agreement, however, dropped or changed some provisions that liberal activist groups — the wing of the party she is assiduously courting at this stage of the campaign — had strongly criticized. \nFor example, the U.S. had pushed for 12 years of legal protection from generic drugs for advanced pharmaceuticals, but the final agreement provides only up to eight years. A provision was also added barring tobacco companies from using the agreement to overturn national anti-smoking laws. \nEDITOR'S NOTE _ An occasional look at political claims that take shortcuts with the facts or don't tell the full story.
