But she said she wouldn't skip an upcoming hearing despite her concerns.\nAppearing at a town hall event on NBC's \"Today\" with Savannah Guthrie, Clinton again expressed contrition for choosing to conduct official business on a private email account and server.\nShe then quickly pivoted to describing the email issue as a partisan witch hunt.\n\"But it's also, as we now know, very clearly the way that the Republicans are trying to bring my — as they admit — poll numbers down,\" Clinton said, alluding to comments by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) last week in an interview with Fox News .\nThe House Select Committee on Benghazi, before which she still plans to testify on Oct. 22, \"is nothing but a partisan exercise,\" Clinton declared.\nAsked whether she would have treated a Republican like Colin Powell or Karl Rove similarly had they conducted their email business in a similar fashion, Clinton forcefully demurred.\n\"I would never have done that. Look at the situation they chose to exploit, to go after me for political reasons: the death of four Americans in Benghazi,\" Clinton said, adding that she knew Ambassador Chris Stevens and asked President Barack Obama to nominate him for the Libya post.\n\"There have been seven investigations, led mostly by Republicans in the Congress, and they were nonpartisan and they reached conclusions that first of all, I and nobody did anything wrong, but there were changes we could make. This committee,\" she said, jabbing her index finger to make a point, \"was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans. I would have never done that. And if I were president, and there were Republicans or Democrats who were thinking about that, I would have done everything to shut it down.\"\nClinton remarked that, despite her objections over its political agenda, she would still appear at the hearing later this month in Washington.\n\"Well, I have to say, that now that they've admitted that it's a political, partisan committee for the sole purpose of going after me, not trying to make our diplomats who serve in dangerous areas safer, that's up to the Congress. If they're going to have it still running, I'll be there,\" she said. \"And I'm looking forward to answering questions about real things when I'm there. And I'm looking forward to having a chance to explain everything we've done, everything I've asked to happen, but it's not, it's not appropriate what they've done, from, obviously, their own admission.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:19:03.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
