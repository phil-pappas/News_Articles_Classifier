Nevertheless, by 2016 the use of this lightweight metal inauto sector in India is expected to go up by at least three times,\" said Chand, on the sidelines an Auto Fest held on Friday.\nStating that replacement of one kg of heavy metal by aluminium reduces 22 kg of carbon dioxide emission during the lifecycle of a vehicle, Chand said, \"Most importantly, at the end of a vehicle's life nearly 90 per cent of the aluminium is recyclable.\n\"Initially, aluminium gained a foothold in wheels and transmission casings.
