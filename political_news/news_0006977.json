To shine a light on the extraordinary work done by ordinary dogs and underscore the remarkable power of the human-animal bond, the American Humane Association Hero Dog Awards® were created. This congressional briefing will feature this year's winners – eight of the nation's most courageous canines. Each dog has won in one of eight special categories with top honors and the title of 2015 American Hero Dog going to Harley , a little Chihuahua with a big heart. For 10 years, this poor dog suffered unspeakable cruelty in a puppy mill before he was rescued.\nHarley and the seven other 2015 Hero Dog Awards winners will join us on Capitol Hill for a lively discussion about the important role dogs play in our lives. And because behind every hero pet is a hero vet or hero vet tech, we are also proud to feature the winners of the 2015 American Humane Association Hero Veterinarian and Hero Veterinary Technician Awards , sponsored by Zoetis. Dr. Annette Sysel and Julie Carlson will talk about their important work to help animals in need.\nWHO: American Humane Association President & CEO Dr. Robin Ganzert\nMembers of Congress , with Humane Bond Caucus Co-Chairs Gus M. Bilirakis and Henry Cuellar , Ph.D\nMichelle Vicary , EVP, Programming & Network Publicity, Crown Media Family Networks\nThe Eight 2015 American Humane Association Hero Dog Awards Winners (Full bios at www.HeroDogAwards.org )\n2015 American Hero Veterinarian Dr. Annette Sysel , for her work on canine and feline cancer.\n2015 American Hero Veterinary Technician Julie Carlson, who founded Vets for Vets' Pets.\nTHE DOGS: Congress and the American public will meet for the first time: Emerging Hero Dog of the Year Harley; Arson Dog of the Year Glory who investigates deadly arson fires and helps put criminals behind bars; Guide/Hearing Dog of the Year Chara who trained herself to detect her handler's impending myoclonic dystonic attacks; Law Enforcement Dog of the Year Dax who saved the life of police Sgt. Chris Alberini ; Military Dog of the Year Rambo who conducted 622 searches and had a limb amputated; Search and Rescue Dog of the Year Glory, the only certified S&R dog to track pets; Service Dog of the Year Axel, who helps his handler Marine Capt. Jason Haag cope with the hidden wounds of war; and Therapy Dog of the Year Hudson the Railroad Puppy, who was severely abused but now works to comfort the young, the sick, and the aged.\nWHY: For thousands of years, dogs have not only been our best friends, but have enriched, improved, and even saved our lives. Working dogs benefit millions of people every day in many unique, often innovative ways. America's military dogs save an average of 150-200 U.S. warriors each in combat zones and continue to rescue our veterans from the hidden wounds of war long after the battle is over. Seeing-eye dogs give eyes to the blind. Service dogs improve and save the lives of veterans, the aged, and the differently abled, while arson and police dogs help us sleep safer in our beds. Therapy dogs provide comfort to abused children and, according to a new study by American Humane Association, may even help provide healing to children with cancer.\nAfter appearing on Capitol Hill, all of America will have a chance to meet these heroic hounds as the 2015 American Humane Association Hero Dog Awards, presented by the Lois Pope LIFE Foundation, Inc., are broadcast nationally on Hallmark Channel October 30 at 8 pm ET /PT, 7 pm Central Time .
