Ms Lloyd-Jones has read documents dating back to the 1990s and interviewed dozens of key players, some on several occasions. \nCouncil leader Cllr Stephen Godfrey said the report is likely to change \"the way we generally do business.\" \nHe said: \"One would like to have the report, but if I start saying 'where's the timetable?', Ms Lloyd-Jones would come to me and say 'I can't give you a timetable', and no one's better off. Promoted stories \n\"We don't want to have to compromise on the integrity of the report.\" \nCllr Godfrey said Ms Lloyd-Jones received \"quite a lot of additional information\" in August, including a submission from Silver Hill critic Kim Gottlieb which prompted further investigation. Share article \nAsked whether the report would be made public, Cllr Godfrey added: \"I'm not expecting there to be anything in the report which we would not make public. I would certainly expect it to be entirely in the open.\" \nCllr Gottlieb said: \"I don't think it's keeping anybody awake at night, but [councillors] would like to see what areas she's covered and what she has to say.\" Promoted Stories Claer Lloyd-Jones has refused to issue a timetable for her delayed report into the Silver Hill development   Keep in touch with local news", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:48:31.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
