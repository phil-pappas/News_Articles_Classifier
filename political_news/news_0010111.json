Rand Paul was set to appear onstage at the Republican Party's first debate of the 2016 campaign. \nProsecutors say Kesari and Benton concealed payments to a former state senator to endorse Ron Paul. The trial began Tuesday. \nKesari faces five charges, including conspiracy and obstruction. Benton faces one count of making false statements. They have pleaded not guilty.
