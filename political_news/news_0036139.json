He just said it in the wrong place. The New Jersey governor was kicked out of Amtrak’s “quiet car” for reportedly screaming (or, at least, talking loudly) on the phone during a return ride to New Jersey from Washington on an Acela Express . He later apologized for breaking the transit company’s “cardinal rule.”\nAccording to Christie’s spokesperson Sam Smith, the GOP presidential candidate who appeared on CBS’s “Face the Nation” prior to his departure, took a seat in the quiet car by accident during his morning travels.\n\"On a very full train this morning, the Governor accidentally took a seat in Amtrak's notorious quiet car,\" Smith said.\n\"After breaking the cardinal rule of the quiet car, the Governor promptly left once he realized the serious nature of his mistake and enjoyed the rest of his time on the train from the cafe car. Sincere apologies to all the patrons of the quiet car that were offended.\"\nAmtrak’s passenger guidelines urge riders to use quiet voices to help maintain a “ library like atmosphere ” in that particular car.\nThe story was initially reported on Gawker, where someone claiming to be a nearby passenger said the governor was yelling a lot.\nChristie continues to lag in early voting state polls, coming in 12 th in a recent Iowa poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.scribd.com/doc/286605246/Bloomberg-Politics-Des-Moines-Register-Iowa-Poll-Oct-23-2015-release", "http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CHRISTIE_QUIET_CAR_KERFUFFLE?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-10-25-14-01-41", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/25/politics/chris-christie-amtrak-quiet-car/"], "published": "2015-10-25T11:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:34:14.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
