Walsh’s performance on casinos was rated “excellent/good” by 57 percent of those polled, while 22 percent said it has been “not so good/poor.” Similarly, 56 percent of people approved of his handling of the Boston Olympics, while a third of people disapproved. His general favorability ratings are even higher. He was rated as favorable by 77 percent of people, with just 14 percent saying Walsh is unfavorable.   Those numbers are slighly higher than other polls of the mayor’s popularity. Walsh held a favorable rating around 70 percent among registered voters in the city of Boston over five periods in 2015, according to WBUR polls [ PDF ]. The poll, conducted by Global Strategy Group, surveyed 403 likely 2017 voters in mid-September. You can read the rest of the story at Politico Massachusetts .
