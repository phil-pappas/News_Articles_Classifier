But you're still the King.\" -John Oliver\"Congratulations, Congress! 77% disapproval rating! You may be about to become the English language's most offensive C-word.\" -John Oliver\"One failed attempt at a shoe bomb and we all take off our shoes at the airport. Thirty-one school shootings since Columbine and no change in our regulation of guns.\" -John Oliver\"Sarah Palin has been hired back by Fox News, and she only left five months ago. She has now effectively quit quitting. She can't even commit to being uncommitted.\" –John Oliver\"Mr. President, no one is saying you broke any laws, we're just saying it's a little bit weird you didn't have to.\" –John Oliver on the NSA spying scandal\"You know. Mr. President, when Michele Bachmann is in your side you may want to look at the side you are on. She is the canary in the crazy mine.

How does 2013 Florida have a law that seems cut and pasted from 1881 Tombstone?' asked a seething John Oliver. 'Because – let's be clear here – according to current Florida law, you can get a gun, follow an unarmed minor, call the police, have them explicitly tell you to stop following him, then choose to ignore that, keep following the minor, get into a confrontation with him and if at any point during that process you get scared, you can shoot the minor to death and the state of Florida will say, 'Well, look, you did what you could.'' –John Oliver\"Democracy is like a tambourine – not everyone can be trusted with it.'\" –John Oliver\"First tonight, I and the rest of America woke up this morning in the worst way imaginable.\" -John Oliver on Sarah Palin returning to Fox News\"News is not a game show.
