(We do not see or collect those addresses.)\nOn the site you’ll find 357 races and 595 candidates listed. In addition to your individualized ballot, you’ll also see all of the information indexed by races and by candidates, a link to the Ohio secretary of state’s office for election information and details about how to register, and a link to a video that explains how to use the guide.\nYou can compare candidates side by side, see the potential cost of property-tax increases if levies pass, and email a copy of your sample ballot to yourself. In some cases, videos of candidates are included, such as one of a debate between candidates for Columbus mayor.\nWhat you won’t find is information about some of the candidates. Let me explain:\nA team of people from The Dispatch and ThisWeek Community Newspapers starts working on this project weeks in advance of each election. Reporters and editors from the Metro and Public Affairs desks gather up email addresses for candidates and supply them to the Dispatch.com team, which sends emails to everyone for whom we have addresses to ask them to participate. There is no charge.\nEach candidate is given a unique Web address to access the site and provide biographical information and answer specific questions prepared by our reporting staff related to public service and the office the candidate seeks. The candidates also can include links to their campaign websites, Facebook pages and Twitter accounts.\nYet, you won’t find information about some candidates on your ballot because the candidates didn’t provide the information before our deadline, or they are running for office in Morrow County.\nUnlike all other counties in central Ohio, the Morrow County Board of Elections does not collect email addresses from candidates. Therefore, we were unable to obtain those addresses and directly ask candidates to participate.\nWe post a general notice on Dispatch.com, the Dispatch Facebook page and Twitter accounts asking candidates to participate, but that is not as effective as a personal email. We likely will drop Morrow County for the next election if it does not change its policy and start collecting email addresses.\nReporters provide descriptions of races and issues, and the Dispatch.com team of Victor Black, Scott Gowans and Chuck Nelson add the details into the Voters Guide site, which is hosted by e.thePeople.\n“Candidates are generally grateful for the opportunity to participate,” said Black, who leads our Voters Guide team. “They like being able to get information out to voters in their own words.”\nHe said that it’s a big hit with voters, too, based on traffic to the website.\n“We’ll have thousands of people looking at it” between Tuesday and Election Day, he said. “And, typically, on the day before the election is when it sees the most traffic.”\nAlan D.
