(Khalil Mazraawi/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) October 8 at 5:45 PM The source of the disastrous events in Syria existed well before the missteps described in the Oct. 3 editorial “ The origins of a disaster .” After World War I, Sunnis and Shiites, the two dominant warring religious sects in the Middle East, were consigned to coexist in the newly created states of Syria and Iraq. The Assad family took power in Syria; the Sunnis were persecuted and are now fleeing for survival.\nThe way out is not the creation of temporary “safe zones” but a permanent policy of supporting statehood for the anguished, ignored Sunnis. At home, they could fight the Islamic State and transition from tribalism to self-government in the Middle East. The Kurds of northern Syria, who are proving their worth in the repulsion of the Islamic State, have sought an independent state. There seems to be a renewed interest in statehood for Palestinians.\nOnly a balance of power between the Sunnis and Shiites will bring peace to the Middle East. The role of the United States is not to reflexively respond to every crisis with arms and soldiers but to lead those struggling for a peaceful existence through self-determination. Our foreign policy should empower them in that quest.\nProvidence Billings , Dumfries", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:12:43.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
