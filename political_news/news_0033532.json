It also sounds a death knell for Solidarity. What is Solidarity’s purpose if they register under other names to promote Tommy Sheridan?”\nUnder electoral law, parties are allowed to register and protect 12 descriptions as optional names for use next to candidate names on ballots.\nSheridan has used the option in the past, registering “Solidarity Scotland's Socialist Movement (Tommy Sheridan)” and “Solidarity - Tommy Sheridan”.\nHope Over Fear (HOF) says it is a grassroots movement which evolved from Sheridan’s national tour to promote independence.\nIt claims to be willing to work with anyone “regardless of political persuasion”, and has previously tried to attract SNP politicians to events.\nHowever Solidarity’s registration of the phrase for voting purposes points to HOF being part of Sheridan’s ambition to return as an MSP.\nThe 51-year-old is standing on the Glasgow regional list, just five years after he was jailed for lying in court about attending a sex club.\nMorgan last night insisted HOF and Solidarity were organisationally and financially separate.\nHowever he said it was not clear which name would feature on ballots in 2016.\nAsked if Solidarity would appear at all, he said: “I don’t know. It depends what people decide. We registered the names because we were not sure how things were going to go.”\nShare article Sheridan was a Glasgow list MSP from 1999 to 2007, first for the Scottish Socialists and then, after the party split in 2006, for Solidarity.\nNicola Sturgeon recently ruled out sharing a platform with him, saying “women in particular” found it hard to forget his behaviour.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:22:57.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
