The facility is located 22 miles southeast of Washington, DC and has a capacity of 13.1 MW-dc. The project was originally developed by juwi Inc. and has a 20-year power purchase agreement with Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative (SMECO).\nThe completion of this project increases the capacity of PSEG Solar Source's portfolio to 148 MW-dc.\n\"With the completion of the PSEG Waldorf Solar Center, our portfolio now has 11 plants in nine states, each providing customers with safe, clean and reliable energy,\" said Diana Drysdale , president of PSEG Solar Source. \"It was great to partner with SMECO on a project that will help the electric cooperative achieve its sustainability goals.\"\nAccording to Austin J. Slater, Jr. , SMECO's president and CEO, \"By developing a project that provides sustainable energy right here in our service area, PSEG Solar Source is helping us to meet our renewables target for solar production.\" He added, \"Our customer members will be pleased to know that the cost of the energy provided by this solar project is competitive with alternatives we considered.\"\nThe 80-acre PSEG Waldorf Solar Center uses approximately 42,000, 310-watt photovoltaic solar panels to generate enough solar energy to power more than 3,800 homes. Its pollution-free energy displaces approximately 26,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually â€“ the equivalent of removing approximately 3,300 cars from the road.\njuwi is the engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the project and will operate the project for PSEG Solar Source.\n\"Our partnership with PSEG Solar Source has been tremendously successful over the years and we are proud that companies like PSEG continue to dedicate significant resources and efforts to the renewable energy industry,\" said Mike Martin , juwi's president and CEO. \"The PSEG Waldorf Solar Center is another great example of this and will provide renewable, emission-free energy for SMECO customers for years to come.\"\nPSEG Solar Source's other operating facilities are:\nPSEG Queen Creek Solar Farm, a 25.2-MW solar farm in Queen Creek, Arizona .
