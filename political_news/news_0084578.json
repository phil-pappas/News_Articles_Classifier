But they also want to see the country be great,\" he added.\nThe country needs someone with \"tremendous strength,\" Trump said, while qualifying, \"but I think I could tone it down a little bit, and I’ll try.”\nTrump’s own Texas state director called him a 'joke' By Ben Schreckinger\nTrump faces a stiff test among his fellow GOP contenders among faith-based voters, particularly from retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\nAccording to the latest Quinnipiac University national poll , Trump received 25 percent of the vote among white born-again evangelicals, while his closest competitor, Carson, took 24 percent. At last month's Values Voter Summit in Washington, Trump finished a distant fifth in the annual straw poll.\nAt other times in the segment, Trump talked about his relationship with God and with the Bible in, particular.\n“The Bible is special. The Bible, the more you see it, the more you read it, the more incredible it is,\" he said.\nHe also credited his faith as one of the reasons he is \"doing so well.\"\n\"I am a Christian. I’m a Protestant. I’m a Presbyterian. I’m a total believer. I believer in the Bible, I believe in God, and I think I will help them so much with this country,\" Trump said of his influence on evangelicals.\nDonald Trump, Hillary Clinton dominate Facebook in early states By Hadas Gold\nAsked whether he prayed, Trump said yes, \"more than anything for the family and for health,\" after pulling out a photo of his confirmation class from June 1959, \"which is pretty good, right?\" he said.\nOn the subject of forgiveness, Trump, who has said that he has never explicitly asked God for forgiveness, remarked that he considered taking communion \"asking for forgiveness in my own way,\" an explanation he has offered in the past, though differently. He had referred to the act of communion as drinking \"my little wine\" and eating \"my little cracker\" at a July event in Iowa.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uk4c2uoOF3o", "http://www.quinnipiac.edu/images/polling/us/us09242015_ui47mfb.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:25:29.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
