Jeff Davis, says he could not provide details, including the number of times this has happened. \nHe says U.S. aircraft are still flying attack and other missions daily over Syria. But he acknowledges that the air operations have had to be adjusted since the Russians began flying. \nDavis says this highlights the Pentagon's interest in talking further to Russian officials about ways to avoid accidents and potential unintended conflict in the sky over Syria. \nOne round of talks was held Oct. 1. No second session is scheduled. Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:33:49.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
