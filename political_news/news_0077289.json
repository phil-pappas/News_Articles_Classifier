If such a person doesn't meet the requirement, they will only receive benefits for three months out of a 36-month period.\nThe change comes as the state allows a federal waiver to expire Thursday. The waiver currently allows adults, ages 18 to 49, who are capable of working but who aren't working and who don't have children to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits without an imposed time limit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:46:27.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
