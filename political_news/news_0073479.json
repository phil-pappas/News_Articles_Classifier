(AP Photo/Molly Riley, File) The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nA Republican lawmaker says House Speaker John Boehner has scheduled elections to choose a new leader for next week. \nRep. John Mica of Florida told reporters Wednesday morning that House Republicans will select their candidate for Speaker next Wednesday and the full House will choose a new Speaker to replace Boehner on Thursday. \nMica spoke as House Republicans met behind closed doors a day after Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan said he would seek the speakership if the Republicans could unify behind his candidacy. \nRepublicans have been bitterly divided with hardline conservatives forcing Boehner to announce his resignation last month and scaring off his No. 2, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who withdrew from the Speaker race.
