Six such teams have been formed till Wednesday, and over 50 more are being planned. The drive started in Malkajgiri, Kukatpally, Masab Tank and Borabanda. Each team comprises a few local residents and members of the city police. The teams have started taking rounds of their respective colonies. Those who were found moving around in suspicious ways are being interrogated and in some cases referred to police. B.T. Srinivas, general secretary of the United Federation of Residents’ Welfare Associations, said, “Members of different colony associations have asked the residents to contribute small sums for setting up CCTV cameras. Cameras are getting installed inside the colonies. We have formed teams in six colonies and aim to form 60 more such teams by next month.” G. Shekar Goud, inspector, Malkajgiri police station, who is also the in-charge of the drive, said, “The policemen deployed for the special teams have been provided with bikes so that it is easier to catch the culprits. These are done mostly by youths on bikes.” Every station in Cyberabad will have two to three teams, and each of these will have at least two cops. B.A. Pramod, resident of Gowtham Nagar, Malkajgiri where three CCTV cameras have been installed as part of the drive, said, “The installation of CCTV cameras will be of great help. We readily agreed to contribute for the cameras because this is for our protection. Now the women of the society can roam around freely.” CCTV cameras have been installed on all the main roads of Gowthamnagar colony and Vasantpuri colony in Malkajgiri, Shanthinagar in Masab tank, Bank Colony in Indira park, Pragati colony in Kukatpally and Motinagar in Borabanda.
