He suggested that reforms could be introduced through a phased approach in a bid to prevent landlords quitting the sector.\nHe added: \"We don't need to limit rent increases if people are already being forced into foodbanks. The argument is capped increases will bring predictability but if something is predictably unaffordable, it's still unaffordable. The report isn't about trashing landlords - it's about creating a sector that works.\n\"Scotland's housing crisis is at a tipping-point and we urgently need solutions. The private rented sector is growing faster than any other form of housing, and more and more people are becoming trapped in a sector that isn't appropriate or affordable for them.\n\"This paper outlines what the answers are. It is time for Scotland to join the majority of European countries in guaranteeing private tenants affordable rents and security of tenure.\"\nThe report, published today, was launched at the Old Sheriff Court Building on Brunswick Street in Glasgow's merchant city, which was the final destination of an enormous march by tens of thousands of women leading the 1915 Glasgow Rent Strike.\nThey opposed landlords driving up costs for wartime workers and evicting those who could not pay. It ended in a historic victory when legislation to restrict rents to the pre-war level was brought in.\nShare article John Blackwood, Chief Executive the Scottish Association of Landlords, said he supported reform but warned against \"unintended consequences\" of heavy handed measures that could reduce investment and drive responsible landlords out of the sector.\nMeanwhile, social justice secretary Alex Neil launched a new charity aimed at building 1,000 new homes offering affordable private rents within five years. The Local Affordable Rented Housing Trust has been backed by a £55 million Scottish Government loan with private sector cash expected to bring the total to more than £100m. The first project is taking place in Musselburgh, East Lothian.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-14T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:32:30.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
