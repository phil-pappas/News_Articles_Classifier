(Alexei Nikolsky/RIA Novosti, Kremlin Pool Photo via Associated Press) October 9 at 5:37 PM Regarding the Oct. 8 news article “ Obama apologizes to head of Doctors Without Borders ”:\nThere is a way out of our Middle East quagmire, if Washington would pay attention to what most Americans want: no more U.S. involvement in the Middle East.\nFirst, we need to let Russia become the bad guy that President Vladimir Putin wants it to be in Syria. We have no hope of solving that crisis, but we shouldn’t make things worse by indiscriminate bombing, and all bombing where we don’t know who’s who is indiscriminate. It’s unfortunate that after 14 years we continue to bomb Afghanistan, ignoring the lesson that the Russians learned and we should have, just as Russia returns to the same failed policy in Syria.\nSecond, and in keeping with most Americans’ generosity, we can make things better by spending those resources helping millions of displaced persons, whether they’re in Jordan, Turkey, Europe or even Syria. In the long run, we’ll be safer and our damaged karma might be renewed.\nJohn Schaefer , Arcata, Calif.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:59:13.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
