He adds that any attacker will be \"shocked\" if he tries to assault the real estate mogul and that he will emulate Bronson in the vigilante film \"Death Wish.\" \nTrump says that the Oregon shootings could have been averted if instructors or students had been armed. \nTrump's positions on gun control have evolved significantly over the years. He once backed an assault weapons ban and longer waiting periods for purchases.
