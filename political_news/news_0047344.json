Corporations Hoarding $2 Trillion in Profits, Asking Taxpayers to Pay Their Employees' Wages Citizens for Tax Justice just reported that Fortune 500 companies are holding over $2.1 trillion in accumulated profits offshore for tax purposes, with estimated taxes due of over $600 billion. But high-profile businessmen Peter Georgescu and Warren Buffett both recently recommended that government subsidies be used to increase worker wages, and Marco Rubio agreed, suggesting that government should pay the sick leave for corporate employees. . . . 2. Mourning American Lives, But Not Foreign Lives Two days after President Obama expressed grief and anger about the Oregon school shootings, a hospital in Afghanistan was bombed by the U.S., killing 22 people. Our government admitted its mistake. But we haven't apologized for funding Saudi Arabia's attacks in Yemen, which are killing hundreds of civilians. Or for our drone strikes in Pakistan, which led one 13-year-old to say, \"I no longer love blue skies...The drones do not fly when the skies are gray.\" 3. Caring About Unborn Children, But Not Living Children The anti-abortion element keeps attacking Planned Parenthood, even though the long-successful and essential organization saves women's lives through breast cancer screenings, and reduces abortions by providing contraceptive services. Little mention is made of the 65% rise in homeless children in less than ten years. Or of the fact that only the United States and South Sudan have failed to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It's a curious phenomenon that a safe and secure fetus garners more attention than a child exposed to the harsh realities of the world outside. 4. Demanding Self-Reliance of People Who Can't Find a Living-Wage Job The Koch-funded Heritage Foundation proclaimed, \"Helping the poor should mean promoting individual freedom through self-reliance..\" The Cato Instituteadded, \"SNAP helps breed dependency and undermines the work ethic.\" Here are the facts: Nearly two-thirds of all working-age poor are actually working, but unable to earn a living wage, forcing them to rely on food stamps, which only provide about $5 a day per person for meals. In addition, over 83 percent of all benefits going to low-income people are for the elderly, the disabled, or working households. Black families have the least opportunities, and are most maligned. . . . Perhaps worst of all, Congress vilifies the poor for laziness while doing little to provide employment opportunities. In 2011 Senate Republicans killed a proposed $447 billion jobs bill that would have added about two million jobs to the economy. Members of Congress filibustered Nancy Pelosi's \"Prevention of Outsourcing Act,\" even as a million jobs were being outsourced, and they temporarily blocked the \"Small Business Jobs Act.\" In April, 2013 only one member of Congress bothered to show up for a hearing on unemployment. When asked what he would do to bring jobs to Kentucky, Mitch McConnellresponded, \"That is not my job. It is the primary responsibility of the state Commerce Cabinet.\" 5. Turning Away People Who Were Displaced by Our \"Free Trade\" Pacts . . . Apparently few Americans are aware of, or concerned about, the hardships faced by Mexican families since the beginnings of NAFTA. Subsidies to U.S. corn farmers led to lower prices and a tripling of corn exports to Mexico over the first ten years of the trade pact . Prices collapsed in Mexico. Corn that earned growers 2.00 pesos per kilogram in 1994 dropped to .50 pesos in 2001. Production became concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy landowners. Over 1.3 million jobs were lost in agriculture since 1994, while 500,000 manufacturing jobs were gained, most of them at lower wages than before NAFTA, and many of them in the crime-filled and disease-ridden maquiladora factory towns at the U.S. border. This is not America. This is a plutocracy with an oligarchy economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:40:13.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
