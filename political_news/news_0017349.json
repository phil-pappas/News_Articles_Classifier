(AP) - \nMissouri Republican lawmakers are brainstorming potential changes to abortion laws, including additional oversight and an idea that there should be memorials for aborted fetuses. \nMembers of a House committee Tuesday floated ways to revamp state policy after reviewing abortion practices in Missouri for months. \nDemocratic Attorney General Chris Koster and two legislative committees launched investigations into Planned Parenthood this summer. The reviews followed the release of undercover videos by anti-abortion activists showing officials from the organization discussing the transfer of fetal tissue. \nKoster says he found no evidence that a St. Louis Planned Parenthood sells fetal tissue. But GOP leaders of the House committee say they want to tighten regulations. \nPolicy ideas included one from GOP Rep. Rick Brattin to create a \"Vietnam Wall-type\" memorial for aborted fetuses. \nCopyright Â© 2014 KMIZ - The Networks of Mid-Missouri. All rights reserved.
