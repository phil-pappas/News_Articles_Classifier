Lisa Jaster. What's perhaps more impressive, however, is that Jaster accomplished this at 37 years old ​, an age that has placed a world of experiences and time between her graduation from West Point in 2007.\n​ As former Ranger graduate Andrew Exum, a deputy assistant secretary of defense, ​tweeted:\n Forget the fact she's a woman. I can't believe a 37-year old graduated from Ranger School. I'm 37. I went when I was 22. 37 is ld.\n— Andrew Exum (@ExumAM) October 11, 2015\n The Washington Post reports that Jaster is a former Shell engineer and Army reservist with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and is married with two children. She completed the course after 180 days — three times the minimum length of the course, but well within the range male graduates finish — and is over 10 years older than Capt. Kristen Griest, 26, and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver, 25, ​the first two women to complete Rangers School in August.\nAfter more than 60 years of barring women from its famously tough combat program, the Ranger School is now trying to integrate women in response to a 2013 edict from the Pentagon that ordered military officials to create plans to integrate women into their programs.\nJaster didn't offer a comment to the Washington Post , but in a Facebook post, she opened up about the gender divide. \"A lot of doors can open for women if we go about it the right way,\" she wrote. \"The right way includes being professional, thick skinned, and ensuring that we minimize any special treatment. I know that I am physically fit. I am mentally tough. I know that I have all the ingredients to be successful. I volunteered because I want to make sure the standards do remain high and that the women coming out at the far end of Ranger School will be respected for their accomplishments rather than being judged for making things easier.\" ​\n​ Follow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/prachigu", "https://twitter.com/ExumAM/status/653329983516082176", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2015/10/12/army-ranger-school-has-a-groundbreaking-new-graduate-lisa-jaster-37-engineer-and-mother/"], "published": "2015-10-13T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:25:15.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
