The measure follows court decisions striking down parts of Wisconsin law related to money in politics. \n\"I think it makes sense for us to take a look at and codify those court decisions and make very bright lines so people know what they can and cannot do under current law,\" Vos said Monday. \nThe bill doubles contribution limits directly to candidates from $10,000 to $20,000. \nIt also allows candidates to coordinate with outside groups on \"issue advocacy,\" which is when groups run ads not using \"vote for\" or \"vote against\" language. Instead, they typically ask voters to contact a candidate and tell them to take action on a specific issue. \nJay Heck with Common Cause of Wisconsin said coordination may actually cause much of the money in Wisconsin elections to flow through the groups, because third-party groups are largely not required to disclose their donors. \n\"Virtually all the money will now flow to these secret issue ad groups, which can then coordinate with the candidate,\" Heck said. \nThe bill also allows unlimited giving to political parties and campaign committees, and it says that any donors who do give to candidates don't have to disclose their employer. \nGroups like the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign keep a searchable database of that information. \n\"It will ruin our ability and that of many other good government groups to find out who is giving money to try to elect one candidate or defeat another candidate,\" Wisconsin Democracy Campaign Executive Director Matt Rothschild said. \nVos said including job titles but not employers in disclosures will help protect businesses. \n\"Allowing the opportunity to know what you do for a living, a farmer or business owner or a teacher or a person who works for a factory, that's important to know what industries could be benefited by going out and raising money,\" Vos said. \"But to say who your employer is doesn't make sense because people are concerned about boycotts that could occur or have that employer be associated with a contribution they knew nothing about it.\" \nAssembly Democrats joined Heck and Rothschild at a Capitol news conference Monday to rail against the bill. \n\"This sets the stage for a new form of legal money laundering,\" Rep. Lisa Subeck, D-Madison, said. \nBut Vos said Monday that Democrats were in \"hyperbole overdrive\" and said that the bills would help free speech. \n\"This is the desperation tactics unfortunately of my colleagues in the Democratic Party,\" Vos said. \nThe Assembly is expected to vote on the bill on Wednesday, along with a bill dismantling the state's elections agency the Government Accountability Board, and replacing it with a partisan commission. \nCopyright 2015 by Channel 3000 .
