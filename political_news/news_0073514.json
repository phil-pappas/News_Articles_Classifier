But as members of both parties pitch ideas for gun-control legislation, once again, there appear to be few areas of agreement between Democrats and Republicans.\nMinority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Monday that he is reaching out to other Democratic senators on moving background checks legislation – a tall order in the Senate, where just two years ago Republicans and red-state Democrats blocked a bill when the chamber was under Democratic control. On Monday, Senate Republicans again shrugged off the push from Democrats as political and not addressing the root cause of the country's mass shooting affliction.\n\"We'll see whether the people who have no solution, who just want to keep talking about guns, are willing to meet us halfway,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who wants to focus on the link between mental health and guns. \"If somebody's got a better idea, great. But if they're just going to rail about guns and violence without offering solutions, that's not good enough.\"\nThe spate of recent mass shootings – from last week’s Oregon killings to the shootings of two journalists on air in August; and a rampage that left nine dead at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C. – have left Democrats frustrated that the GOP-led Congress is unlikely to act on tougher gun measures. President Barack Obama has suggested people should become single-issue voters on the issue of gun violence.\nIf “we don’t take action, we are equally responsible for innocent deaths as the sick individuals who plot and carry out these horrific measures,” Reid said Monday on the Senate floor. “One thing is clear: To pass background checks, we need Republicans to stop acting as puppets of the NRA.”\nThe Senate has stalled on gun-control legislation since a Democratic-led Senate blocked a background checks bill written by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) in April 2013. Of the four Senate Democrats who opposed that bill, only Sen. Heidi Heitkamp remains in office (Reid also voted no, but for procedural reasons).\nThe Democratic caucus is likely to discuss whether to reintroduce a background checks bill this week, with senators also mulling tacking on legislation dealing addressing domestic gun violence from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) as well as beefing up the existing background check system that has faltered of late. But unless they can force an amendment vote, the effort could end up being a messaging exercise.\nReid has had an up-and-down history with the influential gun lobby. The western-state Democrat maintained a long-standing relationship with the NRA during his years in the Senate, but the gun-rights group pointedly announced during Reid’s 2010 reelection bid that it would not endorse him.\nHis primary offense, in the eyes of the NRA, was that Reid backed the confirmations of Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – which the gun group saw as key votes on the fate of Second Amendment rights.\nHillary Clinton to offer gun proposals By Annie Karni\nOn Monday, Reid leveled sharp criticism at the NRA, saying it was once a “moderate sportsman’s organization” but that \"times have changed.”\n“Now the NRA and its leadership are committed to a radical agenda that allows criminals and mentally ill Americans to access guns to commit these terrible acts,” Reid said. “Is this what the American people elected us to do? I think not.”\nCornyn has introduced legislation this year designed to bar mentally ill people from obtaining guns by encouraging states to send more mental-health records to a federal database. The NRA has endorsed the measure, but gun-control advocates, such as the group Everytown for Gun Safety, argue that Cornyn’s bill make it easier for the mentally ill to ultimately purchase firearms.\n\"What's been frustrating to me is everyone knows that mental health is the common thread in the overwhelming majority of these cases. Yet there's very little effort to do something about that,\" Cornyn said. \"Adam Lanza killed his mother and murdered all those kids at Sandy Hook. He didn't even buy those guns, his mother did. More background checks for Adam Lanza wouldn't do any good.\"\nCornyn is working on recruiting bipartisan co-sponsors and is optimistic that a companion bill in the House will soon be introduced, an aide to the senator said Monday.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:11:44.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
