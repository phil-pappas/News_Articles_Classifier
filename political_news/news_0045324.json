One of those companies was NBC, which cancelled its contract with Trump regarding the show The Apprentice.\nIt appears that Trump has television networks like NBC, CNBC, and Fox News under his thumb. Trump gets ratings, and both Trump and the networks know that. As Felix Sanchez, co-founder of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, said, SNL would provide Trump “a comedy satire platform that would de facto laugh away his bigoted comments.”\nFor more on this story, visit Talking Points Memo “Hispanic Coalition To NBC: Don’t Let ‘Bigoted’ Trump Host SNL”", "external_links": ["http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/national-hispanic-leadership-agenda-trump-snl"], "published": "2015-10-18T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:42:07.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
