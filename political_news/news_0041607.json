This initiative, in partnership with Calvert Foundation and Capital Impact Partners, aims to support enterprises and projects that create affordable homes, increase access to healthy foods, improve financial security, and offer more community-oriented models of care.\nStarting with an initial investment from AARP Foundation, Calvert Foundation will raise up to $70 million from investors seeking financial and social returns. AARP is committed to matching up to $6 million to further strengthen the impact of this initiative. Capital Impact Partners will provide financing to enterprises meeting the needs of the vulnerable low-income older adults.\nThe number of Americans over 65 will double in the next 25 years, and more services will be required to fulfill their needs. Age Strong funds enterprises that provide those services, with a focus on meeting the needs of vulnerable older adults.\n\"Age Strong is an innovative approach to supporting enterprises that are meeting the critical needs of vulnerable adults 50-plus. It demonstrates what is possible when partners with complementary strengths and aligned missions come together with a shared goal.\" said AARP Foundation President Lisa Marsh Ryerson . \"This initiative deliberately aligns with our work to help struggling low-income older adults attain safe and affordable housing, steady income, adequate and nutritious food, and create strong and sustaining bonds that will help create more vibrant and strong communities.\"\nAge Strong is the only social investment initiative that focuses specifically on low-income and/or vulnerable 50-plus adults. It brings together AARP Foundation and AARP's experience and voice for the 50-plus, Calvert Foundation's impact investment platform and Capital Impact Partners' expertise in financing community development projects.\n\"Through our investment product people can invest in Age Strong starting at $20 , and fund enterprises that provide critical services for vulnerable older adults\" said Calvert Foundation President and CEO Jennifer Pryce . \"It's a win-win because investors earn returns while creating positive social impact. For more than 20 years we've been connecting people with the causes they care about through investment, and Age Strong is one of our most exciting new options.\"\n\"The ability to age strong requires that all people, especially the most vulnerable older Americans, have access to those critical services that enable them to lead healthy, vibrant, and engaged lives,\" said Terry Simonette , President and Chief Executive Office at Capital Impact Partners. \"Through this partnership we have the ability to help ensure that good projects that support age-friendly communities receive the capital they need to grow and deliver social impact.\"\nThrough Age Strong, Capital Impact provides financing of community or economic development projects that provide positive benefits for the 50-plus, low-income population.
