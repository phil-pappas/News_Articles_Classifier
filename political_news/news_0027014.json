John King speaks during a press conference at the White House on Oct. 2, 2015.\nBy Lauren Camera Oct. 20, 2015 | 10:42 a.m. EDT + More Arne Duncan shocked the education community when he announced last month his plans to step down from his perch just a year shy of skippering the Department of Education from the beginning through to the end of President Barack Obama’s two terms.\nBut when he resigns from his post in December, stepping into the fold will be someone who brings something unique to the role that Duncan never could.\nJohn King, who currently serves in the No. 2 slot at the department, grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Both of his parents died by the time he was 12, and he bounced from relative to relative. School, he’s publicly explained , was his refuge and as a young African-American male without a stable home life and without role models, it literally saved his life.\n[ READ: 5 Things to Know About the New Education Secretary John King ]\n“He is much more, for better or worse, much more similar to the kids that we want to do better for than I was growing up, and I think that’s a tremendous asset,” said Duncan in an interview Monday. “That’s a set of experiences that I simply did not have that I think will help to make him especially impactful.”\nBy contrast, Duncan grew up in Chicago, where he spent most of his time after school helping his mother run a day care and tutoring center in the city’s gritty South Side.\nRELATED\n5 No-Spin Takeaways From Arne Duncan's Departure From Education Department “I had a passion for and a real commitment to helping kids who have struggled, but that wasn’t my background,” Duncan said. “I was lucky to have two parents at home. I was lucky to have three meals every single day and a safe place to sleep.”\nThroughout Obama’s tenure in the White House, Duncan has prioritized federal education programs that specifically target communities devastated by failing schools, violence and other social problems with programs like Promise Neighborhoods. More recently, through programs like My Brother’s Keeper, he’s been trying to build better support systems for young men of color.\n“John can look at kids who aren’t living with mom or aren’t living with dad, or aren’t living with both and say, ‘Guess what, I’ve been there,’” Duncan said. “He can understand perfectly what they’re going through. There is a way for him to identify with the kids that we all are concerned about in a very powerful and personal way.”\nSo what will change when Duncan leaves Washington come December? Probably not a whole lot.\n“There’s a very clear agenda that Arne and the president have laid out over the last six and a half years that is right for the country,” said King, who also present during the interview.\n[ ALSO: Education Reforms Are Here to Stay ]\nThe agenda, King said, includes continuing to push states to adopt higher standards, to ensure students are better prepared for college and careers, to expand access to early childhood education, and to expand access and improve completion of higher education.\n“That agenda is very robust and I think I bring to it my experiences and my sense of urgency about kids who are most at risk, particularly because I see myself in them,” he said. “These last 16 months will be an opportunity to build on the last six-and-a-half years.\"\nTAGS: education Duncan, Arne King, John Obama, Barack Obama administration", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedhhd%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=What%20John%20Kings%20Brings%20to%20the%20Education%20Department&summary=Incoming%20education%20secretary%20John%20King%27s%20past%20could%20make%20him%20especially%20effective.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedhhd%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=What%20John%20Kings%20Brings%20to%20the%20Education%20Department", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedhhd%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedhhd%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedhhd%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-king/education-the-difference_b_148855.html", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZedhhd%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=What%20John%20Kings%20Brings%20to%20the%20Education%20Department"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:59:29.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
