The 2016 Committee, which previously served as a draft effort to bring Carson into the race, has teamed up with Our Children's Future PAC, a group aligned with Carson aides. The groups pledged in a release to turn \"Carson’s outside militia into an organized army.\"\nThe 2016 Committee, in particular, has already played a key role in organizing early state grass-roots activists on Carson's behalf and will remain focused on engaging at that level and among those donors, while Our Children's Future zeroes in on bigger-dollar donors.\nCarson, a conservative grass-roots favorite, has rocketed to the top of the polls and his campaign pulled in the biggest fundraising haul of the Republican presidential field in the latest quarter. But he lacks a critical mass of big donors and has been reliant on more expensive efforts to target small-dollar donors. The joint effort by outside forces could free up more of his official campaign's resources.\n\"Starting immediately, both organizations will unleash a unified, comprehensive strategy to increase voter education in early primary states through print, online and broadcast advertising as well as grassroots engagement via The 2016 Committee’s volunteer army of 31,000 Americans,\" the release promised.\nCarson surges past Trump in Iowa poll By Eliza Collins\nTerry Giles, who previously served as Carson's campaign chairman for his exploratory committee, and Jeff Reeter, his former campaign finance chairman who runs Our Children's Future, are both involved in the joint venture. Earlier this year, they left the campaign for super PAC efforts as Carson's candidacy got off the ground, generating talk of a shake-up and painting a picture of a fledgling campaign in chaos.\nBut, Giles said in a statement, \"The Carson campaign team is doing a great job, and now here come the Super PACs. This is a game changer in the history of Super PACs and an unparalleled powerful force for Dr. Carson.”\nNews of the pending merger was first reported by MSNBC.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ben-carsons-campaign-faces-turmoil-after-staff-exits-and-super-pac-chaos/2015/06/05/ce08f9b2-0ba8-11e5-a7ad-b430fc1d3f5c_story.html", "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/exclusive-ben-carson-super-pacs-plan-form-massive-army"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:00:55.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
