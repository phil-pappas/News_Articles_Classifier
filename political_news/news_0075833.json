There is no on-job training. \nMs Ovens says virtually no guards are offered further training because security companies undercut each other in bidding for work in a “race to the bottom,” keeping wages and training expenses unfairly and dangerously low. Most guards are on the minimum wage or close to it, even with reputable multinational companies. \n“We have requirements in our Collective Agreements for guards to be trained to NZQA Level 3, but this rarely happens, partly because guards get higher pay if they are qualified, and party because the government has taken away the incentive for security companies to invest in training.” \nMs Ovens said security companies should take other steps to ensure the safety of their guards, such as the issue of radio telephones with emergency call buttons, and regular welfare checks initiated from the call centre. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:36:46.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
