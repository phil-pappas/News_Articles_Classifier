Dallas Kilponen by Joe Aston Will Glasgow The Liberal Party's NSW council, held in Sydney over the weekend, will be remembered as the first in memory to heckle a Prime Minister. On first glance, the story seemed clear – Malcolm Turnbull erred badly by claiming in his speech to the faithful that their party is \"not run by factions… or by deals in back rooms\" only four weeks after both factions and their deals ultimately allowed him to topple Tony Abbott in a party room ballot.\nAnd while it was an inexplicable lapse in political judgment and self-awareness by Team Turnbull, it's not really why the new PM copped humiliating friendly fire before the rolling cameras.\nMinutes earlier, the heavily factionalised NSW division had finally passed a consensus package on internal democratic reforms of party governance, shepherded through by acting president Trent Zimmerman and supported by long-time agitator and Abbott's federal electorate chair Walter Villatora .\nVillatora's original proposals, favoured strongly by the party's Right, were withdrawn on Friday and its key proponents fell in behind the compromise deal.

And it was to defend him that Abbott himself took the podium to declare the package imperfect, but a clear improvement. He could've released statement to that effect, and stayed at home, away from the cameras, but then that would be honouring his unsolicited pledge not to wreck, snipe or undermine…\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-10/liberal-party-owes-abbott-an-enormous-debt-turnbull-says/6843816"], "published": "2015-10-11T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:55:19.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
