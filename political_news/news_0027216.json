Every penny, plus interest, has been repaid to everybody.” \nHe further described his past 2½ years as “horrendous” and said he’s worked hard to meet all his obligations and put the past behind him. \nMorton ran afoul of industry rules by borrowing about $315,000 from seven of his clients, with their agreement, between 2009 and 2012. This was considered an ethical breach by the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency. In August 2013, the regulating body fined Morton $5,000 and suspended him from acting as a financial planner for six months. Morton also was fired as a contractor with LPL Financial. \nCounty Democratic leaders looking for an edge over Morton in this year’s election examined redacted financial disclosure forms from the Erie County Board of Ethics and said his list of creditors – he listed only one in 2013 – defied belief and warranted an investigation. \nIn explaining how he paid off his creditors, many of whom were family members and friends, Morton said he never owed $315,000 all at once, but rather paid off some older debts while acquiring new ones. Once his license to work as a financial planner was restored in March 2014, he sold off his list of clients to two former colleagues and used the proceeds to help pay off his remaining creditors, he said. His wife also worked until last year and helped him pay down debts. \nWhen he filled out his 2013 financial disclosure form, he said, he misunderstood the instructions and wrote down the single debt he had remaining at the time he filled out the paperwork instead of all the debts he had for the entire year. He further said his 2014 financial disclosure form, which also listed only one remaining creditor, is accurate. That debt was paid off in monthly installments and cleared as of September, he said. \nThough Morton’s campaign bio describes him as a “self-employed financial planner,” his sole job is currently that of county legislator. He expects to close on the sale of his home in November and has moved into an 1,800-square-foot doublewide trailer to save money and pay off the last of his personal debts. He and his wife have made hard choices, paid debts, altered their living expenses and are current on all personal bills, he said. \nMorton faces Democratic challenger Debra Liegl for the Eighth District seat, which includes Cheektowaga, Lancaster and Alden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:41:03.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
