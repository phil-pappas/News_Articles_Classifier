Senator Sanders called for a raise in the taxable cap for Social Security and an expansion of benefits for those receiving them right now. \nBut the real applause line happens right at the end, when Sanders talks about the wars that the Bush administration piled onto the national debt. He made Lindsey Graham and Chris Christie look like the selfish hacks they are. \n\"Those wars will end up costing us somewhere between 4 and 6 trillion dollars. And I've got to tell you, i have a hard time understanding how some members of Congress can come forward and say 'Oh, we've got to cut Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and education and nutrition programs for hungry kids, because we have a deficit',\" said Sanders. \n\"Oh, but when it comes to war, not a problem. We'll just put it on the credit card. And I think that is very, very wrong,\" he concluded. It was one of the biggest applause lines I heard today. \nAmen, Senator Sanders. I couldn't agree more with you on that and it looks like that NoLabels bunch is right there with you too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:33:31.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
