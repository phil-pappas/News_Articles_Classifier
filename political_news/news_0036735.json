Say no.” \nThe planned rezoning of East New York serves as a litmus test for the rest of the city as the first of 15 neighborhoods targeted by the de Blasio administration. \nThe goal is to add or preserve 200,000 affordable housing units over the course of a decade. \nOver the past months, locals have called on the mayor to secure jobs for longtime residents and expressed fears of displacement . \nThe sentiment continued Monday night, with attendees asking city representatives how they could guarantee the longevity of the community. \n“This city has an affordable housing crisis. I admire the mayor for making a full commitment to building affordable housing, but we cannot build our way out of this,” said Frank Castillo, a building service worker who spoke on behalf of Service Employees International Union, Local 32BJ. \n“As long as there are hard-working people earning too little to afford the rising housing cost, families are going to continue getting priced out of their homes and this crisis will continue.” \nNorth Brooklyn residents spoke out against “broken promises” from the city, saying they have yet to see the completion of their nearly 30 acres of parkland promised as part of the 2005 waterfront rezoning plan. \n“It changes your neighborhood like you can’t even imagine,” said resident Kim Fraser. \n“With us, I really feel like it was a big bait and switch. This is the bait, tonight’s presentation, and then down the road, they’re going to switch it.\" \nAddressing locals' concerns, city officials cited a neighborhood development fund for East New York, which commits funding upfront for two projects — safety improvements and the revitalization of Atlantic Avenue, and the redesign of City Line Park. \nRepresentatives also highlighted workforce and job training, as well as the addition of MIH, which they described as a “major way to retain affordable housing,\" much to the skepticism of attendees. \nEarlier this month, de Blasio told a church in East New York that his plans for the area would help keep people in their homes . \n\"Powerful developers will not decide the future of these communities. The people will decide, and the people will set the rules,\" the mayor said. \nBrooklyn Community Board 5 will host the next public hearing on the rezoning plan on Oct. 28, 6:30 p.m. at Franklin K. Lane High School, 999 Jamaica Ave. \nBorough President Eric Adams will also hold a public hearing at 6 p.m. on Nov. 23 at Brooklyn Borough Hall. \nBrownsville and Ocean Hill’s Community Board 16 is set to vote on the full proposal at the end of November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:41:58.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
