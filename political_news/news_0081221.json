COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The campaign urging Ohio voters to reject Issue 3 , a marijuana legalization measure on the November ballot, released its first advertisement Thursday.\nThe ad, described by Ohioans Against Marijuana Monopolies as a \"significant six-figure buy,\" will appear on websites and in applications through Nov. 3.\nCurt Steiner, a political consultant working for the group, said the web ad will be seen more than a million times and the group plans to buy TV air time before Election Day.\n\"In today's world, this is a very cost effective way to advertise on an issue because we can focus directly on voters we consider to be very interested in it and maybe haven't made a final decision,\" Steiner said.\nResponsibleOhio , the political action committee behind Issue 3, has been running statewide television ads since August .\nResponsibleOhio plans to spend at least $20 million on its campaign. Issue 3 opponents have admitted from the start they won't be able to raise as much money.\nOhioans Against Marijuana Monopolies also has begun sending campaign mail to Ohio voters who have applied for absentee ballots. Absentee voting began Tuesday.\nIssue 3 would legalize recreational and medical marijuana for adults over age 21. Commercial marijuana could only be grown on 10 pre-selected sites owned by investors bankrolling the initiative. Individuals could grow up to four flowering plants at a time in a secure, private area after obtaining a $50 homegrow permit.\nThe ad, dubbed \"Bad Deal,\" presents two of the campaign's biggest arguments against Issue 3 -- that it would create a monopoly for investors and that it would allow sale and use of marijuana-infused candy and other edible products that would be attractive to children.\nHere's a transcript of the ad:\nIssue 3, the marijuana amendment, is a \"bad deal\".\nIt would change Ohio's Constitution and grant a few wealthy donors a marijuana monopoly.\nThey get exclusive ownership of marijuana sites to make millions.\nIssue 3 allows marijuana lollipops, gummy bears and candy, posing a threat to our kids.\nJoin Ohio's police, doctors, nurses, educators and leading newspapers in voting NO.\nNO on the monopoly. NO on marijuana candy. NO on Issue 3.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gfUP0HMi8o", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8gfUP0HMi8o"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:44:24.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
