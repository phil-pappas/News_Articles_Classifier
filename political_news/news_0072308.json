That comes on top of the fact that not all Indiana school districts offer the current basic-level diploma, or if they do, those districts place additional requirements students must meet to graduate. \nAbsent meeting those requirements, students often leave high school with a certificate that doesn’t carry as much clout when searching for a job. And advocates for special-needs students worry if school districts don’t offer the current general education diploma, they won’t offer the new equivalent as well. \nAdvocates for special-needs students hope debate surrounding the proposed diploma types serves two purposes. They want the state to require all high schools to offer all diploma types. They also want the state to review the additional credits the proposals would require. \nKim Dodson, executive director of The Arc of Indiana, said her organization wants to ensure as many students as possible are provided the opportunity to earn a diploma. Part of that comes with every diploma type being offered no matter where a student lives in the state. But even if that occurs, she worries the proposed diplomas, as currently structured, would have a negative impact. \n“If our goal is to get as many students as possible to leave high school with a diploma that provides them the tools they need to be successful and (receive) post-secondary education opportunities and jobs, I don’t think this proposal does it,” Dodson said whose organization offers programming for the developmentally-disabled community. \nSupporters argue the new diplomas are needed to increase rigor, but opponents say the new requirements could negatively affect at-risk and special needs students by steepening the climb to earn a diploma. \nIn addition to more math courses across all diploma types, students would be required to take new courses in preparing for college and careers and personal financial responsibility. Another key feature is the requirement of students to take a sequence of courses that would end with a graduation capstone. That capstone could include achieving a career credential or completing a work-based learning experience. \n“We have concerns about that within the disability community. Just because our students are not performing well in an academic setting does not mean they cannot be successful as adults with or without a college degree,” said Mary Roth with the Autism Society of Indiana. \nJeff Huffman, a parent whose son attends Noblesville High School, noted the struggles some students face when they leave school with a certificate of completion instead of a diploma. Noblesville Schools recently aligned its general diploma requirements with the state after requiring additional courses to obtain the basic diploma for years. Nash, Huffman’s 14-year-old son, has Down syndrome and is currently working toward a general diploma. \n“Our standpoint always has been the most important thing for all students is the opportunity to at least have an opportunity to earn a high school diploma...I guess the million dollar question is why do we need to mess with the system...,” Huffman said. \nThe Indiana Department of Education does not track the types of diplomas offered by each school district in the state, according to agency spokesman Daniel Altman. Whether school districts will be required to offer all types is a conversation that will involve the Indiana General Assembly, he said. \n“We want to listen to everybody and be a part of that conversation,” Altman said. \nData shows the vast majority of graduates receive the current Core 40 diploma, which is above the general diploma and is the default diploma the state wants students to achieve. In 2013, 16 percent of graduates received the general diploma, according to data presented to the committee co-chaired by Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Glenda Ritz and Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Teresa Lubbers that crafted the proposal. \nLearning some high schools don’t offer a general diploma took Bluffton High School Principal Steve Baker, a leading official in the Indiana Association of School Principals, by surprise. Baker feels schools should offer all diploma options approved by the state. \nAt some high schools, local officials set additional requirements for a student to receive a general diploma. But at Bluffton, the local school board offers Baker the flexibility to lower those requirements to the state minimum if needed. \nBaker said he doesn’t think the proposed diplomas should be tossed out, but state officials need to strike a balance. He worries if the state adds rigor then districts could run the risk of losing more students who are struggling. \n“Throwing more math at students that are already struggling in math – is that going to solve the problem or make the problem more noticeable, more intense,” Baker questioned. \nYet, state Rep. Robert Behning, an Indianapolis Republican, said he likes that the diplomas require additional math courses. \n“That is the area of the highest remediation in the state and nationally, and it’s one of those subjects if you don’t use it, you lose it,” Behning said. \nIn addition to concerns for special-needs students, the proposed diplomas are creating other divides in the education community. \nSchool administrators are expressing concerns the proposed diplomas will offer students less flexibility from taking a wide-range of courses, especially in the fine arts. \nThe proposed changes are the byproduct of a state law that required a panel of educators and workforce experts to review the state’s current diplomas and offer possible changes. \nConcerns will come to a head at a special meeting of the State Board of Education tentatively scheduled for this month. State law requires the board to act on the proposals by Dec. 1. \nIf approved, the new requirements are slated to kick in for the graduating class of 2022. \nCall Star reporter Chelsea Schneider at (317) 444-6077.
