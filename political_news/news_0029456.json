Judge Damon Keith issued a dissent that said he thought the court should determine whether it has jurisdiction before issuing a stay.\nEPA released a statement that said it respects \"the court's decision to allow for more deliberate consideration of the issues in the case\" and looks forward to litigating its merits. It said its previous rule will remain in effect nationwide and it \"will continue to apply the best science and technical data on a case-by-case basis to waters at issue. \"\nWhen announcing the rule's implementation earlier this year, top EPA and Army Corps officials said it would protect streams and wetlands from pollution and degradation by more clearly defining which waters are protected under the Clean Water Act.\n\"For the waters in the rivers and lakes in our communities that flow to our drinking water to be clean, the streams and wetlands that feed them need to be clean too,\" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said when the rule was finalized in June. She said the rule would \"strengthen our economy and provide certainty to American businesses.\"\nJo-Ellen Darcy, an assistant secretary for the Army in charge of civil works, said the new rule responded \"to the public's demand for greater clarity, consistency and predictability when making jurisdictional determinations.\"\nDeWine issued a statement after the order was issued that said he's \"glad that the Sixth Circuit Court has temporarily stopped the effect of this sweeping, illegal rule that claims federal jurisdiction over about every damp area of public or private land in the nation.\nCongressman Bob Gibbs, a Holmes County Republican who vocally backed a House of Representatives bill to overturn the rule, said he was \"pleased to see the Sixth Circuit Court put a stay on this disastrous and burdensome regulation,\" which he called \"another example of the federal government overstepping its jurisdiction at the expense of the states.\" The House passed the bill but the Senate did not, and President Barack Obama has said he would veto the bill if it came to his desk.\n\"I call on the EPA to withdraw this costly regulation and start from scratch,\" said Gibbs, saying the EPA should collaborate with states to come up with a replacement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:43:09.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
