His original petition to Parliament in 2002 promoted the government to introduce a small benefit payment to donors. \n\" I welcome any initiative that will improve the organ donor rate but will press the committee for much more than the Bills proposed level of compensation for live donors.\" \nThe Bill currently proposes a level similar to ACC where the live donor would get 80% of their income reimbursed. \nTookey suggests that if passed in its current form we should rename the Bill to \"Save a life - Lose 20% of your wages Bill.\" \n\"Live donors not only save lives, but each donor saves the health system $120,000. Even if they were given 100% of their wages they still lose money due to the many other costs they face. Is 80% of your wages all the the Gift of Life worth?\" \n14 year old Katie Tookey hopes to address the committee also. \nKatie who has a liver disease that will require a liver transplant last appeared in front of the Health Select Committee aged 5. \n\"She caused quite a stir when she last appeared. I hope she will this time now she is old enough to speak to them on the subject.\" \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:47:00.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
