Lovey refrained from delving into the reason behind her sudden exit, but a source revealed that the makers of the show are still hoping to get her back.\n“We’d like to give it one more shot to see if she is willing to change her decision, as we feel that over time her character of Paridhi has established a strong connect with the viewers,” said a source from the production team.\nThe crew has been shooting for around two weeks without Lovey’s character Paridhi, with the makers trying to find a good reason to explain her absence in the storyline. They are also twisting and turning the story around so that the focus moves to other characters.\nMeanwhile...\nWhile on the topic of quitting shows, we hear Garima Parihar, known as Nimmi on Mere Angne Mein, is quitting the show too. If sources are to be believed, Garima is getting married and will move to the US, where her fiancé lives. The news has come as a rude shock to the makers of the show who are trying hard to find a replacement for Garima.\n Lovey Sasan Paridhi Modi Saath Nibhana Saathiya TV Serail entertainment Also Read Sushmita can turn into Hitler Kate Winslet annoyed with post-baby figure craze B-Town condoles filmmaker Daggubati Ramanaidu's death Sonam kapoor sports quirky glasses", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/LOVEY%20SASAN.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/LOVEY%20SASAN.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/entertainment-tvmusic/article/paridhi-quit-saath-nibhana-saathiya"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:49:44.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
