The email was sent from Smith’s Jones County Junior College account, prompting those with 42 For Better Schools campaign to submit a public records request for Smith’s emails and to ask the auditor’s office to investigate. Mississippi law prohibits state employees from using resources, equipment and time to advocate or campaign for or against any political issue. In another email to Smith from Holmes County Community College President Jim Haffey, Haffey tells Smith he would like to donate to the anti-42 PAC (IMPIC) Smith had suggested in his email to other presidents, but does not want his name associated with the donation.
