They were faced with hurriedly adapting to a colder climate, wearing boots for the first time and being served stodgy food after a lifetime diet of predominantly fish and fruit. Inevitably, severe illness took a big toll. \n\"This year Niueans will remember those who did not make it home and the bravery of those who ventured into a world they knew nothing of. \n\"I look forward to being part of the country’s commemoration. I am also delighted to return to Niue, to look over aid projects and developments past and present.\" \nMr Peters will also be guest speaker at tonight’s Niue RSA’s reception. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
