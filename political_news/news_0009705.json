We were having lunch in the Hudson Valley, after a nature hike. Curiously we listened, an unwilling audience hearing a racist riddle unfold.\n\"The sergeant hands out tools, and gives the Jew a shovel,\" the man projected. He was in his 40s with short brown hair, dressed in a well-worn tee shirt and jeans. \"The Jew asks if they have one with a motor. The officer says, 'Did you ever see a shovel with a motor?' And the Jew replies, 'Did you ever see a Jew with a shovel?'\" (Get it? It plays on the old dumb stereotype that Jews won't break a sweat, will always pay others to do things for them.)\n\"He told the joke for our benefit,\" my husband whispered.\n\"You're being paranoid,\" I insisted.\n\"Did you hear how loudly he spoke?\"\n\"Maybe it's just a coincidence,\" I hoped.\nI was born in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, amid tribesmen (Orthodox, Conservative, Reformed), Italians and Irish. We not only co-existed, but became friends. No one would have told a demeaning joke about each other. Occasionally I heard landsmen ridicule themselves. Yet I'd never heard an anti-Semitic joke bellow through a crowded restaurant.\nWhether it was because he recognized us as \"the other,\" his words were alarming. Yet he laughed heartily and sipped his coffee, before explaining the punchline to the stumped white-haired octogenarian across from him, probably his grandmother.\nWe sometimes forget how immune we are to prejudice in New York City. I raised my daughter in a melting pot of Hare Krishnas to transgenders. I sent her to a Quaker school, where truths are \"deepened by welcoming people with diverse experiences of the world into our community.\" She baked cupcakes for LGBT fund-raisers.\nIn college, she watched a Jewish friend teach her Christian roommate to write her name in Hebrew. Her 26-year-old boyfriend stormed through the dorm, yelling, \"I'll kill anyone who makes my girlfriend into a Jew.\" Police barred him from campus.\nDecades earlier, I migrated from Brooklyn to Ohio. My mother examined the nametags on every door in my dorm, worried I was outnumbered. That night a dozen girls huddled over the three Jewish freshmen in the lounge, demanding, \"Where are your horns?\"\nAway from small towns and farms for the first time, they'd never met a Jew. Now there were three, sharing their bathroom. The heckling continued. I didn't want to follow my ancestors, fleeing for safety in numbers with \"their own kind.\" But I was 17, as apprehensive of the unknown as my dorm-mates. We moved to Taylor Tower, nicknamed Taylor Temple because of how many residents had been bat mitzvahed. Our own shtetl. This taught me more about the world than any history class.\nAnd here it was again. Driving home, I texted my friend, child of Holocaust survivors. \"Did you confront the joke teller?\" she asked.\nA half-Jewish friend agreed, remarking, \"You got a good joke out of it, and a reminder of how much we're hated.\"\nAlthough I could see the joke's humor, I felt uncomfortable laughing â€” especially because anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. and Europe rose 38% in 2014, \"one of the worst years in the last decade\" according to a startling study by Tel Aviv University Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry.\nJews feel safer settling into liberal enclaves. But when we edge further into the world, we must be ready for unsuspected jolts of anti-Semitism. My daughter left to study in Paris the day after the Charlie Hebdo massacre. My instinct was to warn her not to volunteer her heritage unless asked, even though it was wrong to hide. Her Catholic host mother offered to remove the cross above her new bed. They shared after-church dinners on Sundays, and she bought them their first challah from a bakery in the old Jewish quarter.\n\"It's not the Parisians who are anti-Semitic,\" a Moroccan neighbor assured me. \"They have five million Muslims to hate now,\" she claimed, France's second-largest ethnic group.\nI did not find solace in anyone hating someone even more than Jews. This won't console me the next time I hear a disparaging joke about my people. Nor will I be surprised.\nSchulman is a writer in New York.\nRelated Stories Mayor de Blasio says he 'stands with Israel' Man wanted for Molotov cocktail was aiming at local merchant Richard Cohen: Trump, Farrakhan and the pitchfork Carson defends comments linking gun control to Holocaust Neo-Nazi charged in Jewish center killings starts trial", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:16:02.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
