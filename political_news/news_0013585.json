Just like global warming, and evolution I'm not an expert in environmental science, or biology, but because the people who do study these subjects claim global warming and evolution is real I accept it If someone for whatever reason decided to deny another kind of science for example flat earthers, then should I be considered a round earther? Even though im just going along with whatever basic science tells us? I am not an evolutionists, or climate changeist, anymore than i am a round earther. So whats a good word for someone who denies basic science? and whats a good word for someone believes in basic science? They are plain and simple Conspiracy Theorists but, just for fun maybe they could be called 'Scoofers' (Science Troofers).
