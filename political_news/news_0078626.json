In 2004, a plan was floated to undo the ban, but it failed.\nA few years later, International Speedway Corp. eyed Aurora for a new NASCAR racetrack, but the slumping economy halted that plan.\nISC and NASCAR have no plans to build a racetrack here in the foreseeable future, Mounier said.\nBut if they come calling again, Mounier wants Aurora to be ready to offer financial incentives should the city want a racetrack.\n\"Absolutely no one has contacted me or anyone else regarding building a racetrack, and they won't as long as the language is in the charter,\" Mounier said.\nISC spokeswoman Gentry Baumline-Robinson said there is \"nothing brewing\" regarding a racetrack in Aurora.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:16:47.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
