David Woodsome Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 4:18 PM Updated Oct 16, 2015 at 4:18 PM By Sen. David Woodsome Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 4:18 PM The recent troubling news of more Maine (paper) mills shutting down has ignited a discussion about energy costs in the state. While there are other factors involved in the shutting of the mills, the high cost of energy is certainly a necessary discussion. It is true that Maine’s energy costs are among the highest in the nation, and that is not only prohibitive to individual residential ratepayers, but also to large businesses who consume huge amounts of electricity merely to open each day. While I certainly was aware of the issue before starting in the Legislature, it became clearer and clearer to me as chair of the Energy Committee that action needs to be taken. During the last legislative session, we considered dozens of bills related to Maine’s energy policy. Among those were many aimed at reducing the cost of energy in the state, including several proposals from Governor LePage. The Committee sent four of those bills to the Legislature, voted down one, and carried over two – meaning they will be considered during the upcoming legislative session. The last legislative session presented its share of challenges due to the fact we were operating in a divided government – a Republican-led Senate, a Democrat-led House, some committees with Democrat majorities and others with Republican majorities. We also have an executive branch that has been unwilling to compromise and to work with the Legislature. In that environment, it is frankly surprising that any legislation on any topic passed! Unfortunately, certain energy measures that passed in the Energy Committee and were passed in the Senate, met an untimely end in the House. Among the bills was one that would have lifted the 100 megawatt cap on hydropower, allowing Maine to take better advantage of hydropower available from Canada. By doing so, prices for Maine ratepayers would be driven down as supply of energy increased. Another measure which passed in the Senate but failed in the House was LD 1314, “An Act To Establish Primary Energy Goals for the State,” which would have laid out Maine’s goals and focus on both lowering the cost of electricity while dealing with air pollution. A third bill, which met the same fate as the prior two, would have repealed Maine’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). While encouraging renewable energy sources is certainly valuable, doing so as Maine has been has increased costs to ratepayers. In fact, just leaving the RPS in place for another year is estimated to be costing Mainers $12 million! Renewable sources are more expensive forms of energy, and the RPS is a government mandate to have certain levels of those renewable sources. A repeal of the RPS would have made Maine’s energy market more competitive without the government picking winners and losers. I was particularly disappointed to see this legislation fail in the House, as it was a bill I sponsored and was heavily involved with. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Mark Eves, has spoken much about job creation recently. Perhaps in the coming session we will be more successful in having Democrat leadership and Democrat House members understand the urgency of addressing high energy costs as it relates to job creation. We will have at least two energy bills of import to tackle when we reconvene in January, and one in particular will be a boost for employers in the state. LD 1398, one of the measures proposed by the governor and sponsored by my colleague Sen. Garrett Mason, would increase the amount of money that goes back to business ratepayers from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative Trust Fund. Currently 15 percent of the funds are returned to businesses, and this bill increases it to 55 percent. Certainly no one thing is going to be the magic bullet for Maine’s economy or energy costs, but with each step we take we can improve the situation. We did well in the Senate this year, but the obstruction we faced in the House prevented passage of solid energy policy reform. I am hopeful that 2016 will be different. It needs to be different – for Maine’s industries, for families with energy bills who need costs to go down, and who need the jobs provided by Maine industries to pay their bills Sen.
