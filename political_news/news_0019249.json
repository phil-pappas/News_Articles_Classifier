Picture: DAYLIN PAUL Related articles ANC’s electoral maize and other not-so miner issues Shake-up ahead of key ANC meeting Zuma could stay if anti-Ramaphosa group wins In this article Companies and organisations: African National Congress THE African National Congress (ANC) will subject its aspiring councillors to thorough screening and questioning by the communities they hope to serve after next year’s municipal elections.\nThe party has adopted more stringent guidelines for its branch structures to follow before choosing representatives.\nThe ANC also wants 60% of its candidates to have local government experience.\nParty deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said that despite the hiccups experienced in 2011, when the new selection process was introduced, subjecting candidates to the approval of communities was a \"mechanism that worked\".\n\"It takes the power back to the people; they must choose,\" Ms Duarte said.\n\"Candidates must resonate with their communities and must be known,\" she said.\nBranches will hold meetings to nominate candidates and present them to community meetings. In terms of the guidelines, the meetings can be attended only by registered voters in the ward.\nShortlisted candidates will be presented to communities and asked what they have done for their communities, what the main problems in their ward are, how the candidate will strengthen the work of councillors if elected and what skills the individual brings to the council. Community members may then ask a maximum of two questions of each candidate.\nThe ANC subjected its candidates to community scrutiny for the first time before the last local government elections. But this caused friction, leading to an investigation headed by party national executive committee member Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. This resulted to elections in some wards being rerun.\nAccording to the party’s 2016 candidate selection guidelines, the process of nominating candidates by ANC branches is expected to be concluded in a week’s time.\nMeetings with communities should be concluded by the end of the month.\nNext year’s municipal elections take place amid economic decline, job losses and a power crisis. Opposition parties are eyeing key metros in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng where ANC support has slipped.\nMs Duarte said a key focus for the ANC next year would be resolving local issues in municipalities.\nThe candidate selection guidelines spell out requirements for councillors, including that they should lead by example, listen to the community, understand ANC policies and reject factionalism.\nThe ANC has also outlined principles to avoid the problems that arose during the 2011 process. These include that all candidates should agree to the party’s disciplinary rules, selection process rules and decisions taken.\nAbout 60% of the ANC’s councillor candidates are required to have served in local government. Potential candidates will be screened for whether they have been found guilty of any offences in ANC disciplinary actions, have been found guilty of a crime by a court of law, have a criminal record after 1990, have been found guilty in a government or employment disciplinary process, or have civil judgments against them. They also have to show service in the party for at least six months.\nPolitical analyst Ebrahim Fakir, manager of governance institutions and processes at the Electoral Institute for the Sustainability of Democracy in Africa, said subjecting councillors to community scrutiny was always a good element of a campaign, but councillors had to be engaged with communities after they were elected.\nChoosing candidates was a tricky balance between attitude and skill — with \"attitude\" referring to the willingness to implement party policies, engaging and interacting with communities, and \"skill\" referring to the technical side of governing, including administrative prowess, he said.\nWhile the ANC would continue to choose candidates, popularising them through community meetings was essential to avoid perceptions that the party was \"imposing\" people, as had happened in the past, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:22:06.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
