SMITHAssociated Press Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 2:33 pm Updated at 2:51 PM PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP)— Fresh off a presidential debate performance that was widely panned as inadequate, Democrat Lincoln Chafee says he raised just $11,000 in the third quarter — an amount that represented a rounding error for the other Democratic candidates. Chafee, the former one-term governor of Rhode Island, said in a filing with the Federal Election Commission that he raised $11,336 in contributions from people other than himself in the three months ended Sept. 30. The total amounts to around .04 percent of what rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each raised in the same period. Clinton raised $29 million, and Sanders raised $26 million. It's also just around 1 percent of the amounts raised by the other two candidates on Tuesday's debate stage: Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley ($1.2 million), and ex-Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia ($700,000). Sanders spent the same amount of money, $11,000, on his gas tab during the same period. Chafee's spokeswoman said Friday that Chafee has not considered dropping out of the race. \"I am disappointed in the fundraising but I knew I could never compete with the Clinton machine. I have always envisioned running a different kind of campaign by necessity,\" Chafee said in a written statement. Here's a look at some other numbers on Chafee's finances: — Chafee paid out of pocket for $4,121.86 in various expenses, something neither Clinton nor Sanders did. Chafee has driven himself to dozens of campaign events in New Hampshire, and even to Iowa. His fundraising reports show him spending his own money on hotels and gas. — Chafee reported paying $2.75 for a parking meter in Washington, and $293.46 to Facebook for advertising out of his own pocket. — Chafee has raised only $40,000 in contributions from people other than himself. That's one-tenth of the amount of contributions Clinton refunded in the period: $406,000. — Chafee spent $60,000 total in the period, the same amount Clinton spent on postage. — Chafee has spent around $123,000 on his campaign since announcing he was running in June. That's around the same amount that Sanders spent in the third quarter alone to rent sites to hold campaign events. — Most of Chafee's campaign money has come from $363,000 in loans he gave to himself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:29:59.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
