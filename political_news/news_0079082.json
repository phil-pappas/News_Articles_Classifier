The lawyers say harm is being done to the families and their children who need birth certificates to enroll in school and ensure parental rights. \nDozens of families and children sued the Texas Department of State Health Services after local authorities refused various foreign identifications. The state agency wants the suit dismissed. \nThe parents, from Mexico and Central America, aren’t U.S. citizens. The Constitution guarantees the right of citizenship to their children because they were U.S-born. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:48:05.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
