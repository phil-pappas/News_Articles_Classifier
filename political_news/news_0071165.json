The Supreme Court on Oct. 5, 2015, put a change in place that prohibits lawyers who are members of the Supreme Court bar from hiring \"line standers\" to hold their place for seats to big arguments. The practice is common for congressional hearings, and has become more so in recent years for high-profile high court cases, including those involving gay marriage and the Obama health care overhaul. Lawyers who are part of the Supreme Court bar have access to a reserved section toward the front of the courtroom, and their odds of getting in are better than those for the general public. But now they will have to wait in line themselves if they want seats in the special section.
