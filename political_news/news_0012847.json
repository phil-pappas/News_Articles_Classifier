Ltd. (TWSE: 2325, NASDAQ: SPIL) (the \"Company\") filed a civil lawsuit against Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (TWSE 2311, NYSE: ASX) (\"ASE\") in ASE's domicile at the Kaohsiung District Court at 9:30 AM on October 15, 2015 , requesting the court to confirm ASE does not have the right to request registration as a shareholder in the Company's shareholder register.\nASE conducted a tender offer of the Company's issued common shares and American Depositary Receipts between August 24 and September 22, 2015 , claiming in its tender offer prospectus and at numerous public occasions that its tender offer was a \"purely financial investment\". However, ASE, both during the tender offer period and after its completion, has acted with a competitor's mindset, repeatedly criticizing the Company's proposed strategic alliance with Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. and aggressively intervening in the Company's business operations, even clearly stating in its lawsuit that the proposed strategic alliance will affect the number of the Company's board of director seats it can obtain. These various actions reveal ASE's \"financial investment\" was in name only, when in actuality ASE is attempting to directly and indirectly control the Company's business operations. SPIL believes ASE's tender offer prospectus was a sham, concealing the true purpose of ASE's tender offer, thereby ASE's tender offer violated the Securities and Exchange Act, Fair Trade Act and other related regulations and breaching public order, and thus should be invalid.\nThe Company, in order to protect the rights of Company and all its shareholders, is appealing to the court to right the injustice of ASE's tender offer. Once the court issues a judgment in this case, the Company shall lawfully proceed with all procedures.\nContact:\nSiliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd.\nNo.45, Jieh Show Rd.\nHsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu\nTaiwan , 30056\nwww.spil.com.tw\nJanet Chen , IR Director\njanet@spil.com.tw\n+886-3-5795678#3675\nByron Chiang , Spokesperson\nbyronc@spil.com.tw\n+886-3-5795678#3671\n releases/spil-is-filing-a-lawsuit-against-advanced-semiconductor-engineering-inc-300160490.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=HK29187&Transmission_Id=201510151106PR_NEWS_USPR_____HK29187&DateId=20151015", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spil-is-filing-a-lawsuit-against-advanced-semiconductor-engineering-inc-300160490.html", "http://www.spil.com.tw/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:51:15.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
