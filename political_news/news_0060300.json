On the contrary, he is a foolish and naive boob. He proved it yet again today when he expressed his disapproval with the Israeli governments’ urging that its citizens arm themselves (“self-help”) in the wake of all the Palestinian attacks. The latest this weekend involved a Palestinian storming a bus station and shooting up the place. A policeman was killed and ten others wounded before the gunman was killed.\nMeanwhile, boob Kerry’s negotiating partner, Mahmoud Abbas, is celebrating “every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem” while Hamas puts out a handbook on “how to stab a Jew”.\nNot how to stab an Israeli. Not how to stab a Zionist. How to stab a Jew.\nBut none of this gets through Kerry’s thick head. He is on his way to the Middle East yet again to try and do what he has been unable to do-bring about agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. The language that he and President Obama use indicates a moral equivalency between Israeli and knife-wielding Palestinians. It is an absurdity, and Kerry’s latest remarks are obscene.", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Fousesquawk/~4/vZA6lOXi47A", "http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2015/10/19/kerry-urges-israelis-to-restrain-from-any-kind-of-self-help/?utm_source=twitterfeed&#038;utm_medium=twitter"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:00:25.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
