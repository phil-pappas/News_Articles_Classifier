(AP) - The husband of former U.S. Senate candidate Annette Bosworth has been indicted on election law violations in connection with his wife’s problematic 2014 campaign. \nA Hughes County indictment charges Chad Haber with one count each of offering false or forged instrument for filing and perjury. \nAuthorities say Haber turned in a petition nominating his wife Annette Bosworth that included false or forged signatures. \nA former candidate for state attorney general, Haber, says he received the court summons Saturday and is expected to appear in court later this month. He says the charges are unfounded. \nA jury in May found Bosworth guilty of six counts each of perjury and filing false documents in connection with her campaign petitions. She avoided serving prison time when a judge handed down a suspended sentence. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:29:56.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
