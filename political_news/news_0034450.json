Since the morning 27% percent of polling has been registered till 11 am with the highest 34% posted in Khagaria. \nThe BJP , which had an edge hardly 15 days ago, seems to be losing it. This is in part to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s promise of “good governance” against Lalu Prasad’s “jungle raj”. The BJP had hoped that by doing so it can make Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar go into the background. But instead Kumar has emerged as a dignified statesman; even his choice of words, they say, placed him above the fray, the RSS sources. \nModi urged the youth to vote extensively in the elections and electricity, beef and drinking water are issues that are highlighted in the elections. The BJP -led alliance and the grand coalition are in a “neck-and-neck” fight, with many shifts in the pollscape. There are as many as 583 candidates, of which 20 are crorepatis, in the fray with 1.53 crore voters. \nWith BJP referring to Prasad’s “jungle raj” and calling him a chara-chor (fodder thief) appears to have backfired, it has not only united Yadavs but also made them quite “aggressive”. In last year’s Lok Sabha polls, a sizeable chunk of young Yadavs had voted for Modi , but this time the BJP has failed dent the Yadav votebank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:37:41.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
