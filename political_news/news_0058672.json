Timing has not been decided, but the Treasury Department says the nation's borrowing limit needs to be raised by Nov. 5, and Boehner (R-Ohio) would like to resolve the issue before a new speaker is sworn in. Boehner expects to step down Oct. 30. His office declined to comment for this story.\nBoehner is in discussions with Senate leadership and the White House over a budget package that would include raising the debt ceiling, but House GOP aides do not expect the talks to produce an agreement. GOP leadership aides have discussed passing a standalone debt limit bill should the talks break down. Many senior Republican aides and lawmakers see a \"clean\" debt limit bill as the only real option.\nPlans have not been finalized, according to GOP sources.\nRaising the debt cap is among the thorniest issues for House Republicans. In 2011, Boehner set the standard that anytime Congress raised the debt ceiling, it should be accompanied by corresponding spending reductions. Since then, Congress has consistently sparred over lifting the nation's borrowing limit.\nBoehner's exit date from Congress is unclear. House Republicans still have not scheduled internal party elections to choose their nominee to replace Boehner. Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is considering a bid for speaker, but is unlikely to decide until Congress returns next week.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:28:41.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
