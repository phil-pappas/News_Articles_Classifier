(Waldo Swiegers/Bloomberg) October 22 at 5:55 PM Regarding the Oct. 14 news article “ Timing is everything in Ebola response, study says ”:\nWhy didn’t the British and U.S. governments act quicker to build treatment centers? I was part of a group that pushed the U.S. government to move. Sierra Leone requested military field hospitals from Britain and the United States on Sept. 2, 2014. Five days later, on Sept. 7, President Obama announced he would send military engineers to Liberia to build Ebola treatment units . But he gave the U.S. Agency for International Development the lead role and instructed the Army to follow its efforts.\nUSAID decided to build treatment centers from scratch rather than use the Army’s hundreds of field hospitals, which could have been set up within two weeks and are scalable, easily modified and easily moved. Concurrent with that decision, the White House told the Army to step down requests for Army doctors. The result was a four-month delay and thousands of unnecessary deaths. Mr. Obama and USAID should explain their decisions.\nGary H. Maybarduk , Reston\nThe writer was deputy chief of mission in Sierra Leone from 1988 to 1991.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/world/africa/idle-ebola-clinics-in-liberia-are-seen-as-misstep-in-us-relief-effort.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/world/africa/obama-to-bring-most-military-personnel-fighting-ebola-home-officials-say.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:34:02.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
