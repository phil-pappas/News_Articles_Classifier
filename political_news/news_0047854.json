The Depression-era law, which put a wall of separation between investment and commercial banking, was repealed under President Bill Clinton in 1999. The most important effect of its repeal, wrote Public Citizen president Robert Weissman, \"was to change the culture of commercial banking to emulate Wall Street's high-risk speculative betting approach.\" Clinton's newly unveiled plan puts her approach to Wall Street reform squarely at odds with her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Gov. Martin OMalley (D-Md.). Sanders, for his part, has given his support to the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, which aims to \"reduce risk in the financial system and dial back the likelihood of future financial crises.\" Explaining her plan in a Bloomberg op-ed, Clinton writes that she would \"increas[e] resources for the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate and prosecute executives for financial crimes;\"\"strengthen and enforce the Volcker Rule so banks cant make risky and speculative trading bets with taxpayer-backed money;\"\"give regulators the authority they need to reorganize, downsize or even break apart any financial institution that is too large and risky to be managed effectively;\" and put a tax on some high-frequency tax trades. Nothing says \"I am paid by Wall Street\" more than the REFUSAL to reinstate Glass-Steagall and telling people \"we will investigate\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:40:13.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
