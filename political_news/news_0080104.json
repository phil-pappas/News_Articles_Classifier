The move, which will affect five full-time employees and 20 part-timers, will be effective Nov. 1 and save the district $135,380 this year and help mend a projected budget deficit of $150,000 to $200,000, officials said.\n\"None of us here ever thought we would reach this point,\" Joe Mitternight, chairman of the fire district's Board of Commissioners said after the vote. \"If we saw a way to continue it, we would certainly do it.\"\nAnother board member, Dr. Jim Woodard, blamed the situation on the administration, calling the situation \"extremely dysfunctional.\"\nWhile officials said the ambulance program provided stellar service to the citizens of the Covington-area district, it does not work financially.\nThe board also made the following moves to address financial problems at the fire department:\nAuthorized its bond attorney move forward with the issuance of up to $800,000 in tax certificates, similar to a bond issue, to help the department make financial ends meet this year and assist with financial troubles looming in 2016. Officials said the department would not necessarily need the entire amount. Authorized the early retirement of $1.9 million in bonds using unspent bond proceeds that had been earmarked for capital improvement projects. The early repayment of the bonds, issued in 2012, will relieve the department of annual debt service payments of $165,000 to $175,000 per year, said bond attorney C. Grant Schlueter, of the firm Foley & Judell. Approved the refinancing and extension of $2.8 million in outstanding debt from a $3.2 million tax certificate issue in 2014. The move will reduce the department's debt service but could cost taxpayers as much as $345,000 in the long run due to fees and differences in interest rates, officials have said. The moves came during a lengthy, and often tense, meeting of the fire board at the district's main fire station near Covington. The Parish Council last week accused fire department leaders of mismanagement and asked the district attorney's office and Louisiana Legislative Auditor to investigate the fire district for possible malfeasance and criminal activity.\nMitternight has said the ambulance service was supposed to generate revenue but became a liability because of limited insurance reimbursements and delays in receiving the payments. Those problems, coupled with flat property tax revenue and rising costs, put the fire department in a financial hole, he told the council.\nCouncil members raised questions about the department's operations, including six-figure salaries for some administrators and employing a fulltime attorney at a cost of more than $100,000 a year, an arrangement other parish fire departments do not have. Several members of the council said the ambulance service should be scrapped.\nThe council also questioned the projected revenue figures the fire district used to justify its decision to get into the ambulance business, saying they were higher than figures provided by the parish government. The council also asked why a fire department administrator signed a contract with a third-party billing firm without board approval.\nOn Tuesday, board member Woodard made a motion to initiate an internal investigation of the 2015 budget, how it was put together, and the signing of the contract by Assistant Chief Steve Krentel.\n\" If we sit back and do nothing, then we become complicit . . . and it becomes a whitewash and a cover-up,\" Woodard said. \"My name was been smeared, and I am not happy.\"\nHe said the ambulance program was put together in good faith but the board might have been \"totally mislead\" by the administration regarding projected revenue. He accused administrators of \"sitting around and having a grand old time\" in a \"party atmosphere\" instead of working.\nHis call for a internal probe did not receive a second. Other board members noted that the department did not have the capabilities for such an investigation and that the district attorney's office and Legislative Auditor had already been asked by the council to investigate.\nThe DA's office said Tuesday it had already started looking into the fire district's operations prior to the council's request. \"So, we're on a fact-finding mission right now, and based on the results of the information we receive, we will take the appropriate action,\" District Attorney Warren Montgomery said in a statement.\nKrentel said the projected reimbursement of $700 per ambulance run was based on trends and fell well short of the less than $500 actually being received. \"We can't change that,\" he said. \"The climate was different in 2014 than it is today.\"\nHe said he signed the contract with Intermedics, a third-party billing firm, and that the board was aware of the situation every step of the way. \"There was no intent to hide a contract like some choose to mislead. I'm just tired of hearing about it.\"\nMitternight defended the administration, saying the department is not dysfunctional and there were no deliberate attempts to mislead the board. \"Mistakes were probably made. Probably we made some misjudgments.\"\nNone of the moves should reflect badly on the personnel operating the ambulance service, he said. \"None of this is their fault. We have provided premium ambulance service to people. We have saved lives. I think the right decision was made at the time with the information we had.\"\nIt was unclear Tuesday whether the ambulance service employees would lose their jobs or assume other duties at the department.\nOfficials said Acadian Ambulance is ready to step in to provide coverage in the district, which has 25,000 people and surrounds the city of Covington. The department collects 25 mills of property tax and received $6.29 million in general revenue in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T16:50:07.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
