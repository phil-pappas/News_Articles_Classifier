But Tsipras will also outline what the government calls “grey areas” where it believes it can negotiate better terms or find alternative measures with the same fiscal impact.” Sputnik International\nSyriza is reportedly ready to “dive deep” into the IMF structural reform package, wishing to quickly convert the whole of the Greek government into yet another “free market” failed state and behalf of the vulture capitalists circling the carcass of Greek democracy.\nThe Prime Minister admits he fully expects the Greek economy to contract even more for the remainder of this year and all of 2016 but, he claims, the Greek people can look toward some relief in 2017.\n“Tsipras will Monday unveil a painful 2016 draft budget meant to satisfy its international creditors, projecting the economy will stay in recession next year before returning to growth in 2017, in line with the estimates by the country’s lenders.” Sputnik International\nOf course, Mr. Tsipras, taking his cues from the Western spin doctors, tries to turn this into a victory for the people.\nA clear mandate for a four year term. #Syriza will stand tall, it won't be intimidated. This victory belongs to the working classes. #Greece\n— Alexis Tsipras (@tsipras_eu) September 20, 2015\nNot since the “Miracle of Chile” has such a drastic set of IMF economic reforms been imposed on a country. Back then it took a bloody CIA-backed coup and a ruthless dictator to accomplish it. In Greece, all it took was some fraud of a leftist leader and a couple million dollars paying off fake alternative activists like Webster Tarpley to back him and give him a measure of credibility.
