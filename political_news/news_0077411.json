Isn't the issue with that approach that it's a race to the bottom.Somewhere like (say) Luxembourg has about the same population as Croydon and would probably be very happy to receive 1% of all European companies profits if they set a 1% corp tax rate that everyone decided to use. Each citizen would probably be as rich as the average Saudi national.In fact, Luxembourg benefited for years by levying a 15% VAT rate which meant that it was the cheapest in europe and they made shedloads of free money before the EU mandated that companies have to charge the rate at the point of sale.inho, if the EU is good for anything then it must close these loopholes and ensure that money is taxed fairly before it leaves europe,Even within Europe there are loopholes. One of the low countries (I think) doesn't tax income from intellectual property so many multinationals charge a massive fee for use of intellectual property to their subsidiaries; guess where it's paid.There should be a tax law that says something like .. \"if it looks hinky then it is hinky\"ETA: looks like Luxembourg are already onto the intellectual property loophole: http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2008/3/article23.en...
