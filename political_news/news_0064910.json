On parade in ceremonial uniform Coldstreamers take to the crocodile-filled waters of Belize David Wells, a senior news editor at the Western Morning News Comments (0) \nTheir motto proclaims that they are ‘second to none’. \nIt is a declaration made with no exaggeration, given the distinctions that set the Coldstream Guards apart from their military counterparts. \nNot only is the Coldstream renowned for its status as the oldest regiment in the British Army in continuous service, but the Coldstreamers, as the unit’s soldiers are known, have served in every major conflict since their inception 365 years ago. \nTheir ceremonial role as one of the seven regiments in the Household Division – the personal troops and protectors of Her Majesty the Queen – earns them an iconic place in the fabric of British life with their scarlet tunics and bearskins renowned the world over as symbolic of the British military and our love of pomp and circumstance. \nWhat might not be so universally well-known is the connection the Coldstream Guards have to a small village in the middle of the rural North Devon countryside, that dates back to their very beginnings, and how a high proportion of their numbers are made up of soldiers from the Westcountry. \nThe Western Morning News will be exploring more about the Coldstream Guards’ strong ties to the South West and how Coldstreamers prepare for combat, as they have done on foot, by vehicle and by air in recent times, when the newspaper joins the regiment on a jungle training exercise in the rainforest of Belize in Central America. \nDavid Wells, a senior news editor, will be joining Exercise Mayan Warrior, to learn how Coldstreamers train in the jungle, one of the toughest environments on the planet – with Caribbean Sea shorelines to the east and dense jungle inland. \nThe jungle is often extremely difficult to navigate, while finding food, water and shelter is no easy task, so learning to survive and managing military operations under the canopy is an essential skill for troops going out into the field. And when it comes to army training, the jungle of Belize is undoubtedly a tough place to go on exercise – it is hot and humid, in thick forest, with venomous snakes, deadly spiders, and with rivers full of crocodiles, among other challenges – providing a range of tactical obstacles for soldiers to overcome. The modern Coldstreamer has to be equipped with these skills to maintain the flexible nature of the regiment, which has been developed over the centuries, in order to respond to its call of duty anywhere in the world, at any time. \nThe Coldstream might have come a long way since its beginnings in the 1600s but its ties with the Westcountry have grown ever stronger since those early times. \nSince the foundation of the regiment, the unit has predominantly recruited its soldiers from Devon and the South West and, in a geographical association that follows the narrative in the other significant part of their historic story, the regiment also recruits in the North East of England and the region around Coldstream on the borders of Scotland and English Northumberland. \nThe regiment’s links to this region dates back to their very roots with the Devon-born general who founded the unit as an offshoot of the English Civil War’s New Model Army. \nGeorge Monck, later to be made 1st Duke of Albemarle, who founded the Coldstream Guards, was born in 1608 at Great Potheridge, Merton, a village five miles south of Great Torrington in North Devon, later living in Exeter. He raised the unit in June 1650, when Oliver Cromwell appointed Monck to command a New Model Army Regiment. \nDuring the Civil War, Monck gave distinguished service as an officer in the Royalist Army until he was captured by Parliamentarian forces and persuaded to support the Commonwealth. \nCromwell, the Lord Protector, created the new regiment for Monck, which was at the time based in the small Scottish town of Coldstream – cementing the regiment’s name, and its connection to that region, in history. \nIts infantry has gone on to prove itself to be ‘second to none’– as in its motto Nulli Secundus – in combat operations worldwide throughout its history. \nThe same fighting spirit and professionalism that its soldiers displayed at Waterloo, during the Crimea and in some of the bloodiest battles of First and Second World Wars, has been shown in operations in more recent times in Iraq and in Afghanistan – not least in the bravery shown by Guardsman Christopher King, 20, from West Buckland, Devon, and Lance Corporal Darren Hicks, 29, from Mousehole, Cornwall, who both gave their lives while serving with the Coldstream Guards on operations in Afghanistan. \nThe Coldstreamers might be known around the world for their ceremonial public displays, such as lining the streets during the recent visit to the UK by China’s President Xi Jinping as he was welcomed by the Queen – but they are very much a combat ready battalion and their training in challenging environments around the world such as this latest Central American exercise is just one of the ways they put their military skills to the test. \nWhile Number 7 Company of the Coldstream Guards was on ceremonial duty for Jinping’s state visit, the rest of the battalion was on exercise deep inside the Belize jungle, where the WMN will catch up with them in the coming days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:08:44.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
