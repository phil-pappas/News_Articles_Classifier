That includes almost 60 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and children who get Social Security benefits.\nThe average monthly Social Security payment is $1,224.\nThe cost-of-living adjustment is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W, a broad measure of consumer prices generated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It measures price changes for food, housing, clothing, transportation, energy, medical care, recreation and education.\nThe COLA is calculated by comparing consumer prices in July, August and September each year with prices in the same three months from the previous year. If prices go up, benefits go up. If prices drop or stay flat, benefits stay the same.\nThe numbers for July and August show that, overall, consumer prices have fallen since last year. Fuel prices are down by 23 percent from a year ago, according to the August inflation report. But prices for some other goods and services, such as health care and housing, are up.\nThe CPI-W numbers for September are being released Thursday, providing the last piece of the puzzle.\n____\nFollow Stephen Ohlemacher on Twitter at http://twitter.com/stephenatap\n___\nOnline:\nSocial Security Interactive: http://hosted.ap.org/interactives/2015/social-security/\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/stephenatap", "http://hosted.ap.org/interactives/2015/social-security/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:56:10.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
