French warplanes have destroyed a training camp in eastern Syria, President François Hollande announced on Sunday morning.\n“France struck in Syria this morning an Islamic State training camp which threatened the security of our country,” Hollande told journalists at the United Nations, adding that six French jets had struck the IS camp. The French president warned of more strikes in the coming weeks, with the goal of “identifying targets that are training camps or places where we know that the Daesh [also known as IS, ISIS, ISIL] terrorist group can threaten the security of our country.”\nLa France a frappé ce matin en Syrie un camp d’entraînement de Daech. Nous agissons pour trouver une solution en Syrie et nous protéger.\n— François Hollande (@fhollande) September 27, 2015\nHowever, the French president ruled out any ground intervention and said that nothing should be done that would strengthen Assad or help him remain in power. “In the end, Assad must go,” Hollande emphasised. He added, “Civilian populations must be protected from all forms of violence, that of IS and other terrorist groups but also the murderous bombardments of Bashar Assad.”\nThe targets were identified during reconnaissance missions carried out by the French air-force over Syria since September 8 with help from the coalition of Western and Middle Eastern states conducting the air campaign against IS. On September 16, the French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that France would start carrying out its airstrikes against IS in Syria “in coming weeks.”\nUntil now, France has conducted airstrikes against jihadist groups, but it has resisted joining anti-IS campaign in Syria, fearing that it would ultimately provide support for President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.\nThe French government has shifted its position as political pressure mounts over the refugee crisis and the threat of jihadists posed by Islamic State.\nThe announcement of operations in Syria came the day before world leaders gather at the UN General Assembly in New York, where the four-year war in Syria is expected to be at the centre of debate.\nIran and Russia have strong supported Assad’s regime since the beginning of the Syrian civil war, in which at least 240,000 people were killed and millions displaced. In recent weeks, Russia has alarmed the West by increasing its support for the regime and reportedly providing advanced operational equipment and weaponry.\nAs leaders gather at the UN General Assembly, US Secretary of State John Kerry met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday to discuss the situation in Syria. Kerry said that while it was vital to coordinate efforts against Islamic State this was not yet happening.\nOn Saturday, Kerry also discussed Syria with the Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. “I view this week as a major opportunity for any number of countries to play an important role in trying to resolve some of the very difficult issues of the Middle East. We need to achieve peace and a way forward in Syria, in Yemen, in the region itself,” Kerry told journalists.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/fhollande/status/648147123654033408"], "published": "2015-09-28T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:51:02.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
