Colleague: 'Wants to go back to South Carolina, and God bless him for that' Published: 1 hour ago \n(Roll Call) It’s been a wild couple of days for Rep. Trey Gowdy. \nThe three-term South Carolina Republican went from a candidate for majority leader amid the House Republican Conference’s leadership shakeup, to retiring in 2016 to denying that he’s got any plans besides continuing to serve in his current role — all within a roughly 24-hour period. \nThe drama began Tuesday morning, when freshmen Reps. Mia Love of Utah and Lee Zeldin of New York came out to say they’d support Gowdy for majority leader if he were to run. \nBut Rep.
