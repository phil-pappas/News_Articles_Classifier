He was born in the town in 1926, the son of a local solicitor.\nAs his choice of title suggests, he was always proud of his Welsh roots although he was heavily defeated when he stood as Conservative candidate for Aberavon in the 1955 and 1959 elections. He had to look elsewhere to become an MP although he lasted less than two years as MP for Berbington on Merseyside between 1964 and 1966.\nDuring the following four years before he found a safe seat in Surrey, he was at his most involved in Welsh public life. As a barrister he represented NCB managers at the Aberfan inquiry and then chaired the Ely Hospital Inquiry. His report on the mistreatment of children with learning difficulties is still considered a landmark in the history of the NHS and led to major reforms, including a proper system of inspection.\nLast updated Sat 10 Oct 2015 Read more 5 updates Former Chancellor Lord Geoffrey Howe dies aged 88 Politics Wales South Wales Lord Howe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:29:52.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
