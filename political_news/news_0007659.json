(AP) - The only scheduled debate among all the candidates for three open seats on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is just hours away. \nWednesday’s forum at Widener University Law School in Harrisburg comes less than three weeks before the Nov. 3 election. \nSeven candidates are running - three Democrats, three Republicans and an independent. \nTwo of the open seats resulted from the resignations of disgraced justices - a Democrat implicated in a pornographic email scandal and a Republican convicted of corruption for using state-paid staff for political work. \nThe seven-member court itself is under a microscope because of allegations that a second justice is involved in the email scandal and criticism that the court has interfered in disciplinary cases that should have been handled by independent panels required by the state constitution. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:19:07.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
