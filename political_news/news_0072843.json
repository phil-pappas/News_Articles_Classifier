Promoted stories \n“The CCG has made us aware that they are concerned there will not be enough GPs in the city within the next 12 months as so many are retiring.” \nDr Peter Goodall, pictured below, a practice partner for 20 years at the Walnut Tree surgery in Southampton, said care for some conditions is increasingly being moved into the primary care sector and more specifically GPs which is leading to extra workload but without the increase in funding. \nIn Southampton he claimed that during the last 18 months one practice had closed, three had merged with other practices and two had been taken over by private companies. \nNHS England has disputed some of his claims, saying two small practices had merged and another one had closed because the sole GP had retired. It denied that any surgeries were now being run by private companies. \nDr Goodall said: “When you see that 90 per cent of all patient contact with the NHS is with their GP it seems incredible that we get less than 10 per cent of that primary care budget. \n“There is certainly a crisis in the recruitment of GPs. Around a third of all practices in Southampton cannot recruit doctors to fill their vacancies. Either they have had no response or only a handful of applications. \n“Too many GPs are leaving the profession either retiring or just leaving because they have had enough. \n“In the last 12 months six of my colleagues have left the profession before retirement age because of workload pressures and extra regulation.” \nHe said as a result he had seen a drop in the standard of care given to patients. \n“Particularly in the last five years, there has been a significant deterioration in the quality of care we are providing,” Dr Goodall said, “for me that is really sad that we can’t deliver the standard of care we want to.” \nHe said that in the last year along waiting times at his practice alone had rocketed from a one-to-two day wait for an appointment, to a seven-to-ten day wait. \nDr Goodall accused Whitehall of not spending enough on GP-related services in Southampton and complained that the amount was decreasing still further next year. \nNHS England said GP practices across the country were facing pressure from increased demand but claimed it “did not recognise” some of the Southampton-related figures that were being quoted. \nA spokesman said: “Two small practices have merged and one has closed because the GP has retired. No private companies have taken over services.” \nSouthampton Clinical Commissioning Group did not say how many GPs it expects to be working in the city next year, but said there are currently 188 and that the situation in terms of recruiting more GPs “reflects the national position”. \nDr Sue Robinson, the CCG’s clinical chair and a local GP, said a new strategy for developing primary care was being drawn up and added: “We are clear that General Practice has a central role to play in the future provision of health services to our population. Share article \n\"Nonetheless, the changing needs of the city combined with workforce and economic challenges mean that the way care is organised will need to change in order to be sustainable for the future. \n\"By working constructively with our GPs, other care professionals, patients and the public we will be able to define how this can be done successfully.\" Promoted Stories Southampton is facing a health crisis due to a shortage of GPs, according to doctors and council leaders Sorry, an error occurred.

Users of the NHS still have a responsibility they need to face up to, it disgusts me that my surgery has a notice up saying how many hours people have clocked up in missing an appointment. The NHS is not safe in any of the political parties hands and should be run by a committee of people from each political party so they can come up with a long term strategic plan which is signed up to by all the parties. We cannot keep on having a plan which only lasts until the next election! nanana33 \nUsers of the NHS still have a responsibility they need to face up to, it disgusts me that my surgery has a notice up saying how many hours people have clocked up in missing an appointment.

Report Score: 4 rfrank 2:20pm Fri 9 Oct 15 \nMy wife is a GP in the city, she works 2.5 days a week due to childcare etc. I am not involved in the medical profession at all. In 1.5 days so far this week she has worked 19 hours and I fully expect her to exceed 31 by the end of today. None of these hours are put in due to the part time nature of her job, other GP's buddy up to cover the time spent away from the office. The number of GP's in the practice is dropping alarmingly - and this is due to the workload and the almost constant debate about \"money grabbing\" fueled by whoever is in the government. I don't think any one of you would expect to work a 62 hour week (full time), and as for the pocket stuffing - I think it probably works out at £20 an hour when they are all accounted for - and that's being fairly prudent with the hours. There have always been unpaid hours, and long working days. But I have never met a doctor who cared about this, it is a calling and its what they do. The difference here is the change in conditions, effectively taking advantage of this outlook. This cannot be mistaken for them being an easy target and it has been pushed to the point of breaking. There are many cases where people should be paid more, or work less hours - in any profession, and everyone deserves there chance to put that case forward, but many are a lot less vital than our GP's and they deserve more respect from the current and former governments and a fair resolution.
