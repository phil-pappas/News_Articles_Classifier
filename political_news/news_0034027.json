As such, we are expanding our investigations to fully examine any complaints, formal or otherwise, that are brought to our attention. We are undertaking to identify an independent third party to lead this process. We encourage anyone who has a concern to contact the COC. The COC has clear policies that include measures to address harassment of any kind in the workplace. Having a workplace environment that is healthy and safe for all of our employees is critical to our organization, and we will examine every possible way to enhance those protections. We are very concerned by the allegations that have been made and about the well-being of those who may be affected. We are committed to taking any actions required following Mr. Rolland's findings or any other findings.\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C4675&Transmission_Id=201510021346CANADANWWEB______C4675&DateId=20151002", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:54:04.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
