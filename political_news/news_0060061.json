Alas, no, though, really, most Cult Of Climastrology websites seem to be satire, since they seem to be so over the top bat guano insane.

Did the pope’s encyclical on the environment alter the views of American Catholics? Not really . Did his address to Congress sway Republican politicians? No . But that’s okay.\nWe may come to see Pope Francis as the Will & Grace of climate change. That is not to say that he is Will, a compulsive neat freak with perfect hair, or Grace, Will’s self-absorbed counterpart, or even Jack, their persistently flamboyant friend. Rather, the pope is Will & Grace , the show — all of it. He is at once trendy and tendentious, and when he’s not making us laugh and smile, Il Papa is challenging Americans to think hard about the defining issue of our time.\nIf the pontiff’s message on climate change feels inconsequential now, it’s not a flash in the pan. Pope Francis has made the care for our common home a central part of the church’s mission, offering a new avenue for faith leaders to drive home the moral argument for climate action.
