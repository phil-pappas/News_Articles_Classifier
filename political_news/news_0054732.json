File/Staff × Candidates in the Charleston mayor’s race weighed in on development, keeping the city affordable and the future without Joe Riley at the helm, at the largest forum held so far. \nOnline \nTo stay up-to-date on the race for Charleston’s next mayor, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android . Several hundred people attended the event at the Charleston Music Hall. Most of the forums so far have been smaller, more intimate gatherings. Six candidates are running for the city’s top post: Ginny Deerin, William Dudley Gregorie, Toby Smith, Leon Stavrinakis, John Tecklenburg and Maurice Washington. Each one hopes to replace Riley, who has led the city for 40 years. Forum organizers asked the candidates questions concerning: the city’s planning and development process, economic development, affordability and plans for running city government after Riley steps down. Deerin, founder of the nonprofit WINGS for Kids and Riley’s former campaign manager, said she has the courage to stand up to developers who want to overdevelop portions of the city or build developments that are too dense. “I will be a mayor with a strong backbone who can say ‘no’ to The Beach Co. or any other developer.” Deerin was referring to The Beach Co.’s plan to redevelop the Sergeant Jasper apartments site downtown to more dense development. The tri-county population is expected to reach 1 million by 2027, according to a 2014 study by the Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce and the Charleston Regional Development Alliance. The Charleston region is one of the highest-priced markets for a home among comparable Southeastern cities and continuing the tradition of building new homes farther inland and away from job centers will only exacerbate congestion and other transportation issues, the study said. About 43 new residents call Charleston home every day. Washington, a local businessman, said the city should have infrastructure, such as roads, in place before it allows more development. “Put the brakes on overdevelopment” he said. “It’s killing our quality of life.” Smith, executive director of Midland Park Community Ministries, said she would work to reverse gentrification. “If we’re not careful, we’re looking at the last generation of blacks on the peninsula,” she said. Tecklenburg, another businessman, said the city’s economy is strong, especially in tourism, port activity and the new and growing knowledge economy. But a lot of local people aren’t getting the new jobs, he said. “Our economy is bright, but what concerns me is that not everyone has come along with our success.” As mayor, he said, he would focus on preparing students for those jobs. He also would support local businesses. Gregorie, a Charleston city councilman and former administrator with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, said one of the things he will push for is affordable housing. That’s essential for everybody, especially poor people and young people, he said. “As mayor,” Gregorie said, “you will see an affordable housing building program like you’ve never seen before.” Stavrinakis, a state representative and former Charleston County Council chairman, said the next mayor faces a big challenge. Some of the longtime leaders in Riley’s administration might move on, he said. “The challenge will be to make sure the organization is stable.” Stavrinakis said he has the experience to do that. As chairman of County Council, he said, he was ultimately responsible for a $60 million budget and 2,000 employees. The forum on development and growth was sponsored by Lowcountry Local First, the Preservation Society of Charleston, the SC Community Loan Fund and If You Were Mayor. Charleston voters go to the polls Nov. 3, with a Nov. 17 runoff likely. Reach Diane Knich at 937-5491 or on Twitter @dianeknich.
