Mr Lloyd is taking up the position of chief executive for the Local Government Association.\nThe arrangement will save Peterborough City Council £110,000 per year.\n\"I believe a shared chief executive will give our city and the county a stronger voice nationally to promote economic development in the area, as well as creating greater opportunities for jointly commissioned services and sharing of best practice between the two authorities.\"\n– Cllr John Holdich, Leader of Peterborough City Council Last updated Thu 15 Oct 2015 Politics Cambridgeshire Peterborough", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:19:00.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
