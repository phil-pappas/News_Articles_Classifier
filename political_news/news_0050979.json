Chesapeake Urology is the only urology practice in the Mid-Atlantic region with such a comprehensive and full-service OAB program.\n\"Overactive bladder affects millions of women in the United States , but is often under-diagnosed or under-treated,\" states Andrew Shapiro , M.D., Director of Chesapeake Urology's Continence Program. \"Our comprehensive OAB program includes a dedicated team of OAB specialists that understands that when it comes to overactive bladder symptoms, there's no one-size-fits-all fix. Every woman is unique and our program takes an individualized approach to managing this condition and restoring a woman's quality of life.\"\nTreatment Pathway Leads to Better Symptom Management\nOveractive bladder is a group of urinary symptoms such as an uncontrollable urge to urinate or urine leakage caused by this frequent urge. While there is no cure for OAB, there are many options for managing symptoms successfully for the long term. One of the unique aspects of Chesapeake Urology's OAB program is the treatment pathway, which follows a systematic approach to symptom management and is consistent with the American Urological Association's guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OAB:\nFirst Line Therapies – Management of OAB begins with a comprehensive evaluation to help identify the cause of the symptoms. Once the condition has been diagnosed as overactive bladder, conservative approaches to symptom management such as pelvic health physical therapy, behavioral and lifestyle modifications and OAB medications are prescribed. Evaluation and Diagnostics - Patients are then re-evaluated by their provider. If first line treatments are not effective in the management of OAB symptoms, cystoscopy or urodynamic studies are employed. Urodynamic studies help the urologist determine the source of OAB symptoms and the best course of treatment. Advanced Treatment Options - Advanced therapies including neuromodulation (Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation/PTNS or Urgent PC® and Interstim® Therapy) and Botox® bladder injections may be part of a patient's plan of care when first line treatments are not effective. Dedicated OAB Specialists Set Chesapeake Urology's Program Apart\nChesapeake Urology's OAB program is staffed by fellowship trained incontinence specialists as well as dedicated female urology specialists. While most urologists help patients manage the symptoms of OAB, Chesapeake Urology's OAB program offers the added benefit of OAB specialists experienced in the latest therapies for managing more complex cases.\nAdditionally, an OAB care team works with each patient. These professionals include a women's health nurse practitioner, an OAB patient navigator, urodynamicists for more advanced diagnostics, and pelvic floor physical therapists, all working together to provide a seamless continuum of care.\nOAB Patient Navigator, Nurse Practitioner Walk Patients Through Every Step of Treatment Process\nUnderstanding that OAB is a very personal health issue that may be embarrassing or a source of great anxiety for women, Chesapeake Urology's program includes the care of a woman's health nurse practitioner and dedicated patient navigator. The nurse practitioner works closely with OAB patients, playing an active role in overall care and providing needed support. The patient navigator, a registered nurse with special training in OAB, serves as a patient's advocate and support resource, working directly with the urologists to coordinate care including scheduling appointments for testing, physical therapy consultations and surgical procedures. As important, the patient navigator listens to patients' concerns and reassures them that even when one treatment proves ineffective, there are other options for managing symptoms and getting back to a normal life.\nChesapeake Urology's comprehensive OAB program is part of the practice's overall commitment to women's urologic health. The OAB specialists are committed to helping all women find relief from the debilitating symptoms of OAB and to return their quality of life.\nVisit womenshealth.chesapeakeurology.com to learn more about overactive bladder treatment and women's urologic health conditions, or call 8 77-771-9508.\nAbout Chesapeake Urology\nChesapeake Urolog y is a fully-integrated urology practice providing a comprehensive array of urologic services to its patients.
