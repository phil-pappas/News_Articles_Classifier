It drives them crazy. You know, why not just come out and lay it out. This is what makes people distrust not just these politicians, but Washington, but the administration, but anybody who even raises their hand and testifies under oath, believing you’re not being straight with me,” she ranted on her show The Kelly File.\nHowever, if someone was watching or reading news on the committee hearing from other media outlets such as ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, or The Washington Post, they would see a totally different story.\nWriters for the Washington Post’s Daily 202 stated Clinton “emerged not just unscathed but stronger.” Rep. Adam Smith, D-Calif., told MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews that “we’ve learned absolutely nothing new” from the proceedings.\nKelly went into detail about Clinton’s private emails, brought to light during her Oct. 22 testimony, that revealed she knew within hours of the 2012 attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi that it was a terrorist attack. Yet, days and weeks after the attack, Clinton, United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice, Press Secretary Jay Carney and even President Barack Obama maintained the claim that the event which left four Americans dead was a “spontaneous reaction” to protests in Cairo and related to a video produced by a man in California.\n“And today, for the first time,” Kelly said on her show, “we hear Mrs. Clinton’s thoughts, at least in the hours right after the attack, what she really believed as she told the public a video was to blame.\n“The truth is that what Mrs. Clinton said publicly is very different from what she claimed privately she knew– that this attack had nothing to do with a video nor a protest – that it was a pre-planned attack and she said she knew it.”\nKelly pointed out that Clinton and other administration officials, including Rice and Obama, talked to family members of the deceased U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty at the casket ceremony, and told them the video prompted a spontaneous protest that ended in the attack.\nKelly also pointed to emails sent to Egypt’s prime minister and her family the night of the attack that said, without any wavering, that the attack was a planned attack conducted by terrorists and had nothing to do with the video.\n“We know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack, not a protest,” Clinton’s email to the Egyptian prime minister stated.\nAn email to her family said the same thing, that the attack was terrorism. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, demanded answers of Clinton during the committee hearing.\n“State experts knew the truth. You knew the truth, but that’s not what the American people got. Again, the American people want to know why,” Jordan said during the hearing.", "external_links": ["http://therightscoop.com/heres-how-abc-cbs-nbc-portrayed-hillarys-testimony-at-benghazi-hearing-today-on-the-nightly-news/", "http://therightscoop.com/megyn-kelly-shows-other-networks-heres-how-to-report-on-hillarys-big-lie/", "http://www.westernjournalism.com//https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/23/the-daily-202-eight-reasons-why-hillary-clinton-won-the-benghazi-hearing/"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:06:06.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
