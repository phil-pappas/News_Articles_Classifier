If you are coming you have to check yourself,” First National Vice-Chairman, Samuel Ofosu Ampofo, told Joy News. \nA 45-year old polling station youth organizer, George Boateng, picked up presidential nomination forms in August to contest Mahama in the November 7 presidential primaries. \nHowever, the NDC refused to authenticate George Boateng’s ambitions and has since moved to quell any speculation that the president will be challenged by the youth organizer. \nPresident Mahama who is seeking a final term submitted his nomination forms last in August amidst fanfare at the party's headquarters in Accra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:34:12.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
