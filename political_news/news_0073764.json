Now the company is making news for its boldest action yet: asking employees to work for free! Gawker got hold of an email sent to salaried employees of URBN, which is the company that owns Urban Outfitters, on Tuesday. Note how it suggests that taking part will help build camaraderie: From: URBNcommunity Sent: Tuesday, October 06, 2015 12:01 PM Subject: A Call For URBN Volunteers! A Call for URBN Volunteers! URBN is seeking weekend volunteers to help out at our fulfillment center in Gap, PA. October will be the busiest month yet for the center, and we need additional helping hands to ensure the timely shipment of orders. As a volunteer, you will work side by side with your GFC colleagues to help pick, pack and ship orders for our wholesale and direct customers. In addition to servicing the needs of our customers, itÂ’s a great way to experience our fulfillment operations first hand. Get your co-workers together for a team building activity! I can see the tails wagging on these trained Pavlov right wing employees as they volunteer their rent and groceries away for the month. On a side note, every time I see someone scanning their own groceries or retail items and bagging them, then paying for it on the computer teller, I smirk and think \"schmuck\". They just worked free for a corporation and cut down on the jobs that could have been hired in their local communities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:49:52.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
