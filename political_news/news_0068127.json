We want this relationship to continue but we will not be lectured to by anyone.\n\"Hasty decisions prompted by short-term gains often do more harm than good in the longer term.\"\n'Intense criticism' Mr Corbyn used his recent Labour Party conference speech to call for the prisons deal to be scrapped, and said the government had been \"shamed\" into a \"U-turn on this terrible contract\".\nHe said Mr Cameron should be sending a \"strong message to repressive regimes that the UK is a beacon for human rights\" and claimed the contract bid would damage Britain's standing in the world.\nThere have also been recent tensions between the two countries over 74-year-old expat Karl Andree, jailed in Saudi Arabia after being caught with homemade wine and thought at one point to be facing 360 lashes.\nIn addition, Prince Mohammed said the \"intense criticism\" of the state's response to the Syrian refugee crisis had been \"unfair, as it failed to acknowledge that Saudi Arabia has taken in over 2.5 million displaced Syrians\".\nThe intelligence provided by Saudi authorities had also helped Britain combat terrorism, he added.\n\"To further our shared strategic interests in the years ahead as we confront a variety of threats, it is crucial that Saudi Arabia be treated with the respect it has unwaveringly afforded the United Kingdom.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/35B8/production/_86325731_86325727.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8824/production/_86325843_gettyimages-144728347.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34513096", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34518706", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/11954146/How-Saudi-Arabia-helps-Britain-keep-the-peace.html"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:15:10.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
