Steve Scalise , R-Jefferson, the current House Majority Whip, is running, as is Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga.\nOne Republican said he expects that contest for majority leader to be very close. Scalise fits the conservative views of most House Republicans, and won a surprising first ballot win last year to assume the majority whip job. He's generally well liked.\nBut Price, a physician and a favorite of Tea Party members, is in a position to take advantage of the desire by some GOP caucus members to bring an \"outsider\" into top House leadership.
