And is religion the root of all evil? \nPlus, there’s been plenty of concern about foreigners buying NZ farmland. But what about the plants, the brands, the whole supply chain? Are we at risk of losing control of our economic backbone or is foreign investment good for us? In the wake of Lochinver Station and the Silver Fern Farms deal Alistair Wilkinson sifts the facts from the spin. \nWe’ll discuss all this and more on our panel: RadioLIVE political editor Jess Williams, Business New Zealand chief executive Phil O’Reilly and Otago University political scientist Bryce Edwards. \nThe Nation on TV3, 9.30am Saturdays and 10am Sundays, and 7pm Saturdays on Radio Live. Proudly brought to you by New Zealand on Air’s Platinum Fund. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:25:24.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
