Built in 1953, Enbridge Line 5 runs west of the bridge and carries light crude oil and liquid natural gas. (MLive.com files) \nLiz Kirkwood is executive director of For Love of Water (FLOW), a Great Lakes water policy center. Liz Kirkwood \nBy Liz Kirkwood \nGov. Rick Snyder and Attorney General Bill Schuette must act immediately on their legal duty to shut down the oil flowing through the Enbridge Line 5 pipelines in the Straits of Mackinac just west of the Mackinac Bridge.Their leadership is needed now to prevent a catastrophic oil spill in the Great Lakes from the 62-year-old pipelines. The state must act to protect the \"Pure Michigan\" economy, local businesses, commercial shipping, a vital fishery, and the drinking water supply for local communities, including St. Ignace and Mackinac Island.Schuette already has said Line 5's days are numbered and that he and the governor have the authority to stop the 23 million gallons of oil a day flowing through the Straits, as outlined in their July pipeline task force report . Legal and scientific experts at For Love of Water (FLOW) say that Canadian-based Enbridge is violating the terms of the 1953 easement allowing its pipelines to occupy state bottomlands. \nAs evidence , the experts point to pipeline supports and a protective wooden covering that are required for Line 5 but missing, pipeline dents that Enbridge has discovered but publicly denied, hidden inspection reports, and the company's written admission that it is unable to detect the presence of any small but steady leaks that could total 140,000 gallons of oil spilled into the Straits on any given day. Additionally, the operating pressure limitations on Line 5 set forth in numerous MPSC orders are likely invalid since they are based on new pipe and not a 62-year-old corroded pipe. This amounts to \"imminent harm\" under state law and must be pursued swiftly by the governor and attorney general.Propane for home heating could continue flowing through Line 5 because it doesn't pose the same threat to the water. However, the oil has to stop while the governor's new Pipeline Safety Advisory Board oversees studies of the risk and alternatives that don't threaten Michigan waterways. Enbridge is infamous for its Line 6B pipeline that corroded and spilled more than 800,000 gallons of heavy tar sands oil in 2010 into the Kalamazoo River watershed near Marshall.Currently, Enbridge uses the Mackinac Straits as a high-risk shortcut for its pipeline from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario, an underwater segment Schuette acknowledges would never be approved by today's standards. \nEnbridge estimates that a \"worst-case\" spill from Line 5 in winter would dump up to 360,000 gallons of oil in the Mackinac Straits , and 70 percent, or a quarter-million gallons or more, could go unrecovered. The U.S. Coast Guard Commandant in April told Congress that he is \"not comfortable\" with his agency's preparedness for a worst-case spill in the Great Lakes. And no one thinks that an effective oil cleanup attempt is possible under ice cover at the Straits, the \"worst possible place\" for a Great Lakes oil spill according to the University of Michigan. \nEnbridge says its statewide operations support roughly 250 employees and contractors, but the Great Lakes support 800,000 jobs in Michigan paying $54 billion a year. That's why businesses and citizens across northern Michigan and beyond are calling for the governor and attorney general to shut down Line 5's oil flow in the Mackinac Straits. For many Michiganders, everything depends on oil-free Great Lakes. \nDo you have a guest column on a statewide topic to share? Email Opinion Curator Dan Hawkins at dhawkins@mlive.com .
