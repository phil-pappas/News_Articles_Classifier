The 4th Congressional District is no exception.\nIncumbent GOP Rep. Cresent Hardy didn't lead the pack. But he did fare better than Democratic challenger Ruben Kihuen, a state senator who landed the endorsement of U.S. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.\nThe score for this three-month period, ending Sept. 30: Hardy: $187,402. Kihuen: $150,418. The Kihuen campaign announced the Reid endorsement on Sept. 3.\nQuarterly reports were filed this week with the Federal Elections Commission, covering campaign fundraising and spending activities in July through September.\n\"I think we're in a good place,\" said Rory McShane, a consultant for Hardy's campaign. \"In the same quarter that Harry Reid endorses Ruben Kihuen, we out-raised him.\"\nKihuen campaign spokesman Dave Chase's countered that Hardy will need whatever money his campaign gets.\n\"We are confident we will have the resources and support we need to tell voters about Congressman Hardy's record,\" Chase said.\nThe district stretches across six rural counties and North Las Vegas.\nAnother Democratic challenger, philanthropist Susie Lee, ended the quarter on top: $572,977 cash on hand. Her campaign raised $334,485 total, which includes $284,485 in contributions, plus a $50,000 loan from Lee in that quarter. Lee loaned her campaign another $50,000 in the prior quarter.\nHardy ended the quarter with $555,113 in the bank. Kihuen, in comparison, ended with $299,216 cash on hand.\nJohn Oceguera, a Democrat and former Nevada Assembly speaker, raised $180,844, which includes a $50,005 loan he made to his campaign from personal funds. It was his first quarter in the race, and he ended it with most of the money intact. He has $145,541 cash on hand.\nDemocrat Lucy Flores, a former assemblywoman, reported nearly $75,342, ending the quarter with $73,543 to spend. She started the quarter in July with $76,523 cash on hand.\nRepublican Niger Innis reported having just $57.97 in the bank.\n3rd Congressional District\nRepublican Michael Roberson is leading the charge for the 3rd Congressional District seat, which includes Henderson, Boulder City and areas of Clark County south to Laughlin and west to California. It's an open race because Republican Rep. Joe Heck is running for the seat held by Reid, who is retiring. Heck entered the Senate race in July.\nRoberson, the state Senate majority leader, raised $443,788 in the third quarter, spending only a fraction and ending the quarter with $419,630.\n\"We are encouraged to have set the pace in our first quarter in the race,\" Roberson campaign spokesman Mike Slanker said.\nRoberson is followed by GOP candidate and sports facility owner Danny Tarkanian who raised $357,294 and had $333,744 left at the close of the quarter.\nDemocrat Jesse Sbaih, an attorney, raised $300,932, which includes a personal $200,000 loan to his campaign. He ended the quarter with $286,259 to spend.\nRepublican Andy Matthews, the former president of Nevada Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank based in Las Vegas, gained $136,367, ending the quarter with a $107,541 war chest.\n1st Congressional District\nRep. Dina Titus doesn't face any serious money competition in the 1st Congressional District, an urban Las Vegas area. Titus raised $106,155, and ended the quarter with $221,458 in the bank.\nRepublican challenger Annette Teijeiro, a medical doctor, reported $10,831 in contributions, closing the quarter with just $1,471.\nRepublican Mary Perry's only donation is a $1,600 loan she made to her campaign and she has spent all of it except $138.60. She is an attorney.\nContact Ben Botkin at bbotkin@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2904. Find him on Twitter: @BenBotkin1\nBush calls out Trump: 'he...
