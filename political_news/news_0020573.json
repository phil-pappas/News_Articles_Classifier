Advisor to the President and Head of the President’s Office P.Tsagaan talked about barriers and difficulties that the business sector of eastern provinces face, and Prime Minister Ch.Saikhhanbileg heard requests from economic representatives during the meeting. Two phases of training are being conducted under the Law on Economic Transparency. A total of 12,000 individuals, legal entities, and business personnel have attended training in the first phase. So far, three changes have been made to the tax return system and legal environment of taxation through recent amendments. Chairman of the General Department of Taxation B.Ariunsan announced at the meeting that several more changes are going to be made to the Law on Taxes due to the current economic situation, as the law has not been touched since 2007. Amendment authors say that losses and fines will be reduced, tax fraud will no longer be classified as an economic crime, monitoring and inspections will be reduced, and tax percentages will be changed. Members of the Economic Council thanked the Prime Minister for making an effort to adopt the Law on Economic Transparency and made some requests. They requested support for the development of new businesses by not requiring the payment of taxes for the first three years of operation, and to share positive information at the Hour of Solutions weekly meeting by promoting charitable projects that have shown results. The Banking Association made a request at the meeting to postpone tax withdrawal from customer’s savings accounts, as savings at commercial banks have reduced drastically, and the tax withdrawal may make customers withdraw savings from their accounts. The Economic Council of the Prime Minister gathers once a month to exchange views on timely policy, legislative decisions, and other economic matters. It was established by the Office of the National Committee of Economy, with the intention to exchange information and improve the coherence of political and economic sectors. \nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16564   18  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:13:33.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
