I thought I could fix it and I can’t. What have I done?”\nPromoted stories Labour fell from 41 MPs to 40 at the hands of the SNP in May, and Murphy’s constituency majority of 10,420 was replaced by a winning SNP margin of 3718.\nOne ex-Labour MP said of Murphy's new venture: “No one is going to touch him with a barge pole. The danger for him is that he’s unemployable in Scotland.”\nMurphy, 48, joins a growing list of former Scottish MPs who have set up or joined companies to earn a living outside the Commons.\nBarely a fortnight after the election, former Chancellor Alistair Darling - now Lord Darling - set up the imaginatively titled Alistair Darling Ltd with his wife Maggie Vaughan.\nIn June, ex-Glasgow South MP Tom Harris set up Third Avenue Communications Ltd, styling himself a “public affairs consultant”.\nA month later, ousted East Kilbride MP Michael McCann set up MIMC Consult Ltd with his wife Tracy, describing himself as a “political consultant”.\nAnd in August, former LibDem MP Mike Crockart, who lost Edinburgh West to the SNP’s Michelle Thomson, set up the Mike Crockart Management Consultancy Ltd.\nMeanwhile former Scottish Secretary Douglas Alexander, who lost his Paisley seat to 20-year-old Mhairi Black, has spent two months as a company director.\nAccording to official records, he was a director of London-based Generous at Work Ltd from May 14 to July 16.\nJo Swinson, former LibDem MP for East Dunbartonshire, became a non-executive director of Glasgow-based retail analysts Clear Returns last month.\nBesides Arden Strategies, Murphy is also understood to be working on a book.\nLast year the dedicated Celtic fan published a volume on football matches.\nShare article The SNP said: “We wish Jim Murphy - and all his colleagues who lost seats in May - well.”\nMurphy could not be contacted.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:35:24.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
