The journey to achieving gender parity will require action in multiple areas â€“ pipeline, retention, advancement and overall workforce inclusivity,\" said Sandra Rivera , vice president of the Data Center Group and general manager of the Network Platforms Group at Intel. \"Intel and Women in Comms share this common focus, and we look forward to partnering with this new organization to promote diversity and inclusion in the communications industry.\"\nAs a non-profit, Light Reading and its partners will tackle head-on the well-documented gender imbalance in the communications industry, working to connect women, build up the pipeline of qualified female candidates, provide mentorships for women in the workplace and scholarship for college-level women. WiC will strive to empower women currently in the industry and, ultimately, create a work environment that's better and more equitable for women.\n\"Redressing the gender imbalance in the comms industry is a cause that's near to my heart,\" said Sarah Thomas , Light Reading's editorial operations director and the director of Women in Comms. \"While it's great to see the issue receiving more attention, there isn't yet an organization that unifies all our voices around a common platform and turns words into action. Women in Comms will be that destination, both online and through live events.\"\nWomen in Comms will continue to hold its networking breakfast series throughout the year with four quarterly events, including a one-day conference and jobs fair dedicated to women at Light Reading's BIG Communications Event in the spring. The group will also hold regional meetings, connect women that are early in their career with mentors from the industry, provide a scholarship to a young woman pursuing a degree in the STEM field, honor leading women with industry awards and much more.\n\"We are thrilled to be launching such an important not-for-profit initiative at a time when the industry needs it the most,\" said Light Reading CEO and Founder Steve Saunders . \"Light Reading is proud to be a leading protagonist in the mission to redress the gender imbalance and to join forces with the industry's top companies that share our goal.\"\nFor more information and to join Women in Comms, please contact WiC Director Sarah Thomas at thomas@lightreading.com or 913-486-9358.\nAbout Women in Comms\nLight Reading's Women in Comms is an independent, 501(c) not-for-profit organization with support from the largest comms companies across the globe.
