But at the one time he needed help, his country failed him,” she said.\n“All I wanted was for lessons to be learned, but it seems Iain Duncan Smith doesn’t want to learn them.\n“It makes you wonder what the government has got to hide.”\nVictim: former soldier David Clapson who died after his benefits were cut\nThe Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has taken four months to reply to a damning report by the Work and Pensions Committee.\nAfter months hearing evidence, the Committee called for a full independent inquiry into the sanctions regime – suggesting it appeared to be “purely punitive”.\nDuncan-Smith has agreed to trial some changes to the system, including a yellow card system for sanctions, but has refused the number one recommendation – an independent inquiry.\n“I am incredibly angry today,” Thompson said, adding that she had been crying ever since she heard the response.\n“What crime had David committed? If he had been a criminal, he would have had a judge, a jury, a trial. But he didn’t get anything. The DWP just decided he could starve to death .\n\"He never even got an inquest.\n“Wouldn’t you want to uncover what had happened not just to David but to all the other people who have died or had to go hungry because of a sanction? It sickens me. What is wrong with these people?”\nPA \"Callous\": Iain Duncan Smith took four months to reject inquiry call\nDavid died with just £3.44 in his bank account and no food in his stomach because his Jobseeker's Allowance had been withheld as a punishment for missing a single meeting. CVs were piled up close to his body.\nLabour MP Debbie Abrahams – then on the Work and Pensions Committee and now the Shadow Minister for Disabled People – instigated the original MPs’ inquiry after meeting Gill and hearing of David’s death.\nOwen Smith MP, Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions said Duncan-Smith’s response “lays bare the two themes that define his tenure at the head of DWP – callousness and incompetence.”\nHe added: “The publication of this response to the Work and Pensions committee’s is almost four months late, which highlights the disarray at the DWP.\n\"It is an insult to the people who have been failed by the sanctions regime and the taxpayer, who ultimately pick up the bill for failings of the Department.\n“The committee’s number one recommendation called on the DWP to establish an independent review of benefit conditionality and sanctions, to investigate whether sanctions are being applied appropriately, fairly and proportionately.\n“However, the Secretary of State’s response ignores this cross party call, clearly the Government is worried about what any such review will uncover.\n“It is little wonder they have reservations, when the Work and Pensions committee’s report raised concerns over issues such as the deaths of vulnerable claimants following benefit sanctions, the piloting of tax credit sanctions for working people and the potential that the sanctions regime is distorting the JSA figures.”\nMirrorpix Unimpressed: Labour's Owen Smith says the DWP is in disarray\nSince the report came out the Work and Pensions Committee has had new elections, including a new chair, the Labour MP Frank Field.\n“Our predecessor Committee conducted some very valuable work on the benefit sanctions regime,” he said.\n“We are pleased that the Government has accepted many of the Committee’s criticisms of its approach and, more importantly, the recommendations for change.\n“In particular, we welcome the trial of the “yellow card” warning system and the reassessment of what constitutes hardship.\nConditionality is an important part of our benefit system, but sanctions must be fair, clearly understood and not plunge families into unjustifiable hardship.\nBut he added that the Government’s response “leaves a number of questions unanswered” which he hoped the Secretary of State could answer when he gave evidence to the Committee on Wednesday.\nIain Duncan Smith said in a statement: “We have been building a labour market system in which each claimant, closely assisted by a work coach, agrees the steps they need to take to secure a job, receives support to help them do so, and understands the requirements placed on them in return for their benefits.\n“Last week’s labour market statistics showed the UK’s employment rate had reached 73.6%, the highest since records began; evidence that the system is working.”\nHe said his department would be trialling some changes to the system, including yellow cards for when people were first sanctioned.\nHorror stories involving sanctioned claimants have become commonplace. In one case a man with heart problems was sanctioned because he had a heart attack during a disability benefits assessment – and so failed to complete the assessment.\nEarlier this year, the DWP was forced to admit it had made up stories of benefit claimants who had a positive experience of sanctions.\n\"They eventually admitted the stories “were for illustrative purposes only”.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DailyMirror", "https://twitter.com/realbritainros", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:31:02.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
