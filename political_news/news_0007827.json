But analysts remain sceptical that an end is in sight to a conflict that has killed more than 2,500 civilians and heightened regional tensions. More Journey of a barrel of oil across Syria \nMr Hadi has previously insisted he would enter negotiations only once the rebels complied with a UN Security Council resolution calling on them to lay down arms and together with their allies, loyalists of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, withdraw from territory under their control. \nThe UN’s special envoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, said he would be “working with all parties to . . . ensure that the negotiations lead to concrete benefits for the Yemeni people and the foundation for sustainable peace”. \nThe UN envoy has been working to persuade Mr Hadi, the Houthis and members of Mr Saleh’s General People’s Congress party to agree to another round of talks after abortive attempts at brokering a deal in Geneva in June saw both sides walk away without meeting. \nWestern officials say the move to hold talks at the end of October follows months of pressure on Saudi Arabia to commit itself to resolving the conflict by political means. \nSaudi Arabia, Mr Hadi’s main backer, has led a nine-nation military coalition that has conducted seven months of intensive air strikes against the Houthis, who Riyadh claims are backed by Iran \nOn Monday night a Saudi foreign ministry official quoted by the official press agency said Mr Hadi was encouraged by reports that “other parties” — the Houthis — had accepted UN resolution 2216. \nThe civil war flared in March when Houthi fighters, who already controlled the capital, moved on Aden, which Mr Hadi had named as the temporary capital after fleeing Houthi house arrest. As Mr Hadi escaped from the southern port city, the Saudi-led coalition began bombing Houthi positions and intensified a ground invasion over the summer. \nDespite the apparent willingness to enter talks, analysts worry that neither side is any mood to make concessions. \nThe Saudi-led coalition has been trumpeting recent battlefield success in oil-rich Mareb in central Yemen and in the south of the country, and along the strategic Red Sea coast. \nGulf officials have suggested the Saudi-led coalition is preparing for a large ground attack on the capital. \nSenior Houthi officials, meanwhile, claim that the loss of territory in south and central Yemen was a strategic move by the northern rebels to withdraw to more easily defendable areas and intensify attacks over the Saudi border. \n“During the [last] war, the Saudis thought they could finish the Houthis by launching air strikes,” a senior member of the Houthis’ politburo told the Financial Times during a recent trip to northern Yemen. \nHe was referring the last of six wars between the Houthis and then-president Saleh between 2004 to 2010. Riyadh lent air support to government forces in late 2009 but was taken by surprise when Houthi fighters seized a swath of small Saudi towns and villages. \n“The Houthis went into Saudi Arabia and scared them into stopping,” the Houthi official said. “Now, we will do the same again.” \nThe official said Houthi fighters were already crossing the Saudi border on foot, seizing towns and even military installations in mounting numbers. Saudi officials have previously insisted that any such incursions were temporary. \nA Gulf-based western diplomat said previous UN attempts to convene talks had been scuttled by assaults by the Saudi coalition on Aden and Mareb. The coalition remained confident, he said, that it could win outright, dimming peace prospects again. \n“All of the key players in this conflict continue to assert that the solution ultimately lies at the end of a political rather than military process,” says Adam Baron, a fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \n“The question, however, is whether this can come at a time when both sides — despite the catastrophic consequences this is having on the average Yemeni — still appear to believe that they are winning.” Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
