The previous Mission Readiness Exercise proved invaluable as it enabled the first Task Group to hit the ground running when they got to Taji,” said Acting Land Component Commander Colonel (COL) Rob Gillard. \nTask Group Taji, the combined Australian and New Zealand group which has been training Iraqi Security Forces since late April, is achieving good progress in enabling Iraqi soldiers through training. \n“Approximately 2,100 Iraqi soldiers have completed unit-level and individual specialty courses conducted by the Task Group,” said COL Gillard. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:12:20.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
