All the patients were listed in stable\ncondition.\nAs of late morning, medics were evaluating another 20 to 40 students at the Cuyamaca Street campus, Mattick said.\nOfficials had unaffected students remain in their classrooms as public safety crews worked to identify the source of the fumes.\nA hazardous materials team was summoned to investigate the bleach-like smell, which was believed to have wafted over from a pool area at the nearby community center, according to Mattick.\nDeputies closed Cuyamaca Street between Mast Boulevard and Mission Creek Drive while crews handled the emergency. Motorists were advised to avoid the area until further notice.\nUpdate: firefighters say up to 75 students/staff taken to hospitals from Rio Seco School.
