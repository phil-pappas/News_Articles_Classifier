Security Council resolutions when it test fired a new ballistic missile. \nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that such violations are nothing new. \nEarnest says the Iranians have \"almost serially\" violated international concerns about the country's ballistic missile program. \nBut the White House spokesman added that those violations are \"entirely separate\" from the historic nuclear deal reached between Iran and world powers. \nEarnest said that Iran over the last few years has had a track record of abiding by its commitments related to the nuclear talks. \nIranian state TV reported on Sunday that the Iranians successfully test fired a new guided long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile.
