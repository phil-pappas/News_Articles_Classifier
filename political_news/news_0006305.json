The left-wing Washington Post has published a piece defending Ronald Reagan from a hatchet job by the ostensibly conservative Bill O’Reilly:\n“Killing Reagan,” by Bill O’Reilly and Martin Dugard, is supposed to be a book of new scholarship on the Reagan presidency. Instead, it restates old claims and rumors, virtually all of which have been discredited by the historical record.\nIn this best-selling book, there are no endnotes, no bibliography, no long list of interviewees and only a smattering of footnotes. There is a section titled “Sources,” but it is only two-and-a-half pages long. It includes … long-questionable works, including the sensational 1991 attack by Kitty Kelley — which is clearly incorporated throughout the book — and the 1999 biography by Edmund Morris, roundly criticized for its intermingling of fact and fiction.\nO’Reilly’s depiction of Reagan appears to be based largely on partisan accounts from the 1980s that maliciously mischaracterized the only great president in living memory.\nFrankly, we had thought that demeaning, flawed caricature — Reagan as the doodling old fool who spent too much time sleeping at Cabinet meetings and watching old movies — had been permanently put to rest by recent scholarship.\nUnfortunately, it seems there is still a buck to be made by rehashing it — along with salacious extramarital allegations best left to gutter tabloids.\nThe book finishes with a claim that Reagan’s ghost may haunt his ranch. O’Reilly had better hope the ghost isn’t vengeful.\nThanks for the warning, WaPo.
