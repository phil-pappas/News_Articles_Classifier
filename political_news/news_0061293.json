The regulatory impact statement underlines that there is absolutely no certainty that full regional democracy will ever be restored while National remains in power. \n\"None of the New Zealand’s other 77 local authorities have has this half pie model of democracy with half the members appointed by Ministers and the rest elected. Cantabrians deserve the same democratic rights as other kiwis. \n\"The Green Party trusts Cantabrians to elect a competent regional council which can get on with the job of tackling the region’s water pollution issues and managing water, soils, air, the coast, natural hazards and transport in a sustainable way. \n\"Democracy involves debate between different world views and elected councillors representing local people on the issues that matter.\" \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
