'Government policy threatens over 20,000 UK solar jobs - with many more at risk in other green sectors. 'It seems the Treasury is happier to give sky-high subsidies to Chinese nuclear power, than support British solar. 'The renewable energy industry around the world is booming and costs are falling rapidly, but the UK government seems to be stuck in the wrong century.' ENDS Notes to editors: 1.
