Could not subscribe, try again later \nMinister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin have today revealed the Government's spending plan for the coming year. \nIreland's hard-pressed middle income earners are set to reap modest rewards in today's announcement. \nThe €600 million tax reform package includes cuts to the hated income tax levy - the Universal Social Charge (USC). \nStay with us throughout the day for breaking news, updates and reaction as it happens. \nHere's a summary of the main points contained in the Budget. \nCuts to USC for all taxpayers \nEntry point raised to €13k \nThe Universal Social Charge rates are decreasing from 1.5% to 1%, from 3.5% to 3% and from 7% to 5.5%. \n50 cent hike on 20 cigarettes \nFuel duty, and motor tax unchanged \nMinimum wage increased by 50 cent \nState pension increased by €3 \nChild benefit increased by €5 per month 11:55 am What we know about Budget 2016 so far \nToday's Budget is expected to see USC rates altered and the minimum wage increased - among other expected changes. 12:23 pm Brendan Howlin reveals Budget will support 'families, elderly and vulnerable' \nMinister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin revealed that the Budget will mainly focus on work as it is \"the best way for people to escape poverty\". \nAs he made his way into the Dail this morning, he told reporters: \"Having restored the economic sovereignty of the state, we're now in a position to address issues that are under stress so the Government have decided that the Budget will focus on work and the supporting of work. \n\"It will support families, the elderly, and the vulnerable...they're the main themes that you'll see knitted through the announcements made, both on the tax side by Michael, and on the expenditure side by myself.\" \nHe added: \"We went into Government five years ago, people thought that at the time it might be electoral suicide for us to pick up the bits of a broken economy but the focus we've had from day one was to put the country first, not any political interest. \n\"That's been the hallmark of all the decisions we've made. Clearly some of them have been very unpopular but the proof of the pudding now is that the economic strategy we laid out from day one has worked and we now want to begin to create the sort of Ireland that is more equal, fairer, that supports work - because that is the best way for people to escape poverty - and to ensure that work pays and that's what will happen today.\" 12:35 pm Free GP care for kids under 12 Getty Doctor \nMuch of the Budget has already been leaked but this morning it emerged the the Government may extend free GP care for kids under 12. \nThe move could prove controversial, as free GP care for children under 6 did when it was unveiled. \nRTE report that it's unclear when the plan would come into effect, and will be subject to talks with the Irish Medical Organisation. \nThe IMO has already said they are surprised at the news, which shows no such talks have yet taken place. 12:51 pm Irish Medical Organisation warns it's 'simply not possible' to extend free GP care \nThe Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) has warned the Government that it is “simply not possible” to extend Free GP Visit Cards to new age groups in the absence of a new GP Contract for the Medical Card and the Doctor Visit Card schemes. \nThe Chairman of the IMO GP Committee, Dr. Padraig McGarry, was responding to leaks stating that the Government was planning to extend Free GP Visits to children up to 12 years of age. \nHe warned that the GP system was severely under resourced after years of cuts and was under massive pressure to cope with existing demands. \nHe said: \"The question isn’t whether we can extend free GP care to new age groups, its how do we save General Practice as we know it.\" 1:09 pm Boost for pensioners \nThe old age pension is expected to be increased by €3 a week in the Budget. \nPensioners haven't seen a change in their payments since 2008, with 575,000 of them now expected to benefit from the increase. \nIf the increase goes through those on the State contributory pension will see their payment rise from €230.30 per week to €233.30. \nThose on the non-contributory pension will see an increase from €219 per week to €222. 1:18 pm Retailers angry over mooted cigarette price hike PA \nThe rumoured 50 cent increase in a pack of cigarettes will be another boon for smugglers, retailers have said. \nRetailers Against Smuggling, which represents over 3,000 retailers, said it was hard to believe the Government was considering another increase. \nRAS spokesman Benny Gilsenan said: \"It beggars belief that the Government would decide to increase exciseat a time when smuggling remains a huge problem and keeps severely damaging our trade. \n“A few weeks ago, a man was convicted in Limerick after being caught trying to launder €1.5 million in cash from the sale of illegal cigarettes, while in the past few months, counterfeit Irish tax stamps were found on smuggled products. \n\"Due to the excise increase, we have now reached a stage where the price of legitimate products are double that of smuggled cigarettes. For most consumers, that’s a no-brainer and they will choose the cheap, illegal products.\" 1:30 pm Taoiseach says budget will help middle Charles McQuillan/Getty Images Response: Enda Kenny \nTaoiseach Enda Kenny said this morning that the Budget will bring relief to Ireland's hard-pressed middle income earners. \nHe told reporters: \"We've made it perfectly clear that for those from €70,000 down, there will be relief given, and I've indicated a couple of months back that we'll get the tax burden below 50%.\" \nA €600million tax reform package is expected to include cuts to the hated Universal Social Charge. 1:38 pm Universal social charge rates to be slashed \nThis appears to be one of the certainties in the budget, but it remains to be seen the depth of the cuts. \nBefore today, we understood the top USC rate will be cut by 1.5% bringing it from 7% to 5.5%; the middle from 3.5% to 3%; and the lower from 1.5% to 1%. \nThe bands will also be changed slightly as the lowest paid will pay the levy only after earning about €13,000 as opposed to the €12,012 as it currently stands. \nMany families will be eagerly waiting to see if those are the actual cuts unveiled in Minister Noonan's speech. 1:42 pm Would a Budget bounce bring on an early election? \nThe Taoiseach finally said the election will be in the Spring, shocking some within his own party. \nBut if the response to the Budget is better than expected, could he change his mind? #Budget16 If Simon Harris is as confident as he says, the Government should have their budget and call #GE15 .! — Ger Mccann (@ger_mccann) October 13, 2015 1:49 pm Christmas bonus and carer grant expected to improve \nOther welfare payments should also improve such as the Christmas bonus for the unemployed and the restoration of some of the carer grant. \nThe light relief will also be seen as way to build on the modest growth in consumer spending which many economists believe is the logical next step in Ireland's economic revival. \nWill it be enough to change the Government's popularity or have they already gone too far? 1:51 pm Let us know what you think \nAfter the Budget we'll be inviting readers to let us know what they think by leaving a comment in our new comments section below. \nYou can sign up now before the speech gets underway in the next half hour. 1:54 pm Is Dobbo Time now a thing? \nThis is a new one on us. It's Dobbo time.

Following support, the Mayo native has hardened further into 1/6 from 1/4 to remain as Taoiseach after the next general election.” \nHe added “Their isn’t many contenders that would tick all the boxes to become Taoiseach and despite maybe not ticking all the boxes, it looks like the Irish nation believe that Enda Kenny is still the best person for the job, as so far it’s Kenny that’s the runaway loser by a mile for BoyleSports having been available at 4/5 back in January.” 2:09 pm Taoiseach pays tribute to victims of weekend tragedies \nThe Taoiseach has opened Dail proceedings by paying tribute to the 10 killed in the Carrickmines fire tragedy at the weekend, and to Garda Tony Golden, who was shot dead on Sunday night. \nHe said it would be very difficult for both the Golden family and the extended Connors and Lynch families to move on with their lives after such tragic loss. \nThe Taoiseach said that the Tricolour will fly at half mast on all public buildings on the occasion of their funerals. \nTanaiste Joan Burton also paid tribute to the victims. 2:13 pm Heavy Garda presence outside Leinster House ahead of Budget speech \nThere's a heavy Garda presence outside Leinster House as protesters gather ahead of the Budget speech. \nGardai have said the protests are low-key at the moment and they aren't expecting any trouble.
