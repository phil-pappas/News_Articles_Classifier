The 2015 Gallup education poll showed Americans opposed to vouchers by 57 percent to 31 percent. (The D.C. vouchers are paid for by taxpayers nationally.)\nIn 28 state referendums from coast to coast between 1966 and 2014, millions of voters rejected vouchers or their variants by an average margin of 2 to 1. In 1981, D.C. voters rejected a tax-credit voucher plan by 89 percent to 11 percent , and this month a majority of the D.C. Council expressed opposition.\nEdd Doerr , Silver Spring\nThe writer is president of Americans for Religious Liberty.", "external_links": ["http://www.nea.org/assets/docs/2009-04-23_Debunking_Myths_About_the_DC_Voucher_Program.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:20:23.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
