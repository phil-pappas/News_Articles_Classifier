She has been a vocal opponent of Palestinian statehood and her country's own Supreme Court.\nIn an interview, recorded during Shaked's visit to the UN General Assembly in September, Mehdi Hasan challenge d the hardline minister on the rise of xenophobia and racism in Israel, treatment of the Palestinians, and the future of the \"peace process\".\nShaked told Hasan she does not believe in a two-state solution. \"My personal view is different from the prime minister\". Shaked said. \"I don't think it's a valid solution right now... I think that the status quo is the best option for everyone.\"\nThe Israeli justice minister also tells Hasan that when it comes to Israeli law, \"everyone should be treated equally\".\nWhen challenged by Hasan on the number of Israeli settlers prosecuted for violence against Palestinians, Shaked says, \"Every murderer, it doesn't matter if he is Jewish or Muslim, should sit in jail for the rest of his life.\"\nShaked was at the centre of controversy for an article she posted to her Facebook page during last summer's Gaza conflict that referred to Palestinian children as \"little snakes\". When asked by Hasan about the post, Shaked responds, \"it was something that wasâ€¦out of context and it was removed.\"\n\"Now, what you need to ask the people is why those kids, the Israeli kids, are being murdered and no one cares,\" Shaked adds.\nEditor's note: The interview was conducted prior to recent unrest in Israel and Palestine.\nWatch UpFront on Al Jazeera English on Fridays at 1930GMT.\nFollow UpFront on Twitter @AJUpFront and Facebook.\nSource: Al Jazeera", "external_links": ["http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.656490", "http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/MK-backs-infiltrators-law-which-saved-Israel%3e", "https://twitter.com/AJUpFront", "https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:40:46.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
