(AP) - A teacher in northeastern Wisconsin went to the hospital after being poisoned in what two students told police was a prank. \nPolice say the Gillett Secondary School teacher noticed a strange smell coming from a bottle of soda he had left unattended Tuesday afternoon. Police talked to a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old girl, who said they put a small amount of cleaning solution in the bottle. \nPolice say the teacher was treated at a hospital. School Superintendent Todd Carlson tells WLUK-TV (http://bit.ly/1MTOU9yhttp://bit.ly/1MTOU9y ) the teacher was back at school Wednesday. \nThe school board will discuss punishment for the students. \n___ \n___ Assembly passes bill dissolving nonpartisan elections board \nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - The Wisconsin Assembly voted Wednesday to dissolve the state’s nonpartisan elections board, however a Republican state senator said the bill in its current form didn’t have enough support to pass in his chamber. \nThe proposal has been rocketing through the Legislature, with the Assembly passing it less than two weeks after it was introduced. The Assembly was also expected to pass another fast-tracked measure that would overhaul the state’s campaign finance laws by allowing unlimited donations to political parties and doubling the limits for individual candidates. \nThe Assembly voted 58-39, with three Republicans joining all Democrats against, to pass the bill replacing the nonpartisan Government Accountability Board with two partisan commissions. \nIn the Senate, where the GOP has a narrow 19-14 edge, there are three or four Republicans who will not support the bill, Republican Sen. Luther Olsen said. \nRepublicans can only lose two votes and still have enough to pass either measure given expected unified Democratic opposition. The bills must pass both the Senate and Assembly in identical form and be signed by Gov. Scott Walker before they could become law. \nOn the elections board proposal, Olsen said the major problem for him and other Republican senators with reservations is whether to replace the six nonpartisan former judges who currently sit on the board with appointees made by Democrats and Republicans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:17:32.459+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
