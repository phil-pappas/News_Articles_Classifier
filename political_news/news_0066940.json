While some county residents might envision hordes of crafty property owners, or a few big businesses, taking aggressive advantage of various loopholes, reality is much more mundane. Government entities generally don't pay taxes on their property for reasons outside of the county's control, and they dominate the non-payer list. At the very top, accounting for about $11 million in foregone revenue, is the federal government. \nUncle Sam's property tax exemption is well known in counties like Josephine, where the federal government owns about half the land area. To mitigate the sting, the federal government does send payments in lieu of taxes, which amounted to about $16 million for the entire state in 2015, according to the Association of Oregon Counties . \nBut here's where urban and rural counties begin to diverge. The federal government's properties in Multnomah County differ in important ways from its holdings in the state's heavily timbered, rural counties. Consider the top five federal properties in Multnomah, in descending order of foregone revenue: the Bonneville Dam and associated facilities; the Veterans Administration hospital; the federal offices at 2nd and Salmon in downtown Portland; the federal buildings by the Lloyd Center; and the federal courthouse downtown. \nRural counties aren't completely devoid of federal facilities, of course. But a crucial difference between the federal offices clustered in Portland and the vast expanses of federal forests that dominate many rural counties is that the former function as employment and service centers. They're populated by people who make good money (and pay taxes on it) and they contribute to the region's economic vitality despite their property tax exemption. Federal forests in rural counties were once engines of economic vitality, too, but logging has been virtually idled by environmental legislation and litigation. Congress has provided money to soften the blow, but funding levels are steadily decreasing and not intended to be permanent in any case. \nFor Multnomah County to approximate the economic shock from which the state's timber counties have yet to recover, Portland would need a whole lot more federal buildings; they would sit idle, unstaffed and unproductive; and every once in a while they'd burn, threatening buildings around them and bathing tourists with smoke and ash.
