Photo Credit: IANS Sushma rejects Nawaz ’ s proposal at UN In a caustic reaction on Thursday to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s four-point peace initiative at the United Nations General Assembly, Indian foreign affairs minister Sushma Swaraj told Islamabad to give up terror before Delhi agrees to talks. She refuted Sharif's claims that Pakistan was a victim of terror and his call for the demilitarisation of Kashmir.

Railway minister proposes independent regulator In an attempt to pull the cash-strapped Indian Railways out of its slump, railway minister Suresh Prabhu is planning to set up a tariff regulatory authority staffed with professionals from the private sector to determine passenger and freight fares based on market conditions.

The move could well be considered a key reform item of the Bharatiya Janata government, with railway fares remaining largely unchanged during the United Progressive Alliance's two terms.
