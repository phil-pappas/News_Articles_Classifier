Putin and Lavrov are doing an encore to Bush and Cheney. Bastards all. Quote: Vladimir Putin will lie about Syria as he did in Ukraine Even before Russia started bombing targets in Syria, it should have been clear to all involved that its actions would follow the pattern President Vladimir Putin set in Ukraine. He will be indiscriminately ruthless in making sure his allies achieve territorial gains to improve their negotiating position, and his diplomacy and propaganda machine would do its best to erect a smokescreen around his true plans and actions. On Wednesday, the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's parliament gave Putin permission to use troops overseas, an obligatory procedure under Russian law. That's how the Crimea annexation began in March, 2014, too, but there's a striking difference between the two Federation Council resolutions. Last year's specifically permitted Putin to use the Russian military in Ukraine. Wednesday's document is a blanket one. It doesn't mention Syria at all, granting the president the right to use \"the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation outside the territory of the Russian Federation on the basis of commonly accepted principles and norms of international law\". The difference between the two documents is proof of similar tactics. Putin isn't really bound by the decisions of his rubber-stamp parliament. He only uses the parliamentary procedure to strike fear into his enemies. In March, 2014, the Federation Council resolution mentioned Ukraine but not specifically Crimea, warning the revolutionary government in Kiev to stand down and let Putin take over the peninsula or potentially face a full-scale invasion. In September, 2015, Putin is telling whomever it may concern that anything goes in his latest military adventure -- including, implicitly, operations in countries neighbouring Syria, such as Iraq. After the resolution received unanimous approval, Putin's chief of staff Sergei Ivanov and Federation Council speaker Valentina Matvienko said the matter only concerned Syria and Russia would only conduct airstrikes there, ruling out the use of ground troops. That, like everything else official Moscow says, means nothing. Putin wants, and has, full discretion in what he can do to aid Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. At the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, Putin talked about fighting the terrorist threat of the Islamic State, but he also made it clear he, like Assad, saw little difference between Islamic State and other anti-Assad groups fighting in Syria. \"The radicals' ranks are now being supplemented by members of the so-called moderate Syrian opposition, supported by the West,\" he said. \"First they are armed and trained, then they go over to the side of the so-called Islamic State.\" That was typical Putin: There is no evidence that anti-Assad opposition is joining Islamic State en masse, but the Russian leader is happy to use isolated incidents to draw his battle lines. That's what he did as the conflict in eastern Ukraine developed, denouncing Ukrainian troops as neo-Nazi executioners to make it clear they were fair game. Putin's public statements are usually pretty clear on who the enemy is, even if the reasons he gives to back up these determinations are often disingenuous. When it comes to fighting the enemy, though, the Kremlin doesn't feel compelled to tell the truth. To Putin the intelligence officer, obfuscation is an important weapon. Throughout the Ukraine crisis, Russia has denied the presence of its troops in Eastern Ukraine and even pretended that it wasn't arming the separatist rebels there. Now, official Moscow is already denying that the targets it is striking in Syria have nothing to do with Islamic State. The Russian defense ministry reported on Wednesday that it had bombed Islamic State positions. After the U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov that this didn't appear to be true, the Russian foreign minister responded with a familiar gambit: Our American partners are concerned about those having been the wrong targets, and they expressed these concerns to us, saying they had some kind of proof. We asked them to produce it because we are sure of our targets.\"Prove it\" was the Russian response to every Ukrainian accusation, and every time proof was delivered Moscow declared itself dissatisfied with it. No wonder: The Kremlin is not engaged in an academic debate in which either side can be persuaded by proof. It is waging a war in which force is the ultimate argument, and that force is enhanced when coupled with deception.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:51:58.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
