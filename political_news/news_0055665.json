Vitter, the 59-year-old brother of Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana, is scheduled to come to campus Oct. 29 to meet with faculty, students, staff and alumni. Barring heavy disapproval by campus groups, trustees are likely to vote later that day to appoint him as the leader of the 24,000-student university.
