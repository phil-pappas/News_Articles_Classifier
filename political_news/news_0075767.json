The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority approved new rules that go into effect Nov. 1 that will let Uber and Lyft drivers take people to and from Dulles and National airports in new, specially created locations, but they'll need a permit and it will cost $4 a trip. \"It means you'll be paying more for a ride\" \nIn other words, the ride-hailing apps won, but not unconditionally. It was a hard-won victory too. Uber and Lyft were getting into trouble with the airports for a while now. Clever workarounds , such as the apps showing where you could step off airport grounds and get picked up, didn't exactly fit the bill for the convenience that leads people to using the services. It took a lot of time and effort did finally end in an agreement, it's not necessarily one that the companies, and their customers, are going to be happy about in the long term. \nThat's because it means you'll be paying more for a ride. Lyft and Uber both said that the extra cost will be included in the cost of the ride. It could possibly be as much as 25 percent more according to a statement by Uber spokesman Taylor Bennett. \n“It’s unfortunate that National and Dulles airports will now have some of the highest fees for Uber rides in the nation,” Bennett wrote in the statement. “We look forward to continuing to work with MWAA to revise the fee structure so that hundreds of thousands of residents and visitors don’t have to pay over twice the fee that’s imposed on taxi rides.” \nThis result, however long it lasts, is not universal. Depending on the airport, Uber and its fellows have faced different challenges. For instance, at Sky Harbor in Phoenix, there are no restrictions on dropping people off in an Uber, but if you want to get picked up, UberX drivers need a ground-transportation permit. That often means a higher price unless you're willing to walk off the airport property. \nBut there are good reasons for Uber to want any kind of deal. In South Florida, Uber driver fines are approaching $3 million according to the Sun-Sentinel , and airports in the area are a prime spot for enforcers to catch drivers. Of course, law enforcement has also used the app to trick drivers in sting operations according to the article, but all of that makes for an urgency on Uber's part to get some form of legalization, even if it's not ideal. \nMonterey Regional Airport looks to be more willing to experiment. A short-term contract started this month where Uber will pay a $3 fee to the airport for every trip that begins or ends at the airport. That's a change from the blanket ban on Uber pickups previously. The contract only runs until the end of next June however, which means that there will be plenty of time for negotiation on what the next contract, or permanent regulation will look like. \nLAX's rules looks a lot like D.C.'s, with a $4 charge for each trip, although LAX had a contentious debate, arguably even more so than it was here. In New York meanwhile, Uber and Lyft don't have to pay extra for trips to JFK, but each driver needs a license from the Taxi and Limousine Commission. \nAt this point, Uber and Lyft's airport operations look to be in quite reasonable shape in D.C., but both companies have repeatedly rallied customers to pressure lawmakers for more amenable rules before. This will likely be more of a temporary truce than a true end to the ride-sharing battles at airports.
