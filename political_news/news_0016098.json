Number one.\nBy Rachel Brody Oct. 14, 2015 | 2:15 p.m. EDT + More The first Democratic primary debate is over, and the verdict is in: Hillary Clinton owned.\n\"Instead of turning in the safe and solid performance she needed,\" writes Slate's Josh Voorhees, \"Clinton was closer to spectacular on Tuesday night.\" The New York Times' Frank Bruni agrees . \"She mixed confidence and moments of passion with instances of humor,\" he writes, \"and her manner was less didactic and robotic than it can often be.\" Says Michael A. Cohen at The Boston Globe, \"This was a top-notch debate performance.\"\nClinton may have won handily among pundits, but her fellow contenders hardly put up a fight, they point out. \"O'Malley had a hard time finding a way to stand out,\" writes Refinery29's Meredith Clark of the former Maryland governor. \"[Former Virginia Sen.] Jim Webb and [former Rhode Island Gov.] Lincoln Chafee remained, for the most part, marginal to what was going on,\" says David Graham at The Atlantic.\n[ READ: In Debate Hillary Clinton Reminds Democrats Why She's the Front-Runner ]\nEven Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, second in the polls to Clinton and her biggest competitor so far, \"made himself into a political eunuch,\" writes John Podhoretz at New York Post. Instead of taking her to task over the email kerfuffle, a vulnerability that could follow Clinton to the general election, he sided with her . \"If Sanders really believes he has a chance at the presidency, he needs to give Democrats an alternative to Hillary on the trustworthiness issue,\" writes Podhoretz.\nThen again, reasons Suzy Khimm at the New Republic, Sanders wasn't really gunning for Clinton. \"[T]he debate seemed to confirm that Sanders isn't interested in stretching himself as a candidate for the sake of broader political appeal,\" she writes. He views politics \"through a single prism,\" she explains, unwilling to engage on anything that falls outside of this framework. In other words, \"Bernie's gonna be Bernie.\"\nDespite Clinton's steady – and growing – lead over her fellow candidates, it's the Democratic Party that reigned supreme, writes Richard Barry of The Moderate Voice. \"The candidates had a real discussion about the issues, within the parameters allowed by electoral politics. They were respectful of each other and of key constituencies,\" he argues. Gabriel Arana at The Huffington Post tweeted , \"The #DemDebate makes Republican debate look like the real kids table.\"\n[ DEBATE CLUB: Who Won the First Democratic Debate? ]\nBut not so fast, writes James Poulos at The Week; the Democrats aren't the anti-Republicans they think they are. Chafee and Webb \"boast GOP experience in office,\" he writes, and Clinton voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force and the Iraq War (but has since changed her position). Even Sanders clings to guns rights, \"lecturing his rivals that they misunderstood the place of firearms in rural life at their peril\" during the debate, notes Poulos. \"If Republicans can solve their personality crisis, they just might come out looking like the moderate ones,\" he concludes.\nTAGS: politics Clinton, Hillary Sanders, Bernie 2016 presidential election Democratic Party", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ztl%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Hillary%20Clinton%20Owns%20Democratic%20Debate%2C%20Pundits%20React&summary=What%20everyone%27s%20saying%20about%20the%20first%20Democratic%20debate.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/14/biden-needed-hillary-to-stumble-instead-she-finally-shined", "https://twitter.com/gabrielarana", "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/the-atlantics-liveblog-of-the-democratic-presidential-debate/410413/", "https://youtu.be/BrBXcKcviuc", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/10/13/hillary_clinton_won_the_cnn_debate_with_a_surprising_performance.html", "http://theweek.com/articles/583049/surprising-conservatism-first-democratic-debate", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ztl%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.refinery29.com/2015/10/95727/martin-o-malley-democratic-debate-closing-statement-quotes#.yqbok8:ozyO", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/10/14/hillary-clinton-delivers-top-notch-debate-performance/h2WzCgXgUqYTnog4lu35tL/story.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/opinion/hillary-clintons-democratic-debate-magic.html", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ztl%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Hillary%20Clinton%20Owns%20Democratic%20Debate%2C%20Pundits%20React", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ztl%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ztl%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Hillary%20Clinton%20Owns%20Democratic%20Debate%2C%20Pundits%20React", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe6ztl%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.newrepublic.com/article/123115/why-bernie-sanders-lost-debate", "http://themoderatevoice.com/209656/the-winner-of-tonights-debate-was-the-democratic-party/", "https://twitter.com/gabrielarana/status/654122626089136128"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:30:14.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
