WASHINGTON — She really did stand by her man.\nAs a sex scandal threatened Bill Clinton’s presidency, Hillary Clinton defended him despite his tryst with Monica Lewinsky — blaming the young intern, the President’s enemies and herself, according to the writings of a late friend.\nThe friend, Diane Blair, described Hillary Clinton’s reaction to the way her husband handled the Lewinsky affair: “It was a lapse, but she says to his credit he tried to manage someone who was clearly a ‘narcissistic loony toon,’ but it was beyond control,” she wrote in notes reviewed by the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website.\nSean Gardner/Getty Images Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks at the 10th National Automobile Dealers Association Convention on Jan. 27, 2014 in New Orleans. Clinton in part blamed herself for her husband's affair. After Bill owned up to the affair, Hillary faulted herself for not being attuned to the stress he was under because of his adversaries.\n“She thinks she was not smart enough, not sensitive enough, not free enough of her own concerns and struggles to realize the price he was paying.” Blair wrote.\n© Reuters Photographer / Reuters/REUTERS President Bill Clinton embraces Monica Lewinsky in a scene which became a prominent image of their sex scandal. Hillary Clinton later told a close friend that Monica Lewinsky was a 'narcissistic loony toon,' according to newly revealed writings by longtime Hillary Clinton friend Diane Blair. Blair, whom Hillary Clinton once described as her “closest friend,” died at 61 in 2000. Her husband donated her personal papers to the University of Arkansas.\nBlair tended to share Hillary’s “complex, pragmatic view of politics and men,” said David Maraniss, who wrote a biography of Bill Clinton.\n© Reuters Photographer / Reuters President Bill Clinton poses with Monica Lewinsky in a Nov. 17, 1995 photo. According to a deposition Lewinsky later gave, she had a sexual encounter with Bill Clinton in the White House that day. The writings show Hillary Clinton apparently took a dim view of women who accuse politicians of caddish behavior.\nDiscussing harassment charges against then-Sen. Bob Packwood — whose help Hillary Clinton sought for her health care plan — Blair wrote in 1993 that Hillary was “tired of all these whiny women.”\nMARK LENNIHAN/ASSOCIATED PRESS Former President Bill Clinton takes the stage with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and daughter, Chelsea, at the Clinton Global Initiative Sept. 24, 2013, in New York. The initiative was started by Clinton to act as a forum where leaders from all over the world can discuss and develop solutions to global issues. The papers include a polling memo from Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, stating that voters admired the couple, but adding: “What voters find slick in Bill Clinton, they find ruthless in Hillary.”\nBlair’s notes cover a “hellacious” first year for Hillary in Washington, where her health care reform hit resistance on Capitol Hill.\nBlair wrote that in 1993 Hillary Clinton was “dumbfounded by people who look her in the eye and lie to her” and frustrated by the White House’s failure to fight back.\n\"HC still in despair that nobody in WH tough and mean enough,” Blair wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:13:02.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
