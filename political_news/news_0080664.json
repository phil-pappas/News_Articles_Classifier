Upgrades At US Nuclear Bases In Europe Acknowledge Security Risk\nBy By Hans M. Kristensen http://fas.org/blogs/security/2015/09/nuclear-insecurity/\nPosted on Sep.10, 2015 in NATO , Nuclear Weapons , United States by Hans M. Kristensen By Hans M. Kristensen Federation of American Scientists\nSecurity upgrades underway at U.S. Air Force bases in Europe indicate that nuclear weapons deployed in Europe have been stored under unsafe conditions for more than two decades.\nCommercial satellite images show work underway at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey and Aviano Air Base in Italy. The upgrades are intended to increase the physical protection of nuclear weapons stored at the two U.S. Air Force Bases.\nThe upgrades indirectly acknowledge that security at U.S. nuclear weapons storage sites in Europe has been inadequate for more than two decades.\nAnd the decision to upgrade nuclear security perimeters at the two U.S. bases strongly implies that security at the other four European host bases must now be characterized as inadequate.\nSecurity challenges at Incirlik AB are unique in NATO’s nuclear posture because the base is located only 110 kilometers (68 miles) from war-torn Syria and because of an ongoing armed conflict within Turkey between the Turkish authorities and Kurdish militants. The wisdom of deploying NATO’s largest nuclear weapons stockpile in such a volatile region seems questionable. (UPDATE: Pentagon orders “voluntary departure” of 900 family members of U.S. personnel stationed at Incirlik. )\nhttp://fas.org/blogs/security/2015/09/nuclear-insecurity/ Contune Reading", "external_links": ["http://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/incirlik-top.jpg", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33844246", "http://fas.org/category/nato/", "http://fas.org/category/nuclear_weapons/", "http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Transcripts/Transcript-View/Article/616244/department-of-defense-press-briefing-by-pentagon-press-secretary-peter-cook-in", "http://fas.org/blogs/security/2015/09/nuclear-insecurity/", "http://fas.org/author/hans-m-kristensen/", "http://fas.org/category/united_states/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:45:34.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
