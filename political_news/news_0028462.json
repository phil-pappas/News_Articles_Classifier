The UN Secretary General said he “render tribute to men and women of Italy who have saved tens of thousands of migrants.” He thanked Italy and called for all EU countries to share the burden of rescuing, hosting and processing migrants and asylum seekers. “All nations have the same duty, above and beyond geographical proximity,” he said, according to the Italian news agency ANSA. The current refugee and migration crisis is a “defining moment” for Europe and the world, Ban also said in an address to Italian Government officials.\n“Italy has always been a bridge across cultures and continents,” he told the Chamber of Senate and Deputies in Rome in an address kicking off his three-day official visit to the country. The UN chief thanked again Italy for its “resources, energy and empathy for the thousands of desperate people arriving here in search of safety,” noting that Italy was a leader in European rescue efforts. “These are urgently needed to stop the thousands of needless deaths that are turning the Mediterranean into a sea of tears,” he said.\nThe UN chief stressed that millions of forcibly displaced people from Syria are being hosted by its neighbours, such as Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq and some in Egypt and North Africa. Like those countries, Italy’s shoreline makes it a frontline state for refugees from the Middle East and Africa, he stressed.\nWar in Syria\n“The war in Syria is the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” he continued, adding that his Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, a former Deputy Foreign Minister of Italy, is leading the effort “to forge a lasting political solution.”\nThe Secretary-General also noted the threat to peace posed by violent extremists across the Middle East, North Africa and beyond. “We must stop the atrocities, especially the attacks against women and girls,” he said. “We must also end the destruction of cultural heritage.”\nItaly’s contribution to the UN\nThe Secretary General went on to recall the scores of Italians who have lost their lives in the cause of peace and stability. “We thank the thousands of sons and daughters of Italy who have served under our blue flag of the United Nations over the years,” he said, noting the murder of 13 Italian peacekeepers in the Congo in 1961.\n“Today – out of all the western nations – Italy is the top troop contributing country to United Nations peacekeeping operations,” he continued. “Italian support has been especially valuable for the United Nations mission in Lebanon. The fighting in Syria is putting intense pressure on Lebanon – and the United Nations is doing everything possible to respond, with Italy’s critical support.”\nHe also welcomed Italy’s renewed commitment to foreign aid and its goal to become a top donor among G7 nations, and praised its backing for preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.un.org/sg/statements/index.asp?nid=9137"], "published": "2015-10-16T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:10:13.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
