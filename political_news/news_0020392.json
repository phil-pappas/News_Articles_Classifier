It's the first from Vandy's political research arm to survey Nashville. The poll found that 72 percent of Nashville residents think the city is headed in the right direction and that those positive vibes reach across demographics like age, race, and income level. Millennials — who, by the way, probably feel entitled to everything because they are an all-consuming obsession for media and pollsters — are the most optimistic. But 75 percent of respondents also believe Metro should increase spending on things like education and affordable housing. A thousand Nashvillians participated in the poll, reached on landlines and cell phones. More on the results from the Vanderbilt release, after the jump (with Pith's correction on the cost of the Music City Center): Public approval is high City officials and institutions are riding impressive approval ratings as Barry takes office. Most popular of all is former mayor Karl Dean, who enjoys 66 percent approval ratings and only 18 percent disapproval. Barry starts out with a solid 41 percent approval rating and just 12 percent disapproval. The Metro Council has 58 percent approval, and the Metro School Board has 43 percent approval and 37 percent disapproval. “Based on Karl Dean’s popularity, the numbers of people who think the city is on the right track and the sense of shared priorities, it’s clear that people are pretty satisfied with the direction of the city,” Geer said. Race not an issue, but income is “We found it a bit of a surprise, though, that the differences among people in Nashville tend to play out in terms of income level rather than race,” Geer said. For instance, 88 percent of those making $100,000 or more per year believe the building of a more than [$600 million], 350,000-foot convention center downtown was a good move. That number drops more than half to 42 percent for households with incomes from $75,000 to $100,000, and a majority of those who make less than $45,000 a year think the money should have been put toward improving other parts of the city. Asked about the availability of healthy, affordable food close to their neighborhoods, 75 percent of those who make more than $100,000 per year said it wasn’t a problem. At the under $30,000 and $15,000 per year levels, that number shrank to the high 40s. Sixty-five percent of households thought finding housing in Nashville when making less than $30,000 a year was very difficult, and 28 percent said it was somewhat difficult. When asked about the availability of housing for those making between $40,000 to $60,000 a year, 40 percent said finding affordable housing was very difficult and 43 percent said it was somewhat difficult. Education is top priority across the board Parents with children in public pre-schools, kindergartens and elementary schools thought their children were in good hands, grading the schools 3.8 on a 5-point scale. For public junior high and high schools, satisfaction dropped to 3.3. A solid majority, 71 percent, of parents with children in public school, support the opening of more charter schools in Nashville. The most important priority of the city should be improving public education, according to 84 percent of those polled. Whites, blacks and Hispanics all agreed that it should be the No. 1 priority, with blacks designating it the most urgent at 91 percent. Reducing crime was the second-highest priority at 76 percent, followed by ensuring the city’s long-term financial health (71 percent), helping the poor (69 percent) and easing traffic congestion (65 percent). When it comes to giving tax breaks, 73 percent of Nashville residents said they were open to arts organizations such as the Nashville Symphony receiving help, and 65 percent were satisfied if manufacturing companies such as Bridgestone Americas received incentives in the form of tax breaks to bring jobs to the city. Residents were less sanguine about giving such allowances to sports teams and entertainment productions, with 51 percent opposing tax breaks for teams such as the Tennessee Titans, versus the 47 percent who approve of them. No word on how many Nashvillians approve of teams such as the Tennessee Titans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:29:48.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
