The nearly $100 billion deals would reduce the number of major, national health plans from five down to three — and potentially undermine a central goal of the Affordable Care Act, increased competition. “These mergers should be scrutinized very closely with an eye to preventing the undue concentration that they appear to create,” Clinton said in a statement. “I am very skeptical of the claim that consumers will benefit from them because the evidence from careful studies shows that too often the companies end up pocketing profits rather than passing savings to consumers.”\nClinton’s statement is her latest populist alarm on consumer issues and comes days after she pressed federal regulators to investigate a drug company that raised the price of a decades-old drug more than 5,000 percent overnight.\nShe is the first presidential candidate to question a pair of mergers announced this summer — Anthem's takeover of Cigna and Aetna's acquisition of Humana. The wave of consolidation has sparked concerns from other health care players, most notably the American Hospital Association, and was scrutinized during three recent congressional hearings.\nThe companies have ramped up their lobbying efforts since the deals were announced, according to disclosure forms filed Tuesday evening. Anthem spent $2.3 million on lobbying during the third quarter of this year, more than doubling its spending during the same quarter in 2014. Aetna's lobbying totaled $690,000 the most recent quarter, about a 60 percent increase over last year's figures at this time.\nThe collapse of eight nonprofit startup health plans established with federal Obamacare loans could heighten concerns about competition in the insurance marketplace. Funding for the co-op insurers was included in the law to put pressure on the national insurance giants to keep down prices in the Obamacare exchanges.\nClinton is vowing to toughen regulatory scrutiny if she becomes president.\n\"I would strengthen the antitrust enforcement arms of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and appoint aggressive regulators to take on troubling concentration wherever it occurs in the health care industry,\" she said.\nClinton has issued a number of health policy statements in recent weeks. The Democratic front-runner has also proposed capping out-of-pocket drug costs at $250 per month and providing a refundable tax credit for individuals with insurance who still face steep medical bills. In addition, Clinton has called for scrapping Obamacare’s controversial “Cadillac Tax,” a 40 percent levy on high-cost workplace health plans that's slated to take effect in 2018.\nFederal regulators still need to approve the Anthem and Aetna deals, which are likely to raise unique concerns. Combining Aetna and Humana would create the largest provider of private Medicare Advantage plans, with roughly 4 million customers. Scrutiny of the Anthem's merger is likely to focus on states where Cigna competes with the Blue Cross Blue Shield carrier for customers. Anthem is the licensed Blue carrier in 14 states and faces restrictions on competing against other Blues.\nInsurers, who have argued that the mergers will allow them to reduce overhead costs and pass those savings onto consumers through lower premiums, said Wednesday that they're already operating in a competitive and regulated environment.\n\"If the goal is to make health care more affordable and to provide greater choices for consumers, then policymakers should focus on addressing the real cost challenges facing patients -- the soaring prices of prescription drugs and medical services -- that drive up the cost of coverage and out-of-pocket costs for millions across the country,\" said America's Health Insurance Plans spokeswoman Clare Krusing.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.politicopro.com/health-care/story/2015/09/insurers-defend-blockbuster-mergers-under-senate-scrutiny-055052", "https://www.politicopro.com/health-care/whiteboard/2015/10/oregon-co-op-plan-becomes-eighth-fatality-062176"], "published": "2015-10-21T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:46:37.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
