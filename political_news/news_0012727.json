Steve Warren, a spokesman in Baghdad for the U.S.-led coalition that is fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\nWarren said the U.S. has intensified its airstrikes in the Ramadi area over the past 10 days and Iraqi ground forces are beginning to make progress. He said the Iraqis are in the outer Ramadi suburbs, with Iraqi F-16 fighter jets recently joining the operation in support of Iraqi ground troops.\nRamadi fell to the Islamic State in May when Iraqi troops fled, prompting the U.S. to question their will to fight.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
