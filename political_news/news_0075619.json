Do we go to the party who, in my belief, would make the situation an awful lot worse?\" \nA favourable budget saw support for Fine Gael rise by two points to 30% compared with September, the first time in almost three years the party has reached this level. \nSupport fell for the other half of the Coalition however, as Labour suffered a three point decline to 7% compared with last month. \nIf these results were replicated in the general election the current Coalition would be unable to secure the necessary seats to remain in office without support from Independents or at least one other party. \nMeanwhile, Fianna Fail has gained 2 points and now stands at 20%. Gareth Chaney Collins Fianna Fail Leader Micheal Martin: Would he be prepared to do a deal with Enda Kenny? \nLabour’s continued hemorrhaging of support has fuelled speculation that Fine Gael may need the support of Fianna Fail, their long time rivals, to form a stable government. \nTaoiseach Enda Kenny stressed the need for sustained recovery telling his party’s presidential dinner recently that it must “sustain the recovery” instead of handing it over to rival parties. \nMr Kenny said: “I, for one, don’t want to see Ireland’s hard-won progress put at risk by those who wrecked our economy several times in the past, or by those whose policies would surely wreck it in the future. \n“Fine Gael has a plan to keep the recovery going. \n“It’s a plan based on enterprise, not speculation.” \nMinister Bruton admitted that he in unconcerned by Labour’s ailing support. \nHe added: “Both parties (Fine Gael and Labour) have lost support, people have been through a very difficult period, people have suffered a lot that is the reality. \n“Every poll is different and as we get closer to the election I think people will look at the alternatives and stick with a policy mix that is seeing our roads being busier, our restaurants fuller, and all our sectors showing good signs of recovery.” Are Fine Gael and Fianna Fail destined to form a Government together?
