(AP) â€” The city of Oakland, California, sent a letter warning a church that it could be fined after a neighbor complained that choir practice was causing unbearable night-time noise.\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reports (http://bit.ly/1G9tDr2 ) that the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church has served residents in West Oakland for 65 years. Pastor Thomas A. Harris III says he was surprised to learn he could face an initial fine of $3,529, followed by $500-per-day penalties, for the \"joyful noise\" of choir practice.\nHarris says rehearsal ends at 9 p.m., but the complaint sent to the city says the loud music sometimes lasts until 2 a.m.\nCity spokeswoman Karen Boyd says the letter was a courtesy notice and that she hasn't received any more complaints. She says she doesn't intend to fine the church.\n___\nInformation from: San Francisco Chronicle, http://www.sfgate.com\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9g7s%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9g7s%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9g7s%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=City%20warns%20church%20after%20neighbor%20complains%20about%20choir%20noise&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9g7s%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=City%20warns%20church%20after%20neighbor%20complains%20about%20choir%20noise", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9g7s%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=City%20warns%20church%20after%20neighbor%20complains%20about%20choir%20noise", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9g7s%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://bit.ly/1G9tDr2"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:40:47.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
