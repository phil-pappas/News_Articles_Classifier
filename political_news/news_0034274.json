(AP) - A collective of environmentalists paddled along the Delaware River in kayaks to protest pollution allegedly caused by dumping at a PSE&G; power plant located on Duck Island. \nThe Courier-Post reports (http://on.cpsj.com/1N9ao0n ) activists from the New Jersey Sierra Club and Environment New Jersey pushed off from Bordentown Beach around 12:45 p.m. Monday and trekked four miles up the river to the plant’s shoreline. \nProtesters called for the state to force the energy company’s coal-fired plant to install cooling towers that would lower the temperature of river water used in power generation. \nSierra Club Executive Director Jeff Tittel says the plant discharges superheated water back into the river that contains contaminants responsible for killing fish. \nPSE&G; officials say the company has worked to maintain its reputation as “good stewards of the environment.” \n___ \nInformation from: Courier-Post (Cherry Hill, N.J.), http://www.courierpostonline.com/ \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:29:21.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
