The Republican National Committee and candidates began discussing the format on Wednesday, RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said.\nCNBC had proposed two hours of debating time not including four commercial breaks, meaning the time the candidates would be onstage would be about 15 minutes longer.\nThe most recent debate, on CNN, lasted three hours with commercial breaks, a duration that left some of the candidates complaining. Since the debates have set records for high ratings, television networks have an incentive to keep the candidates onstage and on the air for as long as they possibly can.\nCNBC had initially called for no opening and closing statements, which made some candidates unhappy because it would take away their best chance to speak directly to voters without having to be called on to respond to a question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:40:35.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
