This would need careful co-ordination between different levels of government and broader federal support.\"\nHousing hard landing On the risks confronting the economy, the IMF warns that non-resource demand could be slower to pick up than expected, and further terms of trade falls could entrench slower growth, higher unemployment and fiscal deficits, especially if there is reform inertia.\nAt the same time, it says, the housing market could experience a hard landing .\n\"Current efforts to rein in riskier property lending might not be sufficiently effective. Against a backdrop of already high house prices and household debt, this could give rise to price overshooting and excessive risk-taking,\" the IMF warns.\n\"A sharp correction in house prices, possibly driven by Sydney, could be triggered by external conditions – for example, a sharper slowdown in China or a rise in global risk premia.\n\"The house price cycle could be amplified by leveraged investors looking to exit the market and a turning commercial property cycle.\"\nThe IMF warns that investors in self-managed superannuation funds that have added geared property to their fund portfolios would also be among those adversely affected in a downturn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:50:18.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
