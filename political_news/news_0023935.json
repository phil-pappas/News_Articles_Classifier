No wonder Shanghai Pengxin pulled out of the Northland Farms sale. \n\"With the TPP set to raise the threshold for OIO scrutiny of company sales from $100m to $200m it’s essential the OIO is properly resourced to scrutinise these sales. \n\"Labour will toughen up and better resource the OIO so that buyers and sellers will know where they stand. Good quality foreign investment shouldn’t be driven away but investors should have to prove they can create good jobs for New Zealanders and be held to account for those pledges. \n\"There is no doubt that both the whole Overseas Investment Act and the Overseas Investment Office need a real shake up because they are simply not delivering. \n\"New Zealand needs good quality overseas investment that is going to deliver for our country and community. This means an overseas investment regime that is fit for purpose. Our current one isn’t,\" said Stuart Nash. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
