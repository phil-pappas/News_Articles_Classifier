Employees at Denver-based Platte River Networks in a mid-August email chain were trying to find records that showed that the Clinton Executive Service Corp., the company paying the Platte River bill, had instructed them to reduce the length of time backups of Clinton's emails were kept.\n“Any chance you found an old email with their directive to cut the backup back in Oct-Feb,” one Platte River employee asked another, according to excerpts of the emails included in a Monday letter from Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). “I know they had you cut it once in Oct-Nov, then again to 30day in Feb-ish.”\nSuch a record, the employee said, would be “golden,\" and would clear the company of outside criticism and point back to Clinton Executive Service Corp., which “appears to be a Clinton family company,” according to the Johnson letter.\n“Starting to think this whole thing really is covering up some shaddy shit,” the employee continued. “I just think if we have it in writing that they told us to cut the backups, and we can go public saying we have had backups since day one, then we were told to trim to 30 days, it would make us look a WHOLE LOT better.”\nMcClatchy first reported on the Johnson letter.\nIn December of 2014, Clinton turned over to the State Department about half of her 60,000-plus emails that spanned her time in office as Secretary of State. The other 30,000, she said, were “personal” in nature. She said she deleted them.\nRepublicans and outside groups suing State Department for documents, however, have questioned whether she turned over all her work-related documents as is required by law — or if her team withheld messages that would have potentially been embarrassing to the Democratic 2016 presidential frontrunner.\nClinton ad highlights McCarthy statement on Benghazi By Gabriel Debenedetti\nHer team has said they were over-inclusive in what they turned over. But just days ago, the State Department confirmed that it did not receive copies of work-related emails from the first few weeks of Clinton’s tenure, an oversight first discovered by a government watchdog.\nThe previously undisclosed emails between Clinton and General David Petraeus further raised questions about whether her public record was complete.\nThe State Department, according to Tuesday court documents, wrote to Clinton’s lawyer David Kendall, and asked that that he confirm that Clinton did not have additional emails from the beginning of her tenure. State asked that Clinton turn over any such emails.\nAccording to the Platte River email chain, the employees searching for directives about backing up Clinton's email considered creative ways to find the instructions.\n“Wonder how we can sneak an email in now after the fact asking them when they told us to cut the backups and have them confirm it for our records,” the employee wrote.\nFootnotes in the letter say the employees believe the directives were give over the phone.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T03:22:17.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
