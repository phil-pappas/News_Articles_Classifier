Hughes had just sat down with Sen. Don Gaetz for a brief meeting as part of his regular Neighborhood Day office hours. \"The first word that comes to my mind is energized,\" he said. He came to Gaetz to express concerns about a program he believed was fraudulent. \"I looked in his eyes ... and I believe him. I trust him,\" Hughes said. Sometimes a politician just needs to listen. That's why Gaetz hosts Neighborhood Days throughout Northwest Florida to take comments, complaints and the occasional compliment from his constituents. Inside the church, a handful of people straggled in. Light refreshments and newspapers sat in the informal waiting area. \"Not too many people get in their car and drive to Tallahassee,\" Gaetz said from an office in the church. \"Real people have real jobs and families to tend to.\" The questions he faces run the gamut from property taxes, the School Board prayer issue and even potholes. Gaetz said even if it's not his jurisdiction, he contacts county commissioners or Congressman Jeff Miller to follow up on issues. Gaetz has more than 70 Neighborhood Days under his belt. It's a rare situation that he has an odd request, he said. Although he does remember one man expressing concern over black helicopters that were hovering over his house. Sometimes the Neighborhood Day is chance to catch up. One grandmother he met back when he was superintendent came in just to hug him. Others came in just to introduce themselves. \"The senator took the time to come in to meet us, so I'm taking the time to share a viewpoint as a constituent,\" said Giuliana Scott. The viewpoint was opposing, but Gaetz said it was \"a good conversation.\" That's why he holds the Neighborhood Days inside churches or community centers to discuss issues in a non-threatening way. \"When I go to Tallahassee, I'll have the real voices of real people ringing in my ears,\" Gaetz said. \"It's too rare that people get this opportunity.\" By JENNIE McKEON", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:27:18.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
