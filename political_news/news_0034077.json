It’s intense and interesting. But just as fascinating are the City Council races, where all 13 are contested and at least six new faces will populate the body simply because of incumbents’ departures.\nSo while these aren’t all the things I find myself wondering the week before the election, here are some:\n1. Can Rachel Knox send District 2 to a runoff? Frank Colvett Jr. has the money and the Republican bona fides in the open seat in District 2, but the upstart Knox has plenty of union backing and a decent amount of money. Many expect Colvett to win, but can he win on election day with more than 50 percent and avoid the Nov. 19 runoff? That’s the question.\n2. Is Berlin Boyd ’s seat in jeopardy? He is technically the District 7 incumbent, but he was never elected by the voters of his district. (They elected Lee Harris in 2011; Boyd received the interim appointment to his seat in January.) A field of eight challengers coalesced around him, including more formidable battles from charter school founder Anthony Anderson and behavioral health consultant Thurston Smith , among others. If someone other than Boyd eventually wins, that would mean a turnover of at least seven faces on the City Council, something I didn’t think was in the cards a year ago.\n3. What to make of District 5? A week before the election, and I’m not quite sure what to expect. Remember, there are five well-funded candidates (more on that in a bit), with two loosely vying for Republican voters and three loosely vying for Democrats. (It’s not that clear-cut, but it’s a good organizing principle for the moment.) And while the East Memphis/Midtown territory suggests friendliness to a GOP-leaning candidate, remember that its current occupant, Jim Strickland , is a Democrat. A runoff seems quite likely, but you could ask 10 insiders in town who makes it to the runoff and get all sorts of answers.\n4. Oh, and if not for the mayor’s race, and if not for the City Council races, I could actually be fairly fascinated by the City Court Clerk’s race. That’s right -- the City Court Clerk’s race. Almost the entire field appeared at a forum prior to the NAACP mayoral forum Sunday afternoon, and I came away thinking that their personal performances only underscored what’s obvious from the ballot: There are a lot of big names, and many voters will have a tough time choosing.\nRemember, there are runoffs in the single-member council districts, but not in the super districts (or the mayor or clerk’s races).\nHeadline headache: “FBI: Violent crime rose here in 2014” is the big headline in today’s print version of The Commercial Appeal. Wisely, the story notes that crime is trending down in 2015. And the 2014 rise isn’t new. But with everything magnified the week before election day, just add it to the pile of headlines the incumbent would rather not see.\nBill Dries of The Daily News has a good look at the crossroads between Mayor A C Wharton ’s accomplishments and his problems these days. An excerpt: “What plagues Wharton beyond the speeches at groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings is a running series of controversies that have nothing to do with the accomplishments marked by such events.”\nBy the way: Speaking of that City Court Clerk forum, I found out there that clerk candidate Justin Ford has an app. Yes, an app. You can find it in the App Store.\nHere’s a Mike Williams ad:\nI see no corresponding filings for the ad to air on broadcast TV.\nStacking paper: Financial disclosures for the pre-election reporting period, which ended last week, are still trickling in. But this we know for sure: Winning District 5 remains an expensive, expensive proposition.\nEven with pre-general disclosures for Worth Morgan , Chooch Pickard and Dan Springer not yet uploaded to the system (as of Tuesday afternoon), there’s a little over a third of a million dollars raised in support of the big five candidates in the race to replace Strickland on the council. Mary Wilder 's campaign brought in $35,595 alone last month, though that includes a $20,000 loan she gave herself on July 30. John Marek raised $20,869.\nAnd think about it: As we mentioned above, District 5 is very likely to head to a runoff, allowing more fundraising and more spending among the two successful candidates.\nEarly voting numbers: The Election Commission reports 3,657 Memphians exercised their franchise Tuesday, bringing the 10-day total to 30,590. That’s 58 percent higher than 2011, four percent lower than 2009 and now 25 percent lower than 2007.\nThis year’s early voting total is beginning to look a lot like 2009, when almost 110,000 voters cast their ballots for a turnout of 27 percent.\nA busy few days: I’ll be speaking to the Kiwanis Club of Memphis today at noon. On Thursday, I’ll be part of an 11 a.m. politics panel with Brian Clay at LeMoyne-Owen College, then at 7 p.m. will be part of the Politics 101 panel presented by the Greater Memphis Chamber’s Soundcheck group.\nAnd tonight, I’ll see you at the Flyer ’s Best of Memphis party.\nThings you should read: You’ve got to love this story from Ryan Poe : A pair of graffiti artists are making some City Council candidates’ signs their canvases. … A Lakeland city commissioner’s Facebook post reflected an anti-gay view. … In Clay Bailey ’s Outside the Loop feature, looking into why County Commission chairman Terry Roland left the chamber when that body honored Sheriff Bill Oldham Monday. … A proposed redevelopment for the old Mall of Memphis site has been put on the shelf.\nWhy we're here: InforMemphis' First Word is a politics-first start to your day.
