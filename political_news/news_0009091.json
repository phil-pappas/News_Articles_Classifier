Escalante Perez refused, saying that his father was also a bus driver and he didn't want to kill anyone. The gang members then again threatened him with death: He could be chopped up with a machete or thrown off a bridge. According to FNL, Escalante Perez chose the bridge, and the gang members threw him off the Incienso Bridge, where he fell 443 feet.\n Although he survived the fall, Escalante Perez lay immobile for 72 hours while his parents and rescue workers searched for him. They eventually found him and took him to a hospital, but he died 15 days later.\nLocal human rights activist Edgar Guerra told the Mirror that gang violence against children is increasing, and that it's common for gangs in Central America to recruit children — mostly poor, young, and who have little to no education — into gangs.\n\"This type of phenomenon, the use of children for murders, can be seen much more frequently,\" Guerra said.\nFollow Alanna on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/10/15/gang-members-throw-12-year-old-boy-off-bridge-after-refused-to-kill-bus-driver/", "http://www.twitter.com/alannaknunez", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/kill-killed-boy-12-dies-6017677"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:47:03.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
