The community seems grateful for the free self-storage, and U-Haul is happy to do its part during a difficult time for so many.\"\nU-Haul stores have much-needed supplies available to help with storm recovery, such as boxes, tarps, propane and propane tanks. U-Haul urges customers to stop in to ensure that their propane tanks are topped off, since propane is good to have on hand in the event of long-term power outages.\nWith U-Box containers, you can conveniently pick up our custom-designed trailer and take your U-Box container with you. U-Haul also can store your U-Box container in our secure warehouses or even pick up and deliver it to a location of your choice.\nIn addition to the 30 days of free self-storage being offered, people who need boxes can take advantage of the U-Haul Take a Box, Leave a Box Program. The program enables customers to return their reusable boxes and allows others to take them as needed â€“ FREE. U-Haul encourages anyone who has any type of reusable box to drop it off at the nearest U-Haul location and allow another family to reuse the box.\nAbout U-Haul\nContact:\nJeff Lockridge\nSebastien Reyes\nE-mail: publicrelations@uhaul.com\nPhone: 602-263-6194\nWebsite:\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/u-haul-offering-30-days-of-free-self-storage-to-south-carolina-georgia-residents-affected-by-hurricane-joaquin-flooding-300154563.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.uhaul.com/Storage/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=disaster-relief&utm_medium=self-storage", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/u-haul-offering-30-days-of-free-self-storage-to-south-carolina-georgia-residents-affected-by-hurricane-joaquin-flooding-300154563.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA20654&Transmission_Id=201510051927PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA20654&DateId=20151005", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20090622/LA34860LOGO-b", "http://www.uhaul.com/UBox/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=disaster-relief&utm_medium=Ubox", "http://www.uhaul.com/About/History.aspx", "http://www.uhaul.com/Propane/?utm_campaign=prnews&utm_source=disaster-relief&utm_medium=propane"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:44:46.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
