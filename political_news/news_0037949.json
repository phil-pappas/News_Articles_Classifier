Bernie Sanders. Webb has been polling in the back of the pack with former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee.The Iowa Democratic Party says Webb will not appear at Saturday's major Jefferson-Jackson fundraiser in Des Moines.Webb served as a senator in Virginia.Webb is the first Democrat of five announced candidates to drop from the 2016 presidential race.
