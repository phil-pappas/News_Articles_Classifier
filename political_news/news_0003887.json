(AP Photo/Wayne Parry)\nAssociated Press Oct. 26, 2015 | 12:38 a.m. EDT + More By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press\nBELMAR, N.J. (AP) — People across the country have pitched in to help two New Jersey families get back into their homes three years after Superstorm Sandy wrecked them.\nThe shore community of Belmar started its \"Home By Summer\" campaign in February to raise money to help Krista Sperber and Teresa Keefe make repairs so they could move back in by June. That deadline came and went, but both are now back in their homes just before Sandy's third anniversary.\nThe fundraising campaign brought in $240,000 in cash, materials and labor — most of it from people who don't even know the recipients.\n\"We had a woman from Evanston, Illinois, who wrote a check for $5,000, who had never been to Belmar, never been to the Jersey shore, never even been in New Jersey,\" Mayor Matt Doherty said. \"She just wanted to help. It speaks volumes to the generosity of Americans. We think we're all caught up in division and conflict, but when Americans hear about other Americans in need, they're extremely generous.\"\nSperber, who just got the electricity turned on in her house last Thursday, said she never imagined her family would be out of their home for three years.\n\"A contractor told us this would be a year-and-a-half to two-year process,\" she said. \"We laughed. We said, 'Come on. Stop. We have insurance, we get paid, we rebuild, end of story.' Well, the story wound up being a lot longer than anyone anticipated.\"\nSperber, her husband, Mike Irwin, and their children, Jack Held, 14, and Maisie Held, 12, have moved six times since Sandy. She estimated she got about $70,000 in cash assistance from the program.\nKeefe lived with relatives in Lakewood, about 30 minutes inland. She had to make two-hour-long roundtrips each day to drive her kids Shayla, 14, Shaun, 10, and Alyssa, 9, to school in Belmar so they could maintain links to friends and teachers as the family rebuilt.\nSandy pummeled the Jersey shore and New York on Oct. 29, 2012.\n___\nWayne Parry can be reached at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
