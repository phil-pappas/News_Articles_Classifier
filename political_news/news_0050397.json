Andrew Cuomo, real estate developers and other insiders were negotiating behind the scenes to build a $500 million stadium on a vacant lot near downtown Syracuse – the heart of the 4th council district.\nMahoney said Bey let an opportunity pass by for his district. He was telling Mahoney privately that he was supportive, but Mahoney said she was disappointed that he did not make enough of a case in public when they needed it most.\nBey was outraged at the suggestion.\n\"What a liar,\" he said.\nBey is someone who normally does not take sides in public.\nBut he said, \"If Joanie wants to get into that kind of debate, I would love to. I assure you, it's one she won't win.\"\nBey said he worked hard to galvanize other city councilors in favor of the stadium and tried to convince Mayor Stephanie Miner, even though it strained their friendship. He said his support is a matter of public record.\n\"The city must seize this opportunity now,\" Bey wrote in a letter to the editor with other councilors.\nMiner confirmed Bey's story. He argued that a new stadium would be good economic development for the city. Miner said she had not seen an instance of a stadium as solid economic development anywhere in the country.\nThe plan fizzled.\nMiner said she still believes Bey is a good advocate for the district.\nBey tells a different story about why Mahoney turned against him. He said Mahoney went as far as hunting for someone to oppose him in this year's election.\nBey said the reason goes back to his support for Toby Shelley – the Democrat who is challenging Mahoney this year.\nJust after Democrats designated him to be their candidate this year, Shelley was Quote: d in the Syracuse New Times in an article about racial profiling that he thought it was okay for police to stop and ask someone who looked different how he was doing.\nSome Democratic leaders were outraged enough to drop Shelley as the party's endorsed candidate.\nBey said Mahoney pushed him to denounce Shelley.\nBey, who is black, said he talked to Shelley himself and made his own judgment that the article twisted Shelley's comments out of context and it did not mean Shelley was racist.\n\"Even the fact that she thinks she can call me and influence me, shows the arrogance,\" Bey said. \"Shame on her for making that kind of assumption.\"\nBey went on to say he does not appreciate people who do not live on the South Side of Syracuse who believe they have the best ideas about what is best for the neighborhood.\nAll that said, Bey took a step back and said Mahoney has done a very good job on behalf of the county.\n\"For that reason, she shouldn't have to stoop to these kinds of tactics,\" he said. \"In my opinion, her record is enough to make her a formidable opponent, but these kinds of tactics undermine that. It shows that underneath it all, you have a serious, serious lack of confidence.\"\nMahoney's response to Bey's side of the story, \"That's funny.\"\nShe said she has never in her life asked anyone to denounce anyone else.\nFor her part, Nelson bristled earlier this summer when asked about rumors that Mahoney was backing her race. Since then, her campaign spokesman has told a reporter not to contact Nelson anymore.\nIt is not out of the ordinary for Mahoney to support a Democrat. She famously endorsed Cuomo in his first race for governor. It is unusual, however, for a suburban Republican to support one Democrat against another in the city.\nMiner said she has never seen that happen before in local politics. Miner said she wouldn't comment on Mahoney's comments.\n\"Everybody is allowed to speak their piece, but at the end of the day there is a difference between Republicans and Democrats and I think that is a difference that matters,\" Miner said.\nSee who is on the ballot in Onondaga County.\nContact Michelle Breidenbach anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-3186", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mbreidenbach"], "published": "2015-10-23T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:30:02.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
