(AP) â€” People who live around dozens of lakes in South Carolina are under emergency orders to repair or replace dams that ruptured or were deemed unsafe by inspectors after historic rains this month.\nThose people face staggering bills ranging from thousands of dollars to perhaps millions and they don't have a lot to time to develop their plans or any certainty about how to pay for the projects.\nPrivately owned dams generally aren't eligible for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and they're unlikely to be covered by private insurance. How much all of it will cost is still unknown.\nThe dam owners face an Oct. 30 deadline from the state's environmental agency to hire an engineer and figure it out.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
