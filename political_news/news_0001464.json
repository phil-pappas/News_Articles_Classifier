On this date in 1785, the first city directory in the United States was published. Fittingly, it was in the young country's place of birth - Philadelphia . The directory's title was the unwieldy \"Macpherson's Directory, for the City and Suburbs of Philadelphia , extending to Prime-Street, southward; Maiden-Street, northward; and from the River Delaware to Tenth-Street, westward.\" It contained 6,250 resident names. The 1790 Census found Philadelphia's population to be just over 28,500, making it America's second largest urban place, behind perpetual first place New York City . Today, Philadelphia is the nation's fifth largest city, with a population of over 1.5 million people. For genealogists and the curious, the 1785 Macpherson's directory is available online in paperback. Profile America is in its 19th year as a public service of the U.S. Census Bureau.\nSources:\nKane's Famous First Facts, 1813\n1790Census: http://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/fast_facts/1790_fast_facts.html\nCity Rankings: http://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/007/508.php\nPhiladelphia population: http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/4260000.htm l\nThe Directory: http://www.amazon.com/Macphersons-Philadelphia-Prime-Street-Maiden-Street-Tenth-Street/dp/1171428715\nProfile America is produced by the Center for New Media and Promotions of the U.S. Census Bureau.
