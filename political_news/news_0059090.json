(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nMichelle Obama unveiled a new social media site Monday where teens can swap practical information and stories about continuing education after high school, an initiative backed by more than 20 media, business and nonprofit groups. \n\"We want to create a space where young people can engage with each other, where they can inspire each other to complete their education beyond high school,\" said Mrs. Obama. \nBetterMakeRoom.org will be a place for students ages 14-19 to get information on such matters as signing up for the SAT and ACT exams, filling out federal financial aid forms and applying to college, aides said. Students will also be able to share stories about their goals, their progress and what's inspiring them to go to college. \nThe website is part of the Reach Higher initiative she launched nearly two years ago to help meet President Barack Obama 's goal of returning the U.S. to first in the world in the number of college graduates by 2020. \nThe first lady was following the announcement by heading to Ohio for a rally Wednesday at the University of Akron with LeBron James of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. \nMore than 20 media, business and nonprofit groups are assisting the public awareness campaign, the White House said. Among them are such recognizable names as Vine, Mashable, American Eagle Outfitters, Funny Or Die and the CW television network, along with AwesomenessTV and CollegeHumor. \n___ \nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:18:29.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
