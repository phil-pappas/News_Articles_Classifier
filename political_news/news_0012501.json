Photo by Randall Hill/Reuters \nWhile the Democratic presidential candidates were busy debating Tuesday night, the GOP presidential hopefuls were busy tweeting their reactions and not so subtle disses. Can anyone imagine Chafee as president? No way. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015 Democrats are debating whether capitalism is a good thing. Naturally. #DemDebate \n— Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) October 14, 2015 Marijuana question appropriate. Democrats smoking it if they think their policies will save this country. #DemDebate #ImWithHuck \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 14, 2015 Can’t take it any longer. Wouldn’t make Gitmo detainees watch all of this. Good luck @TheDemocrats , you’re going to need it. #DemDebate \n— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 14, 2015 \nTuesday evening at the Wynn Las Vegas marked the first Democratic debate of the 2016 election season. Hosted by CNN, the five Democratic contenders faced off to discuss a wide range of issues — gun violence, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, campaign finance, income inequality, education and race relations. \nWhile the candidates took their nuanced stances on each topic, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump took the opportunity to live tweet the event. O'Malley, as former Mayor of Baltimore, has very little chance. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015 Sorry, there is no STAR on the stage tonight! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015 All are very scripted and rehearsed, two (at least) should not be on the stage. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015 Notice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS #DemDebate \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015 \nOther GOP candidates joined in on the fun, slinging counter arguments and offering their versions of fact checking wherever they saw fit. Trust any of these candidates to stand up to the Iranian Ayatollahs, ISIL, & Putin? Yeah, me neither! #Demdebate #ISIL \n— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 14, 2015 . @HillaryClinton is as delusional as Obama when it comes to Russia. Terrible answer. #DemDebate \n— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 14, 2015 . @HillaryClinton ’s #KeystonePipeline defense is as believable as Tonya Harding in a deposition. #TripleAxel #DemDebate \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 14, 2015 If you think this country is on the wrong track, Hillary Clinton just told you she has no interest in changing direction. I sure will. \n— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 14, 2015 \nWhile a large amount of the GOP tweets focused on taking aim at Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, Gov. Mike Huckabee made a point to respond to Sen. Bernie Sanders multiple times. \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 14, 2015 I trust @BernieSanders with my tax dollars like I trust a North Korean chef with my labrador! #DemDebate \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 14, 2015 . @BernieSander 's free college Ponzi scheme would make Bernie Madoff blush. #DemDebate \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 14, 2015 . @BernieSander 's socialist math is as solid and sound as El Chapo’s prison security. #DemDebate \n— Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) October 14, 2015 \nBut in between the insults, there were even a few compliments. . @JimWebbUSA is a war hero by any definition #DemDebate \n— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 14, 2015 Good move by Bernie S. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015 \nThe GOP candidates will have their third debate Oct. 28, at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Let’s see if the Dems take a page out of the Republican’s book and sling the mud right back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:42:44.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
