Not done yet.\nBy Rachel Brody Oct. 15, 2015 | 4:10 p.m. EDT + More President Barack Obama said Thursday he will maintain 9,800 U.S. troops in Afghanistan through most or all of 2016, pausing troop drawdown for at least a year and stretching U.S. involvement in the conflict into the next presidency. U.S. forces in the country, originally scheduled to shrink to 5,500 by the end of this year, will reach that size by the end of next year or early 2017, he said. Speaking at a press conference, Obama defended his decision, saying, \"I'm absolutely confident this is the right thing to do.\"\nMax Fisher at Vox says Obama's change of plans serves two purposes: to protect Afghanistan from completely falling into the hands of the Taliban by safeguarding three major cities (Kabul, Jalalabad and Kandahar) and to keep control over U.S. counterterrorism operations located there. \"There is nothing about this small force that is designed to change Afghanistan's slide into chaos,\" he writes. \"It's only to forestall it, and to allow the U.S. to continue targeting terrorists while we're at it.\"\n[ MORE: Editorial Cartoons on Afghanistan ]\nSlate's Joshua Keating argues a continued troop presence in Afghanistan is \"a strange coda for a president who came into office vowing to wind down the Bush administration's wars.\" And military operations carried out under Obama's command in Syria and Iraq, plus covert actions elsewhere, aren't helping his case. \"If a large U.S. counterterrorism force remains in Afghanistan past 2017 and the U.S. continues to provide more and more direct aid to forces fighting in Syria and Iraq,\" writes Keating, \"Obama can no longer portray himself credibly as an ender of wars.\" (The president, for his part, said Thursday, \"I do not support the idea of endless war.\")\nThe Economist notes that while it will be \"disappointing\" to Obama to exit office with troops still in Afghanistan, in this case, perfect is the enemy of the good. \"[T]o have left office with the country once more at the mercy of the Taliban would have poisoned his legacy far more,\" they write. \"He has done the responsible thing by providing a platform for his successor to boost troop numbers if needed,\" they argue, increasing the chance that other NATO nations will remain in Afghanistan, too.\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Barack Obama ]\nSo what's next? Paul Waldman at The Washington Post wonders , \"[I]f Barack Obama couldn't extricate us from Afghanistan in eight years after George W. Bush was there for seven, what is the next president going to do?\" So far, the way forward isn't clear. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, vying for the Republican nomination, and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton haven't directly addressed the subject while campaigning. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, another Republican contender, has supported maintaining the current U.S. force but only offered vagaries on his plan to end U.S. involvement. And in all three presidential debates, Afghanistan was only mentioned in passing, if at all. \"My guess is that all the people vying to be the next president will say pretty much what Rubio says: we'll stay there until the job is done,\" writes Waldman. \"Because at this point, what else can you say?\"\nTAGS: Afghanistan Obama, Barack Obama administration", "external_links": ["http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/10/14/obama_may_keep_u_s_troops_in_afghanistan_past_2016.html", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/16/world/asia/obama-troop-withdrawal-afghanistan.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8egp%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8egp%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Obama%20Halts%20Troop%20Drawdown%20in%20Afghanistan%2C%20Pundits%20React&summary=What%20everyone%27s%20saying%20about%20the%20president%27s%20decision%20to%20keep%20U.S.%20troops%20in%20Afghanistan.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.vox.com/2015/10/15/9539565/afghanistan-obama", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8egp%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Obama%20Halts%20Troop%20Drawdown%20in%20Afghanistan%2C%20Pundits%20React", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8egp%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8egp%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Obama%20Halts%20Troop%20Drawdown%20in%20Afghanistan%2C%20Pundits%20React", "http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21674957-barack-obama-announce-decision-today-americas-military-withdrawal-afghanistan-hold", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/10/15/endless-afghanistan-war-now-scheduled-to-continue-into-the-next-presidency/", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8egp%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:14:17.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
