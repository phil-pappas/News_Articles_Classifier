A girl in Peru downloaded an Ouija board app to her phone, tried it out and ended up seemingly possessed by an evil spirit. According to witnesses, 18-year-old Patricia Quispe from Chosica, Peru, downloaded an Ouija board app to her smartphone at the urging of her friends. Apparently, Patricia and her friends used the app for a while, then the party broke up and she went home.\nHer parents noticed Patricia was acting strangely. In this case, “strange” meant foaming at the mouth, convulsing and screaming. Thinking she may have taken drugs or eaten something that made her sick, they contacted friends who confessed it might be the Ouija app.\nThe parents called paramedics who restrained Patricia and took her to the hospital. Witnesses believed Patricia was possessed by a demon because her personality changed, she became unusually strong, spoke in a different and loud voice and flailed around uncontrollably.\nAfter being examined in the emergency room, Patricia was committed to the hospital’s psychiatric ward for further evaluation. There was no word if an exorcist had been called.\nSource: www.mysteriousunoverse.org\n lifestyle ghost Ouija app Peru Also Read How SMS could save you from ‘skin cancer’ A dose of bitter truth wrapped up in humour Top places to eat out in South India on this New Year's Eve Social media offenders revealed in a new study", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/13BOARD.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/13BOARD.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/lifestyle-offbeat/article/girl-possessed-ouija-app", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:51:25.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
