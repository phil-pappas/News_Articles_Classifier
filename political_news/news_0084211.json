The rule would be enacted across the 28 member states by the start of 2017.\nHe hoped the deal will mean companies pay their fair share of taxes.\nMany companies, such as Amazon and Starbucks, have struck deals with certain European countries in recent years that have allowed them to pay little tax.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
