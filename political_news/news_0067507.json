Carmen, a Beachwood, Ohio, attorney, apparently was anticipating Ohioans will support legalizing marijuana in the Nov. 3 election when he filed a request with Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted to set up a business called delivermepot.com. \n\nHusted shot down the request. \n\n“We rejected it because it’s not legal to deliver pot,” Husted said. \n\nA letter from Husted’s office said a limited liability company, which Carmen proposed establishing, “may be formed for any purpose or purposes for which individuals lawfully may associate themselves, including for any profit or nonprofit purpose.” The key word there is lawful, which at this point, marijuana is not in Ohio, Husted reasoned. \n\nA call was left with Carmen seeking information about his application. \n\nCalifornia and Colorado, where pot is legal, have delivery services with colorful names such as SpeedWeed, Potvalet and Eaze. One company has even proposed delivery by drone. \n\nThere are also numerous food delivery services, including delivermefood.com, a company operating in Cleveland and northeast Ohio. \n\nPot delivery is not covered in State Issue 3, the constitutional amendment proposed by the ResponsibleOhio organization. If approved, Ohioans 21 and older could buy one ounce of marijuana and grow up to eight ounces for personal use. Medical marijuana would be available from special dispensaries, as prescribed by a physician, for those with qualifying medical conditions. \n\najohnson@dispatch.com \n\n@ohioaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:43:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
