Your Right to Know Justices vote against transparency in 62% of cases By Dina Berliner The Columbus Dispatch • Thursday October 8, 2015 9:52 PM \nCIRCLEVILLE, Ohio — Cars and trucks whizzed by about a dozen people walking on blistered feet on Thursday along Rt. 23. \nThe group of death-penalty opponents were on day four of an 83-mile, weeklong journey to Columbus, where they plan to hold a rally on Saturday near the Statehouse. \nAmong those walking are a Texas-based Baptist minister, a previous Death Row inmate exonerated a decade ago and the son of Dr. Sam Sheppard, the Cleveland-area man convicted of killing his pregnant wife, whose case drew national media attention in the 1950s. \nWith a start at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, the prison near Lucasville where executions in the state are conducted, the group wants an end to the death penalty after a bout of botched executions and questions about lethal-injection drugs in Ohio and across the country. \n“It’s just wrong,” said Derrick Jamison, 54, who served time on Death Row in Ohio for 20 years starting in 1985. “Shouldn’t nobody have the right to say who should live or die.” \nJamison considers himself a “survivor” of Death Row after he was exonerated for the killing of a nightclub owner in Cincinnati. Oct. 25 marks both the day Jamison was sent to and released from prison. As he celebrates 10 years since his release, Jamison admits that while many inmates on Death Row are indeed guilty, there are also innocent men. \n“If you make a mistake with the death penalty, you can’t go get a person out the grave and say ‘ Oh, my bad,’ and they’re (the state) making too many mistakes,” he said. \nOhio’s last execution was Jan. 16, 2014, when Dennis McGuire struggled and gasped for several minutes before succumbing to a combination of drugs not used before. The next execution is scheduled for January but as of August, the state was still trying to find drugs to use. \nWhile lawmakers passed and Gov. John Kasich signed a bill intended to make getting execution drugs easier by keeping the source secret, a bipartisan House bill introduced this past summer calls for an end to the death penalty in the state. \n“Ohio has an option, it’s called life without parole,” said Terry Collins, former director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections. During his time with the department, Collins said he witnessed more than 30 executions. He now works to educate Ohioans about the death penalty and advocates for its abolition. \n“I think a nationwide discussion about the death penalty has certainly changed whether, not just Ohio, but if the United States needs the death penalty,” he said. \nSam Reese Sheppard, whose father appealed a death-penalty conviction to the U.S. Supreme Court, said despite peoples’ mixed opinions on the issue, he said Ohioans have been receptive to open conversation. “We’ve been on the road the past few days, and even if people disagree with us they’r e usually not vengeful or obnoxious about it.” \nThe walkers, sponsored by Ohioans to Stop Executions and other groups, will hold a community dialogue at 7 p.m. today at 1021 E. Broad St. They also invite people to join the end of their walk Saturday at 10 a.m. from 1500 S. 4th St. The rally will take place at noon Saturday in front of Trinity Episcopal Church, 125 E. Broad St. \nDina Berliner is a fellow in the E.W.
