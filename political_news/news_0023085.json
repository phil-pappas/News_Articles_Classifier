Two family-favorite brands are coming together to support K-12 schools with the launch of the new Hanes4Education program that allows the entire community to raise dollars for schools. The Hanes4Education program is simple: Schools can earn cash rebates through orders of Hanes ® or Champion ® printed apparel placed with screen-print suppliers. This includes shirts for youth soccer leagues, company events, family reunions, or local 5Ks – all of those shirts can earn a cash rebate ( $0.10 per piece) for a K-12 school.\n\"The Hanes4Education program makes it easy for everyone in the community to get involved with supporting schools with purchases they are already making,\" said Rachel Newman , director of sales and marketing for Hanes Branded Printwear.\nAll public and private K-12 schools are eligible per the program guidelines. Schools can earn $0.10 per piece with a maximum of $500 per order and $5,000 total for the calendar year.\n\"Our Hanes and Champion brands are proud to support schools,\" said Newman. \"The cash rebates, which are sent directly to the schools, can be used for anything from classroom supplies to technology upgrades to class trips.\"\nThe process is easy. Any business, team, organization, sorority/fraternity or school needing printed shirts for an upcoming event simply asks their favorite supplier to print on Hanes ® or Champion® shirts, then submits the Hanes4Education Rebate Form (available at Hanes4Education.com ) along with a copy of the purchase invoice and designates a K-12 school to receive the rebate. The Rebate Form can be completed by the customer, the recipient school or the supplier. Schools will receive their checks directly from Hanes4Education.\nComplete program details available at Hanes4Education.com .\nAbout Hanes Branded Printwear\nHanes Branded Printwear is a major supplier of T-shirts, sport shirts and fleece to the decorated apparel industry under the Hanes, Hanes Beefy-T, and Champion brands.
