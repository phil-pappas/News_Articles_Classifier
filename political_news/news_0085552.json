Johnson signed legislation abolishing an immigration quota system based on national origin that had been in force since 1924. Breaking from past immigration policy, it established a new one primarily based on reuniting immigrant families and attracting skilled workers. It welcomed immigrants from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.\nIn signing the bill at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, Johnson said: “This [old] system violates the basic principle of American democracy, the principle that values and rewards each man on the basis of his merit as a man. It has been un-American in the highest sense, because it has been untrue to faith that brought thousands to these shores even before we were a country.”\nThe bill’s proponents asserted that its passage would not significantly influence American culture. Johnson said it was “not a revolutionary bill” because “it does not affect the lives of millions.” During a debate on the Senate floor, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass), speaking of its potential effects, said, “Our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. ... Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset.”\nSuch assertions would prove to be inaccurate.\n“In theory, the new approach created a ‘fair’ system in which each nation had the same level of access to the same number of U.S. visas each year. In practice, however, the new system gave people in smaller nations much greater access to the United States than large nations,” Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed article last month.\nIn line with the 1924 act, the new one also barred entry to gays and lesbians, labeling them as “sexual deviants.” This provision was rescinded in 1990.\nSOURCE: “HOW A 1965 IMMIGRATION REFORM CREATED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION” BY DOUGLAS MASSEY, WASHINGTON POST, SEPT. 25, 2015\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:08:45.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
