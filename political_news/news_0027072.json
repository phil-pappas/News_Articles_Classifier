Leon Stavrinakis, one of her five opponents, on his legislative record in a debate Wednesday and in new TV ads that began running Thursday.\nDeerin, founder of WINGS for Kids and Mayor Joe Riley’s former campaign manager, is criticizing Stavrinakis for accepting donations from developers, promoting development before appropriate infrastructure was built, and voting against a $400 million roads bill during the last legislative session. In the ad, she also touts her plan to improve transportation.\nStavrinakis held a news conference Friday in Washington Square Park to chastise Deerin for the negative campaigning.\nAt the event, he was surrounded by dozens of supporters, including Joe Riley III, the mayor’s son, and state Reps. Wendell Gilliard and Peter McCoy.\nAll of the candidates until this week had been running positive campaigns, Stavrinakis said. He also said Riley always has run positive campaigns and been a positive leader. Deerin’s comments, he said, “were beneath the standard the city set this year.”\nStavrinakis said that the city had pulled together in a remarkable show of unity in the past year in the wake of several tragedies including the shooting death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, by a North Charleston police officer; the shooting deaths of nine black people by a white supremacist at Emanuel AME Church; and this month’s historic flooding. But Deerin’s campaign was inconsistent with that show of unity, he said. “We have really shown the world a new definition of what it means to be a united community, a community that truly has come together,” Stavrinakis said.\nAfter the news conference, Stavrinakis said Deerin’s attacks are misguided. “Nobody has worked harder to bring road money to Charleston than I have,” he said. “I’ll keep doing that.”\nDeerin followed up with a news conference of her own at her West Ashley campaign office.\nShe stood by the claims in her TV ad and at the mayoral debate earlier this week at the College of Charleston.\nShe said it was “twisted logic to connect the tragedies our city has experienced to policy comparisons on transportation and development.”\nStavrinakis was “worried about his political backside, not Charleston” when he voted against the roads bill, Deerin said.\nThe bill would have allocated at least $400 million for roads, primarily through tax on gasoline at the wholesale level. Stavrinakis has said he voted against the bill, which ultimately fell victim to a filibuster in the Senate, because it was bad for Charleston. “It raised taxes and reduced our share at the same time,” he has said. He also said it would have abolished the board of the S.C. Transportation Infrastructure Bank and moved the agency under the state Department of Transportation. He was opposed to that because the bank has funded the most important projects in the Charleston area, including the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, the extension of Interstate 526 and drainage improvements for the Septima P. Clark Parkway.\nDeerin, Stavrinakis and businessman John Tecklenburg are the top money-raisers in the campaign, according to figures supplied Monday to The Post and Courier. Also running are William Dudley Gregorie, Toby Smith and Maurice Washington in the Nov. 3 election.\nReach Diane Knich at (843) 937-5491 or on Twitter @dianeknich.", "external_links": ["http://www.palmettopolitics.com/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palmetto-politics/id897497885?ls=1&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:24:44.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
