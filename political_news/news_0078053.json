Usually, they have been accidentally left on or the battery short-circuits.\nAt Los Angeles International Airport in January, a checked bag that arrived late and missed its connecting flight caught fire in the luggage area due to an overheated e-cigarette packed inside.\nThe rule goes into effect within the next two weeks.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:11:49.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
