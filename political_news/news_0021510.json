First in was Black Rod, in his black coat-tails, tights and buckled shoes, followed by the Garter King of Arms in his quartered heraldic tunic carrying his wand. The only thing missing was a pantomime star at the end of it. \nThen came Britain’s latest peer in her long crimson fur-lined robe. It was noticeable how Lady M was walking very carefully, conscience no doubt that any stumble would create headlines. She was supported by fellow Tory peers Lord Freud, the Work and Pensions Minister, and Baroness Morris of Bolton, the Deputy Lords Speaker. Promoted stories \nThe clerk read out the stilted proclamation on behalf of HMQ to “advance, create and confer our trustee and well-beloved Michelle Georgina Mone, officer of our most excellent Order of the British Empire to the state, degree, style, dignity, title and honour of Baroness Mone of Mayfair in our City of Westminster…for life”. \nOf course, not only had the lingerie tycoon swapped silk and lace for velvet and ermine but she also swapped Glasgow’s West End for the high end of Mayfair, having complained about those nasty cybernats berating her for supporting the Union. \nThe proclamation making her a peer also noted how the 44-year-old businesswoman, who is David Cameron’s business start-up czar, could now “enjoy and use all the rights, privileges, pre-eminencies, immunities and advantages” of being a member of the red-bench club. \nIn front of the gilded throne and with the stone angels looking down, the new member stepped forward and took the oath, promising to be faithful and to bear true allegiance to QEII. It took barely a minute. Share article \nLady M and her supporters then stood before the Lords Speaker and bowed. Before leaving the chamber Peer No 787 shook Baroness D'Souza's hand, which was followed by a clipped grunt of approval from the chamber. \nAs the well-beloved baroness, once dubbed “Scotland’s bra queen”, carefully processed past her new friends on the red leather benches to the exit and lunch, looking on were the likes of fellow Tory peers Norman Tebbit, Michael Forsyth and Nigel Lawson. Not a raised eyebrow in sight. Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:26:35.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
