Obama, as he always does, seeks to use the murders to push his Leftist gun-grabber agenda. Never mind that only law-abiding citizens obey gun laws. Adding another restriction to the 2nd Amendment rights of Americans would do NOTHING to prevent these attacks. Having citizens armed and capable of defending themselves could prevent or at least minimize the number of deaths.\nThis is Barack Obama at his worst. He couldn’t care less about the U.S. Constitution. He lectures Americans as if he is the high and mighty potentate who knows all. He is self-righteous even though he has done everything he can to destroy the moral fabric of this nation. His Foreign Policy is collapsing all around the world, and he is facing total humiliation at the hands of Russia’s Vladimir Putin. So, of course, he distracts from reality by going on one of his sanctimonious rants.\nBottom line: The 2nd Amendment will last long after the history books write the story of the failed Presidency of Barack Hussein Obama.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/6wHrpspY9xI"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:47:22.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
