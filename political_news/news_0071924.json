He said he “is praying for reconciliation, for understanding and for forgiveness” and called for similar prayers from people of faith in Dallas.\n“It’s how I react to challenging times,” Brown said in an impromptu news conference at City Hall.\nOn Friday, The Dallas Morning News reported on a private meeting among three council members — Scott Griggs, Adam Medrano and Erik Wilson — and City Manager A.C. Gonzalez.\nThe subject was Brown’s future as police chief, but exactly what was said is in dispute.\nMayor Mike Rawlings said the council members demanded Brown’s firing or resignation. Griggs and Medrano denied that was the case but acknowledged they talked about Brown’s retirement.\nWilson said he did not support firing the chief. Gonzalez declined to comment on the meeting but said he supported the chief.\nBrown, a Dallas native, has been police chief since 2010.\nDuring a meeting Monday of the council’s Public Safety Committee, Brown defended his department’s performance.\nHe relied on well-worn talking points: that those who question crime stats are gossipers who have no evidence, that he has to hold people accountable, that non-emergency response times are slower because better-trained officers are being more careful, and that the city’s often-trumpeted crime decline “continues to be the greatest crime story never told.”\nBrown also said some officers don’t like that he has to hold them accountable when they mess up.\nThe chief said he has made efforts to improve morale. He said he’s ridden with patrol officers to get a bead on what the department could do better. He also said he’d remain silent no longer on pay increases as salary negotiations with the city begin.\n“These men and women deserve to be paid commensurate with other cities in the area,” Brown said.\nThe briefing was supposed to be an update about crime stats. It was, but Brown did not address how violent crime, especially robbery, remains up this year vs. last year.\nCommittee Vice Chairman Adam McGough told Brown he’d have the council’s support in managing resources to deal with crime.\nCouncil member Philip Kingston, an ally of Griggs and Medrano, commented that Brown had gone off the agenda and questioned his speech.\n“Who are the critics you mentioned?” Kingston asked.\n“I don’t understand the question,” Brown replied.\nKingston again asked who the critics are. Brown replied, “I have no idea.”\n“If you have no idea, I’ll just call that a straw man,” Kingston said.\nGriggs questioned the department’s crime statistics when he was on the committee last year. A previous investigation by The News also found that declines in crime were exaggerated by changes in reporting practices.\nBrown didn’t have to face Medrano, the committee chair, who didn’t show up.\nThe chief said afterward that his address to the committee wasn’t a reaction to last week’s turmoil. He said he did not know exactly what happened, so he couldn’t react to that.\nDallas Police Association President Ron Pinkston said it was nice to hear Brown support pay increases but faulted the chief for waiting five years to join the fight.\nPinkston said Brown made “a lot of excuses” for the police department’s morale and performance. Pinkston stopped short of saying the association could no longer work with the chief but said “we have to have a different management style” at the police department.\nHomicide Sgt. Cletus Judge, president of the Black Police Association of Greater Dallas, also showed up at the council committee meeting. Judge said he supports Brown, saying the chief “is firm but he’s fair.”\nAfter the committee meeting, Juanita Wallace, a supporter of Brown’s, led a small, short rally for the chief. Wallace, who has known Brown for 30 years, said his emphasis on community relations has made him a “game-changer.”\n“We don’t need to run him away,” she said. “And when he decides to go, let him go on his own terms. But we will not allow people to mar his legacy with some foolishness.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:41:50.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
