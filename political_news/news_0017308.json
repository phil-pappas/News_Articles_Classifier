Troopers say the animal kept heading toward the interstate despite their attempts to deter it.\nGraves says that's when a trooper shot the cow once to prevent it from returning to the freeway. Troopers then led it to a desert area near an exit ramp.\nGraves says the cow was later euthanized.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
