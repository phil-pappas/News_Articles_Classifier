You might think it’s their size, their ferocity, the number and sharpness of their teeth. It is all of these things, but it is something else, too.\nDinosaurs are remote from us in time. They belong to an alien realm. They ruled this planet for more than 150 million years, the longest such reign ever achieved by Earth’s megafauna. We know this because their bones froze into stone, and became fossils. But the dinosaurs left only a few of these remains, and they are, after all, mostly skeletal.\nEverything else must be pieced together , or imagined.\nA dinosaur is a muse, then. To contemplate a dinosaur is to slip from the present, to travel in time, deep into the past, to see the Earth as it was tens, if not hundreds, of millions of years ago, when the continents were nearer, when the forests and oceans teemed with strange plants and creatures. In childhood, the mind is alive to the thrill of that perspective shift.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:09:20.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
