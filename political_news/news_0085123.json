By Jonathan M. Katz Rush Limbaugh: Mars remarks were taken out of context \nThe speaker of the House was singing last Friday. A reporter had just prodded John Boehner, a man never shy about showing his emotions, to reveal how he really felt walking away from 24 years in Congress and the highest-ranking Republican post in government, amid the fracturing of his party. He responded with a Disney tune: “ Zip-a-dee-doo-dah ,” he warbled, his gaze threatening to dissolve into tears. “ Zip-a-dee-ay .” \nIt was a properly surreal end to his career. During the former plastics executive’s four years as speaker, the same far-right conservatives whose victories had given him his majority then openly plotted against him for having occasionally been willing to make deals with the Obama administration. When news of his resignation reached a convention hall across the capital where conservatives were vetting an equally fractious slate of GOP presidential candidates, the room erupted with a standing ovation. To many, the party’s dissension is dumbfounding, the leaderboard of presidential candidates absurd. But there is one man who would not have been surprised, had he lived to see it, because he was there when the internal forces now threatening to ravage the modern Republican Party first came together: Roger Milliken. Story Continued Below \nMilliken’s name does not mean much to most anyone born after the Vietnam War, but he was the godfather to the first generation of modern conservatives. The owner of one of America’s largest private companies, a textile manufacturer he turned into a chemical-processing giant, Milliken used the profits from his staunchly antiunion mills to fund conservatism’s founding institutions, including the National Review and Heritage Foundation. Many of the facts we take for granted in politics today—that the GOP is a conservative party; that it counts on the solid support of white, male, working class voters in the South and West; and that big-money donors can pick and choose its candidates, even to the point of running themselves—were the fruits of his career. \nIt was weirdly appropriate that Boehner chose to end his farewell press conference with the tune from A Song of the South. It was Milliken who moved to a solidly Democratic Dixie and transformed it into a bastion of Republicanism. Milliken built the South Carolina GOP into a national force, convincing Sen. Strom Thurmond to switch parties and birthing the “Southern Strategy” that put Richard Nixon and later Ronald Reagan into the White House. It was Milliken who inspired all future conservative candidates by pushing Barry Goldwater to run for president, then bankrolling his landmark campaign. Milliken was also the financial patron of the influential libertarian “Freedom School,” which trained a generation of conservative kingmakers, including Charles Koch. “He was the John the Baptist of the Koch Brothers,” says Marko Maunula, a historian at Clayton State University in Georgia. \nIt was appropriate, too, that when Boehner prepared to quit, he reportedly turned to Rep. Trey Gowdy, the chairman of committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, to encourage the South Carolina congressman to help take his place in the House leadership. Gowdy represents Milliken’s adopted home district of Spartanburg and helping to elect Gowdy in 2010 was one of the final political acts of Milliken’s life. He died just weeks after Gowdy won the House seat, after donating the maximum to Gowdy’s campaign. \nMilliken would have understood intuitively the fight between business conservatives and antigovernment libertarians, and voters’ competing desires for help from the state and their allergy to any policy that gives government largess to anyone they see as undeserving. Milliken would have smiled at the presidential candidacies of conservative Republican senators from Texas, Florida and Kentucky. He’d likely have been disappointed by the early exit of an antiunion Wisconsin governor. But he also would have been first to spot the appeal of a candidate riding a wave of antigovernment brio and white, male, working-class discontent —a fellow protectionist billionaire who, publicly and brashly wins admirers by bragging about his ability to buy off the entire field. \nOne of Milliken's last political acts, in 2010, was to help launch Rep. Trey Gowdy, a central figure in the current House leadership struggles.

Their shaky, often nose-holding alliances on race, foreign policy and the economy, among other issues, turned what had been a disaffected array of diehards into a dominant political power—even as they now threaten to tear the party apart at the seams. If you’ve ever wondered how the GOP can be both the party of Lincoln and defenders of the Confederate flag, a refuge for protectionists and the disaffected working class and protector of the most powerful multinational corporations, a party of Pauls and Bushes, Kochs and Tea Partiers, and, yes, Donald Trump—it helps to take a closer look at a man who helped start it all. *** \nRoger Milliken grew up in a Republican Party that would be unrecognizable today: a loose coalition of wealthy businessmen, northeastern liberals, populist moderates and conservatives from the Midwest and West. It was the party of Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan, held together, barely, by a shared belief in laissez-faire economics and Calvin Coolidge’s maxim that “the chief business of the American people is business.” As late as the 1960s, many still believed the party’s future lay with a liberal wing advocating for civil rights, demilitarization, Social Security and the strengthening of pro-business labor unions. \nThe Millikens were part of the wealthy business faction. The family’s textile fortune went back to Roger’s grandfather, Seth Milliken, whose New England general store struck it big selling wool uniforms to the Union Army during the Civil War. By the time Roger came home from Yale in 1937, the company controlled a string of department stores, the Mercantile Bank and a profitable chunk of Manhattan real estate, along with its core textile mills in New England. \nKnown as “Big Red” for his auburn hair and lanky, six-foot-two frame, Milliken was never drafted into World War II, most likely due to a congenital heart defect. Instead he plunged himself into the family business, climbing its ranks as wartime profits soared. The apprenticeship ended suddenly in 1947, when his father dropped dead in his arms on a Long Island golf course, leaving him in charge of the company. Roger was just 31. \nAt that moment, the company was at a crossroads. Thanks to the wartime boom, it was richer than ever. But Milliken’s workers, like those across American industry at the time, had also grown powerful, and were demanding an ever-larger share of the profits. In 1946 and 1947, unions had launched a wave of massive unrest, a now all-but-forgotten two years in which 4.6 million workers walked off the job to protest postwar wage and production cuts and consolidate the gains they had made through the Depression-era New Deal and during the war. \nInstead of fighting the unions at home, Milliken decided to leave them behind. The one part of the country where unions were still struggling, he knew, was in the South. The Millikens had made their first investments there back in 1884, buying shares in a cloth factory on the Pacolet River, near Spartanburg, South Carolina. During the Depression, Roger’s father, Gerrish, had snapped up full control of mills across the Cotton Belt as owner after owner defaulted on their debts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:28:03.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
