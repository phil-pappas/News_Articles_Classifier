The scholarship provides $1,500 to be used towards tuition and other academic expenses. It is open to anyone who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and is currently enrolled as a full-time undergraduate or graduate student at an accredited American college or university, and who either has cerebral palsy or has an immediate family member with cerebral palsy. To apply, students must submit an essay discussing how cerebral palsy has affected their life, and have a current grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or higher.\nMs. Hann is currently pursuing a degree in Human Services & Family and Child Services from the University of Phoenix , which she expects to complete in 2016. She previously earned a degree in Human Service Management & Human Development from the same university in 2014.\nHann is the mother of a seven-year-old boy named Scott who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy at six months of age. In her essay, she described the joys and tribulations of raising a child with cerebral palsy, and how it was an inspiration to her to pursue her chosen field of study.\nScott was delivered prematurely at 34 weeks through Caesarean section. He swallowed amniotic fluid and meconium as he was being delivered and had to be resuscitated immediately after birth. She reflects on the many special accommodations her family had to make to care for Scott, such as placing him in a daycare with an onsite therapist, and moving to live closer to her mother, who has training and experience in working with children with special needs, and has helped with Scott's care.\nAt age seven, Scott still suffers from severe physical disabilities and neurological issues, although he is making progress. He has never been capable of walking on his own, and must use adaptive equipment such as forearm crutches, braces, a walker, and sometimes a wheelchair and a specially-designed stroller.\nScott is currently attending a grade school with a support staff of special education teachers and therapists. He's especially talented at math, loves reading and playing board games, and helps out with the family business of making Renaissance-style clothing and leather goods.\nHann relates how having a child with cerebral palsy initially caused her to question her Christian faith, but how with the support of her family and church community, it has become even stronger because of her experiences with Scott. Her family's struggle provided the inspiration to help others in similar situations, and to pursue her degree in human services.\nMichigan Cerebral Palsy Attorneys specializes in helping Michigan families who have been affected by cerebral palsy and other birth injuries. They are a subsidiary of Reiter & Walsh, P.C.\nInterview requests and further information on this topic:\nReiter & Walsh, P.C.\nKrissy Pollock\n(888) 419-BABY\n122 Concord Rd\nBloomfield Hills , MI 48304\nhttp://www.michigancerebralpalsyattorneys.com/\n2016 Achievements and Abilities Scholarship Information: http://www.michigancerebralpalsyattorneys.com/scholarship/\n2015 Achievements and Abilities Scholarship Winner Information: bit.ly/ 2015ScholarshipWinner\n releases/michigan-cerebral-palsy-attorneys-announce-2015-recipient-of-achievements-and-abilities-scholarship-300163168.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.michigancerebralpalsyattorneys.com/scholarship/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH33272&Transmission_Id=201510210830PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH33272&DateId=20151021", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278643", "http://www.michigancerebralpalsyattorneys.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/michigan-cerebral-palsy-attorneys-announce-2015-recipient-of-achievements-and-abilities-scholarship-300163168.html", "http://bit.ly/2015ScholarshipWinner"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:40:57.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
