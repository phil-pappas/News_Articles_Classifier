The NPP Wednesday petitioned UK parliamentarians over the matter. \nBut speaking at an event in France Thursday, Mr. Mahama said his government will not interfere in the work of the EC. \n\"I have no right to interfere in that electoral list. \n\"....We have an independent Electoral Commission and the Electoral Commissioners have security of office. I am not supposed to interfere in the work of the electoral commission. Ghana has an EC that is independent and does not consult the president to do anything. \n\"What we have done in the past when you have a young register is to clean it up…so it is for the Electoral Commission to decide what it really needs to do,” the President noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:29:15.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
