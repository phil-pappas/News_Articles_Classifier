Security Council resolutions related to ballistic missiles when it test fired a new missile, the White House said Tuesday . White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that when it comes to Iran's ballistic missile program, \"unfortunately, that's not new.\"\"We have seen Iran almost serially violate the international community's concerns about their ballistic missile program,\" Earnest said.
