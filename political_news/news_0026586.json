Our judges must be able to look at how dangerous someone is when they decide how much bail is set – and should look at these factors when they decide to divert someone away from jail. If someone poses a significant threat to our city’s safety, they must be behind bars – and today’s announcement is a strong step toward keeping our residents, and our hardworking officers, safe from harm.” \nNew York State remains one of three states that do not allow judges to consider dangerousness when setting bail. De Blasio also called for public safety and flight risks to be considered when a judge determines whether an individual is eligible for a diversion program. Neither is currently required for consideration. \nCop murderer Tyrone Howard had an extensive history of drug felonies and misdemeanors. Criminal history has been used as a major component of validated risk in other jurisdictions to accurately predict if a defendant will commit other crimes if released. \nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., whose office had recommended a six-year prison sentence for Howard, said: “For years, prosecutors and judges have advocated changing New York’s bail statute to mirror nearly every other state. At a time when we are looking at ways to make reforms to our bail system, this is a reasonable change that balances public safety with fairness for defendants. I urge our lawmakers to take action on this much needed and important reform.” \nThe mayor’s response to the tragic death of Officer Holder comes one day after former Mayor Rudy Giuliani bashed him for not being up to par with his “criminology.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:05:05.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
