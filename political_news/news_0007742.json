Northern Arizona University and Texas Southern University shooting s come on the same day the imposter was scheduled to visit Roseburg, Oregon, where eight students and a teacher were shot and killed last week at Umpqua Community College. The odd thing of course is that all three colleges were gun free zones. \nSo how did that gun break the law and enter a gun free zone and murder people? Didn ’ t the gun read the sign? Gun free is just an invitation for safe working conditions for mass murders – it’s the promise that there will be no return fire. The sycophants of course are calling for all guns to be confiscated, while the evidence is that if you really want to reduce the killing, if you really care about human lives, more guns equals less crime. Just see John Lott ’ s research, More Guns Less Crime . \nIf they were to confiscate guns, criminals would still posses them and the killing would continue apace. In fact the greatest killers are not these shooters that are featured in the news. The biggest killers are in the White House, the Capital and the Supreme Court. They have murdered more than 60 million babies; their mountain of human carcasses overwhelms the senses in contrast to the small mole hill of the shooters. \nNow we understand that murder is murder, and that thug in Oregon having killed himself now stands before the ultimate bar of justice, but what utter hypocrisy for the murderer in the White House to rail against the numerically much smaller crime committed in Oregon. That imposter is himself a mass murderer, with the blood of tens of millions on his hands, and unless he repents he will eternally pay for each and every murder he is accountable for. \nAll this came home vividly for me last Sunday afternoon. We had concluded the Prolife Shut It Down rally at the football stadium in Sioux Falls, and we drove the short distance to a nondescript building with a sign out front with the intertwined logo PP, and in much smaller letters Planned Parenthood. If you were driving by you probably wouldn ’ t even notice it. We stood in protest of the murders which take place there week in week out, year in year out as one of the 553 killing fields of America. \nIn Sioux Falls we received a majority of positive responses from those driving by on that main thoroughfare, but intermixed were the occasional driver indicting their IQ by thrusting forward a single digit and an occasionally indecipherable expletive shouted from a car window. South Dakota is one of four States which has only one killing field left. As I shared with the rally, I pray that what began last Sunday will result in South Dakota becoming the first State to rid itself of these killing fields. To that end I shared with those gathered at the rally, the Biblical doctrine of the lesser magistrate. That whenever a superior magistrate violates the law of God the lesser magistrate is called by God to interpose, in order to restore the godly order in society. \nWe applied this to the Sheriff there in whose jurisdiction Planned Parenthood operates their murder mill. The Sheriff has the power, he has the authority and he has the duty to shut it down. Roe v. Wade as you all know is not the law of the land; it is a violation of God ’ s Law, a violation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and must not be obeyed. On Monday, leaders of the Shut It Down movement met with the Sheriff, and I pray he will take to heart the doctrine of the lesser magistrate and take the actions to shut down Planned Parenthood, effectively ending abortion in South Dakota. \nBut what if the Sheriff doesn’t do his duty. Why might he not shut it down? In one word, “fear” - fear of what others will say about him, fear of some legal repercussions, such as a lawsuit against him, perhaps even fear of losing his pensions when he is two years from retirement. Webster ’ s 1828 defines fear as “ a painful emotion or passion excited by an expectation of evil, or the apprehension of impending danger. ” \nWe, like the Sheriff, are given daily counsel from our fears, but what should be that overriding understanding? Turn to Exodus 20. We are beginning a new sermon series entitled “ True Law is God ’ s Law ” as we examine the fourth section of the book of Exodus. As we move into this new series, our heart, our attitude, and our thinking about God is vitally important.
