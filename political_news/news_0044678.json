Jeff Davis told reporters on Monday.\nThe U.S. service members had not contacted Doctors Without Borders about the visit to the hospital and believed there were no personnel in the structure, so they drove into the gate with the vehicle to force it open, Davis said.\nThere were, however, Doctors Without Borders personnel inside the hospital who were \"understandably not happy\" with the U.S. destruction of more of their property, Davis said.\n  Obama pressuring GOP on climate change White House summit with business and green groups focuses on ways to strengthen a climate change deal.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/19/15 12:50 PM \"They did it, they shouldn't have, they should have coordinated ahead of time and they're going to make it right,\" he said.\nThe U.S. is working with the medical aid group to repair damage to the gate, Davis said.\nMedia reports last week suggested a U.S. tank forced the gate open, but Davis said there are no U.S. tanks remaining in the country.\nAn American AC-130 gunship destroyed the Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz this month, killing 22 medical staff and patients, including three children. The strikes were called in to protect Afghan troops under enemy fire during a recent wave of violence as the Taliban tried to seize parts of the city, the Pentagon said.\nDoctors Without Borders said they provided the GPS coordinates of the hospital to American and Afghan officials and have called the U.S. strikes on the hospital a war crime.

George H.W. Bush famously called the supply-side theory behind Ronald Reagan's tax policy \"voodoo economics.\" Perhaps Bush still believed that when he broke his no-tax-pledge as president in 1990.\nThose days are long gone. Donald Trump appeared to be deviating from supply-side orthodoxy when he said that the rich weren't paying enough in taxes, but the tax plan he released differed little from Jeb Bush's (even on carried interest).
