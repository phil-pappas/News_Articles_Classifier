Today, these students no longer have to worry about whether their classrooms are safe thanks to the United States, which provided the funds for a newly constructed school in Nuzah. “Education is a cornerstone of the essential services that UNRWA provides to 120,000 Palestinians refugees students in Jordan, and more than 500,000 in this region. The United States government is proud to be a part of this effort,” said the Ambassador of the United States of America to Jordan, Alice Wells, at the opening of the newly constructed school on 21 September 2015.\nThe new school replaces three unsafe buildings that were constructed some 50 years ago. Signs of dilapidation were clearly visible in the old buildings and a number of facilities could not be used due to severe deterioration. In addition to rebuilding the physical structures of the school to make it a safe and positive learning environment for refugee students, among other improvements the playground has been updated, the science labs outfitted with new equipment, and the library expanded.\nSpeaking at the opening, tenth grader Ibrahim Alzaben said the new building is “simply beautiful.” “The new labs look encouraging to engage in both science and computer lessons. Studying will be enjoyable,” he said.\nIbrahim’s classmate, Ehab Rabah, was also excited about the new school. “I’m a member of the school order committee,” he said, referring to the committee established by teachers to maintain discipline in the school. “I intend to encourage students to keep the new school clean and beautiful. It is one of the most fully equipped schools I have ever seen during my 10 years studying at UNRWA.”\nThe two school principals, Ismail Ghassan and Sami Siyam, were visibly excited at the opening ceremony. Sami commented: “The new building is fully equipped. It ensures an attractive environment for the children. The spacious school yard and the multi-purpose rooms will finally enable the teachers and the students to engage in extra-curricular activities in addition to physical education – both are very essential in shaping students’ character.”\nIsmail was most proud that the building was designed to provide accessibility to children with disabilities. “The building ensures easy access and movement of disabled persons. The elevator ensures that children who are unable to use the stairs can still attend classes being held on the second floor,” he explained.\nRoger Davies, the Director of UNRWA Operations in Jordan, inaugurated the school with Ambassador Wells. “The new school currently serves 2,019 students, with the capacity to accommodate up to 2,500,” he said. “In addition to providing a vastly improved educational environment that gives students renewed pride in their education, the expected savings resulting from the construction of this new school is approximately US$ 100,000 per year in running costs and maintenance expenses. We truly appreciate the continued partnership with the United States and the students, teachers, and all of us at UNRWA thank the Government of the United States for this exceptional addition to our education system.”", "external_links": ["https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/161/101_1500x1000_620479265_555x370.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:24:56.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
