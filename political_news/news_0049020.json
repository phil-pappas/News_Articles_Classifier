Share article \n\"The men got access to the gym but as there was no one in, left soon after in what is believed to be a blue Ford Focus or similar. \n\"The car, which had a spoiler on the rear, is believed to have driven off after the incident and made its way up Low Waters Road towards Carrigans restaurant and bar in Hamilton.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:13:47.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
