Ms. Normington and Mr. Petts have already been brought on board, but are not expected to begin working for a few months, according to one person familiar with their status. But their arrival will mark the first female pollster on Mrs. Clinton’s team. The expansion comes as the campaign looks toward a potentially competitive primary race and a general election. It is not uncommon to round out polling teams with specific constituencies, according to people involved in the field. In Mr. Benenson’s last national campaigns, when he was working for President Obama , there were different pollsters overseeing specific states. Among their clients? Gov. Jack Markell, of Delaware, the home state of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They have also done polling in Missouri, Connecticut and Rhode Island last year, and in congressional races in highly contested districts. Mon.
