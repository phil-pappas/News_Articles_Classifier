That total would increase to 100,000 by 2017. The U.S. now accepts up to 70,000 refugees per year.\nMichigan's Gov. Rick Snyder, also a Republican, is talking with federal officials about what the state can do about accepting more refugees from Syria and building on more than a century of Arab immigration to the state.\nCruz was campaigning ahead of Michigan's March 8 presidential primary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:38:28.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
