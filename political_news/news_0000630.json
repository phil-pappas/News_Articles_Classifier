Mr Lee said this shows people have \"given us a clear mandate to take Singapore forward beyond SG50\". He added: \"Now, we must fulfil what we have promised to do in our manifesto.\"\nThe focus of the eight-page letter, as in years past, was on the need for PAP MPs to uphold the party's reputation for clean and incorruptible government.\nIn doing so, they should separate their public political status from their private business or professional interests, Mr Lee said.\nThis means they need, among other things, to be careful of invitations and gifts they accept, and not lobby public officers on behalf of their friends or clients. Also, they should not solicit directorships in companies or accept them where their role is \"just to dress up the board with a PAP MP or two\".\nHe warned MPs not to sit on boards of companies owned or chaired by grassroots leaders whom they had appointed, to avoid perceptions of conflicts of interest.\nThe MPs were told to disclose to him, in confidence, their business interests and income by Oct 31 \"for (their) own protection\".\nThey are expected to attend all Parliament sittings unless they have a valid reason, for which they must seek the Government Whip's permission.\nPeople expect PAP MPs to give their views frankly, he said. \"Over time, the public will see that PAP backbenchers are as effective as opposition MPs, if not better, at holding ministers to account, getting issues fully debated, and influencing policies for the better.\"\nIn conclusion, Mr Lee said the PAP has won successive elections because \"our integrity has never been in doubt, and because we are sensitive to the views and attitudes of the people we represent\".\nHe added: \"Any slackening of standards, or show of arrogance or indifference by any MP will erode confidence in him and, ultimately, in the party and Government.\"\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on September 30, 2015, with the headline 'PM reminds PAP MPs to remain honest and incorruptible'.
