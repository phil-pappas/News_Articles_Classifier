Still, it seems Republican Peter Rouff is looking to put up a solid opposition in the Delaware District against Democrat Joel Feroleto. Rouff recently learned he’s been officially certified to run on the Republican, Conservative and Reform party lines on the November ballot.\nThe Buffalo orthodontist already loaned his campaign $30,000; using a chunk of it to do polling and some primary election campaigning to get on the general election ballot. He’s got about $14,000 left; and has an Oct. 8 fundraiser planned to kick-in his general election race. Feroleto, meanwhile, has about $15,000 in his campaign fund.\nStay tuned: Since being assigned to cover City Hall for much of the past year, I’ve tried a few times to watch the Government Access channel. Figured I could learn something. But aside from late night SVU and Modern Family episodes, I guess I’m just not a big TV watcher. I can’t stay focused on those Channel 22 shows for very long. Still, I know some people are addicted to them. So I feel obligated to report that the Common Council adopted a resolution declaring its meetings will be televised live on Tuesdays, and rebroadcast 8 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays, and also be shown Wednesdays and Saturdays. The council also approved a schedule when “District updates” will be televised on Tuesdays and Thursdays for each of the nine district council members. They’ll air between 3 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., each lasting half an hour.\n12th man: The last time City Hall held a lunchtime tailgate, Tom Brady and his Patriots pummeled the Bills. Perhaps today’s Rally in the Square will lead to a better outcome when Buffalo takes on the Giants Sunday. The lunchtime pep rally will be from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Niagara Square, with the Police Athletic League selling hot dogs, drinks and snacks.\nFor more daily news and notes out of City Hall, check out the City Hallways blog at BuffaloNews.com/CityHallways.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:16:56.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
