Police place him in handcuffs and, even right after the confusion passed, the boy was suspended from college.\nThat earned Mohamed a planned trip to the White Home, a message of assistance from Hillary Clinton, an provide to stop by Facebook to meet Mark Zuckerberg and an invitation to be an intern at Twitter.\nThe police overreacted. However the device did appear like one thing Ethan Hunt would lob out of a helicopter at the final minute in “Mission: Impossible.” As National Review’s Charles Cooke pointed out on Twitter, the scary-searching tangle of wires “looks a lot much more like a bomb than a pop tart appears like a gun.”\nJosh Welch, a white Maryland kid with ADHD who was 7 years old when he was kicked out of school for chewing a Pop-Tart into the shape of a pistol and pretending to shoot other students with it, have to be puzzled.\nWhere’s his White Property invitation? Where’s his possibility to start off networking at Facebook? His parents have been forced to hire a lawyer and spent a year and a half just trying to get the suspension erased from the kid’s record. They had been repeatedly refused.\n“I stand with Ahmed, also. But I also stand with Alex Stone,” noted Reason writer Robby Soave. Alex Stone, a 16-year-old white kid from Summerville, SC, wrote a short story in which he imagined using a gun to kill a dinosaur. For this his locker was searched and he was arrested, handcuffed, charged with “disorderly conduct” and suspended from college for three days.\nOf course the White Property and Mark Zuckerberg couldn’t be bothered to comment, but you’d think that, at the pretty least, Stephen King would have sent out a tweet expressing outrage that imagination was being punished.\nNada.\nIn Dyer County, Tenn., Kendra Turner says she was suspended for saying, “Bless you” immediately after a student sneezed, and that her teacher told her that she would have no “godly speaking in class.”\nA school administrator stated, “This was not a religious problem at all, but a lot more of an situation the teacher felt was a distraction in her class.” Uh-huh. School leadership offered no explanation for the pictures posted by students that showed “bless you” on a list of expressions banned in the classroom. Turner is nonetheless waiting for her get in touch with from President Obama.\nAre white children being punished en masse for dopey quasi-infractions simply because of their race? Of course not. That’s ridiculous.\nBut it’s equally absurd to suggest that you have to be Muslim, or brown-skinned, or live in Texas, to be subjected to overenthusiastic use of college discipline and police force.\n“It never ever would have happened to a white kid”? It takes place to white little ones all. The. Time.\nThe principal difference between the Ahmed Mohamed case and the other folks is that the mainstream media and the leftist point of view it presents just can’t let go of Ahmed. Ahmed is also beneficial to their narrative to be a one particular-day story.\nThat Bristol Palin said on Facebook that President Obama didn’t want to get involved in the predicament proved irresistible for the media, which loves to depict America as a bitter standoff involving red-state hicks on the one hand and sophisticated members of the cool bicoastal techno-media club on the other.\nLet’s just savor for a moment that the musings of the daughter of an unemployed former governor constitute national news. This year the brother of a sitting president created derogatory comments about the leader of the cost-free globe and the reaction from the media was crickets.\nMalik Obama gets the courtesy of becoming ignored simply because he has also stated some crazy factors. Now envision Bristol Palin producing loony statements. Would the media decline to cover them?\nFor 14 years and two weeks now, the left has been desperate to discover some proof, any evidence, that Muslims in common are facing deep-seated discrimination since a handful of Muslims attacked us on 9/11.\nThat American Muslims have rather largely been treated with respect and courtesy ought to be a point of pride, but at no point will the left ever say, “Isn’t it wonderful that we’re such a pluralistic and tolerant country?”\nThe left-led push to turn a man who was, as of 2004, an obscure state senator with no unique accomplishments, into the president 4 years later, was centrally and crucially about race. Absolutely everyone else was being subjected to a bait-and-switch.\nRather of getting credited with enlightenment for becoming the only white-majority country ever to elect a black leader, now we’re told that all the things is about racism.\n ", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/09/19/how-ahmeds-clock-became-a-false-convenient-tale-of-racism/"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:47:16.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
