That somehow, that will build confidence in this country, somehow that will give more opportunity to the future generation.\"\n\"Count me out of that,\" he said. \"Put me in the column that I want to start talking about the ways we find solutions.\"\nMcCarthy's comments are a dramatic shift from the wide expectation that Congress will at some point next week pass a \"clean\" debt ceiling hike, one that doesn't include any GOP demands for spending cuts.\nThere's not much time for a grand bargain. The Treasury Department has said that by Nov. 3, it will either need an increase in the amount of money it can borrow, or find ways to trim federal programs to match expected tax revenues.\nRepublicans are also hurt by the fact that they have only just agreed that Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., will be their next speaker, a leadership shift that has distracted the GOP for the last several weeks.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obamacare website to feature new tools Open enrollment starts Nov. 1, and healthcare.gov will be used by residents in 38 states to get Obamacare.\nBy Robert King • 10/23/15 1:20 PM Still, McCarthy said Republicans are looking for cuts at this point, something that could require intense negotiations next week.\n\"I am hopeful that we stop kicking the can down the road,\" he said of bipartisan talks that have started in an effort to reach a debt ceiling deal. \"I'm hopeful in these bipartisan discussions that we start the downpayment where we don't have to worry about raising the debt limit, that we're actually paying off the debt and not leaving this to our children and grandchildren.\"\nMcCarthy indicated his preferred answer would match the one Republicans proposed earlier this year: one that would allow a debt ceiling hike, but would also see falling budget deficits over time, which would reduce the need for more borrowing later on.\n\"It's hard for me to believe that the entire other side of this aisle wouldn't want to do something about the debt,\" McCarthy said. \"Why don't we come together, find a way to raise it, but find a way that we don't continue to add to it?\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Ryan not the key to immigration reform, Chamber's Donohue says A big shift in attitudes is needed before a measure can be passed, the business lobby's president says.\nBy Sean Higgins • 10/23/15 1:08 PM Top Story House Republicans vote to repeal key pieces of Obama's health law House GOP   Obamacare.\n  11:59 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:41:54.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
