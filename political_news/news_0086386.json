He was sentenced to death for the 1996 killing of Cathy Bounds, who was shot five times in the back of her head. \nFults has been trying for 10 years to get a court to consider evidence that racial bias deprived him of a fair trial. \nFults' lawyers obtained a signed statement from juror Thomas Buffington in which Buffington twice used the racial slur when referring to Fults. Buffington died last year. \nThe case is Fults v. Chatman, 14-9740.
