At the same time, national attention has focused on how police and criminal justice officials treat minorities after several high-profile deaths of black men at the hands of police, including high-profile cases in Missouri and Maryland.\nThe legislation announced Thursday would give judges the discretion to give sentences below the mandatory minimum for nonviolent drug offenders. Some current inmates could get their sentences reduced by as much as 25 percent by taking part in rehabilitation programs, if they are deemed a low risk to offend again. The bill also would create new programs to help prisoners successfully re-enter society.\nAmong the senators' goals: Make the sentencing system more fair, reduce recidivism and contain rising prison costs.\nSince 1980, the federal prison population has exploded, in part because of mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. Then it was less than 25,000. Today it is more than 200,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:28:06.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
