As part of our mission to make sure all the dogs in our country are treated humanely, we continually seek to meet and improve standards of care in our stores and across the entire industry. As part of our efforts, we've worked with the USDA, the AKC, animal welfare groups, and the veterinarian and academic community to improve animal welfare.\nAdding to efforts to encourage better breeding standards, effective October 1, 2015 , Petland company stores will only source puppies from shelters and rescues, hobby breeders and USDA-licensed breeders who have no direct violations within the previous two years.\nThese increased standards add to the requirements our breeders already meet or exceed, bolstering specifically the requirement concerning violations on USDA inspection reports. By limiting the breeders we buy from to only those who have no recent history direct violations, we restrict further the already selective pool of responsible breeders.\n\"This decision to increase the requirements for professional breeders selling to Petland is yet another example of our commitment and responsibility related to animal care,\" said Joe Watson , president and CEO of Petland.\n\"Annually Petland and our franchisees conduct numerous on-site breeder visits, attend various state breeder conferences and sponsor a breeder education forum in conjunction with the USDA along with the American Kennel Club,\" said Brian Winslow , Director of Animal Welfare Education. \"Petland speaks at many breeder conferences to the need for improved standards through increased space, exercise and socialization.\"\nTo supply a Petland store, a breeder must:\nAbide and be in compliance with all federal and state laws and regulations related to dog safety, housing and nutrition, Appropriate socialization and exercise specific for the breed. Consult with a veterinarian to provide good medical care for the dogs and create a comprehensive care plan. Maintain written records of medical care and observations. Provide appropriate vaccinations, dewormings, and preventative protocols. Provide a state-issued health certificate from the state of origin and signed and attested to by a licensed veterinarian.
