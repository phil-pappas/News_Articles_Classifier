WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats are calling on the public to get angry about gun control.\nMore than 30 Democratic senators gathered on the Capitol steps Thursday to demand action to combat gun violence, calling for a public outcry to move a stubborn Republican-controlled Congress.\n“The victims and their families deserve better than a Congress that shrugs its shoulders and waits for the next tragedy,” said Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden after lamenting the massacre that took place in his state last week. “End the complacency. It's time to take action against gun violence.”\nThe dozens gathered called for closing background check loopholes, improving the background check database and making straw purchasing and gun trafficking federal crimes.\nBut they’re not introducing legislation — and are the first to admit they have no way to accomplish anything meaningful in Washington unless Republicans feel the heat from their constituents.\n“They won't become law without an outcry from the American people, so today is a call to action,” said Wyden. “There must be a groundswell of urgency from Americans pushing their elected officials to act.”\nDemocrat after Democrat echoed the argument that nothing will get done until and unless Republicans feel real pressure from their constituents.\n“We are asking the American people to now raise their voices,” said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, who promised to force a Senate vote on legislation encompassing these principles once a “groundswell” hits Congress.\nBut asked when that legislation is likely to come, Schumer demurred, a sign of how tough it will be for Democrats to actually get legislation on the Senate floor, much less get anything passed through the Republican-controlled Congress.\n“We'll see when the groundswell hits,” he said.\nRelated Stories RFK called for gun control in Ore. 47 years before shooting Hillary Clinton to announce gun control proposals Rudy Giuliani holds stance on gun control Tags: gun control , congress", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:08:25.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
