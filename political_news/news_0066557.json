A former minister of health under Tony Blair, the peer had suggested a £10-a-month fee for the NHS last year, in addition to hotel-style charges whenever an overnight stay in hospital is required.\nIn his resignation letter, Lord Warner said he \"fears for Labour's future\" if activists loyal to new leader Jeremy Corbyn gain greater control.\nHis message to Mr Corbyn added: \"Labour will only win another election with a policy approach that wins back people who have moved to voting Conservative and UKIP, as well as to Greens and SNP.\n\"Your approach is unlikely to achieve this shift.\n\"I have watched for some time the declining quality of the Labour party's leadership, but had not expected the calamitous decline achieved in 2015.\n\"The Labour Party is no longer a credible party of government in waiting. The approach of those around you and your own approach and policies is highly likely to worsen the decline in the Labour Party's credibility.\"\nSpeaking to Sky News he questioned Mr Corbyn's legitimacy as leader saying he did not enjoy the support of the majority of Labour MPs after a \"bizarre (selection) process\"\nHe said the shadow chancellor's u-turn on support for George Osborne's economic policy had been a \"shambles\" and added: \"This is palpably not a government in waiting\".\nLord Warner's departure follows Lord Adonis's decision to resign the Labour whip - however, this was in order to assume a role which required political impartiality.\nUpon hearing of the resignation, Lord Prescott - Labour's former deputy prime minister from 1997 to 2007 - tweeted: \"Lord Warner. A minister you've never heard of who wanted to charge people £10 a month to use the NHS.\n\"No credibility. No great loss.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:52:59.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
