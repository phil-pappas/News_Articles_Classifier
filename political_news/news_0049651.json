(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) October 11 at 6:54 PM The Oct. 8 Local Living article “ A new school of thoughtfulness ” reported on schools in the area teaching mindfulness to help students cope with stress.\nPeople are jumping on the mindfulness bandwagon too quickly, ignoring that mindfulness was designed for the meditator to see herself as independent from her thoughts — to see that the thoughts are not who she is and, eventually, that the self is not real. It is about divorcing from this reality in order to realize the “true” reality of Buddha nature. The article mentioned an exercise in which children are told to see their thoughts as “fleeting.” This exercise demeans thoughts and thinking. I practiced mindfulness for 12 years but no longer do. It alters the world view, as it was designed to do. Mindfulness is a form of mind conditioning.\nSchools and others teaching mindfulness are ignoring increasing reports of damaging consequences for some who meditate, including recent reports that show that mindfulness creates false memories, as reported by the Association for Psychological Science .\nNo long-term scientific studies have been done on children, and anecdotal information is not evidence for the usefulness of mindfulness. At the very least, parents should be concerned that their children are perhaps being used as fodder for mind-conditioning experiments, especially in light of the fact that so many schools are cutting creative programs and healthful outdoor recess.\nMarcia Montenegro , Annandale", "external_links": ["http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-dark-knight-of-the-souls/372766/", "http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/mindfulness-may-make-memories-less-accurate.html"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:09:10.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
