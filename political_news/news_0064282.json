(MLive File Photo) Comments \nKALAMAZOO, MI — Controversial Michigan Republican National Committeeman Dave Agema is close to endorsing Ted Cruz for president and is considering a Congressional run. \nAgema, who attended a Monday morning Cruz rally at the Wings Event Center in Kalamazoo, said he is impressed by Cruz's knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, because \"we have a president right now that is, in my opinion, ruining the constitution by his executive orders.\" \nA tea party favorite and social conservative, Agema said his initial list of top candidates in the crowded GOP presidential field included Cruz, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum and Bobby Jindal. \nSantorum and Jindal \"are probably going to phase out just because they don't have the money,\" said Agema, indicating that Cruz is emerging as a favorite among his other three top options. \nWhile he remains popular in some conservative grassroots circles, Agema has faced multiple calls to resign over his controversial statements and social media posts about gays, Muslims and African Americans. The RNC executive committee censured him in January , citing his \"harmful and offensive rhetoric.\" \nAn Agema endorsement could be a double-edged sword, but it does carry some real weight. As an RNC member, he's a \"superdelegate\" who can back a presidential candidate of his choosing at the Republican nominating convention and will not be bound by the results of Michigan's March 8 primary. \nAsked if he was planning to run for re-election to the RNC next year, Agema said, \"As of now, yes,\" but went on to note that he is also considering a run for the U.S. House out of Michigan's 1st Congressional District. \nAgema said he's \"been getting all kinds of calls\" from grassroots activists in the 1st District who want him to run for the soon-to-be open seat . \"So I said, I tell you what, if there is the money and there is the grassroots support, I would consider doing it.\" \nAgema is from Grandville in West Michigan and does not currently live anywhere near the 1st District, which includes Traverse City and all of the Upper Peninsula, where Republican Rep. Dan Benishek has decided against running for re-election . \nFederal candidates are not required to live in the district they are seeking to represent, but Agema acknowledged he may be called a \"carpetbagger\" if he gets in the 1st District Congressional race. \n\"The only way you combat that, I suppose, is to get a place up there,\" he said. \"...But again, I didn't ask for this. They asked me.\" \nAgema estimates it will cost between $500,000 and $1 million to run a legitimate primary campaign, and he said his timeline for finalizing a decision depends on when and if he is able to secure a pledge for that kind of financial backing. \nThe 1st District Republican primary could be crowded and competitive. State Sen. Tom Casperson, Rep. Pete Pettalia and former Sen. Jason Allen — all of whom have represented the region in Lansing — top a long list of potential candidates. State Sen. Wayne Schmidt could run as well, although he is close personal friends with Allen. \nOn the Democratic side, former state party chairman Lon Johnson and retired army general Jerry Cannon are also running for the seat. Johnson, who grew up south of Detroit, is already facing some \"carpetbagger\" criticism, although he and his wife own a home in the district. \nAgema said he will not run for Congress simply for \"the glory of it\" but is concerned about the direction of the country. \n\"If we get another president like we have now, we're going to lose this country,\" he said. \"He's ruined us fiscally, morally, constitutionally and militarily.\" \nEven if he sticks with the RNC race, Agema will face a challenge. Cardiologist Rob Steele, who previously ran for Congress and was a Republican nominee for the University of Michigan Board of Regents last year, is already running. \n\"We need principled conservatives who can give a message that is a little more honey and less (vinegar),\" Steele said two weeks ago at the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference. \"No votes left behind. This isn't Nebraska or Kansas.\" \nJonathan Oosting is a Capitol reporter for MLive Media Group.
