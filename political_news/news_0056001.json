It certified that state revenue will cover all of the Legislature’s spending bills.\nHegar, a former GOP lawmaker who is in his first year as the state’s chief tax collector and revenue estimator, said he wanted to issue the report early.\nLower oil prices “definitely” have persisted long enough to require him to lower his biennial revenue estimate, issued in January, “so let’s go ahead and update,” he said.\nIn January, Hegar forecast that the price of oil would recover from a plunge late last year, hovering between $65 and $70 a barrel throughout the current budget cycle. He has had to walk that back. In his new report, Hegar said he expects the world price of oil to average just under $50 this year and go up to nearly $57 in fiscal 2017.\nThe earlier estimate overshot what severance taxes would yield by $3.1 billion for the cycle.\nIn a reflection of how the “fracking” boom stimulated sales tax revenue, he also has had to contract his two-year forecast of sales tax collections by $1.6 billion.\nHegar said he expects unemployment in Texas to remain well below the national level — 4.3 percent this year, and 4.4 percent in fiscal 2017.\nWhen lawmakers passed the budget and tax cuts for business and homeowners in May, they appeared to leave $17.5 billion unspent — $11.1 billion of it in the rainy day fund.\nThe fund, though, mostly relies on ever-increasing revenue from energy production. Under Hegar’s more sober forecast, lawmakers left $14.6 billion on the sidelines — $10.4 billion of it in rainy day dollars.\nHouse Speaker Joe Straus said that gyrations in revenue and the economy are why lawmakers “wrote a conservative budget.”\nThey’ll “continue to exercise prudence” as the 2017 session approaches, the San Antonio Republican said in a written statement.\nLiberal budget analyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the Center for Public Policy Priorities said Hegar, by envisioning flat or even declining revenue, brought bad news for education and social services.\nNext month, voters are likely to approve a constitutional amendment that would shift $5 billion of sales tax money to roads in the 2018-19 cycle, DeLuna Castro noted.\n“The big worry is how schools and health care will fare” in the next legislative session, she said.\nOn Twitter:\n @RobertTGarrett", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RobertTGarrett"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:25:21.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
