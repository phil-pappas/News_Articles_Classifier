Attachment 340 Here's lesson in how to read documents, that document is marked \"declassified\", maybe it was secret in 2002, but it was declassified in 2012. And I'll save you the trouble of googling it, Hillary Clinton was not the Secretary of State in 2002, but she was secretary of state in 2012. What the document shows is that Tony Blair and George W. Bush were lying dirt bags. It also shows that the State Department sent the Secretary of State, a declassified document, not a lot of smoke coming from that gun....", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:16:39.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
