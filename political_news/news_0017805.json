Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abandoned his bid for speaker Thursday afternoon just minutes before the election, throwing the House of Representatives into chaos and leaving the rowdy Republican Conference with no obvious candidate to take the reins from departing Speaker John Boehner. McCarthy's bombshell withdrawal prompted Boehner (R-Ohio) to announce to House Republicans that the election for speaker will be postponed. Pandemonium broke out in the Longworth Office Building, where Republicans had been expected to nominate McCarthy, as lawmakers and aides reacted to the news with astonishment.\n\"If we're going to be strong, we need to be united,\" McCarthy said at a news conference after his announcement, a reference to opposition from conservatives to elevating the centrist Californian to the top leadership post. He said the GOP needs a \"new face\" and added that he did not want to win the job by squeaking by with \"220 votes\"; he would have needed 218 votes on the House floor.\nThe House Republican Conference is now in crisis. McCarthy, the current majority leader, is one of the only lawmakers in the chamber seen as capable of winning a floor vote to become speaker who actually wanted the job. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who could likely be elected speaker if he were interested, repeated after McCarthy's announcement that he won't run: \"While I am grateful for the encouragement I’ve received, I will not be a candidate.”\nMcCarthy does plan to remain majority leader, according to a source close to him, which would mean there will be no election for majority leader or majority whip. Reps. Steve Scalise (La.) and Tom Price (Ga.) have been vying for the party's No. 2 slot. Reps. Patrick McHenry (N.C.), Dennis Ross (Fla.) and Markwayne Mullin (Okla.) would likely be forced to suspend their campaigns for the whip position, which Scalise now occupies.\nThe move by McCarthy blindsided his colleagues and creates a gaping power vacuum in the House Republican Conference.\nAfter the announcement, the House Freedom Caucus — a bloc of roughly 40 conservatives — immediately met in the Cannon House Office Building. The Texas delegation, which has the most Republicans of any state, also convened early Thursday afternoon.\nThere is already talk of finding someone to fill the speakership on a temporary basis. Others are talking about trying to persuade Boehner to stay until 2016. Boehner is set to leave the House at the end of the month, but said Thursday he would remain until the House votes to elect a new speaker.\nMeanwhile, House Republicans immediately began floating a number of names as potential caretakers. One is retiring Minnesota Rep. John Kline, a close ally of Boehner who is chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee. Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry and Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole are also being discussed.\n\"I think you can start talking now about a caretaker,\" said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.), a leader of the Freedom Caucus. \"You can start talking about someone in the center who might be acceptable to both sides. Or you might start talking about somebody who is a true institutionalist like Webster.\"\nHe was referring to Rep. Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican who received the Freedom Caucus' endorsement Wednesday.\nDuring his news conference, McCarthy also acknowledged that his remarks last week that the GOP-created Benghazi Committee damaged Hillary Clinton's poll numbers were not helpful to his cause. Clinton seized on the comments, and a number of Republicans called on him to apologize.\n\"I could have said it much better,\" McCarthy said.\nFollow @politico <div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/politico"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:08:00.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
