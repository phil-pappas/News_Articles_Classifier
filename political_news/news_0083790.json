This is in line with the recommendation by the cross-party International Development Committee that Dfid 'give higher priority to making its work known across Scotland'.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-04T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:47:54.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
