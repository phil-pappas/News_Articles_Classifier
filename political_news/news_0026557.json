The group said there were reports of widespread use of sexual violence, including more than 50 rape cases.\nSouth Sudan army spokesman Philip Aguer said Saturday that he had no reports of fighting in Leer County.\nThe U.N. and human rights groups have documented widespread abuses against civilians including rapes and killings by government soldiers and their militia, in Unity state this year. Fighting persists despite a peace deal signed in August.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
