The scenic meadow is in full view of the nearby Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in Pocantico Hills and passing drivers on Route 448. \nThe parcel that the private landowner would get in exchange is characterized by fairly young woodlands that would remain largely intact, after some clearing to make way for a new house, the state said. A proposed septic system on the site has already been approved, and there is another private home and private land next door. \nThe 6.856-acre parcel that would be transferred to the state would remain as an open meadow, under the plan. \nThe draft impact statement is available at: nysparks.com/inside-our-agency/master-plans.aspx . Copies are also available for review at the Warner Library serving Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow, 121 N. Broadway, Tarrytown; Briarcliff Manor Public Library, 1 Library Road, Briarcliff Manor; and Mount Pleasant Public Library, 350 Bedford Road, Pleasantville. \nThe public is invited to provide comments at the hearing or in writing through Oct. 22.
