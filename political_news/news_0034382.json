By the time Arunachal Pradesh became a state in 1987, the movement had assumed robust proportions.\nThough the refugees had initially moved to the Lushai Hills of present-day Mizoram, most of them were shifted to Arunachal Pradesh -- then known as Northeast Frontier Agency (NEFA) - which was then under the Assam governor.\nAccording to a white paper published in 1996, the number of Chakma and Hajong refugees in Arunachal Pradesh has grown to over 60,000 from nearly 15,000 originally.\nHowever, AAPSU claims the number has now crossed 100,000.\nThough AAPSU is not against the granting of citizenship to the refugees, it wants that they should be issued the inner line permit (ILP) like in the case of any other Indian citizen visiting Arunachal Pradesh.\nApart from Arunachal Pradesh, the ILP, designed to safeguard the rights of the indigenous people, is in force in two other northeastern states -- Mizoram and Nagaland.\nThe AAPSU claims it has not been made party to the process despite it carrying out the movement against the refugess.\nAccording to Biru Nasi, AAPSU general secretary, after being approached by representatives of the Chakmas and Hajongs, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) told the Supreme Court that the AAPSU has been harassing the refugees.\n\"We filed an impleadment in the Supreme Court on Thursday seeking that we (AAPSU) be made a party to the process,\" Nasi told IANS at the rally site here.\n\"Based on what the Supreme Court says, we will plan our next course of action,\" he said.\nNasi also said the AAPSU would petition Prime Minister Narendra Modi and union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in this regard.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:22:21.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
