Molly Riley/AP Many House Republicans have been pushing Ryan to run for Speaker of the House. Previous Next Enlarge \nWASHINGTON — Paul Ryan just got a big endorsement he might want to give back. \nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) offered some unhelpful praise for Ryan, saying he hopes House Republicans will pick him for their next Speaker. \n\"He appears to me to be one of the people over there that would be reasonable. I mean, look at some of the other people. I'm a Paul Ryan fan,\" Reid told reporters Tuesday. \"We've been able to work with him.\" \nMany House Republicans have been pushing Ryan to run for Speaker . But some Tea Party members have warned that he's been too willing to work with Democrats — and the bear-hug from the Senate's top Democrat isn't going to help Ryan on his right flank if he does decide to run. \nWhen asked if he was trying to undercut Ryan, Reid shrugged. \n\"I just speak the truth,\" he said. \"If it helps him, fine, if it doesn't that's too bad.\" \nAnd Reid wasn't the only Senate Democrat calling for Ryan. His deputy, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), jumped in with praise of his own, lauding him for his \"excellent bipartisan compromise\" on a budget deal. \n\"We don't see much of that coming out of the House Republicans,\" Durbin said.
