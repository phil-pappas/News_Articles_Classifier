The devices allowed popular models, such as the Jetta, to tell when they were undergoing emissions testing.\nThe defeat device is actually about 100 million lines of software code written into the vehicle's programming.\nThe software could tell if a test was taking place based on the position of the vehicle's steering wheel, the speed the vehicle was traveling, how long the engine was being used and barometric pressure, according to the EPA. The vehicles would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide during testing and then spew 40 times the legal limit during normal use.\nVolkswagen officials are blaming \"rogue software engineers\" for the installation of the devices.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Critics: Obama's new Syria plan still a misfire Lawmakers have pressed the president for a change in policy in the wake of Russia's intervention in Syria.\nBy Charles Hoskinson • 10/10/15 12:01 AM At this point, regulators aren't confirming that they have been notified of the possible second defeat device.\nCalifornia Air Resources Board spokesman Dave Clegern said he couldn't comment on any second device.\n\"We have an investigation under way about all the circumstances around the original defeat device,\" he said.\nEPA spokeswoman Julia Valentine confirmed the agency did receive notification of the newest software from Volkswagen.\nThe EPA is still investigating the software code and how it works.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner 'Disgrace': NY Times story on Jewish temples irks press Story asks whether two ancient temples ever actually stood at Jerusalem's holiest site, the Temple Mount.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/10/15 12:01 AM \"VW did very recently provide EPA with very preliminary information on an auxiliary emissions control device that VW said was included in one or more model years,\" she said. \"The US EPA and CARB are investigating the nature and purpose of this recently identified device.\"\nA California Air Resources Board official declined to specifically comment on the latest development.\n\nTop Story Obama: Yes to pot, no to oil The administration makes it easier to grow marijuana on Indian lands than to produce oil and gas.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/10/15 12:01 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:19:26.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
