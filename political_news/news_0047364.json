Credit: Chris Radburn/PA Archive. MPs from across the Anglia region will continue to lobby for the A47 to be fully dualled.\nThe government has already agreed to a £300m investment programme which will see improvements at key pinch-points including the Acle straight.\nThey will also see the road - which runs from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, through Cambridgeshire to Leicester - become a dual carriageway from Dereham through to Acle.\nBut following a meeting between a number of Norfolk and Suffolk MPs and with Highways England this week, Elizabeth Truss insisted last year's the announcement would not stop them lobbying for further improvements.\n\"I am keen to ensure that Highways England is planning for the long term so the A47 is future-proofed for further upgrades. Along with my fellow MPs, we want the A47 fully dualled and I have asked Highways England to present the economic case for this.\"\n– Elizabeth Truss MP, South West Norfolk (Cons).
