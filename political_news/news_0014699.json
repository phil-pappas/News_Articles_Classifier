Photo: Wolter Peeters\nThe world of a 14-year-old can be pretty small. They are too young to drive, or consent to sex, or get a job in some states. And they still need a note from mum to attend a school excursion.\nBut under yet another tranche of counter-terrorism reforms, 14-year-olds could be subject to control orders if they are suspected of involvement in terrorist activity. Under such orders, they could be detained at a certain premises for 12 hours a day, required to wear a tracking device, and stopped from associating or communicating with certain people.\nThe move, urged by NSW Premier Mike Baird and announced by Attorney-General George Brandis this week, follows the shooting of police accountant Curtis Cheng by 15-year-old Farhad Khalil Mohammad Jabar in Parramatta on October 2, along with several other cases of children falling victim to radicalisation.\nBut some legal experts remain concerned about the extension of an already contentious tool.\nAdvertisement \"The response so far does seem to be hasty and it does seem to be reactionary,\" Rita Shackel, associate professor of law at Sydney Law School, says. \"There's very little by the way of hard-core evidence to suggest that control orders actually are effective ... particularly in the context of young people.\"\nThere is very little evidence of any sort. Control orders have only been issued six times since their creation in 2005; none to anyone under 18.\nBut lowering the age to 14 would be consistent with the age children begin to be treated like adults in the eyes of the criminal law. The principle of doli incapax , a presumption against criminal responsibility, stops at 14. Minors under 18 are still afforded the protections of the juvenile justice system, such as the explicit preference for rehabilitation instead of punishment, but at 14 it is presumed they are aware of the seriousness of their actions.\nIt is therefore \"understandable\", Shackel says, that politicians would seek to extend control orders below the age of 16. \"It is consistent, prima facie ,\" she says. \"But I think we're dealing with quite a different context. It goes back to this question of efficacy – what will the control orders achieve?\"\nThe aim, according to proponents of the measure, is to give police the powers they need to prevent attacks like the shooting of Cheng. But others point out that Jabar was not even on the authorities' radar before he gunned down the NSW Police employee.\nBrandis says 14 is reasonable and that that ASIO has monitored teenagers of that age . It was also revealed this week that a 12-year-old is being monitored in connection with suspected terrorist activity. The Attorney-General says his reforms will actually beef up protections for minors on control orders by adding safeguards that did not previously exist.\nThat will include a requirement for an independent person to advocate for the best interests of the child before a court, and limitations on \"the capacity of police to question or deal with minors in a way that is regarded, given the age of the person, to be unreasonable\", he said in interviews.\nConsistent with the status quo, minors would be subject to control orders for a maximum of three months; adults for up to a year. \"At all times, we are very, very conscious to craft our national security laws in a way that ... remains respectful of the rights of the individual and the rule of law,\" Brandis told the Senate.\nNational Children's Commissioner Megan Mitchell worries that control orders might be counterproductive to helping children at risk of radicalisation. Having worked in juvenile justice and child protection, she believes disaffected teenagers are likely to be further marginalised by punitive measures.\n\"They are very covert, they're anti-authoritarian, and I think these kinds of control orders will only drive that kind of attitude further,\" Mitchell says. Some measures may even run foul of the international Convention on the Rights of the Child, she suggests.\n\"Placing a tracking device on somebody who has committed no crime would be highly stigmatising,\" she says. \"And putting a terrorist label on a child that young, it's going to be very hard for that child to shake that label.\"\nThe threat of control orders for 14-year-olds represents a direct intervention by state authorities in the behaviour of children, without the involvement of parents. This is an area of concern for many observers, including barrister and former terrorism law watchdog Bret Walker, SC, who told the ABC's Lateline : \"There's nothing comfortable about imposing state compulsion against children.\"\nSimon Cowan, a former lawyer and now research fellow at the right-leaning Centre for Independent Studies, shares this scepticism.\n\"I'm always concerned about extending adult penalties [and] adult devices towards kids,\" he says. \"When you get someone who is 14, they're clearly not a mature adult. Their thought processes are different and their experiences are different. I would be more inclined to try and divert them towards programs that would help them out.\"\nMitchell says control orders would undermine the very parents who need to be engaged in helping their children avoid radicalisation. The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but she wants to see more detail about what assistance will be available to vulnerable families.\n\"It's very risky just to slap [down] the controls without anything else,\" she says. \"The police can't be in everybody's bedroom or home [but] parents can – they are really the frontier we should be looking at here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:27:07.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
