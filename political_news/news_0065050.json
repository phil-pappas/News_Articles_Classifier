Shoppers flocked to the Galleria department store to make purchases benefitting the Reconstruction of a Survivor program. Ten percent of all purchases were donated to help support the program's mission to improve the lives of those impacted by breast cancer through valuable local support groups. Shoppers were greeted by master of ceremonies, Deborah Duncan of KHOU's Great Day Houston , and treated to complimentary bra fittings, massage, makeup application, refreshments and door prizes throughout the afternoon.\nMany believe the breast cancer journey ends after completion of treatment, whether that be chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. The little known fact is that survivors have more options now than ever before. Breast reconstruction techniques now include advanced surgeries that go beyond breast implants. Women are learning about several innovative flap procedures that can use the patients' own skin and fat for breast reconstruction using advanced microsurgical techniques.\nThe program began with a presentation by Dr. Camille Cash , a plastic surgeon and Dr. Jamie Terry , a breast surgical specialist – who both perform surgeries at Westside Surgical Hospital & Breast Center. Dr. Cash explained that many women do not realize reconstructive procedures following a mastectomy are an option, and is covered by all major insurance plans. \"Breast reconstruction may be immediate and can take place right away along with the mastectomy, or reconstruction can be performed later. There are benefits to either approach and women must decide with their physicians what is right for them. Advances in surgical techniques now allow us to offer many options. We have procedures that use tissue expanders or implants - and we also have the broad category of autologous - using your own tissue to reconstruct the breast.\"\nDr. Terry proceeded to give a presentation on the importance of breast cancer early detection and specialty consultation. Dr. Terry echoed Dr. Cash's sentiment regarding the importance of coordinating breast cancer surgical treatment with plastic surgical consultation and planning. Dr. Terry urged patients to remain vigilant about their health, during October and throughout the year. \"Everything starts with awareness and paying attention to your body,\" she shared. \"It starts with women being aware, taking time out from your busy schedule and getting screenings, seeing your doctor, knowing your family history and going forward with any testing. We are diagnosing more cancer because our technology has gotten much better. I firmly believe mammograms and clinical exams save lives.\"\nNearly 60 people joined for the event. Both physicians educated shoppers and survivors about surgical options for women undergoing breast cancer treatment. They also answered questions on topics ranging from screening guidelines to risk factors. Both encouraged the women in the audience to take charge of their health concerns, meet with their physicians regularly and - for those 40 years or older – to ask about advanced screening, such as the 3D mammography found at Westside Surgical Hospital and Breast Center.\nIn addition to hearing from the physicians, the audience also heard from Reconstruction of a Survivor 's program coordinator, Wanda Johnson and a patient member, Michelle Stephenson who each spoke about their personal journeys and how the organization is helping women.\nSince the designation of national BRA day in October, 2011, more and more patients, caregivers and physicians are becoming aware of the surgical choices for breast cancer survivors. Fewer than 25 percent of survivors pursue reconstructive surgery after a mastectomy. Events like BRA day are an effort to help empower women to make informed choices about their options. The event was sponsored in part by Brave is Beautiful , a free educational portal that connects women with information and resources on reconstructive surgical procedures.\nContact :\nMika Rao; Director of Public Relations & Corporate Communications\nPhone: 713.532.7311\nEmail: mika@ks-consulting.net\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279262\n releases/bra-day-event-for-survivors--community-hosted-by-dillards-department-store-and-westside-surgical-hospital-300164777.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.texasoncology.com/doctors/jamie-terry", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151021/279262", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://braveisbeautiful.com/treatment#surgery", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH34797&Transmission_Id=201510221212PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH34797&DateId=20151022", "http://www.reconstructasurvivor.org/events.html", "http://westsidesurgical.net/", "http://www.camillecashmd.com/", "http://www.bradayusa.org/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151021/279262", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bra-day-event-for-survivors--community-hosted-by-dillards-department-store-and-westside-surgical-hospital-300164777.html", "http://www.dillards.com/", "http://www.bradayhouston.com/", "http://www.braveisbeautiful.com/", "http://www.khou.com/story/entertainment/television/programs/great-day-houston/2015/10/12/bra-day/73811664/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:39:31.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
