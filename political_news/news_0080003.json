The results showed 29 percent of respondents replied yes, and 8 percent said they were undecided.\nOf those surveyed, about a quarter identified themselves as Republicans, another quarter said they were Democrats and the rest said they were either independent or unaffiliated. The respondents were evenly split between Nassau and Suffolk counties, and the poll had a margin of error of +/- 5 percent.\nQuiz Quiz: How well do you know the 2016 contenders? More coverage The 2016 campaign More coverage Opinion, analysis about 2016 \"Donald Trump is a niche candidate who has very strong and reliable support that doesn't go much farther than his base,\" said Lawrence Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University and a former Newsday columnist. \"He has the money to hang around as long as he likes, but he has yet to show an ability to go beyond people who have responded to his message and positions.\"\nAfter a surge in support over the summer, Trump led polls nationally by as much as 16 points in some early September, according to Real Clear Politics, which aggregates political data.\nThe latest numbers show the gap between Trump and his competitors tightening, however. Trump has slipped 7 points since his peak on Sept. 19, according to RCP's average of nine polls, and he currently sits at 6 points above the next top candidate, former neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:21:39.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
