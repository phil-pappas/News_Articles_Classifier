There were 1,000 police officers on duty at the march. \nOpposition to the so-called Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has risen over the past year in Germany, with critics fearing the pact will hand too much power to big multinationals at the expense of consumers and workers. \n“What bothers me the most is that I don’t want all our consumer laws to be softened,” Oliver Zloty told Reuters TV. “And I don’t want to have a dictatorship by any companies.” \nDietmar Bartsch, deputy leader of the parliamentary group for the Left party, who was taking part in the rally said he was concerned about the lack of transparency surrounding the talks. \n“We definitely need to know what is supposed to be being decided,” he said. \nMarchers banged drums, blew whistles and held up posters reading “Yes we can – Stop TTIP.” \nThe level of resistance has taken Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government by surprise and underscores the challenge it faces to turn the tide in favor of the deal which proponents say will create a market of 800 million and serve as a counterweight to China’s economic clout. \nIn a full-page letter published in several German newspapers on Saturday, Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned against “scaremongering”. \n“We have the chance to set new and goods standards for growing global trade. With ambitious, standards for the environment and consumers and with fair conditions for investment and workers. This must be our aim,” Gabriel wrote. \nBusinesses hope the trade deal will deliver over $100 billion of economic gains on both sides of the Atlantic. \n“A fair and comprehensive free trade deal promotes growth and prosperity in Europe. We should actively participate in the rules for world trade of tomorrow,” Ulrich Grillo, head of the BDI Federation of German industries, said in a statement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:15:21.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
