In the one and a half years since he became Prime Minister, Mr Narendra Modi had made it his political style to remain disturbingly quiet when the country looked up to him.\nThis was especially the case when many of his fellow RSS “pracharaks” and others went on the rampage against minority faiths, as well as critics, baulking not even at murder — and sometimes even celebrating the extinguishing of the life of those who dare question them, as we recently saw after the Taliban-style killing of rationalist Kalburgi.\nMany inferred that Mr Modi dare not rein in the armies of the religious Right who had campaigned for his election. However, in the immediate context of the lynching of a Muslim villager at Dadri, allegedly for eating beef, the PM appeared to find his voice all of a sudden. Remaining silent, and making the right noises about “development” as Hindutva-style goons flaunted their new-found power and instructed people on what to eat, wear, or study, was no longer an option after President Pranab Mukherjee on Wednesday reminded the country of the core values of diversity, tolerance and pluralism. Speaking thus, it was evident, the President was indirectly instructing the government.\nThe Dadri incident has caused inordinate damage to India’s image. One week on, members of the saffron brigade — Mr Modi’s ministers amongst them — have not stopped their noxious propaganda against Muslims, raising questions over whether the Prime Minister is serious when he makes politically correct observations from to time.\nSome stalwart writers — among them Nayantara Sehgal, Jawaharlal Nehru’s niece and bitter critic of the Emergency imposed by her cousin Indira Gandhi — have returned their coveted awards conferred on them by leading government institutions, in the process shaming the BJP-led government. In public comments Ms Sehgal has gone to the extent of depicting the ideology of the present regime as “fascist”.\nIt is good to see that the Prime Minister has at last spoken. At a campaign rally in Bihar on Thursday, he commended the President’s remarks to the people, calling them “inspirational”, and “guidance” for the country. Better late than never. The country will, however, be waiting to see if Mr Modi is willing and able to ensure that the destructive brigade that has raised him to power pipes down, is given no leeway, and is punished if it strays out of line. He could begin with his ministers, and prominent MPs and party colleagues.\n PM Narendra Modi Bihar Assembly polls DC-Comment commentary Also Read Railways’ vision: A timeframe needed Martian discovery Heed President’s note of caution A relevant debate", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Modi%20in%20Begusarai%20for%20Bihar%20Polls%20PTI.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccanchronicle.com/151009/commentary-dc-comment/article/pm-modi-finally-breaks-his-silence", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Modi%20in%20Begusarai%20for%20Bihar%20Polls%20PTI.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:53:16.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
