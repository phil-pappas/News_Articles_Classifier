By Mary Kate Cary Oct. 9, 2015 | 6:00 a.m. EDT\n+ More The first Democratic debate of the 2016 cycle will be held on Tuesday, October 13 on CNN, with Anderson Cooper hosting from Las Vegas. As I write this, speculation is rampant about whether Vice President Joe Biden will jump in the race. Right now the betting is that he won't debate – there's not enough time for full-scale debate prep – even if he does enter the race. So in addition to probably not seeing the vice president on stage, here are five things you probably won't see either:\nFirst, you won't see former President Bill Clinton in the audience, for the same reason you didn't see former President George W. Bush at any of the GOP debates cheering for his brother. As Hillary Clinton told CNN's Wolf Blitzer last month, \"I'm not running for my husband's third term … I'm running for my first.\" If he's smart, he'll stay away.\n[ READ: The GOP's Primary Calendar Could Help Defeat Trump ]\nSecond, you won't see Hillary Clinton go after socialist candidate Bernie Sanders, who is surging in the polls and has raised almost as much money as she has this quarter – all from over a million small donations, which means he's got staying power because most of his donors will be able to donate again and again. Clinton recently told a longtime supporter, \"I am not going to start to take shots at Bernie Sanders.\" In fact, the last time she was on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" she wouldn't even mention him by name. While some backers are getting nervous about her silence – she risks looking arrogant and out-of-touch – they also know that polls show that most Sanders supporters would back her in the general election should she be the nominee. That means she won't tear him down and risk losing Sanders supporters in the long run. \"I have five words of advice for the campaign,\" longtime Clinton backer Paul Begala told the Washington Post when asked whether she should start attacking Sanders: \"No, no, no, no and no.\"\nDavid Axelrod, the longtime Obama adviser, agreed with the hands-off-Bernie strategy when he told the New York Times : \"Better to be a champion for fairness and opportunity, and tackle the issue of how to raise wages in a country where they have effectively flatlined for decades, than to kneecap a guy who is relatively popular and is running a positive campaign.\"\nThird, you won't hear much about the issues that really matter. You won't hear about the majority of Americans who believe our nation remains on the wrong track, or any new plans outside of big government programs to help the people who have been left behind in the abysmal Obama recovery. You may hear the words \"middle class\" over and over, but you won't hear much about the poor, or how a growing economy will help lift more vulnerable Americans out of poverty so that record numbers don't have to rely on food stamps and disability payments.\nYou may hear about \"free\" community college proposals, but you won't hear a word about our young people who are being saddled with massive debt – both in terms of existing college loan payments and massive future taxes because of our national debt – or their younger brothers and sisters in failing elementary and high schools, who are being denied access to school choice. You will not hear any plans to reform Obamacare in order to help families, doctors and employers get out from under its worst excesses.\nYou won't hear anyone say they want to defeat and destroy the Islamic State group or, for that matter, bring the benefits of democratic capitalism and free enterprise to people overseas. And you won't hear about any sort of coherent energy strategy that allows us to be a long-term net exporter of oil, instead of being dependent on foreign oil from our enemies, in order to strengthen our national security.\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the 2016 Presidential Elections ]\nBut you will hear how the government can eliminate income inequality by raising the minimum wage and imposing higher taxes on the rich. How the government can magically stop school shootings by enacting gun control; how it can regulate climate change; how it can protect \"women's health\" by continuing full taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood; how everything will be better if we can just \"invest\" more (you won't hear the words \"spend more\") on a bigger government, more programs and more regulations. And how the American people just \"don't have the stomach\" for intervening in any more international crises, no matter what the threat to our national security.\nFourth, you won't hear too many self-deprecating lines or attempts at humor at this debate. With the possible exception of Martin O'Malley, who has been known to crack an occasional joke, the current Democratic candidates – Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb – are a pretty unfunny bunch. If you saw Hillary Clinton on Saturday Night Live recently you know what I mean.\nSay what you want about Donald Trump, but he is entertaining. For that matter, so is Joe Biden. Without either one of them on stage, this could be a very long night.\nWhich brings me to my final point: you won't see the record numbers of viewers that the Republicans got in their debates – 24 million and 23 million each in their first two debates. CNN is concerned enough about audience numbers that it is practically begging Joe Biden to appear, and has announced that viewers can watch the debate wearing those virtual reality headsets in order to \"get an absolutely first-row-seat experience\" at the debate – and have the ability to see the candidates up really close and personal. I am not making this up . I'll be surprised if they get many takers on the offer.\nMy bet is that a lot more people will watch the CW's \"iZombie\" than will watch the debate. After all, if you have to watch the walking dead, at least you should get a few laughs out of it.\nThe Report Thank you, your email has been submitted.\nSubscribe to our\nNewsletter Stay informed with exclusive content sent\ndirectly to your inbox.\nTAGS: debates Democratic Party Clinton, Hillary Sanders, Bernie Biden, Joe 2016 presidential election", "external_links": ["http://www.apple.com/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0c4k%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=5%20Things%20You%20Won%27t%20See%20in%20the%20Democratic%20Debate&summary=The%20candidates%20in%20the%20Democratic%20debate%20won%27t%20likely%20address%20important%20topics%20%E2%80%93%20and%20they%20won%27t%20be%20funny%20either.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0c4k%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0c4k%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0c4k%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=5%20Things%20You%20Won%27t%20See%20in%20the%20Democratic%20Debate", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0c4k%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=5%20Things%20You%20Won%27t%20See%20in%20the%20Democratic%20Debate", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0c4k%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:45:19.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
