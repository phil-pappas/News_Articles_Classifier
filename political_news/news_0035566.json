The Post and Courier reviewed spending records of all six mayoral hopefuls, totalling millions of dollars worth of expenses from their current and previous campaigns. The review followed this newspapers’ recent series, Capitol Gains , in which The Post and Courier and the Center for Public Integrity detailed how some South Carolina lawmakers have used their campaign war chests as their personal ATMs. While no one is suggesting the mayoral candidates did anything wrong — and while campaign spending has not become an issue in the race — their records demonstrate how vague ethics laws and enforcement can lead to questions about where campaign money really goes. John Crangle, of the nonprofit watchdog Common Cause South Carolina, said he has heard fewer questions about spending among local officials, but that’s likely because they raise fewer dollars than state lawmakers. “The problem with our campaign finance law is it permits use of campaign money for non-campaign expenses,” he said. “When you allow campaign funds to be used for office-related expenses or charitable donations or any expenses other than campaigning, there’s an immense opportunity for abuse. And it’s been going on for a long time.” And judging solely from campaign disclosure forms, it can be difficult to discern which expenses are clearly tied to running for office and when a candidate just decided to grab a bite on their campaign’s dime. ‘It’s very inconsistent’ Mayor Joe Riley’s last re-election bid showed more than $177,000 being paid to Ginny Deerin, who now is running to replace him. Deerin, who previously founded and ran WINGS for Kids, directed Riley’s campaign. While some of that money was paid directly to her for her consulting work, other sums were reimbursed to her for unitemized expenses. Deerin said Riley’s campaign did not have a campaign credit card, “so what happened was, because I’m close to Joe Riley and I knew he wasn’t going anywhere, many expenses went on my personal credit card and I rebilled the campaign.” Last year, when Deerin ran for S.C. Secretary of State, it was a different campaign — and a very different kind of public accounting of its expenses. Deerin paid for more than 160 visits to coffee shops, restaurants and grocery stores, not including more than $9,530 that she reimbursed herself directly for mileage, food and other expenses. “I had no campaign office. Our meetings were in coffee shops,” she said. “I was on the road a tremendous amount of time, and I would meet voters. When you do that much grassroots traveling, you’re in a lot of coffee shops.” Deerin said in her experience, oversight from the State Ethics Commission has evolved, making it tough to make apples-to-apples comparisons between Riley’s last campaign in 2011 and today. “The oversight and the review is very inconsistent,” she said. “Honestly, it wasn’t until, I can’t remember when, I was told by the Ethics Commission that you have to break down the expenses, which then I of course would do. But back in the Riley days, we were following the rules and no one ever asked us to do anything otherwise.” Deerin said she would be happy to list more detail, but the Ethics Commission asks candidates to re-key items into their system instead of uploading a spreadsheet that might have more detail. “I think it should be online,” she said. “I am completely committed to transparency, and it’s very uneven. In some cases, there’s tremendous detail, and in other cases, there’s not. And it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything wrong. That point is it’s very inconsistent, and it should be totally transparent.” A character limit For some $43,000 in campaign expenses since 2009, mayoral hopeful and state Rep. Leon Stavrinakis spent his own money up front and then paid himself back. By doing this, he became the person listed as providing the service on his campaign spending forms. At times, this practice left constituents without a full picture of where and how that money was being spent. On two days in September 2009, for example, the Charleston Democrat shelled out more than $1,300 to pay for campaign travel and meals. Where did he go and for what purpose? The forms didn’t say. And the details of his trips remain a mystery to anyone reading the campaign finance reports he filed with the state. State law requires candidates and office holders to provide a specific description for all expenditures and the name of the person or business that receives the money, along with the recipient’s address. But by reimbursing himself for those expenses, Stavrinakis made himself the vendor providing the service and left out key details about his spending. Stavrinakis, who sits on the House Ethics Committee, said every expense was legitimate and campaign-related. He preferred to pay up front with his own money because he didn’t want to get too comfortable using his campaign credit card to pay for things. “I was just hesitant to use that card a lot,” he said. “Sometimes people get themselves in trouble because that card becomes easy to use.” State law requires candidates to keep receipts of expenditures for four years should questions arise about their spending. Only one of the expenditures listed above occurred during the last four years, a September 2011 trip that cost $1,375, listed on his campaign disclosure form as “travel reimburse alec.” When asked about the expense, his campaign indicated the trip he attended was a national legislative conference hosted by the American Legislative Exchange Council in New Orleans. The payment was reimbursement for airfare, hotel and meals incurred at the conference, campaign staffer Lachlan McIntosh said. McIntosh declined to provide information on the other expenditures in question, saying they fell outside the time frame of accounting required by law. He would not say if Stavrinakis still possessed the receipts from those expenditures. Stavrinakis said he took it upon himself to increase the level of detail in his spending reports in recent years. The House as a whole has become more meticulous about reporting after “unpleasant developments” such as the ethics-related indictments against former House Speaker Bobby Harrell and former Sen. Robert Ford for improper use of campaign funds, he said. Stavrinakis said he supports greater transparency on campaign spending and he has long advocated for increasing the space provided on disclosure forms to allow candidates to include more in-depth descriptions of their expenditures. “There is a character limit, but I’ve done the best I can to make clear what I am doing,” he said. “I’ve tried to work through the limitations of the system.” Following ‘fuzzy’ rules Businessman John Tecklenburg’s campaign has spent money on several consultants, polling, catering, printing services and the like. His expenses also include three refunds to donors, including one to Dr. Charles Darby, who requested a refund after something Tecklenburg said. “We respectfully returned it to him,” he said. And looking only at expenses sometimes doesn’t tell the whole picture. For instance, Tecklenburg listed $500 in expenses earlier this year at both Halls Chop House and Prohibition, but both were actually in-kind donations also reflected on his contributions. “I certainly wasn’t taking my family out for dinner,’ he said. Other candidates have raised and spent far less. Toby Smith, a nonprofit advisor, has had few expenses to date, including the $1,000 filing fee, $127.45 for business cards, a tote bag and hat, $300 for website development and $40 for a U.S. Post Office box. Former City Councilman Maurice Washington also has had few expenses, though his 2013 state Senate bid showed he spent small sums on about 11 canvassers. “Unfortunately, it’s hard to find volunteers — people who willingly agree to give you a few hours a day at no charge to the campaign,” he said. “They’re postal service workers without postal service pay. They deliver your literature directly to your voters and engage them in conversation.” Like many candidates, Washington has had to amend his reports. “We try to govern ourselves according to the rules, however fuzzy they may be from time to time,” he said. “You just file accurately, and if you’re out of line, you hear from somebody.” For instance, Deerin’s campaign already amended two of its reports to detail how much individual staff members were paid — and how much income tax was withheld. In her initial filings, all of those details were just lumped under $15,326.70 and $16,033.02 payments to Dominion Payroll Services. Earlier this year, Stavrinakis’ House account listed $11,000 in expenses for Facebook ads and consultants who also are working on his mayoral bid. Stavrinakis said those payments reflected expenses incurred in his 2014 re-election bid but after the election. State law allows candidates to shift money from one campaign account to another — with donors’ consent — but Stavrinakis said he opted not to do that this year with any of the $36,326.14 in his House war chest. City Councilman William Dudley Gregorie, who has self-financed almost 15 percent of his campaign, listed 56 payments to canvassers in amounts ranging from $10 to $500. Tecklenburg said he has not focused on his opponents’ spending, adding, “I’ve spent more time, to be honest with you, looking at their contributions.” So far, the mayoral campaign has been devoid of one kind of controversial spending: ads from anonymous noncandidate groups. The 2011 mayoral race saw the emergence of one such group that distributed fliers attacking Riley and praising one of his opponents. Because of recent federal court rulings saying that such spending is protected under the First Amendment, the “Citizens for a Better Charleston” group did not have to disclose its donors, nor did its donors have to abide by the $1,000-per person or business limit set by state law. But it’s something campaigns are keeping an eye one: The election is Nov. 3. Glenn Smith contributed to this report. Reach Robert Behre at (843) 937-5771 or at twitter.com/RobertFBehre.
