This week they will discuss, among other things, China's rising presence in the South China Sea. Jose Luis Magana Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe The Obama administration is keen for the Turnbull government to continue to speak out against China's \"aggressive\" provocations in the South China Sea, as the US prepares to test Beijing's resolve and sail warships through disputed waters in the area.\nManaging China's intimidating behaviour towards smaller neighbours in South East Asia will be discussed when Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop and new Defence Minister Marise Payne hold bilateral talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry and Defence Secretary Ashton Carter in Boston this week.\nPreviewing the annual Australiaâ€“US Ministerial Consultations, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matt Matthews said there was \"rising tension\" in the South China Sea due to overlapping territorial claims and China taking a more \"aggressive stance\".\n\"Australia and the United States also continue to work as partners in the Asia Pacific region to uphold freedom of navigation and overflight with respect to international law and unimpeded lawful commerce,\" Mr Matthews said in Washington on Friday.\nSatellite images from June show extensive Chinese building works on the Spratly islands which it is making into a forward base for military purposes. Supplied The US has repeatedly called for China to halt its constructions activities on the disputed reefs and artificial islands to Australia's north in the South China Sea, a major shipping route which almost one-third of global trade passes through.\n\"We call upon China and other claimants to adhere to that halt and we appreciate it when other nations in the region share in promoting that view as a way of lowering tensions in the South China Sea,\" Mr Matthews said.\nThe US is poised to sail warships inside the 12-nautical mile zone near the Spratly chain that China has been building on and claims as territory, to signal to Beijing that Washington does not recognise the Chinese claims, the Financial Times reported last week. The manoeuvre is expected in the next two weeks.\nResponding to reports the US would assist the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia in enforcing maritime law, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman said on Friday it was \"seriously concerned\".\n \"There is no way for us to condone infringement of China's territorial sea and airspace by any country under the pretext of 'maintaining the freedom of navigation and overflight',\" she said.\n\"We urge relevant parties to refrain from saying or doing anything provocative and act responsibly in maintaining regional peace and stability.\"\nAwkward moment The wrangle is potentially awkward for the Turnbull government, as it tries to balance maintaining strong security relations with Washington, while enhancing economic relations with Beijing in the wake of the signing of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.\nThough the Prime Minister is viewed by some foreign policy experts as being more sympathetic to China than predecessor Tony Abbott, Mr Turnbull labelled China's action on the artificial islands as \"counter-productive\" before he took over as leader.\nIn her first substantive comments on the maritime dispute since taking over as Defence Minister, S enator Payne said last week that Australia opposed \"intimidation\" and \"aggression\" on competing territorial claims , a reference to China's rogue behaviour.\nDefence experts believe the biggest risk in a US freedom of navigation exercise near reefs that China claims and has conducted land reclamation on, is an inadvertent clash that leads to escalation.\nMr Matthews, who until recently was foreign policy advisor to US Pacific Command, would not comment on specific plans, saying the US has a \"robust freedom of navigation program and you can expect that to be ongoing.\"\n\"The United States has naval resources in the South China Sea,\" he added.\nAustralia and the US do not take sides on the territorial claims, emphasising the spats must be resolved peacefully via international law.\nIn the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping at the White House last month, President Barack Obama said the US would \"sail, fly and operate anywhere that international law allows\" after expressing \"significant concerns over land reclamation, construction and the militarisation of disputed areas\".\nMr Kerry will host the AUSMIN meeting in his home town of Boston, starting with an informal dinner Monday night and a full-day meeting Tuesday.\nAustralia's military role fighting the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria, implementing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and possibly slowing the withdrawal of military personnel in Afghanistan are also on the agenda.\n\"I look forward to meeting with Secretary Kerry and Secretary Carter for AUSMIN consultations in Boston,\" Ms Bishop said last week.\nThe AUSMIN meeting coincides with the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Australia and the US.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/marise-payne-australia-will-oppose-intimidation-and-aggression-in-veiled-warning-to-china-20151007-gk3azq.html", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/868ab0d2-6d6c-11e5-aca9-d87542bf8673.html#axzz3o10uDcQh", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-10-11T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:39:14.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
