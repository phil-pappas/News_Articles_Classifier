For most of the 30-minute appearance, Joo read a prepared — and probably coached — speech full of praise for the country, its government and people.\nOther foreigners who have been detained in the North have said after their release that they were coerced or coached closely on what to say in such statements.\nSouth Korea says North Korea is holding three other South Korean nationals and has urged Pyongyang to return them.\nThe Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
