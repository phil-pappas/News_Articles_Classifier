Launched in 2014, the Nutrilite™ Power of 5 Campaign has already provided essential daily nutrients in the form of Nutrilite™ Little Bits™, a micronutrient supplement, to thousands of children in 11 countries.\n\"By setting this goal, Amway is significantly growing the number of malnourished children and families we aim to help,\" said Jeff Terry , global manager for corporate social responsibility at Amway. \"The Nutrilite™ Power of 5 Campaign has been embraced by many people around the world, including Amway Business Owners, employees and members of the general public. Our new goal requires more. We need to develop stronger partnerships with the organizations that are implementing this solution and with people who are supporting our efforts to bring more Nutrilite™ Little Bits™ to more children.\"\nAccording to the World Health Organization, malnutrition is the cause of more than 3 million premature deaths of children under 5 each year. Those who survive often suffer lasting effects, including stunted growth, poor cognitive development and low immunity to disease. Malnutrition also affects school performance and studies have shown it often leads to lower earning potential as an adult.\nThe Nutrilite™ Power of 5 Campaign works with humanitarian organizations to distribute Nutrilite™ Little Bits™ to families that have malnourished children ages 6 months to 5 years old in areas where the organization is actively educating, providing food and conducting follow-up assessments to be sure children are thriving.\nTo support this goal and find additional information about the Nutrilite™ Power of 5 Campaign, visit powerof5.nutrilite.com and participate in the #Powerof5 Twitter Chat on World Food Day, October 16, 2015 .\nAbout Nutrilite™\nNutrilite™ exclusively by Amway is the world's #1 selling brand of vitamins and dietary supplements* developed for personal daily vitamin and mineral nutrition, heart health, strong bones and weight management.
