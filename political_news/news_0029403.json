Michael Pearson, The current CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals who recently said that his companys responsibility is to its shareholders, while making no mention of his customers who rely on his drugs to live. If products are sort of mispriced and theres an opportunity, we will act appropriately in terms of doing what I assume our shareholders would like us to do. Already this year, Valeant has increased the price of 56 of the drugs in its portfolio an average of 66 percent, highlighted by their recent acquisition, Zegerid, which they promptly raised 550 percent. Not only does this have the unfortunate side effect of placing the price of life-saving drugs out of reach for even moderately-insured people, but it has now begun to call into question the sustainability of this rapidly-spreading business model. I think the word \"evil\" is a proper term for people like this, and for a system like this. People need this stuff to live and they raise the price.
