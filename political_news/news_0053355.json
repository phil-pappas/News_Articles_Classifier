On the other hand, finance minister Arun Jaitley has dismissed the protests as being “politically motivated”.\nHere, we will take a statistical look at how the government should react to such protests, although the piece only provides a framework and not a definitive answer.\nThe common criteria to measure the strength of a protest is “numbers” (number of people protesting) and “voice” (following of protesters). Sometimes (like in the India Against Corruption protests in 2011), the sheer number of people protesting is enough for the protests to be taken seriously. Even when the numbers are small, the sheer influence and following of protesters is sometimes enough to draw attention to their cause, for in such cases, the protesters claim to speak not only for themselves but also for their followers.\nStatistically speaking, however, looking at sheer numbers and strength will tell an incomplete story, unless we also include prior beliefs and correlations into the mix.\n“Correlation” can be defined as a measure of the independence of the behaviour of a set of agents.\nOne extreme example is a flock of sheep which is very highly correlated—if one sheep goes one way, it is highly likely that the rest of the flock will follow it. Gas molecules on the other hand have a mutual correlation close to zero— the movement of one in no way influences the other.\nCorrelation can be negative also—for example, an agent can always take a stand diametrically opposite to another agent (such agents are not hard to find in Indian politics).\nCorrelation is a problem in statistical techniques such as regression, where positively correlated explanatory variables can lead to spurious results. The solution in such cases is usually to transform the variables to a set of uncorrelated variables, and this process is usually accompanied by a reduction in the number of variables.\nTo see it another way, the information contained in correlated variables can be represented by a smaller number of independent variables (movement of a flock of sheep, to take an extreme case, can be represented by the movement of just one sheep). \nThus, if you have a number of positively correlated agents protesting, it is as if the true number of “independent protesters” is a lower number, and the higher the degree of correlation between the protesters, the lower is the number of “true protesters”.\nOn the other hand, if you have a set of people who don’t normally agree with each other making the same argument, it adds greater weight—that people who don’t normally see eye-to-eye are coming together lends it greater “information content”.\nThen we have prior beliefs of the protesters. When journalist Rajdeep Sardesai asked Nayantara Sahgal (who set off the protests by returning her Sahitya Akademi award) why she had not protested during earlier episodes that indicated similar intolerance, she replied that her action was based on the fact that “now there is a Hindutva government at the Centre”.\nIn other words, her initial reaction to the events was not unbiased, but based on her “prior beliefs” that with a “Hindutva government” at the centre, intolerance was likely to grow. Given that she started off with a strong prior that intolerance was likely to grow, it didn’t take too much for her beliefs to strengthen to the extent that she protested by returning her award. It is to such prior beliefs that Jaitley possibly alluded to when he spoke about the protests being politically motivated.\nWe had seen how strong prior beliefs resulted in unchanging opinions in the face of contrary evidence, and led to futile flame wars. Bayes’ Theorem can also help us assess if there is truly a problem by matching people’s statements with their prior beliefs.\nWhen someone protests in line with his/her prior beliefs, the information content in the protests is lowered, for it would have taken a lower degree of evidence for them to update their already strong beliefs to a level where protests are necessary. If, on the other hand, a person’s protest is inconsistent with his/her prior beliefs, their protest has high information content—for it would have taken extremely strong evidence for them to reverse their prior beliefs to the extent that they think it is necessary to protest.\nGiven this framework, it is possible for us to determine whether there exists a problem given the protesters’ prior beliefs and correlations (which can be gleaned from their writings and earlier political statements—some degree of subjectivity is inevitable).\nGoing by Bayes’ formula, all we need is the probability that this particular sequence (given correlations, the order is important) of authors register protest given that there is a problem, and the probability that this particular sequence of authors register protest given that there is no problem (the math is not going to be very clean, one must be warned)! \nAnd once this model is built, it is rather easy to update the odds upon receiving every bit (no pun intended) of additional information (in the form of new people joining the protest, or refusing to join them).\nWho says political problems cannot be addressed analytically?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:17:59.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
