It sounds like an appliances warehouse. \nNorthern Powerhouse: the appliance of economic science\nIt's not. It's about the rebalancing of the UK economy pushing growth outside London in the Northern cities. One-nation Government.\nThe theory is that by improving the \"connectivity\" between the cities of Manchester, Leeds, Hull, Sheffield and Liverpool (ie better transport links) a super economic power will be created.\nThat and a shed load of investment, which Mr Osborne has recently been trying to secure from the Chinese.\nIn Mr Osborne's words: \"We need a Northern Powerhouse too.\n\"Not one city, but a collection of northern cities - sufficiently close to each other that combined they can take on the world.\"\nAnd then he gave a football analogy to make it very clear - because that's what football analogies do.\n\"You know, if you brought together the best players from each of the Premiership teams in the north, you’d have a team that would wipe the floor with any competition.\n\"We need to bring the cities of the north together as a team – that’s how Britain will beat the rest.\"\n:: Whose idea was it? \nOsborne: \"100% focused on delivering the Northern Powerhouse\"\nMr Osborne would like you to think it was Mr Osborne's idea.\nBut it was cribbed from obscure Labour policy papers – ones the party itself failed to take up.\nTo the Chancellor's credit, he forged it in Government policy and staked his personal reputation on it.\n:: When did it appear in the political lexicon? \nGeorge Osborne makes his June 2014 speech\nHe made his \"we need a northern powerhouse\" speech on 23 June 2014 at the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester. Then.\nIt's been a key plank of one-nation Conservatism ever since and the party's pitch to hard-working families.\n:: Why does Osborne love the North? Isn't he a Londoner? \nOsborne's Tatton seat\nStrictly speaking yes but he is the first Chancellor to represent a seat in the North in 35 years.\nAs he told the June 2014 gathering: \"As you can tell from my accent, I wasn’t brought up here. I was born and raised in London.\"\nAside from the seat, it's politically expedient to romance voters north of the border, where there has been growing disillusion with Labour.\nAnd the Labour-led councils love his plans. In fact, they are right at the centre of them.\n:: So what is the Chancellor actually going to do? \nUltimo founder Michelle Mone has a role to play\n£13bn of investment, largely in transport. First there's HS2 connecting the North with the South and then there's HS3 – the East-West link.\nThere are 40 major road schemes planned and an Oyster card system for public transport between the \"powerhouse\" cities.\nMichelle Mone, Ultimo (bras) founder, is leading an independent review into encouraging business start-ups in disadvantaged communities.\n:: Isn't it all really just about Manchester? \nAll roads do not lead to Manchester\nThe Government's a bit touchy about this.\nIt is very keen to stress that the vision is not just about Manchester but the other northern cities.\nAt the end of last week, the Chancellor announced that, like Manchester, Sheffield would become a combined authority with an elected mayor.\nNo question though, Manchester is the big hitter – it has a higher population and number of jobs.\n:: And can the North really \"take on the world\"? \nNorthern football teams would wipe the floor with the rest of the world\nThe Northern Powerhouse region, accounts for 16.7% of the UK population and 13.3% of the UK's Gross Value Added – compared to London's 24.5%, according to the Centre for Cities .\nIt has performed below the UK average for 10 years.\nThe Centre for Economics and Business Research has suggested it is not going to fulfil Mr Osborne's hoped-for potential.\nIt suggested the gap between London and the north of England will rise to £110bn (94%) in the next 10 years.\nThe northern football teams, however...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:57:04.363+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
