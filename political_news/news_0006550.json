But \"crazy house prices have a sting in the tail\" and the state will eventually hit population growth.\nVICTORIA\nBusinesses have been cheering the fall in the Australian dollar, while lower interest rates and the strongest population growth in the nation add to the good news. But there are lingering negatives in manufacturing and concerns about the sustainability of housing construction.\nQUEENSLAND\nProspects in gas have been dealt a blow from falls in energy prices, drought is hitting farmers, and population growth is poor. But housing construction is up, falls in the Australian dollar will be good for tourism, and Sydney's housing prices will send \"Blues supporters\" northwards.\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA\nIt has the highest unemployment in the nation, and both car-making and defence manufacturing are in trouble. But lower interest and exchange rates are helping. There are signs of life in housing and retail, while the state's population growth is holding up.\nWESTERN AUSTRALIA\nThe party is over as mining-related construction slows and so does its major trading partner, China. While Deloitte isn't expecting the state to \"crash and burn\" while rising export volumes output keep growth ticking over, things could get worse before they get better.\nTASMANIA\nLow interest rates and a falling exchange rate are helping housing construction, retail and tourism. The economic pain of the past decade is dissipating. But the state's demographics remain dire.\nNORTHERN TERRITORY\nApproaching the tail-end of its mining-related construction boom. There are signs the economy is slowing and population growth has dropped to the nation's weakest, but construction work done will lift exports soon.\nACT\nThe job losses have stopped and housing construction has some momentum. But the pressures on the federal budget are just the same under the new prime minister, and that will keep lingering question marks over the ACT's medium term outlook.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:07:09.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
