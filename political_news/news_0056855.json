The Government has failed to even get off the starter block in this instance.\" \nPacific Affairs spokesperson Su’a William Sio says there are some cultural aspects to improving statistics such as overcoming language barriers, promoting and undertaking checks in a fanau setting, and having predominantly Maori and Pasifika health providers undertake checks in these communities. \n\"The Government has had seven years to get on top of this issue. Meanwhile obesity rates have reached a critical level. \n\"This latest plan, however, will not support the best outcomes for Maori and Pasifika children or their families,\" Su’a William Sio says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:22:47.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
