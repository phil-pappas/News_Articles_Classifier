Of these, the Lib Dem motion \"declining to approve\" the changes is the only one that would kill them off outright.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/CF13/production/_86211035_gettyimages-460805264.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T05:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:05:08.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
