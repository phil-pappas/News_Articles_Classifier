Reversing years of hard-line rule, the new Communist leader ended censorship, opened borders, ousted Soviet advisers and allowed opposition parties to flourish. “Socialism with a human face,” he called it. Moscow was not pleased, and intervention seemed likely. Yet for reporters hanging around into late summer, it was like waiting for Godot. As an international economics reporter for the New York Times, I arrived in Czechoslovakia just hours before the Soviet invasion.\nThe conflation of a half-century of Russian interventions in the Oct. 1 news article “ Russia’s Syria airstrikes are a radical shift ” [World], which spoke of Soviet troops “suppressing uprisings in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968,” was too simplistic in an otherwise excellent article. There was no uprising in Prague until after hundreds of thousands of Warsaw Pact troops led by the Soviets breached the Czech frontier the night of Aug. 20, 1968. It was only then that deadly clashes occurred in Prague and elsewhere as Czechs desperately sought to protect their new freedoms.\nIn other words, Dubcek took a chance on liberalism and failed, but his experiment during those exhilarating months should not be forgotten.\nClyde H.
