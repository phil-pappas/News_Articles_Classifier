Walter Jones, R-N.C., doesn't say if he is aware of any issues involving the candidates for speaker, majority leader and majority whip. But Jones, who started his House career in 1995, said the American people don't want to see a member of leadership with \"skeletons in their closets.\"\nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., remains the front-runner to replace John Boehner as speaker . The 247 Republican members will make their choice for speaker Thursday (Oct. 8) and then the full House will vote Oct. 29. Some conservative GOP members are holding out the possibility that they will withhold their support for McCarthy, raising the possibility he might not get the majority (218 of all 435 House members vote) needed to get the top House leadership post.\nIf McCarthy is elected speaker Oct. 29, Republicans will choose a new majority leader, with current majority whip, Rep. Steve Scalise of Jefferson, running against Rep. Tom Price, a Georgia physician. It's possible that another candidate or candidates could emerge before House Republicans gather to choose their new majority leader. Should Scalise be elected majority leader, members will vote a replacement for him as majority whip.\nIn his letter dated Tuesday to House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., Jones said he doesn't want a new scandal to detract from Republican legislative efforts \"with all the voter distrust of Washington felt around the country.\"\n\"Some of the most difficult times have been when our Republican leaders or potential Republican leaders must step down because of skeletons in their closets,\" Jones wrote. \"We've seen it with former Speaker Newt Gingrich and Rep. Bob Livingston (the Metairie Republican) who ran for speaker in 1998.\"\nLivingston was selected to lead the Republicans and replace Gingrich as speaker after the 1998 congressional elections, and was leading impeachment efforts against then-President Bill Clinton when Hustler Magazine prepared to report that he had an affair outside his marriage. Livingston acknowledged the infidelity and on the day the House approved articles of impeachment dealing with Clinton's denial of sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Livingston said he would resign, expressing hope Clinton would follow his example.\nReached by email Wednesday, Livingston declined to comment on Jones' letter.\nJones said he wants the House Republican conference to discuss his concerns before electing its new leaders.\n\"The House leadership team holds great responsibility, and the individuals on the team should be able to serve with the utmost integrity,\" Jones wrote. \"As members of the House of Representatives, we need to be able to represent the will of the people unhindered by potentially embarrassing scandals.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:49:27.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
