(John Sleezer/The Kansas City Star via Associated Press) October 5 at 7:27 PM Regarding the Sept. 30 front-page article “ A vigorous defense of Planned Parenthood ”:\nFull disclosure, please. Regarding those who would vote to defund Planned Parenthood, how many of them have adopted a child that would have otherwise been aborted? How many children do they have? How many have had a vasectomy? How many wives or mistresses have had sterilizations?\nPerhaps only women should be allowed to vote on this decision. If men could become pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament! Nothing in the Bible discusses this issue.\nE.E. Notar , Lewes, Del.\n●\nThe article “ A vigorous defense of Planned Parenthood ” made very clear that there is no defense for what Planned Parenthood does.\nPlanned Parenthood kills more than 300,000 human beings every year through abortions and has killed more than 5 million in this country since 1970 . No moral defense exists for the destruction of human life on this scale. Killing human beings at any stage of our lives violates our rights and is therefore, by definition, a crime.\nJoe Armour , Annandale", "external_links": ["http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/human-life-and-dignity/abortion/upload/Cardinal-DiNardo-Letter-on-Defunding-Planned-Parenthood.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:53:51.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
