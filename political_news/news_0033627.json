(AP) â€” The northern Colorado college town of Fort Collins has retained a ban on women going topless, rejecting efforts to join a movement to remove such indecency laws.\nThe city council voted unanimously Tuesday evening to reject changes to a law that prohibits the display of female breasts.\nThe hometown of Colorado State University did amend its indecency code to allow public breastfeeding. But otherwise it remains a $250 fine for a woman over the age of 10 to display her breast \"below the top of the nipple.\"\n\"It just doesn't seem right\" to allow female toplessness, said Councilman Ray Martinez. \"People are going to say, we go to Fort Collins and run around topless. And I don't want that.\"\nOther cities, including Denver, New York and the nearby college town of Boulder, have removed all gender-specific language from indecency codes. The city of Chicago is facing a federal lawsuit from a woman challenging as discriminatory her $150 fine for participating in a 2014 \"Go Topless Day\" protest near Lake Michigan.\nIndecency codes are largely local, with very few states having laws on the books banning female breast exposure.\nSupporters of the Fort Collins change said the indecency change wouldn't lead to an explosion of women going topless in public. They called the proposal a simple attempt to remove gender bias from a law that isn't enforced anyway. Fort Collins officials say they're not sure the last time any woman was charged with indecency for displaying her breasts in public.\n\"Equal but different is not really equal,\" said Samantha Six, who pushed for the change.\nBut opponents packed Tuesday's hearing to warn of increased sexual assaults, even car accidents, if women were allowed to display their breasts.\n\"Allowing women to dress or undress the same as men doesn't create equality,\" said resident Katie Peters.\nAnother resident voicing a common opinion in the room said that college women in Fort Collins could be damaged by having a topless photo taken and posted online.\n\"We have the freedom to go topless at home,\" David Harris said.\n___\nKristen Wyatt can be reached at http://www.twitter.com/APkristenwyatt\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
