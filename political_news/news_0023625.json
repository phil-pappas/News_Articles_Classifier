John Kasich a warm reception.\nThe No Labels Problem Solver Convention -- which featured presidential candidates from both major parties in an effort to promote bipartisan solutions -- was Kasich’s first appearance over the next four days in the state holding America’s first presidential primary in less than four months.\nKasich spent a good part of the speech dropping broad hints of a budget-balancing proposal he will officially unveil on Thursday on the final stop of his longest tour yet of a state he considers vital to his 2016 chances. After climbing as high as second in a New Hampshire poll, he has now tumbled to as low as seventh.\n>> Keep up on political news and insights with our Dispatch Politics newsletter.

But he said a balanced budget cannot be achieved without revamping Medicaid, Medicare and other entitlements. He also pledged to tackle defense spending and move federal programs back to the states, such as federal highway funding. And his proposal will include a proposed constitutional amendment that would require a balanced federal budget except in cases of national emergency.\nKasich told reporters afterward that his plan will offer a framework with details to be filled in during coming weeks.\nA key theme to Kasich’s talk was that while other candidates may propose action, he actually has pulled it off either as a budget-balancing, defense-reforming congressman or in nearly five years as Ohio’s governor.\nHe had ready-made stories for one of the main emphases of No Labels -- reaching across the political aisle -- but added, “You can never compromise beyond where you can look yourself in the eye.”\nOne of the jobs he will tackle as president, Kasich said, is to “reignite the spirit of who we are as Americans.”\nKasich’s speech, which followed an appearance earlier on Monday afternoon in Grand Rapids, Mich., took place about six hours after one delivered by Donald Trump. The real-estate tycoon said he doesn’t think he’s divisive, just willing to say what no other candidate has the courage to say.\n“I don’t want to necessarily be politically correct all the way down the line,” he told the conference.\n“I see politicians, they’re afraid to say anything because it’s not politically correct. And they know the answers and refuse to give them because they’re not going to be politically correct. And I’m going to have to be who I am,” Trump said.\nAt least six security people on the edge of the stage in the middle of the crowd kept a watchful eye on the crowd during Trump’s speech. One man who said he merely wanted to get close to ask a question was hauled from the scene.\n“I really don’t believe this is going to be about whether I’m a nice person,\" Trump said. \"I think people are fed up with incompetent politicians who don’t get things done.”\nHe added, “We need smart, tough people. Because we can’t go out like this.”\nThe billionaire said he has a new book coming out in a few weeks titled Crippled America . He said he rejected a good picture of him smiling for the cover, replacing it with one of him looking mean because “I’m angry with what’s happened to the country.”& amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; amp; lt; /p>\nTrump said he already has lined up numerous experts who will work free on trade deals and other obstacles facing the country. He said he also would work without a salary as president.\nIn response to a question that drew cheers, Trump also rejected contentions that some of his comments have been anti-women.\n“I respect women incredibly,” he said, adding that he gave more top jobs to women – including overseeing the building of Trump Tower – than anyone in the construction industry.\nHe promised pay equity for women: “You’re going to make the same if you do as good a job.”\nTrump was his usual blunt self several times during his 38-minute talk and Q&A.\nFor instance, on Obama’s appearance on Sunday night on 60 Minutes : “He bombed, very simply.”\nOn the obligation to campaign contributors of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush: “Believe me, they are puppets.”\nAbout honoring veterans: “Our vets are being treated worse than immigrants coming into this country.”\nNew York City’s LaGuardia Airport? He called it “like a third-world country.”\nAnd because Nabisco put a plant in Mexico, “I’m never going to eat another Oreo again.\"\ndrowland@dispatch.com \n@darreldrowland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:02:45.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
