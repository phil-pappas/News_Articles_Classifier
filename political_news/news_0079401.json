However, moonbat beer is a little different :\nA municipal water utility in Portland, Oregon, recently held a contest to see who could brew the tastiest beer from what was once wastewater — i.e. the stuff that runs off our farms and goes down our toilets — and we got to try it. …\nThe contest was designed to raise awareness about water scarcity…\nIn Portland, where it rains all the time. They should have held the contest one state to the south, where California bureaucrats have managed to create a water shortage .\nBut moonbattery is about making a pageant of allegedly noble intentions, not about dealing effectively with actual problems.\nBarks Clean Water Services spokesman Mark Jockers:\n“Let’s embrace the yuck factor!”\nSo the folks at Business Insider drank the sewer beer. Some of them tried the amber ale:\nWe thought the beer smelled fruity…\nNot surprising, considering that it was brewed by fruitcakes.\nOthers tried the helles:\nOne of them said the flavor was pretty generic, like Bud Light or Coors Light.\nNot surprising either, considering that mass market light beer is undrinkable.\nMost of them didn’t like the taste of the Helles, citing its cloudiness and weird aftertaste.\nThey need to get this beer to market at once. Trendy moonbats will guzzle it by the gallon to prove how much they care about the thirsty polar bears.\nTheoretically it doesn’t matter where the water in your beer comes from, because all the water on the planet his been around for millions of years and has been recycled many times before. By the same token, there is no water shortage. Hollyweird starlets who brush their teeth in the shower so as to preserve precious water may be surprised to learn that when water goes down the drain, it doesn’t pour into outer space. We have the same amount of water we have always had, so there is no need to make a foolish point by drinking beer brewed from sewage. All we need to do is get Democrats out of power so that water will be managed efficiently, rather than flushed out to sea on behalf of a minnow.\nSipping sewage.
