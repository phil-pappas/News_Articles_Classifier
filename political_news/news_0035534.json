(AP) â€” Presidential hopeful Hillary Rodham Clinton is telling black Alabama Democrats that she'd champion voting rights in the White House. She says Republicans are dismantling the progress of the civil rights movement.\nClinton blasted Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley for closing driver's license offices in 31 counties where most residents are African-American. Alabama requires photo identification to vote.\nThe Democratic front-runner says, \"This is a blast from the Jim Crow past.\"\nClinton also mocked Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush for their opposition to restoring Voting Rights Act provisions the Supreme Court struck down.\nAbout 700 people attended a luncheon for the state's largest black Democratic Party caucus.\nAfrican-Americans are crucial to Clinton's campaign. They will likely make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate in several Southern states.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
