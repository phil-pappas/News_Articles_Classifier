Emmanuel Kofi Fianu as the new Catholic Bishop of the Ho Diocese in the Volta Region over the weekend. \nHe said, 'We need to educate every citizen of Ghana using the churches, using the mosques, using every other spiritual facility and arena, to let us be aware that we have a role to play. \n'We must be talking to our church members working as teachers, working as policemen, working as tax people, working as politicians about their responsibility to the country,' Mahama said. \nHe lamented that 'corruption has become quite a serious problem. The government is ready to do everything about it, but very often the information that you need to gather and prosecute may not be as clear as that.' \nAppointment of Ho Diocese Bishop Monsignor Fianu, who is an SVD priest, was elected by Pope Francis in July 2015 as successor to the first Ghanaian Bishop of the then Keta-Ho Diocese, and now Ho Diocese, Most Rev. Francis Kofi Anane Lodonu. \nBishop Emeritus Lodonu was in charge of the Roman Catholic Church in the Volta Region for over 40 years. \nThousands of Catholic faithful across the Volta Region and the country thronged the Jubilee Park in Ho to witness this special event. The dignitaries included members of the Ghana Catholic Bishops Conference, Traditional leaders including president of the Volta Regional House of Chiefs, Togbe Afede XIV. \nTop government officials led by the Deputy Chief of Staff, Johnny Osei and the Speaker of Ghana’s Parliament Rt. Hon. Edward Doe Adjaho were also present. \nAlso in attendance were missionary priests, bishops and other religious leaders from parts of Africa, including Togo, Benin and Nigeria among others. \nThe Superior General of the Society of the Divine Word (SVD) at the Vatican was also present to support his member, who until his appointment, was the Secretary General of the SVD. \nConsecration of New Bishop The principal consecrator at the ceremony was His Eminence Peter Cardinal Appiah Turkson, Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Coast in Ghana and the current president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace at the Vatican. \nHe was assisted by the Apostolic Nuncio to Ghana, Most Rev. Jean-Marie Speich and Bishop Emeritus of Ho Most Rev. Francis Lodonu. \nThe new bishop of Ho Diocese, Most Rev. Emmanuel Fianu, addressing the congregants, expressed gratitude to everyone for their well wishes and prayers and called for their support. He also commended the good works of his immediate-past predecessor. \nArchBishop of Accra, Most Rev. Palmer Buckle, delivering the homily of the day, talked about the good shepherd, as he expressed confidence in the Bishop elect to lead the Lord’s flock in the Ho diocese. \nFrom Fred Duodu, Ho ( [email protected] )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:19:06.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
