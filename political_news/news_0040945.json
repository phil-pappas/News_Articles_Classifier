The school contacted police, who ultimately chose not to charge Ahmed with having a hoax bomb, though he was suspended from school.\nObama subsequently Tweeted an invitation to Ahmed and said the U.S. should inspire more kids like him to enjoy science.\nAhmed said he was grateful for the president's support and said he's OK with the nickname that so many have given him over the past few weeks — \"clock kid.\"\nHe said the lesson of his experience is: \"Don't judge a person by the way they look. Always judge them by their heart.\"\nAhmed's family is looking at several options for a new school. He hopes to eventually go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and become an engineer.\nBefore the White House event, he got to tour labs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nThe White House invitation has brought some backlash. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz complained that Obama didn't give law enforcement officials the same respect he's giving Ahmed. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday the president has made clear in many settings the respect he has for law enforcement officers.\nEarnest said several hundred people will attend the astronomy event, so he doubted there would be any one-on-one meeting between the president and Ahmed.\nThe students visiting the South Lawn of the White House on Monday night will get the chance to explore samples of rocks from the moon, Mars and various meteorites. They will also meet with astronauts and peer at the planets and stars from telescopes.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
