Sipe credited Chamberlain with pulling off an \"extraordinarily complex\" top-to-bottom redesign of Oregon teacher licenses to simplify what had been three sets of rules from different eras. \nThe new licensing system starts Jan. 1 and focuses on the specific courses each educator is allowed to teach. It will give schools greater flexibility to deploy teachers to different grade levels while ensuring that teachers only teach courses whose content they have mastered, Chamberlain said. \nSipe said Chamberlain also helped increase the standards for Oregon's teacher preparation programs and instituted the nation's first online on-demand teacher licensing tests to lower costs and increase convenience for prospective teachers. \nThe agency, called the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission , came under fire more than once during Chamberlain's tenure. It faced criticism for long lag times in issuing teacher licenses and for l ess-than-airtight disciplining of educators accused of sexual contact with children or other serious misdeeds. \nChamberlain acknowledged that her agency was at times overwhelmed because it operated on licensing fees alone. That limited the number of employees it could hire and at times left workers swamped, she said. Wait times for licenses and for teacher discipline at times were unreasonable, including in 2007 and in the past year, she said. \nShe is proud, she said, that she persuaded the 2015 Legislature to raise licensing fees so that commission workers will be able to issue licenses issued promptly and investigate alleged wrongdoing by educators right away. \nInappropriate secret deals were struck with some teachers accused of serious misdeeds , allowing them to resign quietly and get jobs in other schools, Chamberlain said. But they were not made by the commission or known to commission leaders, she said. Rather, they were done by school districts and teachers unions without the commission knowing, she said. The Oregonian deserves credit for bringing the practice to light and getting it ended, Chamberlain said. She strongly supported the 2009 law that outlawed such deals. \n\"When an educator has been accused of that kind of misconduct, it is never appropriate to allow them to continue to practice,\" she said. \nChamberlain said she wants to retire after 29 years working for public agencies in Oregon because the demands of her job are so intense. But she said she hopes to resume working, on at least a part-time basis, after taking a short break. \nThe practical details of how teachers and other educators should put ethics into practice on the job remain a big interest, Chamberlain said. She would like to research and write about the topic, using Oregon cases to flesh out examples of ethical and unethical practices, to help guide teachers and professors who prepare teachers, she said. \nChamberlain said she thinks Oregon schools of education generally do a fine job preparing future teachers and that some programs are exceptionally effective. It is possible colleges need to improve the training they give teachers on how to teach young children to read, she said. At the behest of the Legislature, she has launched a work group that is examining that issue. \nSipe said the commission will likely conduct a national search for its next executive director. The appointed board will discuss that at its next meeting in November, she said. \n-- Betsy Hammond", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:48:35.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
