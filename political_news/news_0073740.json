Uganda President Yoweri Museveni attended the event. \nPresident Museveni said the two countries will expand their markets to increase business opportunities. \nHe said Uganda is ready to work with Kenya to implement projects that will help reduce the cost of doing business in the two countries. \n“Kenya has made remarkable progress in the energy sector and we are going to work together in implementing projects aimed at helping the people,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:21:52.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
