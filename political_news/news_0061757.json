One would renew a public safety levy, while the other would replace an existing library levy with one costing the owner of a typical house $14 more per year. (Dana Tims/Staff) Comments \"These are core services,\" Washington County Sheriff Pat Garrett said. \nWashington County is hoping its decade-long winning streak at the polls remains intact Nov. 4, when ballots are tallied for a pair of five-year levies affecting law enforcement and libraries. \n\"We're optimistic, but we aren't taking anything for granted,\" Washington County Sheriff Pat Garrett said. \"Nothing is assured until the votes are counted.\" \nGarrett is promoting Measure 34-236, which would renew a levy due to expire June 30, 2016. The levy provides 16 percent of the funding for all of the county's criminal justice functions, he said. \n\"These are core services,\" Garrett said. \"And they affect, potentially, just about everyone in the county.\" \nThe measure would levy 42 cents per $1,000 assessed value -- an amount identical to the existing law enforcement levy. That means typical homeowners with an assessed value of $255,408 would pay about $107 annually, according to the county assessor's office. \nGarrett gave several examples of why he thinks renewing the levy is critical to maintaining public safety. \nFirst, he said, the levy funds an entire 60-bed housing unit in the Washington County Jail. Since the jail is at or near capacity virtually all the time, the levy's defeat would force jail administrators to release far more offenders early due to overcrowding. \nIt also pays a portion of the salaries of several prosecutors in the district attorney's office, as well as an equal number of those working in the county's parole and probation office, he said. \nIn addition, it will help maintain current staffing levels in the county's Juvenile Justice Department. \"And that's not an insignificant item,\" Garrett said. \"In the past five years, juvenile crime is down 25 percent in Washington County. We attribute a lot of that to the flexibility that the levy brings us.\" \nFinally, the law enforcement levy has enabled the sheriff's office to expand its Mental Health Response Team , which pairs a patrol deputy with a trained psychologist to respond to situations involving emotional trauma and crisis, he said. \n\"The number of calls to 911 relating to mental illness have increased dramatically,\" Garrett said. \"With the levy's help, we now have a way of ensuring that one of our most vulnerable populations can be effectively treated.\" \nSara Wade, executive director of the Domestic Violence Resource Center of Washington County, said Monika's House , the county's only domestic violence shelter, would likely have to close if the levy is defeated. \n\"We have to turn away 80 to 90 people per month looking for shelter as it is,\" Wade said. \"So in that sense, the levy is absolutely critical in terms of our being able to serve victims of domestic violence.\" \nShe noted that the shelter is one of the few in Oregon that accepts not only women and children, but battered men, as well. \nProposed library levy : \nMeasure 34-235 asks voters to replace a local option levy set to expire at the end of June. If approved, it would increase the amount paid by a typical homeowner from the current rate of 17 cents per $1,000 assessed value to 22 cents. \nBased on information from the county assessor's office, the owner of a house assessed at $255,408 would pay $56 per year if the levy is approved. That's an increase of $13 per year from the current, 17-cent rate. \nThe expiring levy provides about one-third of the support of member libraries of Washington County Cooperative Library Services . Those are located in Banks, Beaverton, Cedar Mill, Cornelius, Forest Grove, Garden Home, Hillsboro, North Plains, Sherwood, Tigard, Tualatin and West Slope. If approved, it would add Aloha Library. \n\"Aloha has been trying to become a member of the cooperative, but until now they've not found the financing,\" said Jodi Nielsen, the cooperative's senior program educator. \"So for them, this will be a pretty big deal if it passes.\" \nThe proposed rate increase would be the first since 2006, Nielsen said. It's needed now as a way to expand services such as resources for job-seekers, help with library expansions in Bethany, Cornelius and Hillsboro, enable new book purchases and maintain children's literacy and reading programs that average more than 280,000 child visits per year, she said. \nPolling done by the county in January showed strong support for both proposed levies, said Philip Bransford, a county spokesman. A random telephone survey of likely voters showed the law enforcement levy attracting 76 percent yes votes, with the library levy at 71 percent. \n\"But at this point,\" he said, \"it's really up to the voters to make their decision.\" \n-- Dana Tims", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:00:55.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
