ADVERTISEMENT Schapiro: The Republican Terry McAuliffe BY JEFF E. SCHAPIRO Richmond Times-Dispatch Richmond Times-Dispatch \nAn affable Irish-Catholic guy from the Northeast is drawn to Washington by the political bug. He achieves power, fame and wealth. He heads a national political party. He and his family settle into a comfortable life in the Virginia suburbs. \nAfter years of counseling this candidate and that, he becomes one in his adoptive state, believing he can do as well, if not better, than the people he advises. His first go for office is memorable but unsuccessful. He hopes the second time is the charm. \nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe? \nNope. \nRepublican Ed Gillespie. \nGillespie this past week became a candidate for governor; perhaps, with deft maneuvering, the 2017 consensus nominee of a benighted Virginia Republican Party. \nHe was considering running, having come within a whisker last November of snagging a U.S. Senate seat from a supposedly unbeatable Democratic incumbent, Mark Warner. It was friend and fellow Republican Mark Obenshain’s decision against a bid for governor that pushed Gillespie from prospective to actual candidate. \nDidn’t see that coming. \nIn barely losing to Warner, Gillespie — a creature of D.C., having led the Republican National Committee, worked for Republican presidents and Republican presidential candidates and amassed a fortune as a political fixer — had dibs on another try for Senate in 2018. Democrat Tim Kaine would be running for a second term, as Warner just did, in an off-year. Turnout would plummet, magnifying the voting strength of the conservative Republican base. \nA funny thing happened on the way to a Senate do-over. \nCheered by Gillespie’s near-upset, Republican activists urged him to think about the governorship, an office always decided in a low-turnout election. Gillespie demurred, believing Obenshain had the right of first refusal because of his 126-vote near-miss for attorney general in 2013. \nBesides, had it not been for Obenshain’s potent organization — it was the core of Gillespie’s in 2014 — Gillespie might not have been viable for Senate. Gillespie waited for Obenshain to make up his mind. \nWhen he did — Obenshain confirmed Monday that he wouldn’t run — Gillespie was in. \nFor a Republican Party largely in retreat at the statewide level since 2006, the Gillespie candidacy — in the textbook sense — may hold promise. \nFirst, he has won the hearts and minds of the GOP grass roots — once. Gillespie was nominated for the Senate at a contested convention dominated by anti-taxers, abortion opponents, gun- and property-rights zealots, tea partyers, and libertarians. Many are deeply suspicious of Establishment Republicans. Gillespie is one, down to the cut of his dark-blue suits and the blue-chip corporate clients to whom he dispenses so-called strategic communications advice. \nGillespie prevailed at the sparsely attended convention against three little-known opponents. Facing Ken Cuccinelli would be another contest altogether. Heartthrob of the hard right, and a fright to nearly everyone else, Cuccinelli narrowly lost to McAuliffe for governor. That Republicans prefer to nominate their statewide ticket in 2017 by convention attests to Cuccinelli’s enduring sway over party activists. \nIn the run-up to 2013, Cuccinelli engineered the switch from an open-to-all primary to a members-only convention with an under-the-radar takeover of the State Central Committee, the governing body of the Virginia GOP. Cuccinelli’s people are still in command. \nCuccinelli isn’t saying anything much about another campaign for governor, other than that he and wife, Teiro, are talking about it. Frank Wagner, a state senator from Virginia Beach who is expected to survive a scare for re-election, talks himself up for the Republican nomination. Another prospect is Rob Wittman, the 1st District congressman. He knows something about crowded conventions. When he was first nominated, Wittman overcame nine opponents across six ballots. \nSecond, Gillespie is a fundraising monster. He could be even scarier in a governor’s race, in which there are no limits on contributions. \nWith Karl Rove, Gillespie was the brains behind the American Crossroads super PAC and affiliates that raised and spent about $325 million in the 2012 election. \nGillespie also led the Republican State Leadership Committee, a cash register for state candidates. It has already steered nearly $500,000 to Virginia legislative candidates this year. In the closing days of the 2005 election, it made a single contribution of more than $2 million to Bob McDonnell, who would win for attorney general by fewer than 400 votes. \nGillespie was chairman of McDonnell’s gubernatorial campaign in 2009 and, for six months until June 2007, head of the perennially cash-strapped Virginia Republican Party, bringing fundraising contacts to both. Gillespie also was treasurer, beginning in 2005, of then-Sen. George Allen’s political action committee. \nThese are Virginia data points on a résumé that, like McAuliffe’s, is still mostly national. But Gillespie has affirmed his Virginia bona fides with his Senate candidacy last year and about 40 appearances this year on behalf of legislative and local candidates. \nThird, Gillespie may have entree to Northern Virginia, a heavily Democratic vote trove that can be sweet on its own. Republicans may have an opportunity there because the presumed Democratic nominee, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam, isn’t local talent. Born on the rural Eastern Shore, he practices medicine in urban Norfolk, in politically competitive Hampton Roads. \nNortham carried Northern Virginia against the hapless E.W. Jackson. The Democrat who has roots there, Attorney General Mark Herring, isn’t running for governor to seek a second term. He’s from Loudoun County. \nGillespie lives next door, in Fairfax County. It’s increasingly blue. But perhaps Gillespie, a professional talker who does earnest well, can play to local pride. \nA Northam-Gillespie matchup would be about old Virginia and new Virginia. \nNortham has deep roots in the state. His family is ancient and influential. He’s a VMI graduate, an Army veteran of the first Gulf War and a doctor who specializes in pediatric neurology. He’s low-key and keenly competitive. His politics are new Virginia: He supports Medicaid-for-Obamacare and is strong on gay and abortion rights. \nGillespie’s politics may seem old Virginia: He’s against Obamacare; resists gun control; and opposes abortion. But Gillespie, like the majority of the state’s residents, is a come-here. He’s a South Jersey boy, a son of Eire with a luminous smile and a flair for blarney. \nSound familiar? McAuliffe migrated from upstate New York to Washington, where he prospered at the intersection of big business and big government as a Clintonista extraordinaire and chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \nIt got McAuliffe to Richmond. Will it prove a charm the second time? \nContact Jeff E. Schapiro at(804) 649-6814. His column appears Wednesday and Sunday. Watch his video column Thursday on Richmond.com.
