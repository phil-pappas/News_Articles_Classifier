Voice of America (VoA) reported that the head of the Reporters Without Borders Africa desk, Clea Kahn-Sriber, condemned the killings and accused the police for the tragic event.\n“It seems to be that the police were conducting a raid in the neighborhood, and they broke down the door of this journalist and killed him, his wife and two children in a completely arbitrary way,” said Kahn-Sriber. Police on the other hand, claimed that the family was killed by the abductors.\nVoA reported that according to witnesses and officials, the local police does multiple disarmament raids in some residential areas in the capital of Burundi which are described as anti-government.\nLast month, the U.S. State Department called on Burundi’s government to disarm all militias, including the ruling party’s youth wing, the Imbonerakure, to prevent a further escalation of violence.\nOn Thursday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the killings. Two days after the event, Ban’s spokesperson issued a statement saying:\n“The Secretary-General extends his deepest condolences to the families of the victims. He urges Burundian authorities to undertake a rigorous and prompt investigation into the circumstances and motives behind these despicable crimes in order to ensure that their perpetrators are brought to justice.”\nAccording to the United Nations, Burundi is facing its deepest political crisis since the end of the civil war , after President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to run for a controversial third term in office. A broad array of actors warned that his attempt was unconstitutional and contrary to the spirit of the 2000 Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement for Burundi.\nSince April 2015, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has registered more than 130 killings and hundreds of cases of arbitrary arrest and detention.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:09:25.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
