Jerry Brown signed legislation Monday making California the fifth state in the nation to recognize a right to die for terminally ill patients, saying the emotionally charged bill forced him to consider \"what I would want in the face of my own death.\"\nBrown, a lifelong Catholic and former Jesuit seminarian, said he acted after discussing the issue with many people — including a Catholic bishop and two of his own doctors.\n\"I do not know what I would do if I were dying in prolonged and excruciating pain. I am certain, however, that it would be a comfort to be able to consider the options afforded by this bill,\" the governor wrote in a signing statement that accompanied his signature.\nTerminally ill patients will be allowed to legally end their lives using doctor-prescribed drugs. The measure applies only to mentally sound people and not those who are depressed or impaired.\nState lawmakers passed the bill last month. A previous version failed despite the highly publicized case of Brittany Maynard, 29, a California woman with brain cancer who moved to Oregon to end her life.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T11:09:38.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
