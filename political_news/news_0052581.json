The proposal, called Connect NC, targets investments in North Carolina's roads, education, public health, parks and military, from small farming towns to large cities. Chris Seward cseward@newsobserver.com i Order Reprint of this Story RALEIGH \nGov. Pat McCrory on Wednesday signed into law a referendum asking North Carolina voters to approve borrowing $2 billion for major repairs and expansions. \nThe governor pushed hard to get the bond issue through the legislature, along the way losing $1 billion of what he originally sought, including funding for transportation projects, and picking up financing for more higher education initiatives. \nVoters will be asked to approve the borrowing in the March 15 primary election. Between now and then, the administration will launch a statewide effort to sway people to support the bond, which McCrory calls Connect N.C. \n“Our major responsibility in leadership is continued economic development while also protecting the quality of life,” McCrory said at a bill-signing ceremony at the Golden LEAF Biomanufacturing Training and Education Center at N.C. State University. \nAbout 150 people attended the event, including dozens of state dignitaries in education, politics and business. \nAbout half of the bond would go to higher education: $980 million for buildling and repairs in the UNC system that focus on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and on medical sciences and business. Another $350 million would go to the state’s community college system for renovations. \nAgricultural research would be a big winner, with $85 million aimed at a Plant Sciences Research Complex at NCSU, and $94 million for a lab at the Agricultural and Consumer Sciences Building for veterinary, food, drug and motor fuel testing. \nAgriculture Commissoner Steve Troxler said the state’s agricultural interests, including the N.C. Farm Bureau, have committed to support the bond. \nThe National Guard would receive $70 million to build regional centers in Burke, Guilford and Wilkes counties. The N.C. Zoo would receive $25 million for upgrades, which was less than originally targeted, and 45 state parks would get $175 million. \nWater and sewer improvements in small towns and urban centers would amount to $309.5 million. \n“It’s time to invest again,” NCSU Chancellor Randy Woodson told the audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:36:58.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
