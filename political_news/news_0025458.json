A crowd of high school students drove Westboro Baptist Church protestors away from their school in Kansas City, Missouri last week where the hate group gathered to protest the recent election of a transgender girl as homecoming queen. Westboro showed up to picket Oak Park High School on Thursday, Oct. 1, but were met by a rally of students already gathered to support transgender homecoming queen Landon Patterson. Westboro was driven away from their picketing site by counter-protestors carrying signs with phrases such as \"Westboro Baptist Church need Jesus\" and chanting \"long live the queen!\"\"This isn't just about supporting Landon, this is about supporting all our students,\"Christina Palermo, an organizer for the rally, told a local news outlet. \"Landon is just their scapegoat.
