If it were, there would be a wing dedicated to plaintiff lawyers’ judicial bribery, evidence manipulation and fraud. It could include falsified chest X-rays used in asbestos and silica litigation. And a special “no injury” class actions exhibit might highlight recent costly consumer lawsuits like those claiming Subway’s “footlong” sandwiches aren’t always quite a full foot long .\nReaders should understand that the personal injury lawyers Nader’s museum lionizes are as self-interested as anyone else.\nTiger Joyce , Washington\nThe writer is president of the American Tort Reform Association.", "external_links": ["http://xml.apache.org/xslt", "http://nypost.com/2013/01/23/2-nj-men-sue-subway-for-short-footlong-subs-after-viral-snap-exposes-meaty-issue/", "http://www.radiologydaily.com/daily/chest-radiology/jury-radiologist-helped-fake-asbestos-claims/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:55:36.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
