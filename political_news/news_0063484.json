No people, who happen to be black, have applied to be police officers for North Yorkshire Police.2. No people, who happen to be black, were deemed suitable to be police officers for North Yorkshire Police.3. North Yorkshire police are racist and don't want black people to be part of their police officer group.It's very sad that people jump to the conclusion that number 3 is the reason. The level of scrutiny top policing figures are under nowadays means we all know options 1 and 2 are the cause - if number 3 was proven to be true, we'd have mass-scale rioting throughout the country. 4. Black people don't consider the police force as a career option because of X so North Yorkshire police ends up all white which doesn't reflect the population and this affects the way they are seen by the public and are able to do their job. I'd say it's good to find out what X is. Agreed but that is 1 i.e. black people don't apply (regardless of the reason). Apologies - I've just written the same thing in a different way and added a bit at the end. I think I just wanted to make the point at the end really. If the people in particular jobs isn't representative of the population I'd say it's worth finding out why. The police need to be respected by the population who in turn need to have confidence that they are doing a good job and if they have to deal with them they will be treated well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:35:15.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
