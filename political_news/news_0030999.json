Can military reject you entry for having criminal family members? I have a pretty clean family and most of them are ex military, Cops, or guards.

The check is to confirm your citizenship background, your personal criminal and mental health history, and to establish your security clearance level. Anything you try to hide which is discovered later will affect your continued service status. As long as your personal history is free from negative hits there shouldn't be any problems. If I stop responding it doesn't mean I've conceded the point or agree with you. It only means I've made my point and I don't mind you having the last word. Please wait a few minutes before \"quoting\" me. I often correct errors for a minute or two after I post before the final product is ready.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:46:39.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
