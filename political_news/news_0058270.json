In contrast, he said the UK was one of the few \"stable\" economies that was open to and keen to attract large-scale foreign investment.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E698/production/_86223095_hammondxi.jpg", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html", "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/china-state-visit-will-unlock-more-than-30-billion-of-commercial-deals"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:05:02.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
