According to local think tank NC Policy Watch, the new income tax rates mean that those earning $20,000 will actually pay an average of $7 more per year. The middle class  those making between $34,000 and $57,000 a year  will save an average of $44. And the top 1 percent of North Carolinians who make over $423,000 a year will save an average of $1,815. Top 1 percent of taxpayers continue to receive greatest tax cut in the Final Budget deal. In addition to the lowered income tax rate, North Carolina also lowered the state's corporate tax rate to 3 percent. But those tax cuts won't come into effect until the end of Fiscal Year 2016, meaning that a new crop of state legislators will be left to grapple with much less in tax revenue. It's estimated that by the time the new corporate tax rate comes into effect, the state will have $350 million less in revenue to spend on necessary public services like education, healthcare, roads and social services. OMG anyone make ANY sense of this being intelligent in managing a state with needs for infrastructure repair, dropping in educational rankings, faltering on increased number of uninsured persons?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:37:45.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
