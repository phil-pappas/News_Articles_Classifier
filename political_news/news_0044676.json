In fact, a city like Sao Paulo has more number of choppers than the total helicopters registered in India,\" Sathiyavathy said at an international conference on general aviation organised by the national chopper operator Pawan Hans here today.\nAs against a total of 257 choppers registered with the DGCA on January 1, 2012, the number increases to 265 in 2013.\nThese numbers came down to 261 in 2014 and as on October 15 this year the total number of choppers registered with the DGCA stood at 280, she said.\nShe assured the industry of providing easier norms for the operations without compromising with the safety, adding, \"we will perform the role of both a regulator and facilitator.\"\nShe, however, urged the chopper operators to provide their suggestions, which are put in the public domain prior to the finalization of any norm or regulation.\n\"We generally don't receive comments from the operators whenever they are put on the DGCA website. But once we finalise them then they raise hue and cry. I will request you to go through the various draft circulars before we finalise them and then we may go for necessary amendments based on these suggestions,\" she said.\nShe lamented that most of the chopper operators flying to and from religious places such as Vaishno Devi and Kedarnath are \"violating\" norms, though they are not serious in nature and urged them to safety regulations.\nSathivathy also said that rules regarding air ambulance operations are likely to be finalised in the next one to two weeks.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:42:09.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
