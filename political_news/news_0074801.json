Photo: Andrew Meares\nGovernment minister Kelly O'Dwyer has promised the plebiscite on marriage will be held \"shortly\" after the federal election.\nThe assistant treasurer has also dismissed any suggestion that Parliament would not legislate if the public voted for a change to the Marriage Act.\n\"It would be absolutely bizarre for the Parliament to ignore the will of the people,\" Ms O'Dwyer told ABC television on Sunday morning.\nLiberal Senator Eric Abetz has warned his colleagues against moving on same-sex marriage. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nThe issue of marriage equality raised its head again last week when Queensland Liberal Warren Entsch said he had already discussed a plan with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that involved passing contingent amendments to the Marriage Act to achieve same-sex marriage equality, but with the legal force of those changes reliant on majority public support via the plebiscite.\nAdvertisement The comments enraged opponents of changes to the Marriage Act within the Coalition.\nTasmanian Liberal senator Eric Abetz warned any move to prepare legislation ahead of the plebiscite would not help the party to heal following the dumping of Tony Abbott as prime minister.\nSenator Abetz was dumped from his cabinet position and role as leader of the government in the Senate following Mr Turnbull's ascension to the prime ministership.\nSenator Abetz said pre-empting the result of the plebiscite was an attempt to override the party room's decision to maintain the Coalition's support for traditional marriage until the next election.\n\"It seems a bit of a thought bubble and an ambush to boot,\" he said on Thursday.\nMs O'Dwyer said the process of setting up the plebiscite would be decided by the cabinet and then put to the party room.\nMs O'Dwyer, who supports changing the definition of marriage, said the plebiscite would be held \"shortly\" after the federal election, which is due later next year.\nFollow Stephanie Peatling on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/srpeatling?ref=hl"], "published": "2015-10-25T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:26:18.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
