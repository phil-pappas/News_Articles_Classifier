Right-wing radio host Laura Ingraham says President Obama should have skipped the Guinesss in Ireland because of the death and devastation wrought by the Missouri tornado.\n\"I don't want to make too much of this,\" Ingraham told Tuesday's \" Fox and Friends \" - before doing just that.\n\"I do think of the disconnect and maybe the tone-deafness, if you will, of that devastation from Missouri,\" she said. You have \"heartbreaking pictures and then President Obama lifting a glass of Guinness. There's something about that, that I think hits people in the gut â€¦Maybe the Irish part of the trip could have been put off to another day.\"\nThe political commentator also complained to the conservative morning show's hosts about a double standard in the \"liberal press.\"\n\"What would the liberal press be saying if this were President Bush , (and) we had let's say, another flood in New Orleans . You had people suffering, you had people dead and yet you had President Bush going to Scotland and Ireland.\"\nOn Monday, Obama downed his beer in four sips while visiting a pub in Moneygall , part of a six-day trip to Europe for the G8 summit in France .\nThe President announced on Tuesday he'd visit Missouri on Sunday to meet with victims of the storm, which has killed 117 people.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who are suffering at this moment,\" Obama said. \"And all we can do is let them know that all of America cares deeply about them and that we are going to do absolutely everything we can to make sure that they recover.\"\nPaul Morigi/WireImage U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama drink Guinness beer as they meet with local residents at Ollie Hayes pub in Moneygall, Ireland, on Monday. Meanwhile Eric Bolling , host of Fox Business Network 's \"follow The Money,\" expressed his dismay via twitter.\n\"Obama chugging 40s in IRE while tornadoes ravage MO,\" he wrote.\nObama isn't the only President to be nitpicked over how -and what he drank in Ireland.\nIn 1984, Ronald Reagan rejected Guinness and opted instead for a pint of Smithwicks , an Irish red ale. He didn't finish his glass.\nIn 1995, Bill Clinton also didn't finish his beer. Aides said he was reluctant to be photographed drinking anything alcoholic.\nAnd in 2006, George W. Bush, a recovering alcoholic, wasn't asked to pose with Guinness at all.\nWith News Wire Services\nashahid@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:07:19.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
