Poe’s lawyer George Garcia is anticipating a separate disqualification case once the senator has filed her certificate of candidacy (COC) for president. “Our reading is that in the end, what they want is to exclude the name of Sen. Grace Poe in the ballot because if it’s included, that would really be a problem for our opponents,” Garcia told ABS-CBN News. “They will try to have us disqualified before the printing of the ballots.” But the camp of petitioner Rizalito David insisted he had no intention of taking her out of the presidential race. Poe is running for president despite a disqualification case filed by David, who alleged that she’s not a natural-born Filipino. The senator has denied the allegation.
