An $8.7 million embezzlement case that authorities say began 17 years ago is nearing an end in Cincinnati. Hammes is scheduled to appear Friday before U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott for a change of plea hearing. He earlier pleaded not guilty to 75 counts of wire fraud and money laundering in a 2009 indictment potentially carrying decades in prison with conviction. (FBI via AP, FILE)\nAssociated Press Oct. 23, 2015 | 1:11 p.m. EDT + More By DAN SEWELL, Associated Press\nCINCINNATI (AP) â€” A Kentucky accountant who spent much of six years as a fugitive hiking the Appalachian Trail pleaded guilty Friday to wire fraud and agreed to pay back the money he embezzled in an $8.7 million case.\nFederal authorities agreed to drop 74 other counts from a 2009 indictment if James T. Hammes complies with conditions of their agreement that include explaining what happened to the millions diverted from his employer, a Cincinnati-based Pepsi-Cola bottling company, in a scheme the FBI said began 17 years ago.\nU.S. District Judge Susan J. Dlott accepted the plea after asking him a series of questions, including whether he was pleading guilty because he is, \"in fact, guilty.\"\n\"Yes, I am,\" the 53-year-old Hammes replied.\nDlott said she would sentence him after receiving results of a presentencing investigation that could take several months. She warned him that she could impose the maximum sentence of 20 years, even though his deal with the government called for less time. He said he understood.\nFBI agents arrested Hammes in May at an inn in Damascus, Virginia, during the annual Trail Days festival. The inn's operator and fellow hikers say he was known by the trail name Bismarck and was an affable, bushy-bearded hiking veteran who often took photos with other hikers along the more than 2,000-mile hiking trail stretching from Georgia to Maine.\nHammes' beard was trimmed neatly Friday, but his hair was to his shoulders when he was led into the courtroom, hands and legs shackled and wearing an orange-and-white jail jumpsuit. He told Dlott during questioning that he was taking medication for depression.\nAn assistant U.S. attorney, Emily Glatfelter, told the judge that Hammes agreed to pay $7.6 million in restitution, including $1 million to his employer's insurer. She said authorities had already seized other money and property from Hammes, including gift cards and more than $11,000 in cash he had when arrested and more cash found in a Fort Wayne, Indiana, storage unit.\nHammes' attorney, Zenaida Lockard, declined to comment after the hearing.\nHammes was called to Cincinnati by his bosses about the missing millions in February 2009, was questioned by the FBI, then disappeared. Hammes, a licensed pilot, had credited a successful investment in a software company for extra money that paid for scuba diving trips to the Caribbean, according to former in-laws who were interviewed in 2012 for an episode of the CNBC series \"American Greed.\"\nThe show is credited with leading to Hammes' arrest: A fellow Appalachian Trail hiker saw the episode and recognized the man he knew as Bismarck.\nTrail guidebook writer David Miller said he had a surprisingly high visibility on the trail. Susie Montgomery, operator of the inn where Bismarck often stayed, said he was a popular guest, and she was stunned when FBI agents showed up there to arrest him.\nHammes, a Milwaukee native, was the Lexington-based controller for the southern division of G&J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers Inc. FBI Special Agent Pamela Matson stated in an affidavit that G&J funds were deposited into an unauthorized account that played off the name of a vendor. Investigators found that Hammes opened the account in 1998, she said. He repeatedly wrote checks to the sham vendor account, then quickly moved the deposits into his own bank account, according to Matson.\nIn 2009, a federal grand jury indicted him on 75 counts, carrying potential sentences of decades in prison.\n___\nContact the reporter at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
