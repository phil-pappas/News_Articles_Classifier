(AP) â€” A Yakima School District construction project totaling more than $200 million is finally complete.\nThe Yakima Herald-Republic reports ( http://bit.ly/1Lqj8Qe ) the bulk of the money went toward constructing new Davis and Eisenhower schools. Additional funds were used to repay more than $3 million that the district had accrued in debt. Major repairs were also funded for several elementary schools, as well as Discovery Lab School and the old Stanton.\nDistrict officials say the Eisenhower project did go over its $108 million budget, but they are awaiting a final report to figure out by how much. After making several changes to the original plans for Davis, officials were able to keep costs for the project at about $98 million.\nThe project was approved by voters in 2009 with a $114 million bond.\n___\nInformation from: Yakima Herald-Republic, http://www.yakimaherald.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1Lqj8Qe", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:48:55.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
