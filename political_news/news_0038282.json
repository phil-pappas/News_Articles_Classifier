We shall not rest until every mother is confident that her daughter will have a better life than what she had.\"\nThe U.S. commitment follows Pakistan's recent promise to double education spending, enroll more girls in school and provide more female teachers.\nThe first lady leads a U.S. government effort to help more than 62 million adolescent girls around the world enroll and stay in school.\nMrs. Obama said since announcing the Let Girls Learn initiative this year, the U.S. has received pledges of more than $800 million. The sum includes $350 million from Japan, $200 million from South Korea and $200 million in a partnership with the United Kingdom.\nOfficials say girls in the developing world are less likely to attend primary school and more likely to face barriers to access and completing an education, which benefits themselves, their families and their communities.\nSince launching the program, Mrs. Obama has visited Japan, Cambodia and the United Kingdom to promote the initiative and recognize new partnerships.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Stacy A.
