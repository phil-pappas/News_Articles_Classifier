CannaGuard Security is a Portland, OR-based cannabis industry security company that serves marijuana businesses nationwide. From storefronts to grow ops, CannaGuard helps companies meet and understand the standards put in place by state regulators, and offers contingencies and preventative measures as safeguards against theft and robberies.\nNoah joined Ganjapreneur podcast host Shango Los to discuss some of the most common requests his company receives, major flaws in the logic used by regulators when defining mandated security protocols, and how cannabis retailers and producers can best prepare for worst case scenarios.\nStokes explains how one of the biggest regulatory flaws facing the cannabis industry is that — according to the Cole Memo, issued in 2013 by the Department of Justice — there are no firearms permitted on the premises of legal marijuana businesses. \"Their intent... was to keep the cartels from having a table full of gold AK-47s,\" Noah said. \"I get that, but having a retired police officer have a concealed-carry to protect himself in an all-cash marijuana business — that probably makes a little bit of sense.\"\nThe full podcast episode is available via iTunes or Ganjapreneur.com , where there are transcripts available of this and previous episodes.\nAbout Ganjapreneur:\nGanjapreneur launched in July 2014 and has since established a significant presence in the cannabis business world.
