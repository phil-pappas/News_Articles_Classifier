Anyone can be an agent of social change!\nToastzr provides reference listing and an exchange of services. These services facilitate issuing and buying a MEAL VOUCHER which allows people to share a meal for a good cause.\nHow does it work?\nTHE HOST CREATES MEAL VOUCHERS\nA restaurant, a hotel establishment or any other authorized institution issues a Meal Voucher for a cause already supported by the restaurant, or causes that mean a great deal to customers the host wants to attract or with whom he wants to foster loyalty.\nTHE GUEST BUYS THE MEAL VOUCHERS ON TOASTZR\nThe Meal Voucher will allow the guest to reduce the amount of his invoice received from the Host. The validation is securely done using the web or mobile application.\nTHE ORGANIZATION RECEIVES CONTRIBUTIONS\nWith minimal involvement of its staff, the organization will be getting additional revenues to better serve its community or beneficiaries.\nIn order to promote the efficient implementation of Toastzr, our funding needs are estimated at $200,000 out of a total of $333,955 . Our online Indiegogo campaign will give you all the details: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/toastzr-app-a-social-innovation-project/x/11992066#/story#en .\nYour contribution will help us to establish this social enterprise project in an efficient way. You will thus contribute to the development of a philanthropic culture in the province of Quebec .\n\"This is a bold project that will make it possible to fund community organizations and see a cooperation between organizations and restaurateurs.
