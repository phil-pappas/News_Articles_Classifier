The award is part of $22.9 million in planning grants to 24 states.\nCCBHCs will serve adults with serious mental illness, children with serious emotional disturbance and individuals with substance use disorders. The clinics will provide intensive, person-centered, multidisciplinary, evidence-based screen, assessment, diagnostics, treatment, prevention and wellness services.\n\"This grant will allow Pennsylvania to further bridge the gap between physical and behavioral health and enable us to treat all health issues equally and comprehensively,\" said DHS Secretary Ted Dallas . \"This approach builds trust with those we serve and the result will be better outcomes and better health.\"\nThe award is made possible through Section 223 of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, as part of a comprehensive effort to integrate behavioral health with physical health care.\nThe planning grant is the first phase of a two-phase process. When the planning phase ends in October 2016 , awardees will have an opportunity to apply to participate in a two-year demonstration program that will begin January 2017 .\n\"One of our department's main goals is to better serve more people in local communities,\" continued Secretary Dallas. \"We are eager to continue this process with the help of these funds.\"\nFor more information on the Planning Grants for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics, visit www.samhsa.gov/grants .\nFor more information on the Section 223 Demonstration Program for CCBHCs visit http://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/financing-and-reimbursement/223-demonstration-for-ccbhc.html.\nMedia Contact: Kait Gillis , 717.425.7606\n releases/pennsylvania-receives-886200-award-to-fund-planning-support-for-certified-community-behavioral-health-clinics-300164877.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC36194&Transmission_Id=201510221416PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC36194&DateId=20151022", "http://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/financing-and-reimbursement/223-demonstration-for-ccbhc.html", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-receives-886200-award-to-fund-planning-support-for-certified-community-behavioral-health-clinics-300164877.html", "http://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/financing-and-reimbursement/223-demonstration-for-ccbhc.html.", "http://www.samhsa.gov/grants"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:59:14.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
