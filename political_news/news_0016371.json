Rauner removed former Harrisburg mayor Eric Gregg from the Illinois Prisoner Review Board on Friday over allegations that Gregg made improper outside income. Those serving on the state parole board are not allowed to have outside jobs. \nGregg tells News 3 it's simply a misunderstanding resulting from an error by his attorney. Gregg says the attorney mistakenly put $45,000 in income under his name rather than his wife's name on a bankruptcy document. \nBoth Rauner and Gregg are Republicans. But party affiliation did not help his cause. Gregg tells News 3 the Rauner administration offered to let him resign. However, he says, he refused to resign on principle. He's also considering legal action against the state. \nGregg promises to sit down with News 3 on Monday afternoon for a one-on-one interview in which he says he'll provide documents proving he did nothing wrong.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:40:49.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
