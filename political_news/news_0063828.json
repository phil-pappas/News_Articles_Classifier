Jay Inslee said Friday that he's disappointed by the federal government's denial of Washington's request for aid to individuals affected by this summer's wildfires, and that he will create a new group responsible for coordinating restoration and recovery efforts. \nThis is the second time over two years that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied the state this type of assistance following massive fires. Inslee had been seeking help for the aid that would have allowed people affected by the fires to have access to assistance with home repairs, rental assistance and with replacing household items. Fires destroyed 146 homes and damaged another 476 this year. \nEarlier this week, federal dollars were made available to state and local governments as well as Native American tribes to repair or replace facilities damaged by wildfires and mudslides in August and September. \nInslee said that to help communities affected by the fires, he's forming a Wildland Fire Council, which, in addition to coordinating various efforts, will also assess policies and resources related to wildfire preparedness, response and recovery. The council will have its first meeting next month and will prepare a preliminary report by next July. \nAlso, the state Department of Commerce will be involved with issuing grants for emergency facilities, water system improvements, and disaster recovery services. \nInslee said that he will continue to fight for greater federal support for disaster recovery. He said that in the future, FEMA and federal officials need to reevaluate the criteria used in determining federal disaster assistance for individuals. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:11:29.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
