However, the 14-year-old girl clocked 12:27.8 seconds to win gold, beating defending champion and school mate Sejal Kadam (13:08.1s), who is two years senior to her. Quimcy D’Souza (14:12.3s) of St Agnes High School (Byculla) won bronze.\nSayali practices at the Naigaon Police Ground and is not accustomed to running on synthetic tracks. The hot afternoon sun also made it difficult for her as the track had heated up, but like a true warrior she persisted to cross the finish line. \"Around the halfway mark, I was dehydrated, but somehow kept running. I didn’t expect to win a medal, my aim was simply to finish the race. Spikes would have definitely helped me run faster here,” the standard IX student told Mid Day .\nMangesh, who earns between Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000 a month, couldn't witness his daughter's moment of glory as he was busy mending shoes in his shop in Dadar (East). He says his earnings are spent on the education of his two daughters and to take care of his wife, who suffers from ill health frequently. Proud of his daughter's achievement, Mangesh said he planned to gift her with her favourite chocolates on her special day.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:06:26.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
