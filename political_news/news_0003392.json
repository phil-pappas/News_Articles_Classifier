This can include various combinations of lower tax rates, less cronyism and picking winners and losers, simplification, greater transparency, and repealing economically destructive taxes or tax components. Our vision is that the tax system doesn't stand in the way of success. No state is there completely, but our index rankings are constantly pushing states to move in that direction.\"\nThe Tax Foundation compiles its State Business Tax Climate Index to annually rank the 50 U.S. states across more than 100 tax policy provisions. The Index synthesizes thousands of data points into an easy-to-use score, awarding highest marks to states with simple, neutral, and transparent pro-growth tax climates. Cross-state comparisons prove that excessive tax burdens can make the difference between growth and stagnation. Low rankings grab the attention of governors and legislators who seek out personalized help from Tax Foundation experts in crafting lasting policy solutions.\nIn the last three years, the Tax Foundation has been instrumental in shaping tax overhauls in North Carolina , Indiana , Ohio , Wisconsin , and several other states.\nWhat : The Tax Foundation's State Business Tax Climate Index named one of six finalists for Atlas Network's prestigious $100,000 Templeton Freedom Award\nWhen : Nov. 12, 2015, 7:30 p.m.\nWhere : Liberty Forum & Freedom Dinner closing ceremony â€“ Capitale, 130 Bowery, New York, NY 10013 (Bowery and Grand St.)\nPress Contact : Daniel.Anthony@AtlasNetwork.org or (202) 449-8441\nAwarded since 2004, the Templeton Freedom Award is named for the late investor and philanthropist Sir John Templeton.
