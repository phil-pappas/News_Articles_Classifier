Barriers also had been erected around the six-foot-tall monument to keep visitors from getting close to it. \nAfter years of legal wrangling, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled in June that the monument's display violates a constitutional prohibition on the use of public property to support a \"system of religion.\" \nThe original monument was smashed to pieces last year when someone drove a car across the Capitol lawn and crashed into it. \nA judge ordered the monument be removed by Oct. 12.
