Issue 2 would bar monopolies from being written into the state constitution. Issue 3 would legalize medical and recreational use of marijuana and open the door to a multimillion-dollar marijuana industry in Ohio. In addition, voters will decide 1,736 local issues, including taxes for police and fire services and school funding. Thousands of local offices in communities and school districts across Ohio also are up for a vote.\nInformation on the state issues is available on the Ohio secretary of state's website.
