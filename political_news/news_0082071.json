In a lengthy letter to skeptical Democrats on Thursday, Republicans on the House Select Committee on Benghazi said that a new trove of emails recently turned over by the State Department offers more details on Blumenthal's role advising Clinton while he developed a business venture that stood to profit from State Department decisions. Republicans plan to call in Blumenthal to testify for a second time about revelations in the emails, which Republicans intend to release next week.\nThe developments came as Clinton prepares to appear before the committee October 22 to testify under oath about her handling of Benghazi. The hearing— and how Clinton handles pointed questions from Republicans — is being closely watched as she campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination. Her emails exchanges with Blumenthal, some of which she forwarded to the attention of other high-ranking State Department officials, are likely to be a focus of intense Republican questioning.\nIn 2011, Blumenthal — a longtime Clinton friend who was barred by President Barack Obama from working for Clinton at State — wrote Clinton a series of intelligence memos on everything from the movement of Muammar Gaddafi’s forces to disputes within the Libyan rebel groups and their plans of attack.\nHe later admitted to GOP investigators that he did not write or even confirm the information he passed on to the nation’s top diplomat. Rather, Tyler Drumheller, a former CIA operative and Blumenthal business partner, did.\nDrumheller and Blumenthal were working with on a new Libya startup called Osprey, headed by retired Army General David Grange. They hoped the company would contract with the fledgling Libyan government to full fill its needs during the transition period, including floating hospitals and, apparently, police or military training.\nThe GOP cites emails in which Blumenthal encourages Clinton to boldly address Libya, back a no fly-zone, arm the rebels — or, have a private contractor do so.\nClinton sides with progressives against Obama trade deal By Gabriel Debenedetti\nIt is unclear exactly when Clinton learned about Blumenthal's business venture, but she knew as early as July 2011, at the height of the Libyan civil war, when Blumenthal first he mentioned Osprey and his connection to the company just before she was slated to meet with Lyban rebel leaders.\nClinton forwarded the email to a top aide and and wrote back to confirm receipt: “Got it. Will followup tomorrow. Anything else to convey?”\nRepublicans contend that her claim that the memos were “unsolicited” is bogus, arguing that half of her emails on Libya relate to Blumenthal in some way. Of the 1,800 new pages of emails they received, for example, 500 pages were with or about Blumenthal.\n“The fact that former Secretary Clinton relied so heavily on an individual for the Libyan intervention … is mind boggling,” writes Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.). “More disturbing is that at the same time Blumenthal was pushing Secretary Clinton to war in Libya, he was privately pushing a business interest of his own in Libya that stood to profit from contracts with the new Libyan government—a government that would exist only after a successful U.S. intervention in Libya that deposed Qaddafi.”\nThe letter represents Gowdy’s opening move to win-back the narrative that for the past week has played in Democrats’ favor. Clinton’s campaign, supporters and Democrats on the Hill have seized on partisan comments Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) made last week about how the panel’s work has hurt Clinton in the polls, raising questions about the committee’s posture that its work is apolitical.\nBlumenthal's attorney did not respond to request for comment, but he has said he did nothing wrong and was simply seeking to help out his friend Clinton with information he was getting from other acquaintances.\nClinton's campaign, which has criticized Republicans for using the Benghazi investigation for partisan attacks, also has not returned request for comment.\nDemocrats blasted Gowdy's letter as a defense mechanism following McCarthy’s remarks.\n“Clearly, Chairman Gowdy has had a terrible week,” said Ranking Member Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), to whom the letter is addressed. “Chairman Gowdy’s lengthy 13-page letter is a defensive and desperate attempt to save face, but it only proves that McCarthy’s statement is true… reveals his obsession with Secretary Clinton and no new information about the Benghazi attacks.”\nThe State Department earlier this year gave the panel more several hundred Libya emails and said that constituted all the documents the committee would need.\nWhen the panel later found several dozen new Libya-related emails with Clinton from a batch of subpoenaed Blumenthal documents, State admitted it did not give the committee all Libya documents but only those with specific links to Benghazi.\nRepublicans were furious and accused the department of stonewalling. State turned over the rest at the end of September.\nRepublicans say Clinton's acceptance of Blumenthal's unsolicited advice is “astonishing” — given that he wasn’t a State Department employee or an expert on Libya.\nThe panel says the emails reveal that Blumenthal was an individual who “tried to heavily influence the Secretary of State to intervene in Libya.” In his emails, for example, Blumenthal backed a no- fly zone in Libya before that pitch became a policy goal of the United States, the GOP says. Clinton told Blumenthal in February 2011 emails, according to the letter, that she was planning to go through the UN Security Council and “stay tuned.”\nHe later encouraged her to beef up the U.S. presence and go big in Libya, citing Obama’s lagging poll numbers on the matter as a reason to recalibrate.\n“The positive case for national interest in terms of removing [Gaddafi], establishing stability in North Africa, security democracy in Egypt and Tunisia, economic development, effect throughout Arab world and Africa, extending US influence, counter-balancing Iran, etc., should be obvious,” he wrote. “It is a vital national interest today, now, at this moment.”\nAlthough she sometimes expressed skepticism of Blumenthal’s advice, Clinton would often forward them on to her top staff, Jake Sullivan. On the email above, for example, she wrote back: “I agree with the need to keep the attack tempo up.”\n2016\nSid Blumenthal's raw advice for Hillary By Nahal Toosi\nRepublicans seized on Blumenthals’ financial interests for his motives.\n“It is … unsurprising that somebody who knew so little about Libya would suddenly become so interested in Libya and push an old friend in a powerful place to action—for personal profit,” the letter says.\nIn an April 8, 2011 email to he told Clinton that the Libyan rebel leaders were thinking about “hiring private security firms to help train and organize their forces.” Clinton, according to the letter, forwarded that message to Sullivan saying the \"idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered.”\nIn one of the new emails from May 5, 2011, Blumenthal complained about a “French economic grab.” “Major French corporations” were “looking to establish working relationships with the rebel leaders as the move toward becoming the new government of Libya,” his email read. He told Clinton they had secured a “memorandum of agreement” with the Libyan rebel leaders to give French firms “favorable consideration in all future business matters.”\nClinton wrote back to Blumenthal the next day: “Just met w TNC again, but signed no contracts! Thx.”\nThe GOP acknowledges, however, that it is unclear if Clinton knew about Blumenthal’s business venture at the time.\nThe first apparent mention of Osprey came in a July 14, 2011 email, when Blumenthal himself told her about his connection with the company just before she was slated to meet with some Libyan leaders.\nHe warned Clinton that she’d be meeting a Libya rebel leader that reached “an agreement with a US company” called Osprey, that wanted to provide field medical help, military training, organize supplies, and other logistics.\n“Grange can train their forces and he has drawn up a plan for taking Tripoli similar to the plan he helped develop that was used by the first wave of Special Forces in the capture of Baghdad,” the Blumenthal memo read, clarifying that the agreement was a private contract not involving NATO.\nThe memo tried to frame it as a win for the U.S., saying it “puts Americans in a central role without being direct battle combatants. “\nAnd, he gave the agreement his blessing: “Tyler, Cody and I acted as honest brokers, putting this arrangement together through a series of connections, linking the Libyans to Osprey and keeping it moving,” the memo reads.\nClinton answered back that she \"got it. Will followup tomorrow,\" and forwarded it to Sullivan: “Pls read and discuss w me at hotel [sic].”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:05:42.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
