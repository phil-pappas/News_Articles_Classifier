But since there is a need to do cost analysis and also to see whether we can have any other option rather than buying them, NHAI and NHIDCL will engage consultants,\" said a road ministry official.\nOfficials said that the option could be hiring aircrafts or taking them on lease rather than buying them. \"But the outcome of the assessment will be the basis of taking a decision. Funding is not going to be an issue, but we must detail their usage and utility,\" said one of them.\nHighways minister Nitin Gadkari had pushed this proposal. \"The cost would be recovered since we spend huge amount in travelling of officials. The focus is to accelerate work and complete ongoing projects through regular monitoring,\" Gadkari had told TOI on Thursday when he rode a bus to see the progress on NH-8. As per the proposal, NHAI would buy the aircraft and NHIDCL, which largely deals with road projects in North-East and border areas would procure the chopper.\nGovernment officials said that there are a few PSUs and government bodies that have procured aircrafts.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:55:45.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
