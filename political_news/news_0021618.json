He will leave 9,800 Troops in Afghanistan through most of 2016, and 5,500 Troops into 2017.\nThis is a tacit admission by Obama that he blew it in Iraq. He pulled all U.S. Troops out of Iraq – against the advice of Military Leaders, and just about every Conservative in America – and it allowed ISIS to explode onto the scene. Obama will never openly admit he blew it, but this Afghanistan decision is clear indication he knows if he doesn’t leave a residual force in the country, it will be overrun by the Taliban and by ISIS.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvdQ6oRPrlw"], "published": "2015-10-16T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:13:24.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
