The statement, which avoids terming the policy a ceasefire, is released by the Group of Communities in Kurdistan (KCK) and does not reference Saturday's twin bomb blasts in Ankara. There have been reports the PKK is preparing to announce a ceasefire ahead of the November 1 election in Turkey. Since Turkey's June 7 general elections, the PKK terror organization stepped up its attacks against Turkish security forces and civilians, killing more than 100 Turkish security personnel. Despite almost all political circles in Turkey accepting the fact that an armed struggle would only worsen the conditions throughout the country and achieve nothing for the Kurdish people's rights and freedoms, PKK has insisted on continuing its armed activities to regain political influence by arms. Designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, the PKK launched a separatist insurgency in 1984 in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. The state launched peace talks with its jailed leader, Abdullah Öcalan, in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:34:42.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
