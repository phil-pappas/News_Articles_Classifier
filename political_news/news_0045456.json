However, their computer systems were \"generally weak and ageing\" and lagged behind those used by the public.\nImage copyright PA Image caption Theresa May said discussions over cuts were still ongoing The report also stressed the need for public reassurance as the profile of policing changed.\n\"Policing in five years' time is likely to look different to now and to 2010: smaller, less costly and perhaps less visible,\" it said.\n\"Maintaining visible neighbourhood policing, rather than becoming a mainly reactive service, is likely to be a challenge - and the public will need reassurance if policing becomes less visible.\"\nWith other agencies also facing financial pressures, HMIC said the \"risk\" is that demand on the police will increase and the least efficient forces will get close to the point \"at which their financial sustainability and operational viability may be in jeopardy\".\nMike Cunningham, who led the inspection, said: \"Police forces have been through change on an unprecedented scale since 2010.\n'Uncharted waters' \"The next five years will be more challenging for forces as they strive to make further reductions in budgets and workforce, while dealing with increasingly complex crime. Policing is entering uncharted waters.\"\nThe findings echo recent warnings by senior officers , including the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who claimed it would be \"a real challenge to keep people safe\" if more cuts were made.\nChancellor George Osborne has asked ministers in non-protected departments - like the Home Office - to come up with reductions in their budgets of between 25% and 40% by 2019/20 ahead of next month's Comprehensive Spending Review, when the government's plans for the next four years will be set out.\nWhen asked on Monday about police concerns over the impact cuts could make, Mrs May told the BBC: \"They don't know what money they will be getting, because no decisions have been taken yet.\"\nBut she added: \"There are bodies like HMIC that have made clear there is further scope for collaboration among police forces to ensure they can get efficiencies and make savings in their budgets in ways that aren't affecting their front-line policing.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/177FB/production/_86215269_86215268.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/AC81/production/_86216144_86216143.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-34533859"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:04:15.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
