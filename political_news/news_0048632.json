Slater will oversee the company's safety performance for the next three years.\nFiat Chrysler says in a statement that it submitted three candidates to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which picked Slater. He's currently a partner in a Washington law firm and ran the Transportation Department under President Bill Clinton.\nIn July the government hit FCA with a record $105 million penalty for failing to tell customers about recalls, failing to make recall repairs and other infractions.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
