A man in the audience asked Clinton whether she thought it would be possible for the U.S. to enact such a program, and if not, why. Gun buybacks have happened at the metropolitan level in the U.S., but any effort at the national level would be sure to run into intense political opposition. Hillary is backed by the NRA. This is scheme which the NRA will work to their advantage. No closing the loopholes to stop gun sales to gangs, felons and the mentally ill. Let's just \"buy back\" the guns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:59:20.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
