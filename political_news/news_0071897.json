And the only person widely deemed fit to fill it is a lawmaker who says he doesn’t want to: Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the party’s 2012 vice presidential nominee.\nEven as they plead with Ryan to reconsider, Republicans are left asking themselves whether anyone can lead them. And even if Ryan does yield to their entreaties, some question whether even he could tame a House GOP that seems fractured beyond repair, with a “hell no” caucus ready to risk crises and government shutdowns to achieve its goals, and establishment-minded lawmakers seemingly powerless to do anything about it.\n“It is bad,” said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y. “We cannot allow 35 or 40 people to hijack the party and blackmail the Congress. We have to get things done.”\nOn Friday, lawmakers left Washington in confusion and discord to head home to their districts for a weeklong recess. Ryan returned to Janesville, Wis., to his wife and young family to turn over his options, with leading Republicans inside Congress and out urging him to step up for the good of the party.\nBefore the House adjourned, outgoing Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, who’d intended to leave Congress Oct. 30, assured lawmakers he would stay on until a replacement can be selected. When that will happen is uncertain, but Boehner urged Republicans to find a way out of their turmoil together.\n“This institution cannot grind to a halt,” he said at a closed-door meeting according to an account provided by someone in the room. “It’s up to the people in this room to listen to each other, come together and figure this out. Time for us to take the walls down, open up our ears and listen to each other.”\nBut Boehner is staying put, for now — and that could improve the chances for a debt limit increase by early next month to avoid a market-shattering government default. His continued presence also might help lawmakers reach a bipartisan budget deal to head off a government shutdown in December.\nThe Tea Party forces that pushed Boehner to plan his exit now have less leverage against a man with nothing to lose.\n“Sometimes the dog catches the car and doesn’t know what to do,” Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, a Boehner ally, said of the House Freedom Caucus and other hard-right lawmakers.\nFacing a fall of fiscal fights with the Obama administration, Boehner has said he doesn’t want to leave a “dirty barn” for his successor. The toughest item, by far, is legislation that must pass by early November or so to increase the government’s borrowing cap so it won’t default on its bills. Last year, Boehner orchestrated a debt ceiling increase by relying on just 28 Republicans and 193 Democrats — the exact opposite of the way the House is usually run.\nThen there are ongoing talks about easing spending curbs that have frozen the budgets of both the Pentagon and domestic agencies.\n“John is going to try to clean the barn up as best he can,” said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. “He’s not going to clean the whole thing, but we can probably dispose of the debt ceiling. I hope we can reach a budget agreement.”\nYet by announcing he would resign rather than face a Tea Party-backed floor vote to depose him, Boehner conceded that the fight to lead the House was one he could not win. And within days of his announcement, the same bloc of compromise-averse hard-liners who’d pushed him out derailed his No. 2, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy withdrew from the speaker’s race at the last possible moment on Thursday, as it became clear he would struggle for the needed majority on the House floor.\nLawmakers were left to fret that whoever becomes speaker next — whether Ryan or someone else — could simply end up the latest victim of a corrosive dynamic that forced a government shutdown two years ago in a failed attempt to end President Obama’s health care law. That dynamic has caused crisis after crisis ever since.\nMajor challenges await whoever does move into the job, including the fight over raising the debt ceiling and must-pass spending legislation in early December that hard-liners hope to use to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, which would risk another shutdown.\n“No matter who we put in that chair is going to have to figure out a way to change the political dynamic,” said Dent. “That is a much harder question.”\nIt’s all happening at a moment when House Republicans enjoy their biggest majority in 80 years and control of the Senate, platforms they hoped to use to set out a responsible governing agenda to show voters the GOP deserves to be returned to the White House.\nYet amid the muddle, some members of the rank and file saw signs of hope that the leadership collapse and attendant soul-searching could somehow result in a more open House GOP with a bigger role for all. Hard-liners routinely complain loudly about being shut out of the process, but those are complaints that some of the more establishment-minded lawmakers share.\nThird-term Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia offered one example, complaining that he had proposed instituting an hourlong annual ethics training for lawmakers but could not get agreement, even though such a policy is routine at major corporations.\n“There’s just this reluctance to change anything, and so I think this is cathartic in a way,” Rigell said. “I really think we’ll get through this.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:47:23.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
