He is widely acknowledged to be a pioneer of the modern Republican Party in Mississippi. Governor Phil Bryant: “Leon was a great American who served his state and his nation with honor and distinction. In everything he did, as a Naval Academy graduate, a U.S. Marine, a Republican gubernatorial nominee, and a community leader, he always served with dignity, principle, and dedication. It was a great privilege to know him and I send my deepest condolences to his family.” MSGOP Chairman Joe Nosef: “As someone who was born and raised in Clarksdale, the same home town as Mr. Bramlett, I recall how he and his name were always larger than life. Mr. Bramlett really helped to shape our Mississippi Republican Party when he ran for Governor as the GOP nominee in 1983 as we were still coming into our own as a Party. I can think of no better tribute to his life of service to the MSGOP than for us to keep working hard to grow the Party for the next generation of Republicans.\" Gov.
