Gov. Ellspermann has worked hard to tout Carly Fiorina’s presidential campaign. Along the way, she is pushing the idea that more women need to seek political office. It’s a welcome message. Lt.

So many, in fact, that it’s hard to know where to start. \nBut as she talked in her office Wednesday morning, Indiana Lt. Gov. Sue Ellspermann focused on one of the most glaring problems, and certainly one of the most consequential. It’s a good place to start. \nThe problem? Too few women. \nToo few women holding elected office and too few running for office. Too few women at the table when decisions are made, and when public policies are crafted. If you don’t see the problem, just look at Congress or the Statehouse or campaigns for just about any office. There are plenty of examples of women in political office, indeed, but the reality is they are still the exceptions. \nYes, even in 2015. \n“If we want good government, then we have to encourage our best and brightest to run for office,” Ellspermann said. “That includes men and women, minorities, people from all parts of society and all professions. And if we are not seeing enough women stepping forward, we have to ask ourselves: What are we doing to push the barriers out of their way?” \nIn the first draft of this column, I wrote that the numbers regarding women in political office were shocking. But I scrapped that sentence, because they shouldn’t shock anyone. They’re disappointing and troubling, absolutely, but the numbers have been so low and so stagnant for so long that they can hardly be labeled a surprise. \nAccording to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University , roughly 1 in 5 elected offices in the country are held by women. Think about that for a moment and then tell me it’s not ridiculous. \nThat figure includes 19 percent of congressional seats, 24 percent of state legislative seats, and 18 percent of mayoral posts. In Indiana, where women have won several statewide elections in recent years, only 31 of 150 legislative seats are occupied by women. That number has actually declined in recent years. \nWomen make up roughly half of the state, Ellspermann said, “So we should be at 50 percent” of office-holders. \nI agree. I’m not here to pander and suggest that more women in office would be some sort of panacea. But the lack of balance in the halls of power is clearly a problem. \n“What I know from problem-solving is that more perspectives around the table mean more solutions that work,” Ellspermann said. “More women and more minorities in office will lead to better-crafted policies and a better understanding of why particular policies and shifts are needed.” \nConsider this: If there was a meeting today between the governor and the state legislature’s four caucus leaders, there wouldn’t be a woman in the room. There’d be only two among a gathering of the state’s 11-member congressional delegation. And if you pulled together all of the state’s current candidates for governor and U.S. Senate, and mayor in our capital city, you’d have an all-male affair. \nThat’s a problem. \n“The parties have to make it a priority to elect more women, and it has to be from the top down,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Rutgers center. “Someone has to say, this matters to us.” \nIn Indiana, Ellspermann is saying just that. She’s saying it with her high-profile support of presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and with her push within the Republican Party to reach out to more female candidates for the Indiana House and Senate. \n“We have to support the candidates who are willing to step forward,” she said, adding that the party also must reach out to successful women who might not be inclined to run for office. \nWomen like her. \nEllspermann entered political life only five years ago, winning a state House seat after being encouraged to run by then-Gov. Mitch Daniels. Two years later, current Gov. Mike Pence selected her as his running mate. \nWith a master’s and a doctorate in industrial engineering and a successful career in business, Ellspermann, the mother of four adult daughters, hesitated before running for the House because of the toxic nature of political campaigns. She agreed to run only after warning her party that she would drop out if it engaged in the type of negative campaigning that is so routine. \nThere are many lessons there, she said. \nFirst, studies have shown that more than men, women need to be asked to run for office. That, Walsh said, is because women more often run because of a deep interest in a public policy issue, and not because of a love of the sport of politics. And given the current state of politics, Walsh said, government doesn’t often seem like the best way to tackle public policy. \nSecond, party leaders must find more ways to support qualified female candidates. This is a bigger problem for Republicans; Democrats at least have several powerful organizations that provide female candidates with financial support. But it’s a challenge for candidates of both parties. As is finding candidates who can balance politics with the demands of being a parent, Walsh said. \nEllspermann said potential candidates must also hear that they don’t have to buy into a slash-and-burn political game. This isn’t about treating women with kid gloves, she said, but about understanding that not everyone sees everything in life “as a fight. ... I have tried to explain to women that they can win on their own terms.” \nAs we talked, Ellspermann was preparing to travel to Kentucky to support Jenean Hampton, a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor in that state, and she is helping to organize a November fundraiser in Carmel for Fiorina . She is focused on increasing the number of conservative women in office but, in truth, both parties could benefit from the points she is making. \nThere are a lot of ways to improve our political system. At the top of that list should be making sure a broader range of candidates are participating in it. \nFollow Star columnist Matthew Tully on Twitter: @matthewltully .
