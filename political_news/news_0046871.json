(Rich Schultz | The Associated Press) Comments \nRepublican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump said that the September 11, 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Centers would not have happened if he was president. \nIn an interview on Fox News Sunday , Trump said his tough stance on immigration would have prevented the hijackers from entering the country in the first place. \n\"I am extremely, extremely tough on illegal immigration. I'm extremely tough on people coming into this country,\" Trump said. \"I believe that if I were running things ... I doubt that those people would have been in the country.\" \nThe New York Post notes that all but one of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 entered the US legally on business or with tourist visas. One had a student visa, but didn't attend class. \nHe later clarified that he would have had tougher visa standards and a \"massive whistleblower system\" to prevent them from entering the country in the first place, but did not expand on how that would have worked. \nTrump also doubled down on his feud with Jeb Bush, saying he's not \"blaming anybody\" for the 9/11 attacks, but reiterating that George Bush didn't keep America safe. \nTrump originally disagreed with Jeb Bush during the second Republican primary debate , saying, \"I don't feel safe\" in response to Bush saying his brother protected America in the aftermath of 9/11. \nJeb responded on Sunday by saying he had \"grave doubts\" about whether Trump could be trusted with nuclear weapon codes, and said Trump wasn't serious enough to be president. \n\"It looks as though he's not taking the responsibility, the possibility of being president of the United States really seriously,\" Bush told CNN . \"For him, it looks as though he's an actor playing the role of candidate. .... It gives me great concern.\" \nTrump followed up Monday by repeating that he wasn't blaming anyone, while criticizing the CIA's and FBI's communication with the Bush administration on CNN: \"The fact is we had the worst attack in the history of our country during his reign. Jeb (Bush) said we were safe during his reign. That wasn't true. And I'm not blaming anybody and I'm not blaming George Bush, although if you look at his three primary agencies, they hated each other, they weren't talking ... And a good leader would've made sure that they would get along and talk and lots of other things happen.\" \nTrump even suggested that CIA Director George Tenet \"knew in advance that there was going to be an attack,\" despite intelligence reports showing that he didn't know when or how those attacks would unfold, or how reliable the information was. \nThe next Republican presidential primary debate is Wednesday, October 28 at the University of Boulder in Colorado, hosted by CNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:34:36.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
