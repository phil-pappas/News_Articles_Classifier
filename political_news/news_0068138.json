There will be no squaring of personal accounts,\" he said. \"There will be no kicking of those who have fallen out of their own fault and very rightly so.\"\nKaczynski credited his late brother, former Polish President Lech Kaczynski, with the party's strong showing. His brother was killed in the 2010 air crash in Russia that claimed the lives of the president and many of Poland's top leaders.\nIf the exit poll results are confirmed, the Law and Justice will take 242 seats in the 460-seat lower house of parliament and 58-year-old lawmaker Beata Szydlo will become Poland's next prime minister.\nA victory by Law and Justice gives the party a chance to implement a brand of politics that is strongly pro-NATO but also somewhat Euroskeptic. The party opposes adopting the euro currency and is strongly anti-migrant, positions that are expected to have a broader impact on the 28-nation European Union , of which Poland is a member.\nLaw and Justice has promised to reverse an unpopular rise in the retirement age and put more money into the pockets of struggling families with tax breaks, monthly cash bonuses for children under 18 and free medication for people over 75. It also wants to raise taxes on the mostly foreign-owned banks and big supermarkets in Poland and give tax breaks to smaller local businesses and those that adopt Polish technologies.\nAccording to the exit poll, for the first time in Poland's post-communist history, no left-wing forces appear to have won enough votes to enter into parliament.\nThe Ipsos exit poll showed that only five parties gained enough votes to make it into parliament: the conservative Law and Justice party; the centrist Civic Platform; a right-wing party led by rock star Pawel Kukiz; the new pro-business party Modern Poland and the Polish Peasants Party .\nTwo left-wing forces had been in the running: United Left , a coalition of several parties, and a new party, Together.\nCivic Platform had led the country through a period of strong economic growth and political stability, even during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the 2010 plane crash that killed Poland's president. But the presidential vote in May signaled problems for Civic Platform when Law and Justice candidate Andrzej Duda edged out their incumbent.\nThe Catholic Church was seen as backing Law and Justice, as were many Poles who have not benefited from the country's strong economic growth, expected at 3.5 percent this year.\nThe church backing has led to some fears that Law and Justice will try to ban in vitro fertilization and create a total ban on abortion.\nFor now, abortion in Poland is only allowed in rare cases, such as when the mother's life is at risk or the fetus is damaged.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:19:19.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
