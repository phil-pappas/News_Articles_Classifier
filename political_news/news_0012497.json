He had been due to address the organisation's conference in London this weekend, but he is now said to have other engagements.\nCND said that while Mr Corbyn was stepping down as vice-chair in recognition of his increased workload, he would take on the role of vice-president instead. \"He didn't want to resign from CND, so he decided to accept a vice president role,\" a spokesman said.\nGeneral secretary Kate Hudson said: \"This is a fitting tribute to a very principled man with a lifelong commitment to CND and the cause of nuclear disarmament.\nShare article \"Working together, with enormous support from across society, we will prevail against Trident and secure a crucial step towards global disarmament.\"\nA CND spokesman said while Mr Corbyn will not be giving a speech tomorrow as had originally been planned, he will be addressing activists at a private session this afternoon.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-17T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:35:30.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
