Loukidelis, a former B.C. deputy attorney general, was called in by the Liberal government in response to Denham's report released on Thursday.\n\"If we have to make any changes, and I'm sure we will, then all of those emails from today on will have been preserved and we can properly dispose of them according to the act or properly preserve them according to the act,\" said Clark.\nDenham's report said the government's practices threaten the integrity of the access to information process in British Columbia. She said the broad interpretation of so-called transitory records in the premier's office resulted in almost all daily emails sent by the premier's deputy chief of staff being deleted.\nShe recommends in her 65-page report that legislation be created that enforces a duty to document key government decisions. The report also calls for installation of technology preventing employees from permanently deleting emails.\nThe issue came to light when government whistleblower Tim Duncan said his supervisor in the Transportation Ministry deleted emails last November from his computer about the Highways of Tears investigation.\nDuncan submitted a complaint to Denham's office last May alleging ministerial assistant George Gretes \"triple deleted\" his computer records that were needed for a freedom of information request about the Highway of Tears investigation into murdered and missing women.\nDuncan was fired from his job with the B.C. Liberals last March.\nDenham's report stated she interviewed Gretes under oath multiple times and concluded he didn't completely respond to freedom of information requests and allegedly lied about it under oath. She said she alerted the RCMP in connection to the man's testimony.\nGretes resigned his government position on Thursday, the day Denham's report was released.\nThe report contains unproven allegations against Gretes, who could not be reached for comment.\nHis Victoria lawyer, Chris Considine, had no comment. RCMP Staff Sgt. Rob Vermeulen said Thursday that they were reviewing the allegation.\nRelated Stories Privacy commissioner alerts RCMP, claims B.C. employee gave false testimony", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:26:12.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
