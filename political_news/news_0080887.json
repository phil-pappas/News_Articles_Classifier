HBO has confirmed that it is in \"preliminary talks\" with the filmmaker about a TV series adaptation of Watchmen , the classic Alan Moore graphic novel that Snyder turned into a feature back in 2009. Collider first reported the news.\nThat film adaptation of Watchmen was hyped for its devotion to the source material, recreating visuals and even specific frames from Moore's book. That led to a big opening weekend, after which audience interest quickly cratered, with even die-hard fans criticizing the condensed plotting and changed ending. Ultimately, Snyder's movie adaptation barely crawled north of $100 million at the U.S. box office.", "external_links": ["http://collider.com/watchmen-tv-series-hbo-zack-snyder/", "http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/watchmen-series-hbo-zack-snyder-1201607567/"], "published": "2015-10-02T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:28:06.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
