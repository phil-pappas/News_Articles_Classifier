His comments come two years after the Supreme Court overturned a key part of the law requiring certain states with a history of racial discrimination at the polls to \"pre-clear\" any changes to voting laws with the federal government. Bush's opposition to reauthorization falls in line with most Republicans, who say the law is out of date and overbearing on states who want to change their own rules. Proponents of the law say it's needed to protect minorities. Some members of Congress have tried updating the law, but those efforts have stalled in the Republican-led Congress.
