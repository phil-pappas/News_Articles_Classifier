Xi Jinping was cheered by throngs of his subjects waving Chinese banners and flags; many were Chinese students bussed in from across the UK. More Scots resist Green Investment Bank sale \nDissent was confined to a short section on one side of the road, and the many police present ensured that anyone who was not a friend of the visiting Communist leader stayed in that section. \nLea Reed, 32, said she had come down from Cambridge with her Chinese friend on one of “tons” of buses laid on for the occasion. The “I love China” T-shirt that she and many others were wearing was handed out onboard, she said. \nSome of the Chinese students described Xi’s visit as “big”, “important” and “exciting” for relations between the two countries. Others were reluctant to talk, fearing that having their names published would cause problems back home. \nJun Haochen, who studies management and had come for the day from Portsmouth, said: “Personally, I really like President Xi Jinping because he’s won many Chinese people’s hearts because he cracked down on corruption.” \n“It does look slightly contrived,” said Stephen Turner, one of the few non-Chinese present, who described himself as a retired company director. “The banners look incredibly well organised. It does make one slightly suspicious there’s some official organisation behind these banners.” \nRead more \nLater, Amnesty International published pictures on Twitter of what it said were boxes sent from China lying in the street containing banners and T-shirts. One was marked “diplomatic bag”. The embassy could not immediately be reached for comment. \nChris Etherington, a pensioner who was passing through, marvelled at the spectacle. “It’s heartfelt. Perhaps in 20 years they’ll be as cynical as we are about politicians,” he said. “If we were abroad, we’d go there to boo.” \nOne of the dissenting voices was Tara Cornish, 45, a polite anthropology researcher holding a Tibetan flag about the size of her hand. A police officer, smiling and courteous, asked her to move to the designated zone for protesters. When she asked what would happen if she did not, he said his superiors might order him to arrest her. \nAs she walked down to where the protesters were, she demonstrated for the Financial Times what happened when she tried to raise the Tibet flag. Two Xi supporters quickly appeared waving giant Chinese flags, on flagpoles about nine feet long, burying her Tibet flag in a sea of red. \nA spokesman for the Met said it was “common policing sense” to separate opposing groups of people at any event that required a police presence “to minimise the risk of anything happening”. In depth \nXi Jinping: UK state visit \nThe Chinese president addresses parliament, dines at Buckingham Palace and rides in a royal carriage as London rolls out the reddest of red carpets for the Communist party leader \nIn the designated area for protesters were campaigners for human rights, religious freedom, Tibet and Falun Gong, a banned Chinese spiritual movement. “We’re here so that people don’t forget about human rights,” said Allan Hogarth, Amnesty International’s head of advocacy, while someone from Christian Solidarity Worldwide said she wanted to tell the prime minister that trade “cannot be placed above human rights and religious freedom”. \nBut many in the crowd were genuinely excited to see Tuesday’s royal pageantry in the Mall. Standing two deep along the barriers, they strained to catch a glimpse of the visitors from Beijing and to take pictures with their phones. \nOne of the spectators was Richard Christie, 26, on holiday with his family from New Zealand, a country that has seen huge Chinese investment in its agriculture. “I wasn’t always a big fan of the Chinese, but you come round to things ... it’s one of those things that needs to be managed.” He was wearing a maroon baseball cap with “China-UK” on it that he said he had been handed earlier.
