Confectionery expert Beth Kimmerle dispels some myths. (The Washington Post) By Beth Kimmerle October 23 at 1:14 PM\nFrom conversation hearts on Valentine’s Day to candy canes at Christmas, sweet treats are a big part of every major holiday, and none more so than Halloween. Maybe because it’s associated with such controversial topics as nutrition and devilish holidays, candy is something we have a lot of thoughts about, many of them wrong (or paranoid: poisoned sweets ?). Let’s brush off the sugarcoating on five other myths.\nBeth Kimmerle is a confectionery expert and the author of four books on the history of America’s candy industry. 1 . Natural and sugar-free alternatives are healthier than candy.\nIt’s no secret that candy isn’t health food. Makes sense, then, that well-meaning adults are often looking for something else to hand out to trick-or-treaters. The Internet is full of healthy suggestions to replace all those Butterfingers, with “natural” snack bars, apples and sugar-free alternatives topping the lists.\nThose snack bars go by many names (protein bars, granola bars, energy bars, nutrition bars), but no matter how they’re marketed, they can have more sugar and calories than their candy bar kin. Their wholesome chia, oats, fruit, flax and nuts are often bound with corn syrup, rice syrup, agave or other hidden sweeteners, not to mention the chocolate coatings, yogurt chips and superfruits that have been plumped up with sugar.\nA chocolate-dipped granola bar from Target’s Market Pantry line contains 15 grams of sugar and 140 calories. That’s better than a full-size Snickers bar (250 calories and 27 grams of sugar) but almost double the numbers for a Fun Size Snickers (8.5 grams of sugar, 80 calories), which is the more likely size to be handed out to trick-or-treaters. (Forgot the apples. A medium-size one packs 19 grams of sugar.)\nAnd those sugar-free candies? Just read the reviews for sugar-free gummy bears, made with sugar alcohols. Aside from unpleasant aftertastes, sugar alcohols can have adverse gastro-effects, causing intestinal pain and diarrhea. Sugar-free candy labels don’t always carry warnings about these potential laxative effects.\nAs with any treat, don’t rely on the package’s marketing messages. Take a look at the nutritional label and make sure that alternative bar isn’t meant to serve a family of five. Or even better, grab a real candy bar.\n2 . Old candy should be thrown out.\nI once visited a call center for a large candy company and was mesmerized by a Sudoku-like poster on the wall titled “How to Read Our Date Codes” — those number or letter sequences strategically placed on hard-to-find wrapper seams that signal when a candy was produced. There’s no standard sell-by date for candy; the confectionery industry uses a variety of practices. The codes don’t tell customers much, which probably explains the regular advice to toss old candy. Better safe than sorry.\nBut eating an old Charleston Chew is very unlikely to hurt you. Typically, candy is cooked to high temperatures and lacks the moisture of fresh foods. Microbiologically, little moisture means little chance of spoiling. If a confectionery piece contains more than cooked sugar and has added fats from butter, nuts or chocolate, or contains an egg product (as in nougat or marshmallow), then its shelf life shortens. Still, nuts won’t go rancid for about a year.
