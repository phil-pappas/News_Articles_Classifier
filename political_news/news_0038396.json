Posted 0 \nFor Rev. Laura Young, executive director of the Ohio Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, apparently killing babies is a blessed event . \nWhen talking about her stance on abortion, Young said, \"There is a reverence for life that happens in this clinic. And the decision to get an abortion is often a really, really, spiritual decision. Even if someone personally wouldn’t get an abortion, they should at least understand this.” \nIn the name of tolerance and loving your neighbor, Rev. Young calls for clergy to become more vigilant in the political process of keeping abortion legal. Lifenews.com explained: \"Vigilant” means, for example, lobbying in Ohio against a measure to protect unborn babies capable of feeling excruciating pain as they torn apart limb from limb. And against measures to protect unborn babies from losing their lives because they are diagnosed with Down syndrome, or involving parents in the abortion decisions of their minor daughters or requiring that abortionists (many of whom parachute in a few days a month) have admitting privileges at a local hospital when they botch an abortion. \nWe long for the day that babies are not legally killed in our county, but killing babies in the name of Jesus is something that must stop!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:20:16.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
