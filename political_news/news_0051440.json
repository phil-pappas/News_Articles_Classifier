This comes just a week after the gruesome sexual assault of a minor in Keshavpuram area.\nIn the latest incidents, the two girls are undergoing treatment at separate hospitals.\nIn the first incident, a five-year-old girl was allegedly gangraped by three drunk men, including a landlord and his tenant, in JJ clusters of east Delhi’s Anand Vihar area. Identified as Sitaram, Prakash and Revati, all accused have been arrested.\nThe victim’s father is employed with a cloth firm while her mother works as a domestic help. The couple also has a three-year-old son.\nThe police said that on Friday at about 6 pm, the three accused were drinking alcohol at Prakash’s house on the second floor of the same building where the victim lives. “Prakash lured the victim to his house floor where the three of them raped her in turns,” said a senior police officer, adding, “After being assaulted, the victim, who was profusely bleeding, went up crying to her aunt and narrated her ordeal.”\nAngry crowd thrashes rape accused\nThe Delhi Police said that locals immediately gathered at the house and tried to get hold of the three accused. While Sitaram and Revati managed to flee, Prakash was nabbed and beaten up by the angry crowd before being handed over to the police.\nThe girl was admitted to GTB Hospital. Sitaram and Revati were also subsequently arrested at Prakash’s instance.\nIn the second case, a two-and-a-half-year old girl was kidnapped from outside her house by two men on a motorcycle and allegedly raped.\nShe was later found lying in a pool of blood in a park 300 metres away from her residence. No arrest has been made so far in this case. The police said that at about 11.30 pm on Saturday the victim was standing with her grandmother watching Ramlila.\n“The girl started to drift into the crowd to watch the function more closely,” said the police, adding, “By the time her grandmother realised it, all the lights went off due to a power outage.”\nIn the darkness, the two men kidnapped the girl. The grandmother inf-ormed the family members about the incident and the police was called. About an hour after the kidnapping, the girl was found from a park in the locality. She was rushed to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital where her condition is said to be critical. The girl’s father has alleged that the area is highly unsafe due to frequent power outages and dysfunctional streetlight.\n nation Rape Crime Delhi Also Read Students worst sufferers as authorities sit on requests Prime Minister votes for first time in Lok Sabha in 10 years Private bus operators cancel services Vijayawada land prices to go up after Chandrababu Naidu's swearing-in", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/molestation%20rape%20kidnap%20crime%20woman%20girl%20child_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/nation-crime/article/delhi-shamed-2-kids-are-raped", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/molestation%20rape%20kidnap%20crime%20woman%20girl%20child_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-18T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:32:39.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
