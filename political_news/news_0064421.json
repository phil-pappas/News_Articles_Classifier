Kumar, then Lok Sabha MP from Barh, had expressed concern on the ever deteriorating financial condition of Bihar, which he said, was in direct control of the Chief Minister.\n\"The balance between income and expenditure was tilted in favour of income at the time you (Prasad) became the chief minister in March 1990...but in subsequent years, expenditure overran income prompting huge cut in plan outlay which have had a bearing on development works,\" Kumar said in the letter.\nClaiming that Bihar had become a butt of jokes in Delhi, he said whatever the Chief Minister submitted to the Centre for annual and plan budget was worth throwing them in basket but sanctions were given on political consideration.\nDuring his chief ministership, intellectuals and specialists felt helpless and ignored but it was senior bureaucrats who felt more harassed and fear-stricken, the letter said.\n Bihar polls Nitish Kumar Lalu Prasad corruption nation Also Read Temples to reach consensus Nestle pays Ambuja Cements Rs 20 crores to destroy Maggi packets 20 workers fall unconscious following gas leak at meat plant in Meerut Plus-2 girl gets drunk, creates ruckus", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151018/nation-politics/article/bjp-digs-out-23-year-old-letter-nitish-kumar-attacking-lalu", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/lalu-nitish_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/lalu-nitish_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:45:25.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
