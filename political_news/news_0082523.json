These carriages were fully rebuilt with a 30-year life expectancy and now we’ve lost them after less than 10 years’ service,\" says Commerce Spokesperson Fletcher Tabuteau. \n\"The carriages could have been used elsewhere but that did not happen as the government ignores provincial New Zealand by failing to invest in the development of passenger rail. \n\"Better use for the carriages would have been for an inter-regional passenger service or new suburban train services in cities like Christchurch, Dunedin, Tauranga and Hamilton. \n\"This government is seriously lacking vision for rail transport in New Zealand,\" says Mr Tabuteau. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
