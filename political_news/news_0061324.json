Cuomo said the clemencies were “a critical step toward a more just, more fair, and more compassionate New York.” \nALBANY – Gov. Cuomo kicked off a new effort to grant more clemencies Thursday by commuting the sentences of two drug offenders and granting pardons to two others who’d already completed their sentences. \nCuomo’s announcement, coming days after the murder of NYPD Officer Randolph Holder, was slammed by Brooklyn Sen. Martin Golden, a Republican. \n“The timing of this is wrong and it is insulting to the police officers of this city,” said Golden, who is a former cop. \nCuomo, who has been criticized by activists for granting only a handful of clemencies during his tenure, said the new effort was “a critical step toward a more just, more fair, and more compassionate New York.” \nSUSPECTED KILLER OF NYPD OFFICER WAS ON STREET BECAUSE JUDGE OPTED TO SEND HIM TO DRUG REHAB, NOT PRISON HANDOUT/REUTERS Officer Randolph Holder was shot and killed late Tuesday while pursuing a suspected armed robber in East Harlem.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:12:47.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
