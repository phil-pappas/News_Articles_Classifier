The campaign, led by the Child Care Advocacy Association of Canada , will work with the Liberal government, the NDP and other progressive MPs willing to make the dream of a national child care program a reality for all Canadians.\nDuring the election, Vote Child Care 2015 collected thousands of signatures on a pledge , urging the federal government to:\nCommit to long-term sustained federal funding for and leadership on child care. Come to the table with the provinces, territories, and Indigenous communities ready to build a public, non-profit system that we can count on.\nThe Liberals said they would call a meeting within first 100 days to begin developing a new National Early Learning and Child Care Framework in collaboration with provinces, territories and Indigenous communities. The Vote Child Care campaign is committed to holding them to this promise and also working with progressive MPs to make it happen.\nWatch: A vision for universal child care Read: What child care could look like in the year 2020 (PDF)\nThe Vote Child Care 2015 campaign set out with the aim of keeping child care on the political agenda and making it a vote-determining issue for Canadians. During the election campaign, we saw three out of four major political parties release child care platforms, each one with promises to support Canadian families with better child care.\n\"The hard work starts now as we must come together and hold the new government to their commitment of building a national early learning and child care framework,\" said Carolyn Ferns , Public Policy and Government Relations Coordinator at the Ontario Coalition for Better Child Care. \"In the coming months, we will continue to advocate strongly for the universal, affordable, quality non-profit child care system that all parents and children deserve.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://childcare2020.ca/sites/default/files/VisionChildCare2020Nov3ENG_.pdf", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C8916&Transmission_Id=201510201336CANADANWWEB______C8916&DateId=20151020", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://pledge.votechildcare.ca/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Q51UQcDgI"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:18:14.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
