As a result, IJ's legal advocacy has been strengthened, and the power of the state has been rolled back, giving individuals a better opportunity to live as free and responsible members of society through expanded economic liberty, better protection of property rights, and greater respect for free speech.\"\nAmong other issues, IJ fights civil forfeiture, eminent domain abuse, and arbitrary licensing requirements, persuading courts with robust evidence and building legal precedent for individual rights and limited government.\nIJ's Strategic Research Program uses rigorous empirical analysis to demonstrate the benefits of freedom and the harm caused by runaway government power. It arms its attorneys to litigate from a position of power both in court and in the media, and the results speak for themselves: though its opponent is nearly always the government, IJ wins more than 70 percent of its cases.\nWhat : Institute for Justice's Strategic Research Program named one of six finalists for Atlas Network's prestigious $100,000 Templeton Freedom Award\nWhen : Nov. 12, 2015, 7:30 p.m.\nWhere : Liberty Forum & Freedom Dinner closing ceremony â€“ Capitale, 130 Bowery, New York, NY 10013 (Bowery and Grand St.)\nPress Contact : Daniel.Anthony@AtlasNetwork.org or (202) 449-8441\nAwarded since 2004, the Templeton Freedom Award is named for the late investor and philanthropist Sir John Templeton.
