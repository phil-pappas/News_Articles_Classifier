Of the 150 MW planned for this business, wind farms with a nominal output of 93.9 MW have already been commissioned or are under construction. Construction has now begun on the 'KÃ¶hlen' wind farm in Lower Saxony. PNE WIND is installing seven Enercon E101 wind turbines which together will have 21.3 MW of nominal output. The wind farm is scheduled to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 'Chransdorf' wind farm (Brandenburg) was commissioned in August and the wind turbines with a combined nominal output of 57.6 MW are already generating results. Two more wind farms planned for the YieldCo with a combined nominal output of 15.0 MW are under construction. These two projects are the 'Waldfeucht' wind farm (North-Rhine Westphalia) with 9.0 MW and the 'Apensen II' wind farm (Lower Saxony) with 6.0 MW. For other projects, planning applications have been submitted. Upon completion, these wind farms will be incorporated successively into the YieldCo. The YieldCo will be a dividend-based company whose aim is to generate long-term stable returns from fully commissioned wind farms. The shares and the assets of the YieldCo are still held by PNE WIND AG, and the company currently generates proceeds from the operation of the wind farms. Markus Lesser, PNE WIND management board member: 'The progress with our YieldCo projects is considerable. Our extensive wind farm development activities are having a positive effect on this. In addition to the projects headed for our YieldCo, we are currently developing other wind farms in Germany that will be sold directly to our customers.' distributed by This content was issued by PNE WIND AG on the 2015-10-08 and was initially posted on www.pne.de.
