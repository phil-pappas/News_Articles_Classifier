(AP) — A Florida teen is getting a reduced sentence after writing 200 apology letters to victims who lost belongings in the fire he set.\nThe teenager intended to burn the storage facility of his mother's abusive ex-boyfriend, but when he doused the unit with gasoline and lit a match in February, authorities say the fire spread to about 40 other units. He was a freshman in college at the time.\nThe Tampa Bay Times (http://tinyurl.com/qdy8d93 ) reports the judge gave him a lighter sentence Friday of five months in a county jail and eight years' probation, citing the remorse he showed in the letters.
