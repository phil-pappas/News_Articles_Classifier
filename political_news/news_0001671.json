Police say Glenn Baxter was in the driver's seat.\nThe children's great-grandfather doubts the deaths were the result of an accident, saying the children's mother had declined her estranged husband's attempts at reconciliation because he hadn't addressed his anger management problems.\nGeorge Britt said it doesn't make sense that the early-to-bed-early-to-rise mother would take her children out for a ride just after midnight. \"She is never up at that time of the night,\" Britt said. \"Never, never.\"\nGlenn Baxter's father and other family members gathered Monday morning at a relative's home, but declined interview requests.\nTempe Police spokesman Lt. Mike Pooley declined to say whether the deaths were the result of an accident.\nThe couple married in April 2012, and relatives said they separated several months ago.\nTamika Franklin, an aunt of Danica Baxter, described her as an excellent mother who adored her children. \"Everything she did was for her kids. Her kids were her life. She would never do anything to hurt her kids,\" she said as she began to cry.\n\"I can't explain it. It's hard burying anybody but to bury a whole family at once I just don't understand it,\" she said, shaking her and tearing up.\nThe parents and the two youngest children were pulled from the vehicle and brought to a hospital, where they later died. Investigators then determined the couple's oldest child was missing, and divers later retrieved the child's body from the still submerged vehicle.\nBroken glass and vehicle plastic could be seen Monday near the lake's shore. Two bouquets of flowers and a stuffed animal also were placed nearby.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:20:46.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
