Aiouna, an Algerian national, says the marketing aspect of the internship also allowed her to understand the importance of teamwork and communication.\n\"Interning in that company gave me a pre-taste of how that company functions and how it thinks to design interior spaces,\" says Aiouna.\nInternship opportunities like the one Aiouna took part in are offered at many Arab region universities and allow students to gain practical experience in their respective field. Many schools offer internships as part of their core curriculum, such as VCUQatar's interior design program, which requires students to complete a 120-hour internship, typically in their senior year.\n[See which universities have branch campuses in the Arab region. ]\nInternship network InternsME.com CEO Jean-Michel Gauthier said in an email that the benefits of an internship for Arab international students include gaining practical and on-the-ground work experience and the ability to \"apply theoretical knowledge to a real world environment.\" He said students can build contacts, develop their network and enhance their CV with related internships, projects and business references.\nGauthier said InternsME.com, based in the United Arab Emirates, provides more than 40,000 Middle East and North Africa-based enrollees with searchable internships, traineeships, and part-time and full-time jobs for grads at more than 500 regional employers.\n\"As a bottom line, the data shows students who've successfully completed one or more internships prior to graduating are more than twice as likely to secure their first full-time job within six months. It's a major employability booster,\" said Gauthier, whose company partners with more than 40 universities in the UAE like the American University of Sharjah , American University in Dubai, Hult International Business School Dubai, Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi and more.\nDuring her sophomore year at VCUQatar, Aiouna also completed a one-week internship at the Art Dubai Fair in the UAE that she heard about through friends. She interned at the dXb Store, a nonprofit retail space that showcases the work of UAE-based artists and designers.\n\"These artists were from different places of the world: Japan, Iraq, UAE, India and so forth,\" says Aiouna. \"This internship mainly allowed me to interact with artists from all over the world.\"\n[Explore how to make the most of studying abroad in the Arab region. ]\nAt the American University in Cairo , the office of Career Advising and Placement Services coordinates an internship program. Internships vary in duration and can be part time, full time, paid, unpaid or for credit. For example, engineering, computer science, and journalism and mass communication majors receive academic credit for related eight-week internships, according to AUC's website.\nNoman Ahmed Ashraf, a Pakistani-Yemeni student at AUC, says he applied to several internships that he found on the school's website and was accepted by AIESEC, an international student-run organization. In his internship, Ashraf, a political science major, helped with a local project that teaches orphans basic English language and math skills.\n\"My experience made me more confident and aware of my skills. It also taught me for the first time how to manage a lot of people throughout a whole day of activities, engagement and learning,\" says Ashraf. \"As I built my confidence and learned how to handle a tough situation, I do believe this will help me as a future lawyer or maybe even a diplomat.\"\n[Find out what career options Arab region politics students pursue. ]\nWork-study programs are another option, mainly at American-style universities . AUC's program allows sophomores, juniors and seniors the opportunity to participate in paid, on-campus work experiences for eight to 10 hours a week.
