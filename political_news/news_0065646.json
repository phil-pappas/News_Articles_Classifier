Text bigger Joe Biden \nA source who reportedly just came back from travels with Joe Biden’s son, Joseph Hunter, told WND the vice president will make an announcement about his presidential aspirations in the next 48 hours – and it will be in the affirmative. \nBiden’s delay, the source also said, was due to his reach-out to top Democrat donors who’ve not yet committed to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Biden reportedly wants to be able to boast significant top-dollar donor support at the time he makes his announcement. \nMedia scrutiny on Monday all pointed to the same conclusion – that Biden would indeed run. \nAnd one Capitol Hill congressman may have let the cat out of the bag, anyway. \nRep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania congressman, said in a Twitter message he knows Joe Biden will be announcing a run for the White House. \n“I have a very good source close to Joe that tells me VP Biden will run for Prez,” he tweeted. \nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!
