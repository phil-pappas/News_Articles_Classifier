The teachers told the children that this was when their continent was discovered by human beings. Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and imaginative lives on the continent in 1492. That was simply the year in which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them. The chief weapon of sea pirates, however, was their capacity to astonish. Nobody else could believe, until it was too late, how heartless and greedy they were.” - Kurt Vonnegut ◆ “Before our white brothers arrived to make us civilized men, we didn’t have any kind of prison. Because of this, we had no delinquents. Without a prison, there can be no delinquents. We had no locks nor keys and therefore among us there were no thieves. When someone was so poor that he couldn’t afford a horse, a tent or a blanket, he would, in that case, receive it all as a gift. We were too uncivilized to give great importance to private property. We didn’t know any kind of money and consequently, the value of a human being was not determined by his wealth. We had no written laws laid down, no lawyers, no politicians, therefore we were not able to cheat and swindle one another. We were really in bad shape before the white men arrived and I don’t know how to explain how we were able to manage without these fundamental things that (so they tell us) are so necessary for a civilized society.” - John (Fire) Lame Deer, Sioux Lakota – 1903-1976 ◆\n“This we know …\nThe earth does not belong to man; man belongs to the earth.\nAll things are connected like the blood that unites one family.\nMan did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it.\nWhatever he does to the web he does to himself.”\n- Chief Seattle\n◆\n ”Only after the last tree has been cut down;\nOnly after the last fish has been caught;\nOnly after the last river has been poisoned;\nOnly then will you realize that money cannot be eaten.”\n- Cree Indian Prophecy", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunningcauseICantFly/~4/zdqM1WchVqg"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:50:23.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
