It was meant to be the ultimate opening for Republicans to find evidence of negligence by the former secretary of state.\nBut in the days leading up to it, expectations fell flat. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy had suggested in a Fox News interview that the committee was created to do political damage to Clinton, rather than to get to the bottom of why there wasn't sufficient security when the compound fell under attack.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ The actual hearing elicited little of anything new, as stated by the committee chairman, Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy. \"I don't know that she testified that much differently today than she has the previous time she testified,\" Gowdy said after the grilling was over, referring to a previous testimony from Clinton on Benghazi in 2013.\n  Boehner creates new panel to probe Planned Parenthood John Boehner appointed eight GOP lawmakers to spearhead the new panel to investigate the abortion provider.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 10/23/15 11:45 AM Conservatives in the political media agreed .\n\"The hearings are a waste of time because everything about it is politicized and nothing is going to happen,\" wrote conservative radio host and blogger Erick Erickson. \"There will be no scalp collection ... Most of the rest of the committee just wants to grandstand for the folks back home as either prosecutors of or defenders of Hillary Clinton.\"\nRepublicans spent much of the hearing questioning Clinton on emails she had received during her tenure at the State Department from her friend Sidney Blumenthal. He had emailed Clinton regularly and offered advice on matters in Libya. Republicans pointed out that no emails appeared to have come from Libya Ambassador Chris Stevens, who died in the attack.\nBut that point didn't seem to resonate for conservative pundits.\n\"The fact that Sid had the email address and the ambassador didn't is a point but it's a very minor point,\" conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said Thursday on Fox News. \"It's not going to persuade anybody.\" He said that Gowdy \"wasted a lot of his valuable time\" on the issue.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obama fundraiser, Julian Castro patron indicted on fraud charges Mikal Watts has given $2.3 million to Democratic causes and candidates over the years.\nBy Timothy P.
