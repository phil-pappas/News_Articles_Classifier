Now, because of their civil lawsuit against the store that sold the gun, the incident may have a lasting legal impact too. On Tuesday, a jury ordered gun store Badger Guns to pay $6 million for its role in an illegal gun sale, which ultimately led to both officers getting shot in the face. More importantly, the jury found Badger Guns to have been negligent in making that sale, and therefore liable for the shooting that left Norbergs teeth shattered and Kunisch without an eye and part of his brain. Though the store is expected to appeal, the ruling could alter current gun law precedent that gives gun stores like Badger Guns wide-ranging immunity when a firearm they sell is involved in a crime. This is not a case about the Second Amendment, the officers attorney Patrick Dunphy said before the court last week. Instead, he said, its about making sure gun stores know without a doubt that their weapons are not being sold illegally. In this case, the gun that put bullets in both Norbergs and Kunischs faces was not purchased by the shooter, but by a different person who eventually sold it to the shooter  something called a straw purchase. And according to the officers lawsuit, there were clear signs that the purchaser intended to sell the gun from the start. Loopholes maimed these two officers. Gee, let's hear the republican argument again for allowing felons, gang members and the mentally ill the LEGAL right to own guns Thanks from Camelot and Lyzza Location: Tejas. Posts: 28,781 Another lying propaganda piece by thinkprogress and one of its grossly unqualified \"reporters\" Emily Atkin with no education regarding the law, and this is about the law. This was a single gun store that was warned that the gun sold was a straw purchase and they sold the gun anyway. It has nothing to do with the gun industry, but a single privately owned business that violated the law. There is nothing in this ruling that will have a single impact on current gun law precedent. This is no different than a privately owned liquor store selling alcohol to a minor knowing they were using a fake ID.

That troll doesn't even read his own posted articles!!! LOL!

You can't wiggle out of this...unless you're going to show everyone you're a liar.

The cases trial and verdict came in the wake of another mass shooting, when America is yet again debating what to do about gun violence and yet again paralyzed in political crossfire. Theres been no indication that gun control laws of any sort will be taken up by Congress any time soon  in fact, from the party that currently controls both houses, calls have been instead for less restrictive gun laws, allowing more access and proliferation. But now, Tuesdays verdict may offer a tiny glimmer of hope for some who advocate gun control. A 2005 law backed by the National Rifle Association gave gun manufacturers and dealers broad immunity from being sued  a unique protection for the industry. That law, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), has been long condemned by gun control advocates who say that it should be easier to hold manufacturers and stores liable for crimes that involve their weapons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:40:44.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
