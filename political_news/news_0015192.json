(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) By Editorial Board October 6 at 7:44 PM THIRTY-FIVE years ago, Americans were transfixed by the drama of 52 U.S. diplomats and other citizens being held as prisoners in the U.S. embassy in Iran. Those hostages had been taken on Nov. 4, 1979, and were not freed until Jan. 20, 1981 — 444 days. On Friday, The Post’s Jason Rezaian, a U.S. citizen and journalist seized in his home on July 22, 2014, could spend his 445th day in detention. Held in violation of Iran’s own laws, not to mention international conventions, he has become another de facto hostage.\nThe case of Mr. Rezaian is less spectacular, superficially, than that of the U.S. diplomats. They saw the Tehran embassy overrun by a mob of militant students, while Mr. Rezaian faces criminal charges — albeit false charges manufactured months after his arrest — and has been unlawfully imprisoned. Over time, the pretense of legal process attached to The Post reporter’s case, which was flimsy to begin with, has crumbled altogether. By Iranian law, Mr. Rezaian should have been released on bail after a year of detention, since he had not been sentenced for a crime; he wasn’t. He should have been informed of a verdict within one week of the end of his trial on Aug. 10, but nearly two months later, none has been announced.\nSince it was presented at a closed trial — once again, in violation of Iranian law — what we know of the “evidence” against Mr. Rezaian is scant. But what has been reported in the Iranian media has been beyond ludicrous. On Sunday, a spokesman for an Iranian parliamentary committee told the official Fars News Agency that an intelligence report by the Revolutionary Guard identified Mr. Rezaian as part of a conspiracy to bring down the Iranian government by the sinister means of improving bilateral relations. “Jason Rezaian has had the duty to exercise the thoughts of those people in the U.S. Senate who believe that if the U.S. can revive its pre-Revolution relations with Iran, the Iranian government can be overthrown easily,” Fars Quote: d the spokesman as saying .\nLast week in New York, President Hassan Rouhani", "external_links": ["http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13940712001397"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T03:10:42.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
