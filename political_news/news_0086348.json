Businesses could hire more people to make up the required business hours and people could get shift flexibility.It could also open the possibility of additional over time hours.On top of that people who don't 'need' to work 37.5 or 40 hours could trim down and have more free time without having to go part-time.I have thought for a while that this could work its way to our shores as a way of getting more in to work.... ie. its a way of dividing out the existing available jobs so that two people could be in the same job position covering the same job. And with that it could see the rise of more businesses becoming 24 hour operations instead of a 9 to 5. Except the people working 6 hour days would have to reduce to 3/4 of their income in order to afford the additional hires and overtime you mention.Or are you a \"magic money tree\" person? Yes... Im not getting that at all... small business needs to hire a new member of staff for every 3 it currently has, which in turn is going to cost them a lot more in hidden costs that employees have fk all knowledge about as proven above... Imagine you had 300 staff and thats all the building you have takes, you now need to hire another 100 to make up the short fall in hours worked.f", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:45:19.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
