Richards/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images With House Republicans in disarray after John Boehner’s likely successor withdrew from the Speaker’s race Thursday, speculation has grown about potential damage to the party’s chances in the 2016 election. Will voters punish the G.O.P. for the actions of a conservative faction that blocked Kevin McCarthy’s ascension and has been willing to repeatedly risk government shutdowns in confrontations with President Obama?\nRecent history suggests that the political costs of turmoil and confrontation for the G.O.P. are likely to be minimal.\nThe most obvious point of comparison is the sequence of events after the 1998 midterm elections, when poor results caused Newt Gingrich to resign as House Speaker and Bob Livingston was forced to withdraw his candidacy to replace him. (Dennis Hastert eventually took over.)\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Top Republicans Appeal to Ryan to Seek Speaker’s Job and Unify Party OCT. 9, 2015 News Analysis: House, and a Republican Party, Divided Against Itself OCT. 8, 2015 Daniel Webster Wins Conservative Republicans’ Endorsement for House Speaker OCT. 8, 2015 Despite the turmoil, the House impeached President Bill Clinton in December over the objections of a majority of the public. At the time, many observers thought the backlash against the impeachment proceedings and the perceived extremism of congressional Republicans would damage the G.O.P. in the 2000 election. Expectations about whether Mr. Hastert could manage to unite his “badly divided” and “split, often combative party” were similarly pessimistic.\nBut Republicans suffered few ill effects despite trying and failing to remove President Clinton from office. The party quickly fell back into line behind George W. Bush, who significantly outperformed political science forecasts and won the presidency in 2000, an election in which the G.O.P. also maintained control of both houses of Congress. (For his part, Mr. Hastert eventually served as Speaker for longer than any other Republican in American history while maintaining high levels of unity in Congress.)\nThe reality is that few Americans pay close attention to Congress — many cannot even name the Speaker of the House — and most legislators represent safe seats. Moreover, presidential elections are largely determined by other factors such as the state of the economy. Republicans certainly need to get their house in order, but the reasons to do so have less to do with the 2016 election than with the need to maintain order in a chamber they ostensibly control.\nPolitical News, Now.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/gingrich110798.htm", "http://www.cq.com/graphics/weekly/2011/01/03/wr20110103-01unity-cht4.pdf", "http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_28941382/mercury-news-editorial-kevin-mccarthys-sudden-rise-and", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/hastert041799.htm", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1999/01/10/strategists-fear-a-toll-on-gop-in-future/69aa8d2a-9c15-43c8-907e-41efb3ea38a3/", "http://articles.latimes.com/1999/jan/06/news/mn-60715", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/09/us/09webster-web/09webster-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/08/opinion/op-40582", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/upshot/10UP-Nyhan/10UP-Nyhan-superJumbo.jpg", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/poll021599.htm", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/09/us/09assess-web/09assess-web-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/08/how-many-americans-even-know-who-the-speaker-of-the-house-is/?postshare=1331444334834951", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-struggle-to-regain-their-footing-as-a-party/2015/10/08/ed24da96-6de1-11e5-9bfe-e59f5e244f92_story.html", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/09/us/09Congress1_hp/09Congress1_hp-thumbStandard.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/govt/leadership/stories/hastert010599.htm", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/upshot/10UP-Nyhan/10UP-Nyhan-blog225.jpg", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-men-who-almost-became-speaker-of-the-house/"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:10:55.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
