Comment mlawrence@s-t.com Posted Sep. 29, 2015 at 8:00 am Updated Sep 29, 2015 at 8:54 AM Ian Abreu Occupation: Manager of workforce and business development, New Bedford Area Chamber of Commerce Education: B.A., communication studies, Bridgewater State University Final year, Institute of Organization Management, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation program, Villanova University Quotable: “We need to grow the tax base by getting more businesses here in New Bedford.” NEW BEDFORD — Ask Ian Abreu a single question about local civic affairs and he’ll talk for the next 10 minutes, addressing the original topic and several others that come to mind along the way. And most of that conversation will focus on positive points about New Bedford. The 30-year-old workforce and business development manager for the New Bedford Area Chamber of Commerce is a passionate advocate of the city. “We’re still riding some pretty good momentum,” he said one morning earlier this month, after a chamber-sponsored Good Morning SouthCoast event at the Wamsutta Club. Abreu said the recent loss of the casino proposal on the waterfront and the slow development of wind power uses for the Marine Commerce Terminal, for example, are far from insurmountable setbacks. Rather, he said, they point to the increased need for economic “singles and doubles,” unabashedly borrowing a baseball analogy commonly used by Mayor Jon Mitchell. Abreu said creating a more streamlined permitting process for new businesses and working to reduce energy costs can help spur ground-level growth in New Bedford, across the entire city. “All of New Bedford is open for business, not just downtown,” he said, citing a need to boost marketing and promotion of New Bedford attractions. Abreu, a South End native, ran for the Ward 6 seat in 2009 and 2011, and for an at-large seat in 2013. His vision for City Council service extends well beyond economic development. Abreu is very active in advocating for South Coast Rail, for example, and said potential shortfalls in Fire Department funding could be addressed by consolidating aging stations in locations that could better serve inland parts of the city. But his work for business growth extends beyond his chamber job. Dena Haden, co-founder of the Groundwork collaborative work space in the Quest Center north of downtown, said Abreu has been an invaluable asset to helping the business become a launching pad for local startups and entrepreneurs. “He’s just so passionate about New Bedford and really making connections within the community,” Haden said. “I think that would definitely translate over (to City Hall) — we’re all for him.” Follow Mike Lawrence on Twitter @MikeLawrenceSCT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:30:39.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
