Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull accused the Labor opposition of trying to \"scare people into poverty\" as he advanced the case for lower penalty rates but promised any change would be taken to the next election.\nMr Turnbull, who last week left open a trade-off of tax credits in return for lower rates of pay on weekends, told Parliament on Monday that whatever the government decided to do, it would be mindful that people had to be better off in net terms.\nHe was backed by Treasurer Scott Morrison who indicated that lowering weekend rates would lead to greater employment.\n\"We need to do everything we can to get young people into jobs,\" Mr Morrison said. \"We are prepared to consider the options that are necessary to put young people into jobs.\"\nWith 4.5 million workers in some way dependent on penalty rates, Labor is seeking to use the government's preparedness to \"cut pay\" as a way of getting at Mr Turnbull who has restored the Coalition to a competitive position in the polls.\nA Newspoll published on Monday finds the Coalition tied 50-50 on the two-party preferred vote. Mr Turnbull is vastly more popular than Bill Shorten. He leads as preferred prime minister by 57 per cent to 29 per cent and has a much higher approval rating.\nThe poll found a majority of voters, or 62 per cent, supported the removal of Tony Abbott for Mr Turnbull and 27 per cent were opposed.\nAdventurous Related Mr Abbott had refused to entertain changing the law to lower penalty rates, saying it was a matter for employers to argue before the Fair Work Commission.\nMr Turnbull has been more adventurous and on Monday highlighted examples where businesses had already traded away weekend rates for higher overall rates of pay.\n\"Businesses like McDonald's and Coles have reduced or removed penalty rates in exchange for other conditions like higher base rates of pay,\" he said. \"Now we will all enjoy and benefit from solutions that create a more flexible and dynamic 21st century economy.\"\nHe stressed it was \"perfectly reasonable\" for workers to expect to be \"better off\" as a consequence of change and that any change the government chose to make would be put to voters first.\n\"So really it is time for the Leader of the Opposition to stop trying to frighten Australians into poverty,\" he said.\nWhile Labor was bracing for a poll boost to the Coalition under Mr Turnbull, the fact that it has not generated an election-winning lead has buoyed the opposition.\nPoll boost A 50-50 result on election day would still represent a 3 percentage point swing against the Coalition from the 2013 election, costing it up to 14 seats and leaving it hanging on to government by a thread.\nSenior Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese suggested the poll boost for Mr Turnbull had peaked. \"The honeymoon is over for Malcolm Turnbull. People will have a look at the substance,\" he said.\n\"Malcolm Turnbull is a superficial politician. When people look at something shiny and new, they tend to be interested in it. But the policies are the same.\"\nMr Turnbull was heckled by a small section of the crowd at a NSW Liberal Party meeting on Saturday when he suggested the party was not run by factions.\nOverall, he was well received and Mr Abbott told the audience the country didn't need six prime ministers in six years. He said that was incumbent upon Liberals, regardless of how they felt about the spill, to unify and support Mr Turnbull.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:45:37.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
