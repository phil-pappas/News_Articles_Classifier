Some opportunistic Republicans have even contacted the governor’s staff and the local GOP leader, jockeying to be named Hawk’s replacement should she resign.\nOne former employee said she’s working on a petition to oust Hawk from office for incompetence.\nMeanwhile, Democrats and Republicans alike have called on her to step down for the good of the county.\n“Dallas County needs a DA who is physically present in order to handle the tremendous day-to-day responsibilities of that office,” said former state Rep. Stefani Carter, R-Dallas.\nIn a short but strongly worded statement Thursday, Hawk defended herself for the first time in weeks and said she’s not going anywhere.\n“I welcome the opportunity to prove my ability to do my job. I’m healthier and stronger than ever, and I’m excited to get to work,” the statement read. “I did not choose to have a mental illness, but I did make the choice to confront it and take on the hard job of recovery.”\nSharp change As she stages her comeback, Hawk will have to make the jarring transition from a highly controlled hospital environment to a high-stress, high-profile job, experts say.\nHer political adviser said Hawk was staying at an in-state treatment facility while away. She has probably undergone intensive treatment, including medication adjustments, individual and group therapy, and regular observation by hospital staff, said two mental health experts who did not have direct knowledge of Hawk’s situation but described the typical process for in-patient care.\nTo warrant a hospital stay, they said, the patient typically must get a referral and be dealing with a crisis, such as suicidal thoughts, or have a history of failed depression treatment.\nDuring initial treatment, doctors typically conduct a full psychological battery of tests and a nurse checks on the patient regularly, as often as every 10 minutes in severe cases, said Jerry Grammer, a clinical psychologist who practices in Austin.\nThen, he said, a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker and possibly a substance abuse specialist get together to create a treatment plan tailored to the patient’s needs. He said the average length of stay is between 20 and 25 days.\nAs Hawk resumes normal life, Grammer recommends that she “ease back” into her job to avoid a relapse.\n“She really needs to take care of herself,” he said.\nBut Madhukar Trivedi, a psychiatrist at UT Southwestern Medical Center, said people can “absolutely” go back to work immediately after in-patient treatment.\n“One good thing about patients with depression is when the right treatment is instituted, the improvement can be very significant,” he said.\nPolitically, though, Hawk’s return could prove trickier.\nCal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, criticized Hawk for trying to hide her problems and said it would take a “real change in strategy” for her to earn back the public’s trust.\nHawk’s representatives initially said the district attorney was taking “time off” and on a “summer break.” After The Dallas Morning News reported that she had been off work without explanation, Hawk announced she was suffering from depression.\n“They have been secretive at every turn. They have misrepresented and misdescribed circumstances so long as they thought they could — and when flushed out, grudgingly chosen the truth,” Jillson said.\nTough turnaround To be taken seriously upon her return, Hawk would have to stabilize the high turnover in her administration and launch “interesting and important” programs to draw attention to her office’s work, he said.\nEven then, he called the idea that she’d be able to win re-election a “fantasy.”\nIt’s difficult to remove a sitting district attorney from office. Hawk was chosen by a vote of the people, and the law gives her protection from frivolous political attacks.\nThere’s a rarely used provision that allows nearly any Dallas County resident to file a petition to remove an elected official from office on grounds that include incompetence or official misconduct.\nCindy Stormer, a high-ranking prosecutor who accused Hawk of financial misconduct and paranoia after being fired last week, said this week that she’s considering that option and could file a petition as soon as next week.\nMore likely, Hawk would have to resign and Gov. Greg Abbott would appoint a replacement.\nAn Abbott aide said this week that he has received calls from Dallas County lawyers interested in succeeding Hawk, but a spokesman for the governor said Abbott is not actively seeking candidates. He said the appointment process typically begins after a vacancy.\nDallas County Republican Party Chairman Wade Emmert said several people have contacted him to “put in a good word for them with the governor.” But he said he’s not going to do that while Hawk is the district attorney.\n“I am not going to sacrifice the party for one person, but neither am I going to run scared because one of our elected officials is dealing with a medical issue,” Emmert said. “I have every expectation Susan will return and do a great job as district attorney.”\nAs the odds-making over whether Hawk will return to work captivates courthouse regulars, the answer probably lies solely with Hawk, whose statement Thursday made her intentions clear.\n“I just want the opportunity to come back and do my job.”\nIF HAWK LEAVES / POSSIBLE SCENARIOS Dallas County District Attorney Susan Hawk has given no indication that she plans to leave office before the end of her term. But as speculation brews over her future, here are two possible scenarios for her leaving and who might be in line to replace her.\nThe less likely scenario: A petition to remove her from office\nA rarely used provision of the law allows nearly any county resident to file a removal petition on grounds of: incompetency, official misconduct, or drunkenness on or off duty.\nFired administrative chief Cindy Stormer said she’s pursuing a petition based on incompetency. That’s defined as gross ignorance of or carelessness in her duties, or an unfitness to do the job because of a physical or mental defect that did not exist when Hawk was elected.\nStormer believes Hawk fits all three conditions and specifically cited the new level of mental health issues Hawk has faced since taking office.\nA judge would have to agree to order Hawk to appear in court, and she would eventually have a trial by jury. This option is unlikely because the law requires an extremely high bar to prove the allegation.\nA more likely scenario: A gubernatorial appointment\nHawk would have to resign for Gov. Greg Abbott to appoint a replacement. The timing of her resignation, however, could affect the political playing field.\nIf Hawk resigns before the ballot is set for the March 1 primaries later this year, Abbott would appoint a temporary replacement, presumably a Republican. Then Republicans and Democrats would duke it out in a special election. The victor would become district attorney until Hawk’s original term ends in 2018.\nBut if Hawk resigns after the primary ballot closes, precinct leaders from both parties would pick candidates for the November general election.\nFinally, if Hawk resigns too late for an election in November, Abbott would appoint someone to fill her unexpired term without the candidate going before voters.\nPossible replacements:\nAbbott could appoint Hawk’s second in command Messina Madson .\nThere’s an array of Republicans who could also be considered. Former state District Judge Jennifer Balido was a top prosecutor under Hawk until Hawk fired her in February. Former state District Judge Danny Clancy sought the office in 2010. Former state District Judge Vickers Cunningham , who made some campaign appearances for Hawk, is also an option.\nBut some observers say Abbott could lean toward a new face, perhaps a Hispanic or black resident. Choices could include state Rep. Jason Villalba , R-Dallas.\nAs for Democrats who could run in an election, former first assistant district attorney Heath Harris is already a candidate for district attorney. Craig Watkins , Harris’ old boss, said he’s also considering trying to recapture his seat. Other possible contenders who haven’t indicated whether they might run include former state District Judge John Creuzot and current state District Judges Elizabeth Frizell and Brandon Birmingham .\nGromer Jeffers Jr. and Sarah Mervosh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:25:25.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
