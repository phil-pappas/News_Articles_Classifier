Forson Nkrumah, an Assembly member for the Adumasa Amasu Electoral Area, had raised an objection to the sudden increase in the constitution of government appointees from 10 to 14, who were selected as members together with the 30 newly elected assembly members some weeks ago. \nMr. Peter Maala, the Municipal Coordinating Director, had announced that there was an error in the formula used in calculating the number of government appointees initially. \nExplaining reasons for the addition of four new members to the 10 already appointed by the government, Mr. Christian Boafo Offeh, the Municipal Electoral Officer, said the Assembly was mandated by the NALAG Act 462 Section 5(1) not to appoint any member not exceeding 30 per cent of the elected house. \nHe added that the law gave an upper ceiling within which the Assembly could reach in the choice of its government appointees to serve in the Assembly body. \nIn his victory speech, Barimah Yeboah Kordie, thanked all the Assembly members for the confidence reposed in him and urged them to support him to push the development agenda of the Municipality forward. \nHe was later sworn into office by the Dormaa Circuit Court Judge. \nMr. Kwaku Agyemang Manu, the Member of Parliament for the Dormaa Central Constituency who is a member of the Assembly was, however, not present to cast his ballot. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:05:50.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
