The news sparked suitable outrage, but one man decided to take a stand.Iqbal Latif, who runs 26 franchises of international food outlet Dunkin Donuts in Islamabad, Lahore and Peshawar, took a step to show how Pakistanis welcome their neighbours. Taking the lead Within hours of the report of the Pakistani family being denied accommodation, his food outlets had banners with an announcement offering free meals to any Indians visiting Pakistan on a short-term visa. The banner was inscribed with Indian and Pakistani flags as well.“I felt bad when I saw this that family had to spend a part of the night on footpath near a police station and another part at a pavement at the railway station,” said Latif. “The offer is not a big deal, but an effort to invoke the teachings of Gandhiji who preached love and coexistence all his life.”The response to Latif's initiative was overwhelmingly positive since the offer came into effect on October 16. “We served 2,432 people in Peshawar, Islamabad and Lahore. They all loved it,” Latif said. Sales went up by 30% since the day the offer was introduced.On the first day of the offer, 17 meals were served to Indians at a Dunkin Donuts outlet in the Diplomatic Enclave of Islamabad. “This is the place where US State Secretary John Kerry had breakfast last year. But we feel great honour [in hosting our] Indian friends,” Latif said. Waiting with open arms Elsewhere in Lahore and Peshawar, no Indian visited to avail a free meal. “We’re waiting to treat Indians with a big heart and a big smile,” said Tehmina, who works at the Liberty Market outlet in Lahore. She said that a couple of passersby glanced at the poster and waved a high five at the staff.Latif was elated by the response to the offer, and sees it as vital for promoting love among the people of Pakistan and India. He said he was slightly apprehensive about the reaction in Peshawar to the display of the Indian flag, but visitors and passersby waved at the staff, a sign of approval.“Where is the hate and stone-throwing of the Shiv Sena? Only a degenerated mind does it. We need to tell Shiv Sena to grow up. Love conquers all,” Latif said. The bigger picture Though the Pakistani and Indian public are more willing to be friends, states and armies on either side don't see eye to eye and often hit the headlines for trading shells and accusations at borders and international forums.On Saturday, Pakistani intelligence reports suggested that India intelligence agency RAW could target Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Jamaat-ud-Dawa head Hafiz Saeed.Earlier last week, former Pakistani foreign minister Khurshid Kasuri was the target of threats from hardline Shiv Sena activists on October 12 in Mumbai ahead his book launch. The host of the event, Sudheendra Kulkarni, was painted black.A few days before that, the Shiv Sena hurled threats, which resulted in the cancellation of the planned performance of ghazal legend Ghulam Ali in Mumbai on October 8.But Latif said his peace initiative has not met with any interference from any Pakistani intelligence agency. \"No ISI, no intelligence came to us to ask about the display of the Indian flag,” he said. He added that some of his friends in the army even called him to appreciate his gesture.He said Pakistan has shown its love for Indians. “Across the border, there is no hate. We all love India. We are only marginalised by a few hate mongers on both sides. I propose such initiatives on the people-to-people level [to] help make bridges,” he said, adding that both Pakistan and India are nuclear countries that cannot afford strained relations.“I suggest that Indian food chains put this offer on display in India, and see if [their] business goes up or drops,” he said.
