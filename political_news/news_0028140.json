Coker said the register compiled few weeks ago contains foreign voters suspected to be NPP. \nHe added the register will be opened very soon for the party to sift through it by identifying NPP supporters and removing their names from the register. \nIn the Eastern Region, the NDC Chair Bismark Tawiah Boateng is threatening to arrest persons he suspects will vote against President John Mahama's candidature on November 7. \nWith John Mahama as the sole candidate for the presidential slot, party members are expected to endorse his candidature but Tawiah Boateng is convinced some sympathisers of the NPP who have infiltrated the NDC voter's register are planning to vote against the president. \nAddressing Branch and Constituency executives at an outreach programme to endorse the candidature of the president in the Lower Manya Krobo Constituency, Bismark Tawiah Boateng said anybody who goes against the party's directive by opposing the candidature of the president will be dealt with. \nThe NPP is meanwhile yet to comment on the allegation.
