The Baltimore City Council met Tuesday evening to discuss how to allocate federal funding for body cameras for city police. \nAt City Hall, there is concern among some councilmembers about the city's police body camera pilot program that's supposed to begin next week. Police Body Cameras Police glasses cams capture... \nBrekford Corporation was one of the companies that couldn't fix the city's error-filled speed camera program, and it's in the final group competing to win the city's body cams contract. \nThree years ago, Maryland-based Brekford Corporation tried to clean up the multimillion dollar speed camera mess left behind by Xerox, which is the company that got most of the blame for Baltimore's faulty speed camera system, one that's still not operating. \nAn audit showed the cameras repeatedly issued erroneous tickets, some for slow-moving or stopped cars. \nBrekford came in, but it also performed poorly during its testing period, and the city paid $500,000 to cut ties. \n\"Well, it's one thing to have problems with traffic. It's another to have problems that you can't fix with public safety,\" City Councilwoman Mary Pat Clarke said. \nNow, Brekford is back trying to win another multimillion dollar city contract for police body cameras. \nBrekford is one of three final companies chosen by the city to compete for the next few months during the pilot program where 155 officers will wear them. \n\"Does it makes sense to choose Brekford as a top three finalists for the body camera program?\" 11 News reporter George Lettis asked. \n\"Absolutely not. I think there should have been a penalty that said, 'Brekford, go out and prove how well you can function in other jurisdictions, other than Baltimore, because our experience with you was pretty bad,'\" Councilman Carl Stokes said. \nA spokesman for the mayor said Brekford performed well in a technical scoring process. It beat out seven other companies vying to be included in the body camera pilot program. \nOn its body camera system, Brekford said, \"We have worked tirelessly with Panasonic and Microsoft, two of the largest and most respected technology companies in the world, to meet the city's requirements for an integrated video evidence management solution.\" \nThe city's Board of Estimates has the final approval of the body camera contract winner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:42:09.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
