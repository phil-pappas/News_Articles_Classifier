New home sales slumped last month, according to a report released Monday by the Census Bureau.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 26, 2015 | 11:52 a.m. EDT + More Analysts expected new home sales to tick down slightly in September following August's originally reported seven-year high. But few expected last month's housing numbers to drop off as dramatically as they did.\nSales of new single-family homes last month clocked in at an annual rate of just 468,000, according to a report released Monday by the Census Bureau . That's down 11.5 percent month over month and up only 2 percent from September 2014. Last month was the worst month for new home sales so far this year, and its numbers fell well short of analysts' expectations. Most expected the monthly total to clock in somewhere between 540,000 and 550,000 units.\nWhat's more, August's originally reported 552,000 sales were revised down sharply to 529,000. The correction erased August's status as the best month for new home sales in seven years, instead making it only the second-best month so far in 2015.\nSee Photos\n5 Things to Know About the Economy This Week: 10/23/2015 \"New home sales in September fell nearly 12% from a downward revision in the sales pace for August,\" Kristin Reynolds, senior principal economist at IHS Economics, wrote in a research note Monday. \"This may look dramatic, but data on new home sales are volatile and the confidence band around this number is large.\"\nMonday's soft housing report appears to be an isolated incident. The National Association of Realtors last week published a separate existing home sales report, which showed such sales up 4.7 percent month over month in September and up 8.8 percent year over year. Existing home sales, which make up a proportionally larger sale of the country's total home sales, have posted year-over-year gains for 12 consecutive months.\n\"All regions of the country saw gains in September, with the Northeast and Midwest nearly 12 percent ahead of their year-earlier pace,\" Reynolds wrote in a research note Thursday. \"The housing market, like the U.S. economy, is chugging along.\nAnd a builder sentiment index from the National Association of Home Builders in October rose to a 10-year high, according to a report published last week. Thanks to rising buyer traffic and improving business outlooks, home builders haven't been this bullish about the housing market since the housing bubble was expanding before the Great Recession.\nRELATED\nStudy: Climate Change Could Make Workers Less Productive September's housing starts data released Tuesday seemed to support rising builder sentiment, as housing starts climbed 6.5 percent month over month and 17.5 percent from September 2014. Housing completions in September were also up 7.5 percent from August and 8.4 percent year over year.\n\"Single-family starts edged higher, and the volatile multi-family category surged 18 percent,\" a team of IHS economists wrote in a research note Friday. \"While the trajectory may not be a straight line, the housing market continues to improve at a measured pace.\"\nBut the multi-family construction segment of the report, which includes group housing structures like apartment buildings, has largely led monthly gains so far this year, as rental occupancy sits near all-time highs while the national homeownership rate hovers near historic lows. Home prices have risen demonstrably so far this year, which has in part hindered aspiring first-time homeowners from entering the market. First-time buyers of existing structures made up only 28 percent of all buyers last month. A year ago, the demographic represented 29 percent of all buyers.\n\"The fact that first-time buyers represented a lower share of the market compared to a year ago even though sales are considerably higher is indicative of the challenges many young adults continue to face,\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said in a statement last week. \"Rising rents and flat wage growth make it difficult for many to save for a downpayment, and the dearth of supply in affordable price ranges is limiting their options.\"\nSee Photos\nThe Economics of Underwear Sales, Haircuts and Other Bizarre Indicators New housing units could help alleviate pricing pressures by introducing new living options to consumers. If more houses pop up in a desirable area, those trying to sell nearby homes won't be able to ratchet up prices nearly as much as if supply were limited. So it's a good sign that home construction is exhibiting continued good health.\nAnd while Monday's underwhelming new home sales data is a little alarming, it's important to put the numbers into perspective. Existing home sales account for a far greater share of overall real estate transactions, and September was a month during which many expected a Federal Reserve interest rate hike that would have made mortgage payments more expensive. Given the country's prolonged period of low interest rates that's expected to extend beyond October and possibly into next year, it's likely next month's sales numbers will show marked improvement as the domestic housing market continues to shine.\n\"Against the backdrop of waning employment and nonexistent inflation, the U.S. housing market appears to be the sole silver lining in the recovery as of late,\" Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, wrote in a research note last week. \"The housing market, however, while a positive contribution to headline activity, will not be enough to propel the economy beyond this stagnant 2 percent growth pace.\"\nTAGS: housing market economy new home sales", "external_links": ["http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf", "https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf", "http://www.realtor.org/news-releases/2015/08/existing-home-sales-maintain-solid-growth-in-july", "http://www.nahb.org/en/research/housing-economics/housing-indexes/housing-market-index.aspx", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek77b%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://economistsoutlook.blogs.realtor.org/2015/10/23/september-existing-home-sales/", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek77b%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek77b%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Housing%20Market%20Slammed%20by%20Soft%20September%20Sales", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek77b%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Housing%20Market%20Slammed%20by%20Soft%20September%20Sales", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek77b%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek77b%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Housing%20Market%20Slammed%20by%20Soft%20September%20Sales&summary=September%20was%20the%20worst%20month%20for%20new%20home%20sales%20so%20far%20this%20year.&source=U.%20S.%20News"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:17:54.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
