Paul Ryan plans to run for speaker.\nLawmakers have been in a holding pattern over the past week after a shocking series of events left them without a long-term leader. Speaker John Boehner (BAY'nuhr) announced his plans to resign, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy abruptly withdrew from the race to replace him.\nThat left Ryan, the party's 2012 vice presidential nominee, as the one lawmaker seen capable of uniting a House at war with itself. He doesn't want the job - but under pressure from party leaders has spent the congressional recess week at home in Wisconsin thinking it over.\nTuesday's meeting behind closed doors offers lawmakers the first opportunity to hear from Ryan directly.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:08:07.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
