Aired 10/15/15 on KPBS Midday Edition . \n'Upward Mobility' Highlighted During Black American Convention In San Diego \nGUEST: Transcript The Black American Political Association of California will hold its 37th annual convention in San Diego Oct. 16-18, 2015. \nThe Black American Political Association of California will hold its convention in San Diego this weekend. The theme of the 37th annual convention is about the middle class and whether upward mobility for black Americans is still possible. \n\"Keep in mind the old saying — when white America sneezes that means black people have pneumonia,\" said Willie Blair, chairman of the San Diego chapter of the BAPAC. \"As you talk about the shrinking middle class for all America, you’re talking about a very elusive dream for black people.\" \nBlair said when the economy tanks, black people are most affected. \n“There are certain things that prevent blacks from transitioning into the middle class,” Blair told KPBS Midday Edition on Thursday. “Because past discrimination deprives the black community of education benefits, employment benefits. It’s exacerbated when the economy is down.” \nBlair said the black community can overcome these challenges by joining forces with unions or the Latino community. \n“One of the workshops at the convention will be a dialogue of the black and Latino communities,” Blair said. “They both must understand if one rises up, the other must rise up.” \n“The struggle still continues,” he said. “Where do we go after the civil rights movement? What is the path to take?” \nThe convention takes place at the Four Points Sheraton at 8110 Aero Drive in San Diego. For more information, go to bapacsd.org .
