Promoted stories \nCritics of the appointment have pointed to a 2013 article in which Mr Milne suggested that the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby \"wasn't terrorism in the normal sense of an indiscriminate attack on civilians\" because the soldier had served in Afghanistan. \nHe said such attacks were \"the predicted consequence of an avalanche of violence unleashed by the US, Britain and others in eight direct military interventions in Arab and Muslim countries that have left hundreds of thousands of dead. \n\"Only the wilfully blind or ignorant can be shocked when there is blowback from that onslaught at home. The surprise should be that there haven't been more such atrocities.\" \nHe has publicly backed Mr Corbyn's opposition to the renewal of the UK's nuclear deterrent, saying the Trident missiles were \"neither independently, plausibly nor legally usable in any conceivable 21st-century conflict, but are instead an exorbitantly expensive hi-tech make-work scheme and status symbol for British officials\". \nMr Danczuk told The Sun: \"This is a totally bizarre appointment of a man more likely to become the story rather than control our party's message.\" \nIn a pointed response to a Twitter post calling reports of Mr Milne's appointment \"insane\", Mr Woodcock wrote: \"Yes, am sure this can't be true. Just right wing papers making mischief.\" \n\"We finally have Tory MPs squirming over the vote on tax credit cuts and we unleash more process barminess to divert attention. So fed up,\" he went on. \n\"This is not some middle class columnista parlour game, it is people's lives who are being wrecked by the Tories. They deserve better. Share article \n\"And now think it is probably in everyone's interests that I turn my phone off for the evening. Including mine,\" he concluded. \nMr Corbyn wrote on Twitter: \"Delighted to welcome Seamus Milne to the team! Thanks Seamus!\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:04:50.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
