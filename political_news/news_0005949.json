Related Content Republicans allege open meetings violation \nReps. Nick Milroy and Joel Kleefisch introduced the bill earlier this year. They told the Assembly's natural resources committee during a public hearing Wednesday that blaze pink is just as safe as blaze orange. \nMajid Sarmadi, a University of Wisconsin-Madison textile expert who studied the visibility of blaze pink for Milroy and Kleefisch, told the committee that blaze pink is more visible against the orange fall landscape than blaze orange. \n\"The pink is more visible when everything is turning yellow and orange,\" Sarmadi said. \"The orange will get lost between those oranges that are there in nature. Therefore, it will be less safe.\" \nRep. Ken Skowrownski, a committee member, said he doesn't support the measure. He said he can't see any reason for the bill beyond making a fashion statement. \nCopyright 2015 by Channel 3000 . The Associated Press contributed to this report. All rights reserved.
