Aired 10/13/15 on KPBS Midday Edition . \nHow California's New Pot Laws Will Affect San Diego Dispensaries \nGUESTS: \nJessica McElfresh, attorney, McElfresh Law \nLance Rogers , attorney, Bremer Whyte Brown & O'Meara LLP Transcript \nNearly a year before advocates push for a recreational marijuana ballot measure, Gov. Jerry Brown signed off on a series of bills that will regulate how the plant is grown, transported and sold in California. \nMedical marijuana has been legal in California for nearly two decades, but cities have struggled with how to regulate it. The new state law aims to standardize how cannabis is handled in the state. \nThe law creates a new state bureau , which will issue licenses and collect fees from pot businesses in the state. The industry will also switch from a nonprofit model, to a commercial-based one. \nThe new law is a relief for Jessica McElfresh , a San Diego attorney who has represented clients in the medical marijuana industry. \nMcElfresh said the new law has made regulations clearer. \n\"It created a great deal of confusion among law enforcement,\" McElfresh told KPBS Midday Edition on Tuesday. \"It created a great deal of insecurity, in terms of qualified patients seeking their medication.\" \nLance Rogers , an attorney who also represents clients in the industry, said the new regulations are terrific. \n\"What we're seeing is finally statewide licensing that really give clear guidance to companies.\" \nRogers said the Department of Agriculture will now be in charge of licensing the cultivation of marijuana. The product will then be transported to a testing facility, a manufacturing facility then to a retail location. \n\"Every step of the process will be regulated,\" Rogers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:14:44.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
