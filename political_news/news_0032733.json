In Texas , there are 935,000 Texas K-12 youth left unsupervised for an average of seven hours per week. More than 1.5 million Texas youth would participate in an afterschool program if one were available in their community. There is more work that needs to be done to meet the great need for afterschool programs that keep Texas kids safe, inspire them to learn, and help working families.\n\" Lights On Afterschool celebrates the remarkable impact afterschool has on students and communities,\" said Molly Clayton , Executive Director of TXPOST. \"It is a powerful reminder that afterschool programs provide a safe, engaging learning space for youth. Unfortunately, we don't have enough afterschool programs, and too many kids are home alone in the afternoons or on the streets where they can be exposed to crime or risky behaviors. Our goal is to raise awareness to ensure that there are programs, funding, and community support for more quality afterschool programs.\"\nLights On Afterschool is organized by the Afterschool Alliance, a nonprofit public awareness and advocacy organization working to ensure that all children have access to quality afterschool programs. More information on the Afterschool Alliance, Lights On Afterschool and America After 3PM is available at www.afterschoolalliance.org .\nTexas Partnership for Out of School Time (TXPOST) is a statewide nonprofit founded in 2011 with a mission to increase the quality and availability of afterschool, summer and expanding learning opportunities (ELO) for Texas K-12 youth.
