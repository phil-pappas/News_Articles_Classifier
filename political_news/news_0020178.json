This would not have happened if not for the placement policies of Corrections, and for both Serco and Corrections’ thorough mismanagement of the facility,’ says No Pride In Prisons spokeswoman Emilie Rākete. \n‘Secondly, we will be demanding that the Department of Corrections reform their policy regarding the initial placement of transgender people. We demand that the Department of Corrections publicly demonstrates its efforts in doing so.’ \nClick here for a link to the rally’s Facebook event page: https://www.facebook.com/events/470315266474767/ \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:21:06.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
