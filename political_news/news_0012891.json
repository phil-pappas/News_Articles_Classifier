The gestures were unsolicited and unwanted, the victim told police. The victim photographed at least one incident. They had been occurring twice weekly for two years, the latest on the morning of Sept. 10, according to court documents. \n\"I was provided with copies of the photographs which clearly depict Raymond Pohl sitting in a vehicle with his penis exposed,\" Sgt. Luke Schwartz wrote in the affidavit. The name of the victim is redacted. The document says the Columbia County DA requested that the OSP conduct an investigation after an initial complaint was made to Clatskanie police. \nPolice said there may be other victims. Anyone with information should contact Sgt. Schwartz at 503-731303. Pohl drives blue 2005 Chevrolet pickup with a canopy and rack. It has Oregon vanity license \"SAR.\" \nSchwartz said that Pohl's cooperation led to his arrest. \nRay Pohl is married to Diane Pohl, who is at the center of the fallout of former police chief Marvin Hoover. A July complaint filed by two of his officers said Hoover mocked African Americans as monkeys and sang the Confederate battle anthem \"Dixie\" during a conversation about a complaint of racism against officers. \nMore: Ore. police sang Dixie, mocked blacks as monkey, complaint says \nHoover was placed on leave in August, then allowed to retire by the Clatskanie city council several weeks later. \nAfter the retirement, Mayor Pohl wrote a letter to the Clatskanie Chief newspaper praising Hoover and his career, thanking him \"for a job well done.\" Though she knew specific details about the complaint of racism against Hoover, she made no mention of it in the letter. \nMayor Pohl has since said with Hoover's retirement, she considers the matter closed. \nAlex Stone, the officer who initially filed the report with the Oregon Department of Public Safety Standards and Training, told KGW after the controversy erupted that he has received death threats. \n\"I think people hate me. People want me murdered,\" he said. His wife has also been harassed. \nHe told the Clatskanie Chief newspaper that Mayor Pohl was part a screening committee that hired him. Among the questions asked was whether he would report wrongdoing by another officer. \n“I answered that I would go to the authorities and I would report that behavior,” Stone told the newspaper. “I’m living up to the exact words of what I was asked to do by the city when they hired me, and all I’m asking is for the city to back me up.” \nThe mayor told KGW that her not praising Stone and a second officer personally for reporting racist actions, while praising the chief's career, was lost in mix of events surrounding the controversy. \n\"If we have overlooked saying that, we have overlooked saying that,\" she said. \nThe city issued the following statement Sept 8, listing no names of elected or administrative officials. \n\"Most recently, the former Chief of Police of Clatskanie, Marvin Hoover, ended employment with the City. There have been various news reporting regarding al allegation of misconduct by the Chief related to racial comments and behavior. To clarify, the allegations were not based on any contact between the Chief and a member of the public. The alleged conduct occurred during an internal discussion with other staff. \nUpon notice of the allegation, the Chief was placed on administrative leave and the City initiated an investigation. The City strongly condemns the alleged conduct. Shortly aft the investigation began, the Chief chose to end his employment agreement before the investigation could be completed. In the best interests of the City, the City agreed to a separation agreement based on Hoover's employment agreement and also included a release of claims. \nThe City is hiring an interim Chief of Police and will be actively seeking to fill the position. During this period, the City will also be engaged in diversity training for City Staff to reaffirm current City policy and workplace expectations. The City regrets that this incident occurred and supports that the matter was reported. The City asks that members of the public respect the rights of the individuals who brought this matter forward.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.kgw.com/1Kg4WYh TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:56:52.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
