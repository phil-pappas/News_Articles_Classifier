Related 2 men sentenced in fatal shooting in... \nThe groups also want a broader say in how slots revenues are used to make improvements in the community. They think the money earmarked for their community that goes to City Hall should get to the groups that work in the Park Heights neighborhoods. \nWanting to make Park Heights more welcome, some community groups are apparently unsatisfied with what they consider slow progress in redeveloping their neighborhoods. They're requesting Baltimore City Comptroller Joan Pratt and Maryland State Comptroller Peter Franchot take a closer look at the handling of slots revenue designated for improvements over a 20-year period through local impact aid grants. \n\"We're just looking for full clarity and transparency from the government, from the city,\" said Will Hanna, with the Park Heights Community Development Corporation. \nThey want a full and detailed accounting from 2010 of what has come to the city and what the city has paid out. They said the Pimlico Community Development Authority reports the total is $15 million, but feel neighborhood associations and other community groups aren't seeing much of an impact. \n\"It is very frustrating when you know that there is money coming and you see no development,\" Hanna said. \nThe mayor's office said, \"Baltimore City has consistently been open and transparent with respect to how the city's share of casino revenues are distributed. Reports are published each year with those details.\" \nLast month, during a meeting at Pimlico Race Course, city planning director told 11 News the process works, but it never happens fast enough. As the city described, projects started or completed since 2012 in the area, including the CC Jackson Recreation Center in the 4900 block of Park Heights. The community groups have other ideas for the funds. \n\"They should go to human services. They should go to job training. They should go to work force development, economic development programs. They should go to community revitalization projects that directly goes into the hands of people that are doing the work in these neighborhoods,\" Hanna said. \nCity Comptroller Joan Pratt's office told 11 News she has requested some information from the community groups, and after getting it and checking with the city planning director, \"We will be able to determine if there are any areas that require review pertaining to the use of these funds.\" \nThe state comptroller's office said it has not had an opportunity to review the request.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:33:52.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
