There were no further details on their conditions. Israel's Haaretz daily reported that a 4-year-old girl sustained burns on 35 percent of her body while her sister and mother were lightly hurt.\nFriday's firebombing was the latest in a series of almost daily Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers over the past month.\nTen Israelis have been killed in that time, mostly in knife attacks. On the Palestinian side, 48 people have been killed by Israeli fire, including 27 said by Israel to be attackers and the rest in clashes with Israeli forces.\n___\n3: 40 p.m.\nIsrael's military says an initial inquiry of security camera footage capturing Israeli troops as they kick and beat a Palestinian man shows they \"did not act in accordance with the standards.\"\nThe army says it's still investigating. It says the incident took place at a time when Palestinians were throwing rocks and firebombs at troops nearby.\nThe footage released Friday by the Israeli rights group B'Tselem shows a man carrying a box into a storage room and then standing at the door, looking outside. Soldiers rush toward him, beat and kick him for several minutes while he lies on the ground, then drag him outside.\nIt's not clear what happened before the footage begins.\nB'Tselem says the Oct. 6 incident happened in the West Bank town of el-Bireh.\nAnsar Aasi, 25, the man in the video, says he wasn't involved in violence. \"I raised my hand and told them I didn't do anything but they beat me everywhere,\" Aasi told The Associated Press. He said he was detained for five days and only released after his employer showed police the CCTV footage.\n___\n2:50 p.m.\nMuslim prayers at Jerusalem's holiest site, which has been the epicenter of weeks of unrest, have ended peacefully.\nIt was the first time since violence erupted in mid-September that Muslims of all ages could attend the weekly Friday prayers at the Muslim-run site.\nIn recent weeks, police had barred younger Muslim men from the shrine, framing the restrictions as a security measure. Clashes between stone-throwers and security forces at the shrine, revered by Muslims and Jews, often involved teens and young men.\nAzzam Khatib, the director of the Waqf — the Islamic religious authority that oversees the compound — said 25,000 worshippers attended, five times as many as the week before.\nThe calm comes after weeks of Israeli-Palestinian violence, including near-daily Palestinian attacks that killed 10 Israelis. On the Palestinian side, 48 people were killed by Israeli fire, including 27 labeled by Israel as attackers and the rest in clashes.\nDiplomatic efforts are underway to end the violence.\n___\n1:15 p.m.\nAn Israeli human rights group has released security camera footage showing several Israeli soldiers beating and kicking a Palestinian man for several minutes as he lies curled up in a defensive position on the floor of a storage room.\nIsrael's military says it is looking into the incident.\nThe group B'Tselem said Friday that the footage is of an Oct. 6 incident in the West Bank town of el-Bireh. The group says 25-year-old Ansar Aasi was at work in the storage room when clashes between Palestinians and Israeli soldiers erupted nearby.\nThe video begins with him carrying a box into the storage room. He is then seen standing at the door, looking outside. Suddenly, Israel soldiers rush toward him, beat him repeatedly and drag him outside.\nB'Tselem says Aasi required medical treatment and was detained for five days after soldiers alleged he had thrown stones. The group says he was only released after police viewed the security camera footage.\n___\n10:45 a.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:05:34.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
