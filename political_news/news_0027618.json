And I dare say even more will be British non-white too, like my mate Abdul's daughters who are a light brown. Abdul is an atheist and as British as they come despite having parents who came over in the 80's. His daughters are big fans of Peppa Pig.My parents came over from Ireland about the same time and their grandkids are the same age as Abdul's daughters. Bar the shade of their skin there is little to differentiate them and thus it's ultimately a non-story. I'm non-white but as British as they come. My parents came over here in the 60s and my dad would support England in the World Cup etc. He was buried in this country rather than \"back home\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:07:30.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
