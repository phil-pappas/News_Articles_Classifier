However it unfolded, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said at this point that it's better to \"wait and see the conclusions of those investigations before we reach any determination.\"\nWhen asked specifically about why the government isn't in a position to apologize given its basic admission that a U.S. airstrike was to blame, Toner repeated that it needs more information before it can take that step.\n\"There is the expression 'fog of war,' and until we actually determine what happened, where and to whom, and how that unrolled ... I don't want to make any pronouncements, and it's certainly not my place to do so,\" he said. \"I think we all need to wait for the conclusions of this investigation.\"\n  Trump warns of bigger threat to U.S. than immigration The billionaire candidate decries currency manipulation and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/06/15 6:46 PM \"That said ... I think U.S. officials have been pretty forthcoming, offering their condolences, clearly saying that this was a tragic accident,\" he added.\nHe made those comments after White House spokesman Josh Earnest deflected a question about whether an apology would be issued by saying reporters should check with the State Department.\nWhen asked whether State was leaving open the chance that somehow the operation could be justified, Toner disagreed and said he was simply saying more data is needed.\n\"I think what we're saying is, an incident took place on Friday night that resulted in the death of civilians,\" he said. Toner added that the U.S. military makes a real effort not to kill civilians, and said the government would \"respond accordingly\" once more is known.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Sanders works to peel union support away from Clinton Sanders has positioned himself as a champion of union workers.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/06/15 6:34 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:16:42.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
