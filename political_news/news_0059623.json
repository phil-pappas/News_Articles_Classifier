Menai Science Park received the EU cash as part of a project to encourage collaboration with researchers. First Minister Carwyn Jones said it would \" support job creation, helping secure a sustainable future for Anglesey \" . Construction at Gaerwen is set to begin in 2016, with the first businesses expected to move in from early 2018. It is hoped the project, led by Bangor University, will encourage hi-tech businesses and scientific researchers to base themselves in north west Wales.
