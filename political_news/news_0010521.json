I have by far the biggest crowds.\" \n\"Of course I don't think they'd want anything to happen. But I would think they should be very proactive and want protection for somebody like me that has 20,000 people at any time,\" Trump said. \"You would think that they would want to be very proactive, but we have not heard from them.\" \nThen-Senator Obama made an official request in writing, according to a U.S. offiical.
