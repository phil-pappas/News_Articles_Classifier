But the underlying theme of the night was the district’s budget. \nThe board this year approved an approximately $93 million budget – 4.25 percent higher than last year’s spending plan — after several heated meetings that resulted in more than $3.9 million in spending cuts, including the outsourcing of 38 special education classroom aides and 32 lunchroom aides. The trustees tapped into its reserve funds to prevent further cuts this year, and raised taxes by $239 for the average district resident, raising questions about how the district will meet its budgetary goals for the next school year while aiming to keep taxes down. \nFisher and Muse called for the board to seek grant funding to free up money in the district’s general fund. \n“There’s money out there and we’re going to have to grab the brass rings,” said Muse, a grant writer who has experience as a teacher and school administrator. \nRomney-Rice, the board’s vice president this year, and Rappoport said they favor finding external grants. But they argued that grants don’t represent a long-term solution for the district’s financial woes. \n“The grant probably lasts two years and it isn’t going to let you add a whole new program ad infinitum when you’ve got to pay the staff and maintain the facilities,” Rappoport said. \nRice said the board could continuously stretch its limited resources by finding more opportunities to share services with the township and lobbying the state for better funding formulas. \n“That is the challenge — limited revenue with lots of expenses,” Romney-Rice said. \nAt several points during the debate, which was held at Teaneck High School and moderated by Minna Greenberg of the League of Women Voters, Gruber pointed to teacher salaries as a possible source of savings, saying that about 70 percent of the budget goes to salaries. He said he supports fair wages, but there are limits to what the district can afford. He said he would rather spend money to create a preschool program. \n“It’s about a resource-allocation decision,” Gruber said. \nThe candidates are competing for three three-year terms on the nine-member board in the Nov. 3 election. \nEmail: diduch@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:56:59.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
