John F. Campbell will be asked whether he thinks President Barack Obama should reduce the U.S. troop presence from its current level of about 9,800 to about 1,000 after 2016\nCampbell is testifying three days after an airstrike on a medical clinic killed 22 people in the northern city of Kunduz (KUHN-duz), the scene of heavy fighting in recent days.
