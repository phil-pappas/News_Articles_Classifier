(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) comments Tweet Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton is raking in campaign donations after her marathon performance during an eight-hour grilling on Capitol Hill about the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.\nThe hour after the hearing ended on Thursday was Clinton’s best fundraising hour, even without asking for money, an aide said.\nMore than half the cash was from new donors and 99 percent of them were from those giving $250 or less. Clinton’s aide said she now has more than 500,000 donors, with more than 100,000 new donors in October alone.\n“I think she impressed a lot of people with her intelligence, her dignity, her cool and I think that’s being reflected by people stepping forward to support the campaign, whether it be with endorsements or donations,” said Kathy Sullivan, former New Hampshire Democratic chairwoman and current National Committee member.\nThe campaign boost comes as Lincoln Chafee, the former senator and governor of Rhode Island, announced he was dropping out of the race, citing Clinton’s “good week” as a reason.\nOn the Republican side, staffers for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, once a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, revealed yesterday he is implementing an across-the-board pay cut for his struggling campaign, removing some senior staff from the payroll, and canceling fundraisers.\nBush’s decision to retool his campaign comes on the heels of a new Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll that shows former neurosurgeon Ben Carson surging ahead of real-estate magnate and Republican front-runner Donald Trump in Iowa.\nThe poll, released yesterday, shows Carson earning 28 percent of the likely participants in Iowa’s Republican caucuses and Trump taking just 19 percent — a dramatic shift from the 23 to 18 percent lead over Carson that Trump held in August.\nHerald wire services contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Clinton+rides+donation+surge"], "published": "2015-10-24T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:27:31.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
