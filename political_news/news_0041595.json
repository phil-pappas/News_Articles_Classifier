The core of Biden's campaign platform would include middle-class issues such as \"the welfare and support of family\" focusing on \"the values of the American people.\"\n\"Everything he and the president have worked for — and care about — is at stake,\" Kaufman said.\nThe memo was released after pundits said it might now be too late for Biden to enter the race, given Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton's strong performance at the first debate Tuesday night. Close aids to both Clinton and Sanders, such as John Podesta and Tad Devine, said it was too late for Biden, and that entering the race so late in the game would prevent Biden from establishing a sufficient ground game in key primary states.\nAfter six months of the Clinton campaign leading the polls and dominating the Democratic field, the vice president's window to enter the race has become increasingly smaller. While the Draft Biden PAC has spent the past months fundraising for the vice president's potential run and have also released two political cable ads campaigning for him, Biden had previously remained relatively quiet when asked about his future plans.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner 'Clock Kid' meets with genocidal Sudanese president Mohamed's father is a Sudanese immigrant who actually once ran against al-Bashir for the presidency.\nBy Curt Mills • 10/16/15 12:55 PM He's also up against a more practical deadline of early November. If Biden were to enter the race, he would have to declare his intent by Nov. 6 in order to get on the primary ballot in all 50 states.\nBut as the Democratic Party suffers under the weight of Clinton's email scandal and polls showing most Americans don't trust her, Biden's candidacy could potentially rescue the party from a scandal-ridden nominee.\nAccording to FEC filings, Clinton's campaign has $32 million on hand from the last quarter, and Sanders has $27 million on hand. The Draft Biden PAC has raised over $3 million for Biden so far, but the vice president has yet to hold any official campaign fundraisers. Voters look to Biden to enter the race to bring something different to the campaign, but he has delayed his decision repeatedly in the wake of the passing of his son Beau Biden.\nKaufman reminded supporters of this. \"I think it's fair to say, knowing him as we all do, that it won't be a scripted affair — after all, it's Joe.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Colorado to close Obamacare co-op Insurer is the third to close in a week and the seventh of 23 taxpayer-funded startups to shutter.\nBy Robert King • 10/16/15 12:34 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:12:05.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
