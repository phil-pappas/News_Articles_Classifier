Bowe Bergdahl should have been executed for leaving his post in Afghanistan.\nTrump made the comments Thursday afternoon at a rowdy rally inside a packed Las Vegas theater at the casino-hotel Treasure Island.\nTrump says Bergdahl is a \"no-good traitor\" and would have been shot 30 years ago.\nBergdahl was charged in March with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. The Army conducted a hearing on his case earlier this month.\nBergdahl is accused of leaving his post in southeastern Afghanistan in June 2009. He was held prisoner by the Taliban for five years, then exchanged for five Taliban commanders being held by the U.S.\nTrump has long railed against the deal.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
