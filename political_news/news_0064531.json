Escape the cycle of idiocy.\nBy Philip Wallach Oct. 26, 2015 | 2:00 p.m. EDT + More Can we really be doing this again? After the costly , futile debt ceiling standoffs of 2011 and 2013, are the inflexible demands from one part of one party really leading us to another flirtation with financial meltdown? Perhaps outgoing Speaker John Boehner will secure some relief this time around, but if only there were a clever way to permanently escape this cycle of idiocy.\nBut there is! Indeed, several techniques offer the president, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve a way out of this mess. The president could just appeal to Section 4 of the Constitution's 14th Amendment , which says that \"[t]he validity of the public debt of the United States … shall not be questioned.\" (Pay no attention to that ellipsis.) Or maybe even get the Supreme Court to perform an analysis showing that all this debt ceiling nonsense is unconstitutional and then authorize Article III sovereign debt .\nOr we could get more creative and technical. The Treasury Department could use its discretion over the terms of the bonds it issues to offer \" super-high-coupon bonds ,\" which would bring in lots of usable revenue relative to their hit against the debt ceiling. Or perhaps it could devise a way to create de facto financial obligations that nevertheless escape debt limit considerations through creation of special-purpose entities . Or the Fed could gin up an emergency facility reminiscent of the Maiden Lanes of 2008 to fend off a debt-ceiling induced default.\n[ READ: Chill Out About the Debt ]\nOr, after all, why not jump on the platinum coin bandwagon, i.e., #MintTheCoin? As its champions excitedly explain, Congress has given the Treasury Department the authority to mint platinum coins of any denomination. Yes, this was designed to allow fairly low-stakes issuance for numismatics enthusiasts, and yes, the largest face value ever put on a platinum coin at this point is $100, but the letter of the law doesn't seem to present any bar to the Treasury minting a $1,000,000,000,000 coin that it could then deposit and use to pay the nation's bills. The debt ceiling problem dissolved through seignorage : Neat!\nThese ideas get policy wonks hot and bothered, and some really are clever. But their proponents are remarkably blind to their downsides. Announcing any one of these ideas in the midst of a debt ceiling negotiation would be taken by Congress as a declaration of executive branch aggression, thus escalating our festering interbranch conflict into a full-blown constitutional crisis.\n[ SEE: Political Cartoons on Congress ]\nThere is great irony here. Those who would refuse to raise the debt ceiling absent their favorite fiscal reforms frequently argue that the risks posed by a debt-ceiling-precipitated default now pale in comparison to the risks posed by our profligate federal spending – which they say, will expose us to the risk of default many years hence. Though our nation's fiscal imbalances are very real, this reasoning is nevertheless rightly ridiculed as absurd: Bearing certain costs of default now to avoid uncertain default later simply does not add up.\nBut precisely the same criticism applies to preemptively invoking the 14th Amendment or minting a platinum coin. To avoid an uncertain ( and more-or-less unprecedented) failed debt ceiling negotiation ending in default and a potential constitutional crisis, those who advocate the clever ways out of our debt ceiling crisis are willing to precipitate a constitutional crisis immediately. For their clever attempt to achieve functional government, they would probably deliver an impeachment trial. The Obama administration was thus wise to forswear these maneuvers.\n[ SEE: Political Cartoons on the Republican Party ]\nWe may one day confront a dire situation where debt ceiling negotiations have stalled, Treasury has exhausted its accounting tricks (extraordinary measures) and the country lacks the cash on hand to pay bills that are due. In that case, it might make sense to consider some of the more technical ideas mentioned – the more arcane, the fewer blog posts written about them, the better. But in that case, the intention would be to help deescalate conflict by buying some extra days, during which increasingly urgent negotiations could return us to normalcy.\nThe proponents of the clever ideas do have one thing right: As a matter of policy and of constitutional practice, our debt ceiling makes no sense in the era of modern budgeting. The congressional authorization of debt issuance should be embedded directly in congressional authorizations of spending, since those are the real drivers of debt accumulation. Budget process reform is overdue, and Congress is justified in wanting to reassert the power of the purse. But the destabilizing tactics of debt ceiling theatrics offer neither side a substitute for that much-needed compromise.\nTAGS: deficit and national debt federal budget debt Congress", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9mdc%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-15-476", "http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5912&context=faculty_scholarship", "http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2334424", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/12/treasury-we-wont-mint-aplatinum-", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/12/treasury-we-wont-mint-a-platinum-coin-to-sidestep-the-debt-ceiling/", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/01/10/platinum_coin_seigniorage_the_intended_use_of_the_platinum_coin_provision.html", "http://www.hofstralawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CC.6.Tiefer.final2_.pdf", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_United_States_dollar", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9mdc%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=We%20Shouldn%27t%20Need%20Magic%20to%20Avoid%20Debt%20Ceiling%20Crises", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9mdc%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2011/05/26/the-day-the-united-states-defaulted-on-treasury-bills/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9mdc%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=We%20Shouldn%27t%20Need%20Magic%20to%20Avoid%20Debt%20Ceiling%20Crises&summary=There%20are%20clever%20tricks%20that%20might%20avoid%20debt-ceiling%20Russian%20roulette%20%E2%80%93%20but%20we%20shouldn%27t%20need%20them.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9mdc%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe9mdc%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=We%20Shouldn%27t%20Need%20Magic%20to%20Avoid%20Debt%20Ceiling%20Crises", "https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/10/03/press-briefing-press-secretary-jay-carney-10313", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/boehner-looking-to-move-debt-ceiling-bill-soon-214791", "http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/reinert/9article_burdekin_seigniorage.pdf", "http://dealbreaker.com/2013/01/instead-of-a-trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-treasury-should-mint-a-trillion-dollar-500bn-bond/"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:16:37.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
