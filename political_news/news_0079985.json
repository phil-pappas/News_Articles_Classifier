It's also nearly double the initial estimate provided in 2013 to address water infiltration issues and other long-identified defects. \n\"I wish that we didn't have to do this,\" Mayor Charlie Hales said before voting, \"but we do.\" \nCommissioner Nick Fish said the City Council has to act. \"I'm done fussing,\" Fish said. \"Either we're going to fix it or we're going to do something else.\" \nThe City Council's unanimous vote puts the final touches on a plan nearly two years in the making. The city can now solicit construction bids in hopes of finishing work by 2020. \nFred Miller, Portland's chief administrative officer, said he thinks the city can shave millions of dollars off the $195 million figure by keeping some employees in the building during construction. He also described the plan as the lowest-cost alternative – cheaper than options such as building a replacement elsewhere downtown or demolishing the Portland Building and starting fresh. \nBut Miller and the City Council repeatedly promised that the project would not cost more than $195 million. \"Let's put a stake in the ground,\" Miller said. \nPortland will issue 20-year bonds to pay for the project. Based on a previous $175 million estimate, the city would owe $12.9 million in annual debt payments, with the money coming from the general fund and rent checks from city bureaus. \nIn a separate decision, the City Council approved a plan to spread the cost of the building across most city bureaus in the downtown area – not just the ones with offices in the building. The new rates would go into effect no later than 2021 \nThe biggest controversy centered on a proposal to dedicate 1 percent of the construction costs to providing opportunities for minority and women contractors. \nMembers of the Equitable Contractors & Purchasing Commission, formed in February, asked the City Council to delay a vote. \n\"We need more time,\" said Maurice Rahming, president of O'Neill Electric, saying the commission didn't know how the council settled on a 1 percent or how the money would be spent. \nBut the council narrowly approved the proposal, promising to work with the commission to discuss how the money, estimated at $1 million, would be spent. \nFinancial officials recommended in late 2013 that the iconic Portland Building be overhauled rather than replaced. \nThe City Council approved spending $3.75 million during the current budget year to start design and engineering work, as well as $2.3 million for project costs. \nThe 15-story Portland Building was designed by architect Michael Graves, who died in March, and built for $25 million starting in 1982. The Portlandia statue sits atop the building's entrance at 1120 S.W. Fifth Ave. \nJen Clodius, Office of Management & Finance spokeswoman, said the city doesn't plan to move Portlandia. \nHere's a preliminary cost breakdown: Remaking the Portland Building", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:06:30.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
