The overflowing camps and the extremely large numbers of migrants continue to flow, along with chaos and disorder. All news of it has disappeared from the news. On September 4th Angela Merkel suspended European asylum rules and allowed tens of thousands of refugees stranded in Hungary to enter Germany via Austria. It won her accolades. There was no limit, Merkel said, to the right to asylum. The mood has begun to change since. More than 200,000 migrants entered Germany in the month of September. As many as 1.5 million could enter within a year.\nHousing is a problem and the government in Hamburg is seizing office buildings to house migrants. Schools are struggling. There is some fear that the new immigrants won’t assimilate to the German culture and values which was magnified when a young pregnant woman who fled Syria after being gang raped was murdered and her story hit the news. It’s believed to have been an honor killing and it has horrified Germans. “I am awaiting death,” Rokstan wrote on her WhatsApp profile shorty before her death. “But I am too young to die.” Still, the program is widely accepted and it has become a moral calling for Angela Merkel. “If we start having to apologize for showing a friendly face in emergencies,” she says defiantly, “then this is not my country.” Greek islands near Turkey have had about 7,000 migrants arriving a day for the past week according to migration experts. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the average in late September was 4,500 a day. The EU’s migrant relocation scheme began Friday, according to the bbc with 20 Eritreans leaving Italy to fly to Sweden. The refugees get to choose the country they will settle in and they generally choose the country with the best benefits. In The Netherlands, refugees are being placed into homes meant for Dutch citizens, according to PJ Media. Dutch citizens have been waiting for years for these homes. PJ Media reports that the Dutch are starting to protest and riot: …they’re literally blocking roads and even attacking government officials, as happened a few days ago in the small town of Oranje. Undersecretary of Asylum Klaas Dijkhoff visited the town last Tuesday to explain why the local refugee center had to take in 700 extra asylum seekers. The result? Inhabitants of Oranje blocked highways leading into their town, and even attacked the undersecretary’s car. These aren’t fringe people or the usual activists, they are the average Dutch citizen. The U.S. takes more than twice as many refugees as all countries from the rest of the industrialized world combined and refugees are consuming subsidized housing that poor and handicapped citizens have waited for. The Federal programs available to refugees in the U.S. are: ∙ Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) formerly known as AFDC ∙ Medicaid ∙ Food Stamps ∙ Public Housing ∙ Supplemental Security Income (SSI) ∙ Social Security Disability Insurance ∙ Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) (direct services only) ∙ Child Care and Development Fund ∙ Independent Living Program ∙ Job Opportunities for Low Income Individuals (JOLI) ∙ Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) ∙ Postsecondary Education Loans and Grants ∙ Refugee Assistance Programs ∙ Title IV Foster Care and Adoption Assistance Payments ∙ Title XX Social Services Block Grant Funds They go on a line for citizenship although we can’t vet them properly.\nSweden and Germany are Europe’s two most generous welfare states and refugees are flocking to them with some chaos and rioting. WND reported that despite the unrest and destabilization in Sweden, the U.S. has blacked out all reports. Quote: : Hundreds of cars were torched, shops had their windows smashed, a police station was set ablaze and fire departments kept from a major blaze by rock-throwing mobs in May 2013. Violent protests erupted again in 2014 and then in late September 2015. The latest violence has included grenade attacks in clashes between Turkish and Kurdish immigrants, who have carried over their ancient rivalry inside their new adopted country of Sweden.\nGermany has also seen increasingly violent protests and demonstrations on both sides of the refugee issue, something we never hear on U.S. TV or read in the papers.", "external_links": ["http://www.newsweek.com/refugee-and-migrant-arrivals-greece-top-7000-day-iom-381690", "http://pjmedia.com/tatler/2015/10/09/europe-riots-mass-outrage-over-mass-immigration/?singlepage=true", "http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/muslim-refugee-riots-ignored-in-u-s-media-blackout/", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34483681"], "published": "2015-10-11T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:34:17.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
