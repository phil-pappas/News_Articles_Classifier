If you're looking for something to splurge on instead, check back every Friday for one great purchase that's absolutely worth eating ramen noodles for the rest of eternity.\nIf you know anything about fashion golden boy Simon Jacquemus, you know that he’s not only the coolest designer to follow on Instagram right now, but also that he’s more interested in creating “souvenirs” than just simply clothes. Take his signature school-uniform-inspired T-shirt. Far from your plain white tee, it doubles as an unexpected statement piece without the overkill of a blaring print, or a surplus of jewels. Layer it over longer-sleeved options like a sturdy dress shirt or a turtleneck bodysuit, or wear under your new fall jacket .\nJacquemus Le T-Shirt Col Haut, $95 at Opening Ceremony .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/jacquemus/?hl=en", "https://www.openingceremony.us/products.asp?designerid=953&productid=146127&gclid=CjwKEAjw1riwBRD61db6xtWTvTESJACoQ04QmLRadkUvblUhnvSJu14fxv_xLFH-Du7YsRPCfD7vjhoC41Xw_wcB"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:24:40.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
