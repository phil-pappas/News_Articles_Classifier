Virginia Health Information (VHI) published their Compare HMOs report to help consumers find, compare and choose the HMO that best meets their needs. Compare HMOs is part of VHI's free Consumer Guide to Health Insurance Options, a comprehensive guide helping Virginia consumers and employers learn about health insurance options.\nHMOs have gained in popularity. Over 1.2 million Virginians chose HMOs in 2014, a five-year high. Even so, HMO plans vary in their levels of coverage, costs and on performance measures.\nWhen shopping for health care insurance you may think first about the costs, but does your doctor participate in the HMO? Are the HMO's members satisfied with the care they get, doctors they use or ability to get care quickly? Do members say they get the care they need? How about immunizations for children and adults? How well cared for are members with diabetes, heart disease or depression?\nWorking with business, consumers and health insurance companies, VHI includes over 60 measures covering how quickly care is provided, satisfaction with doctors, screening for cancers, providing the right care and more. Some examples include:\nMembers Received:\nVA Avg\n5-Year High?\nBetter than Nt'l Avg?\nHighest Rated HMO\nRange across HMOs\nHighly ranked Healthcare\n79%\nYes\nYes\nMD IPA\n74%-82%\nChildhood Immunizations\n78%\nNo\nYes\nKaiser\n56%-89%\nColorectal Screening\n65%\nYes\nYes\nUnited HC\n54%-82%\nPremium per member/per month\n$412\nNo\nN/A\nCareFirst\n$320-$726\n*HMO names are abbreviated.
