This is just politicians pushing this to the nth degree and hopefully after this hearing it will all be over and it will get better for us,” Doherty told the Herald. “Hopefully some of the politicians in Washington will reshape themselves.”\nThe Democratic presidential hopeful, who will testify about the attack before the Select Committee on Benghazi, is expected to be peppered with tough questions. And while the former U.S. secretary of state’s testimony won’t close the book on the committee’s more than three-year investigation, Doherty said she hopes it will allow her family to “get this all behind them” so they can “focus on the fight” with the U.S. government and an insurance company for his death benefits.\n“It’s not just for us, it’s for the hundreds of other families that also have not received their death benefits. We’re fighting for them, too,” Doherty said. “This has been a three-year journey. I’m not giving up the fight. I might take it to my grave but I’m going to keep on going.”\nDoherty last year sued Rutherfoord Insurance, alleging the Virginia company took her son’s money knowing they would not have to pay out death benefits because he wasn’t married and didn’t have children. She also filed a $1 million wrongful death claim with the State Department alleging the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was improperly secured when her son and three other Americans, including the U.S. ambassador, were killed in a militant attack.\nToday’s hearing is set to begin at 10 a.m. and last most of the day. Critics have accused the Republican-controlled panel of dragging out their investigation in an effort to damage Clinton’s presidential aspirations.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Victim%E2%80%99s+mom+won%E2%80%99t+watch+Benghazi+hearing", "http://livestream.com/accounts/300260/events/4441171/player?width=560&height=315&autoPlay=true&mute=false"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:27:19.236+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
