Representatives for daily and periodical press galleries in the Capitol protested that the media \"should not be charged to cover elected officials at an event of enormous interest to the public.\" \nThe four-day event will be held in Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena. \nThe national committee says the $150 charge covers but a fraction of the $750-per-seat cost of constructing press seats. Television networks generally cover the cost of constructing their skyboxes.
