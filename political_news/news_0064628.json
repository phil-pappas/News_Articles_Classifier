I think we need to respect various elements of our heritage, and that's where I will defer to the experts who actually run that house.\" \nTrudeau and his wife, Sophie Gré​goire, sold their Montreal home and had been living in a rented home in Rockcliffe, the same prestigious Ottawa neighbourhood that houses 24 Sussex, Rideau Hall and Stornoway, the official residence for the leader of the Official Opposition. His children have attended a local school. \nTrudeau told reporters covering his election campaign this fall that the house they've been renting was sold, so win or lose on Oct. 19, they'd need to move out very shortly after that. \nIn an email to CBC News on Friday, Liberal spokeswoman Kate Purchase said no decisions had been made about exactly where the Trudeaus will live from now on. \n\"We're in the process of being briefed and will make a decision shortly.
