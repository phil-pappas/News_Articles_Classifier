That looks like one of the Allison engined Mustangs, much slagged off but apparently quite good at low levels, whereas the more reputed Merlin engined P51 Ds were better at high altitude.I am distantly related to a very proper Irishwoman: Kathleen Clarke, wife and then widow of Tom Clarke, one of the leaders of the 1916 Easter Rising. He was an old school Victorian Fenian and anarchist bomb thrower who had spent a lot of time in jail for various failed plots. In 1916 he was running a shop that was a cover for an IRA command centre. He signed the Proclamation of Independence along with the other leaders, and was nominally the first President of the provisional Republic, although he spent most of his very brief term of office being shot at by British troops. After the rebels surrendered, he was executed by firing squad by the Brits, at the beginning of their PR disaster reaction to the Rising. His widow, a revolutionary activist herself, went on to become a Senator of the Irish Republic, and is one of the two big female figures of the campaign, the other being the machine-pistol toting Countess Constance Marckiewicz, born one of the Gore-Booths, a posh Anglo-Irish suffragette and radical. She was the first woman elected to the Westminster Parliament, beating Lady Astor by a bit, but - being a Sinn Feiner - Markiewiecz did not take her seat. She did take her seat in the Dail later on.Talking about Tom Clarke and the many other IRA members in my extended family was fun when I was getting security clearance a few years ago. They don't mind, so long as you tell them stuff. BTW, my mum is also called Kathleen Clarke (born Deane). She is another very proper Irishwoman.
