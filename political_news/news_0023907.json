Marco Rubio believes the 2016 election will be a “generational choice about what kind of country we’re going to be in the 21st century.” “We’ll either be greater than we’ve ever been or we’ll be a nation in decline,” Rubio said in a wide-ranging editorial board interview with the Portsmouth Herald. “Our children will either be the most prosperous children that have ever lived or they’ll be the first generation to inherit a diminished country from their parents. The choice is that stark.” Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, said he has seen “a growing percentage of Americans who believe that hard work and perseverance isn’t enough anymore to get ahead.” He noted the programs used by the government are outdated stating in part “we have retirement systems designed in the '30s, higher education systems designed in the '50s, (and) anti-poverty programs designed in the '60s.” Rubio addressed an array of issues during the interview Wednesday, from immigration to ongoing national security threats faced by the United States and how his life experiences offer him a way to connect with voters. Asked about how he would convince war-weary Americans the U.S. should stay engaged in the Middle East, Rubio stressed “these problems are coming to us.” “The choice that we have is whether we deal with it now or deal with it later,” Rubio said. “If we deal with it later it’s going to be harder, more difficult and more expensive. I’m much rather deal with it now.” Because the U.S. is “the most influential and important country on the planet,” it cannot ignore the threats posed by ISIS and Iran. “Even if we ignore the world’s problems they will not ignore us,” he said. “They will eventually come to us one way or the other.” But he stressed that doesn’t mean “full-scale military engagements” involving “a large number of U.S. ground troops.” On domestic issues, Rubio called for increasing defense spending by $50 billion a year, even while acknowledging there must be entitlement reform. He called Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid “important programs” that he supports. “But the truth is those programs are going bankrupt,” he said. “If they’re not reformed, they will bankrupt themselves and ultimately our country.” He called for changing the entitlement programs but only in a way “that doesn’t impact current beneficiaries.” “It will require future beneficiaries like me to acknowledge that Social Security and Medicare will either look different for us or they won’t exist,” Rubio said. For future retirees that could mean a later retirement age and lesser support for retirees with greater financial means than others. He stressed that defense spending must increase and said the amount “we’re spending right now quite frankly is irresponsible.” “We are in need of modernization of multiple different systems, maintenance of our naval fleets, particularly are submarine fleets,” Rubio said. He also called for more spending on missile defense systems “at a time when ICBMs have become more affordable and easier to access for rouge states.” On immigration, Rubio said he believes “border security is a key element” of dealing with the problem, adding the country still has to “deal with 12 million people who are already here illegally.” “It isn’t realistic to say we’re going to award them all citizenship in a blanket way,” Rubio said. “It’s also not realistic to say we’re going to round them up and deport them.” He supports “a path” to allow illegal immigrants to eventually get a green card, but not if they’re criminals. “If you’re not a criminal you have to pay a fine and start paying taxes and get a work permit,” Rubio said. “And that’s all you’re going to have for at least 10 years and after the 10-year period I personally … am open to allowing them to apply for a green card.” Rubio also believes his story — how the son of a bartender and a maid because a U.S. senator — will resonate with people. “It’s not just my story it’s our story,” Rubio said. “ What we share is a common story and that is we’re all but a generation or two removed from someone who made our future the purpose of their lives. This is our unifying theme as a people. It also happens to be what makes us exceptional.” On other issues, Rubio said the Republican Party “is going through an important internal debate about who we’re going to be in the 21st century and what we’re going to represent.” “My fundamental argument in this race is I want the Republican Party to be the party of the future,” he said. On how he campaigns, Rubio said he has taken “great pains not to be a divisive figure unnecessarily because it makes the country harder to govern.” “If there are policy issues between me and someone else, those are legitimate issues that people deserve to know,” Rubio said. “I think that’s different than attacking someone for their personal attributes or who they are or where they come from, things of this nature.” On his approach to working in the U.S. Senate, Rubio said he has “tried to work in a bipartisan fashion, simply because it raises the chances (a bill) will actually become law.” He also called North Korean leader Kim Jong-un “a lunatic” who possesses “dozens of nuclear weapons.” “We have no idea how someone like him would respond to a threat to his power internally or any sort of challenge,” Rubio said.
