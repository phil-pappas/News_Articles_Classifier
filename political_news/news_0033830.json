Broad St., Philadelphia .\nThe winning ticket correctly matched all five white balls, 04-14-29-31-47, but not the yellow Mega Ball, 09. Because it was purchased with the Megaplier option and the Megaplier number drawn was 02, the ticket earns a $2 million prize, less 25-percent federal withholding.\nThe retailer will receive a $10,000 bonus for selling a winning ticket.\nLottery officials cannot confirm the identity of the winner until the prize is claimed and the ticket is validated. Pennsylvania Lottery Mega Millions winners have one year from the drawing date to claim prizes.\nThe Lottery encourages the holder of the winning ticket to sign the back of the ticket, call the Lottery at 717-702-8146 and file a claim at Lottery headquarters in Middletown , Dauphin County , or at any of Lottery's seven area offices.\nClaims may be filed at Lottery headquarters Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. , and from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at area offices.\nMore than 33,900 Pennsylvania Lottery Mega Millions tickets won prizes of varying amounts in the drawing. Players should check every ticket, every time.\nBecause no jackpot-winning ticket was sold for the October 2 drawing, the Mega Millions jackpot rolled to an estimated annuity value of $55 million for the Tuesday, October 6 , drawing.\nIn the 2013-14 fiscal year, in addition to awarding more than $295.1 million in prizes to Philadelphia County winners, the Pennsylvania Lottery contributed nearly $236.2 million to programs serving the county's older residents.\nHow to Play Mega Millions: Mega Millions tickets cost $1 per play. Players pick five numbers from 1 to 75 and one number from 1 to 15 (the Mega Ball). Players may select their own numbers using a Mega Millions play slip, or they may opt for computer-selected quick picks. For an extra $1 per play, players can add the Megaplier®. Prior to the Mega Millions drawing, the Megaplier number – ranging from two to five – is randomly selected. It applies to non-jackpot prizes.\nMega Millions tickets are sold in 44 states, Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands . Tickets are sold until 9:59 p.m. on drawing nights, Tuesdays and Fridays.
