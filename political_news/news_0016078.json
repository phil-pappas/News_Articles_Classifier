A guilty plea would allow him to avoid a trial. More What to watch for in Democratic debate \nThe bank withdrawals were part of payments made to an unnamed Illinois resident, who was to receive $3.5m to hide previous “misconduct” that occurred years ago against that person, according to the indictment. \nA lawyer for Mr Hastert on Thursday indicated his client would plead guilty during a status hearing at a district court in Chicago, the US Attorney’s office in the city said. \nA hearing is scheduled for October 28, when Mr Hastert is expected to formally change his plea to guilty. Mr Hastert was charged with one count each of structuring currency transactions to evade regulatory reporting rules and lying to the FBI. \nThe US Attorney’s office declined to comment on the terms of the plea agreement and Mr Hastert’s possible sentence. Each of the charges carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. \nThe payments were allegedly made to conceal sexual misconduct dating from when Mr Hastert was a teacher and wrestling coach in Yorkville, Illinois, according to people familiar with the case. \nBut the charges against Mr Hastert do not relate directly to any allegations of sexual misconduct. Mr Hastert’s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment. \nMr Hastert , 73, was the Republican leader of the House from 1999 to January 2007, and he represented Illinois in Congress for 20 years. \nSince the indictment was announced in May, he has resigned from his position as an adviser at Dickstein Shapiro, a law and lobbying firm in Washington. He has also stepped down from the board of the CME Group . \nFrom 2010 to 2014, Mr Hastert withdrew $1.7m in cash to pay the unnamed individual, according to the indictment. In the first two years, he made withdrawals of $50,000 each until he was questioned about the transactions by bank officials. \nUS banks are required to file reports to the Treasury department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000. \nStarting in 2012, Mr Hastert began making withdrawals in sums of less than $10,000, allegedly to avoid the reporting rules, according to the indictment. \nHe is accused of lying to federal agents in December 2014 when he told them he was storing the cash because he did not feel safe using the banking system.
