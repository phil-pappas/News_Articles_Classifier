Oct. 4, 2015. \nReports offer context on immigration \nA couple of recent reports on immigration do much to inform the debate on the topic. All sides should pay attention. \nThe first report, by the Pew Research Center, reaches the eye-opening conclusion that 88 percent of the U.S. population increase between 2015 and 2065 (to 441 million) will come from immigrants and their descendants. \nIt breaks down this way: 56 percent of this growth will be from new immigrants; 26 percent because of the addition to the country of their U.S. born children; and 5 percent from the immigrants’ grandchildren by 2065. Another 12 percent will come from the growth generated by people who were already here in 2015. \nAnd the foreign-born, says Pew, will still account for only 18 percent of the U.S. population in 2065, “only” being a relative term. This will exceed the historic high of 14.8 percent set in 1890, but it will still mean at least 82 percent of residents will be U.S. citizens. And the number of citizens will certainly be even higher than that because foreign-born doesn’t mean a person hasn’t been naturalized, though the naturalization rates for immigrants can stand some improvement. \nHave fears about their failure to assimilate and what this means to the social fabric? Don’t. Another report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine says assimilation is occurring as quickly as previous immigrant waves, measured in improvement in education, the quality of jobs secured over time and income gains. And this process includes learning English - the only language spoken by the third generation of those immigrant households. \nBut there’s a twist. Incarceration rates are lower and labor participation higher for immigrants, who also tend to be healthier than the native-born in many respects. At some point, however, their native-born progeny start mimicking their fellow native-born - which means they start getting jailed at the same rates and developing work habits like the native-born. \nBut they are assimilating and will likely do so even more quickly if immigration reform offers a path to legal residency. The anti-immigration rhetoric of late simply isn’t supported by the conclusions outlined in these reports. \n___ \nHouston Chronicle. Oct. 2, 2015. \nNo Cruz control: Texans would like to see Sen. Ted Cruz focus his energies on Texas interests \nOn a sunny spring day in 2010, rising fifth-graders from J.R. Harris Elementary, a prize-winning school near the Ship Channel, gathered at the newly opened East Side headquarters of the Harris County Republican Party. They were there near the end of the school year to claim new bikes from the party for having met their TAKS requirements. Before the youngsters could claim their prizes, though, they had to listen to a few political speeches, including stem-winding remarks from a dark-haired guy who had been the Texas solicitor general in years past. Sitting cross-legged and quiet on the gym floor, they endured a speech aimed more at the TV cameras than at them. Talking over the kids, literally and figuratively, on that May afternoon five years ago was the Republican Party’s soon-to-be rising star, Ted Cruz. \nEven then, it seemed, Cruz was running for president, two years before he took the intermediate step of winning a U.S. Senate seat in a crushing defeat of then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. Cruz has been running ever since, to the neglect of the people of Texas. Unlike the state’s senior senator, John Cornyn, who, while less so lately, follows in the tradition of former U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison by focusing on the needs of his fellow Texans, the state’s junior member of that august body focuses on himself. \nThe constitutional-conservative crusader is not going to be the next president. He’s not likely to be the Republican Party nominee, despite his rapturous following among archconservatives and recent polls showing him running second to Donald Trump among registered Texas voters who say they’ll vote in the Republican primary. Nationally, according to the RealClearPolitics average, he’s in sixth place at the moment with 6.2 percent of the vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:38:43.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
