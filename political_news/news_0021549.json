Once there is evidence that there is a problem with it, something must be done to avoid problems during the elections,” she told members of the LMVC who paid a courtesy call on the former first family Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:23:53.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
