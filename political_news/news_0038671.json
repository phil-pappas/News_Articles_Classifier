(David Becker/Associated Press) October 15 at 5:17 PM In his Oct. 14 op-ed column, “ A (wo)man among boys ,” Dana Milbank Quote: d former secretary of state Hillary Clinton as saying, “[W]e would be making a grave mistake to turn our backs on what built the greatest middle class in the history of the world” (meaning capitalism). It wasn’t the capitalists that built the American middle class. On the contrary, it was the reining-in of the capitalists — those titans of industry whose market manipulations actually brought on the Great Depression (sound familiar?) — and the rules and regulations formulated during the Franklin Delano Roosevelt administration as a result of the political pressure from the populist progressive movement. This “New Deal,” referred to by many historians as the “Liberal Consensus,” is what built the greatest, most widespread, best-paid and best-educated middle class in the world.\nIf the Wall Street capitalists had been allowed to continue their reign, there never would have been an American middle class.\nNorman Michael Harman , Harpers Ferry, W.Va.\n●\nIs there a presidential candidate — Republican or Democratic — in favor of balancing the federal budget? When I tell friends I am in favor of a campaign to balance the federal budget, the most common response is a laugh. Yet the country may be in a position, and sooner than people think, when it will be forced to take action, perhaps even drastic action.\nThe country needs a debate on the federal budget — from Republican and Democratic candidates for president.\nScott Brewer , Gaithersburg\n●\nI cannot sufficiently express my anger that I and others who lack cable television service had no access to Tuesday’s Democratic debate. CNN’s Web site allowed only limited viewing. Online searches resulted only in teasing dead ends. Network and public TV stations offered nothing.\nSomething as important as a presidential candidate debate should be available on radio, television and streaming to every American. I am incredulous that this situation exists.\nNeil Hopper , Arlington", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:14:48.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
