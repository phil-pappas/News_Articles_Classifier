This is the atmosphere that produced Ryan's candidacy for speaker after the incumbent, Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, announced his resignation under conservative pressure, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., abruptly bowed out. That led party leaders to draft a reluctant Ryan.\nAdvertisement Now Ryan, the GOP's 2012 vice presidential nominee, will face immediate — and perhaps competing — tasks: passing must-do debt and spending bills likely to be opposed by a majority of Republicans, even while he attempts to unite a badly fractured House GOP.\n\"I don't know that it's going to be the honeymoon suite. It might be some economy version,\" said Rep. Matt Salmon of Ariz., one of the conservative rebels who forced Boehner out by threatening what would amount to a vote of no confidence on the House floor.\nBut Salmon and other Republicans said Ryan would get leeway for how he navigates the immediate crises he inherits, including the debt ceiling, if it's not dealt with before he assumes the speakership.\n\"If we get six months down the road and nothing's really changed, if we get eight months down the road and nothing's really changed, then I think it's 'Everybody needs to get a helmet' time,\" said GOP Rep. Mark Amodei of Nevada.\nAfter announcing his surprise plans last month to leave Congress on Oct. 30, Boehner expressed a desire to \"clean the barn\" of messy must-pass legislation, rather than leave it for his successor to deal with. The debt limit was at the top of the list.\nBut Boehner has yet to announce his approach, after leadership backtracked on tentative plans to get the ball rolling with legislation linking a debt limit increase to deep spending cuts and a balanced budget plan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:13:45.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
