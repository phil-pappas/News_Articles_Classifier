(AP) â€” A leader in the effort to get Vermont to pass aid-in-dying legislation has used the rules established under the law to end his own life.\nThe Montpelier lobbying firm that worked with Patient Choices Vermont leader Dick Walters says he died Friday at the Shelburne retirement community where he had been staying. Walters was 90 and had battled lung cancer.\nWalters was born in New York in 1925. He graduated from Yale University, served in the U.S. Navy and worked in retail merchandising before becoming a regular at the Statehouse in recent years while advocating for his death-with-dignity cause.\nThe 2013 law allows a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to someone diagnosed as having six months or less to live and who requests it.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the man's surname was Walters, not Waters.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
