Through the proposal NZGB aims to fulfil its role to correct spelling, and collect and encourage the use, of original Māori place names.” \nThe NZGB’s Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu member confirmed the original spelling and meaning, which also appears in historic documents. \n“Ngāi Tahu wants the original name’s meaning and story to be used, and correcting the spelling would support this. As the rivers are popular with recreational users and are well-known locally, the NZGB wants to know what the public thinks.” \nPublic consultation will run for three months, from 29 October 2015 to 29 January 2016. Anyone can make a submission in support of, or objecting to, these proposals. Details of this proposal will be available on the LINZ website from 29 October. \nFrom 29 October submissions can be made in writing to the Secretary for the New Zealand Geographic Board, via the LINZ website or to nzgbsubmissions@linz.govt.nz, or via post to: Level 7, Radio New Zealand House, 155 The Terrace, PO Box 5501, Wellington 6145. \nVisit the LINZ website for information about general place naming and the NZGB. \nends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:36:46.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
