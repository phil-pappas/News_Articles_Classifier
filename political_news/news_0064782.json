Robert Menendez \nA bill to crack down on so-called “sanctuary cities” for immigrants stalled in the Senate on Tuesday after Sen. Bob Menendez gave an impassioned speech accusing Republican colleagues of jumping on a “fear-mongering bandwagon” driven by their party’s presidential candidates, especially Donald Trump. \nThe measure got 54 votes but needed 60 to advance. Supporters included three presidential candidates: Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida. South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, another GOP presidential contender, did not vote. \nMenendez, a Democrat from Paramus and son of Cuban immigrants, said that “anti-immigrant rhetoric” from presidential candidates “is unacceptable, deplorable and should be renounced by every American.” \nRelated: Senate Democrats block 'sanctuary cities' legislation \nHe singled out Trump, citing his claim that Mexico was sending the United States criminals and rapists. \n“We’ve hit a new low with the extraordinarily hateful rhetoric that diminishes immigrants’ contributions to American history and particularly demonizes the Latino community by labeling Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals,” he said. \nHe argued Republicans in the House had blocked holding a vote on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate with bipartisan support in 2013 that would have provided for increased enforcement by bringing an estimated 11 million immigrants without legal status “out of the shadows.” \nCruz, who is also the son of Cuban immigrants, said the bill was needed to protect citizens from immigrant criminals and public officials who do not want to enforce immigration law. \nHe said there is a “political class and business class of the nation’s elites” who will only allow for robust enforcement of the law after people here illegally are given a path to citizenship. \nCruz also cited the July 1 shooting death of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco as a reason the bill was needed. \n“Kate died in the arms of her father on a San Francisco pier after being fatally shot by an illegal alien with several felony convictions,” Cruz said. “Kate’s killer was released from custody and not turned over to be deported because of San Francisco’s sanctuary policy.” \nUnder the bill, someone with a prior “aggravated felony” who tries to re-enter the United States would face a mandatory five year prison sentence if caught. The bill also would make cities that do not honor requests from federal immigration officials to detain immigrants ineligible for federal economic development and policing grants. \nFifty-two Republicans and two Democrats - Indiana’s Joe Donnelly and Joe Manchin of West Virginia - voted for the measure. Forty-two Democrats, two independents and one Republican - Illinois’s Mark Kirk - opposed it. \nCities that have chosen not to honor requests to detain immigrants who might otherwise be released have cited the need for community cooperation in police investigations. Newark’s police renewed a policy to not honor immigration requests to detain immigrants arrested for minor offenses in 2013, when then-Mayor Cory Booker first ran for Senate. \n“As a former mayor, I know how much this legislation would impair crime-fighting efforts in American cities, burden local governments with additional costs, and promote constitutionally problematic detentions,” Booker said in a statement after opposing the measure. \n“Rather than pursuing political point-scoring, those advancing this bill should seek to actually solve the problems they claim to care about by passing desperately-needed comprehensive immigration reform,” he said. \nThis story contains material from The Associated Press. \nEmail: jackson@northjersey.com Blog: northjersey.com/thepoliticalstate  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:57:20.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
