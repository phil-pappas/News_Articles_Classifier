Photo: Charlie Riedel\nA department spokesman confirmed to Fairfax Media that United Airlines had been fined $10,000 for allowing Mr Newman to board \"despite communication from the department that he was not allowed to do so\".\nAdvertisement It is understood the visa cancellation meant Mr Newman was placed on the Movement Alert List, and the onus was on the airline to ensure he did not board the plane.\nThe list contains the details of more than 700,000 people who pose a possible security or health risk, or owe money to the Commonwealth.\nUnited Airlines has been slapped with a $10,000 fine.\nIt is considered an integral part of Australia's national security and border control strategy, particularly as passenger movements rise.\nA spokesperson for the airline said: \"United takes this matter seriously and is currently working closely with the Australian and US authorities to investigate how this occurred. United is also conducting a separate internal review.\"\nMr Dutton had instructed the department to investigate how Mr Newman was able to board the flight despite red flags being raised in the Movement Alert List system.\nIn 2011 then-Australian Security Intelligence Organisation head David Irvine described the list as \"very fallible\" because there were \"people who perhaps should be on it who aren't.\"\nAn Australian National Audit Office report in 2009 found the database lacked strategic planning and contained poor quality data which \"compromised the system's effectiveness\".\nIt made five recommendations. A follow up report last year found the department had failed to fully implement three of them, even after claiming the measures were wholly or substantially in place.\nThat report made four new recommendations, which the department this week said were \"in the progress of being implemented\".\nMr Newman was detained by the Australian Border Force at the airport before being held at Melbourne's Maribyrnong detention centre overnight, then deported.\nThe High Court threw out an emergency bid by Mr Newman to stop authorities removing him from Australia.\nLawyers for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton and Mr Newman were scheduled to reappear in court on October 30, to determine if the department was legally entitled to cancel Mr Newman's visa.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax?lang=en"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:05:00.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
