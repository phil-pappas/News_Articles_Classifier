Almost a week of talks in Atlanta finally resolved final disputes over dairy, pharmaceutical drugs and automobile export rules.\nU.S. automakers lost a lengthy fight in Congress to require any deal to include prohibitions on currency manipulation. A strong U.S. dollar against a weaker local currency — especially one that is artificially weak due to government manipulation — means foreign vehicles are cheaper here, and U.S. vehicles are more expensive there.\nJapan joined the talks in 2013. Australia, Brunei, Chile, New Zealand, Malaysia, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam are part of the negotiations.\nThe pact eventually would end America’s 25 percent tariffs on imported light trucks and 2.5 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts — expected to remain for 20 years or more under the deal. The tariff has been in place for more than 50 years. Those tariffs, especially the truck tax, have forced foreign automakers to build truck and SUV plants in the United States and helped keep some would-be competitors out of the truck market that is dominated by Detroit’s Big Three.\nUnder the fast track rules passed by Congress this summer, the text of the deal must be public for at least 90 days before Congress votes on it. It can only approve or reject the agreement on an up or down vote and can't amend it. That means a vote wouldn't take place until next year at the earliest.\nBefore the official announcement, Ford Motor Co. said it opposed the deal, also known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, and urged Congress to reject it.\nZiad Ojakli, Group Vice President for Government and Community Relations, said in a statement that \"U.S. lawmakers took unprecedented action to set a clear negotiating objective for addressing currency manipulation in all future trade deals. The TPP fails to meet that test. To ensure the future competitiveness of American manufacturing, we recommend Congress not approve TPP in its current form, and ask the Administration to renegotiate TPP and incorporate strong and enforceable currency rules. This step is critical to achieving free trade in the 21st century.”\nA deal had been expected almost three months ago but stalled amid a standoff between Japan and Mexico over autos.\nThe final key auto issue was how countries will classify vehicles as built in one of the 12 nations — and how much content from other countries can be included in what is known as the “rules of origin.” The rules are in place to prevent China or other lower wage countries from being able to produce the majority of content in a vehicle and export it without paying taxes.\nUnder the North American Free Trade Agreement, at least 62.5 percent of a passenger car or light truck’s net cost must originate in North America to be considered tariff free under the agreement. Mexico wants to increase the percentage to 65 percent in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, while Japan wants it to be about 45 percent — which would allow for a greater number of parts from low-wage countries like China and Thailand to be included.\nMexico’s auto industry is booming as automakers and parts firms around the world build new plants and expand production thanks to low wages. About 70 percent of Mexican-built vehicles are exported.\nPresident Barack Obama wants the free-trade deal as a cornerstone of his administration’s economic legacy, and a way to boost exports of U.S.-made products. His administration also seeks a deal with Japan as crucial, since the world’s third largest economy is a critical ally in a region where China is expanding its influence.\nThe pact eventually would end America’s 25 percent tariffs on imported light trucks and 2.5 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts.

Automakers want the tariffs kept in place for at least 25 years or more.\nJapan and the United States have not said how long the U.S. auto tariffs will be in place — except to say that they will remain in force for an extended period — as long as any other tariff that gets phased out, and that’s expected to be around 20 years.\nJapan imports very few U.S. cars, even though it has no tariffs on U.S. vehicles. U.S. automakers have complained for years of other barriers to U.S. vehicles, while Japanese automakers argue U.S. companies haven’t made enough of an effort to sell vehicles in Japan. Japanese automakers note they have spent tens of billions of dollars and employ thousands of Americans building cars and trucks in the United States — something U.S. companies don’t do in Japan.\nObama wants the free-trade deal as a cornerstone of his administration’s economic legacy, and a way to boost exports of U.S.-made products.
