Safra Center for Ethics released a study exploring the depth and breadth of corruptions in state governments across the nation. \nAlabama, which has grown accustomed to showing up near the bottom of many national comparisons of note, ranked high in this study. Unfortunately, being the fourth most corrupt state in the U.S. is nothing to brag about. \nWith a former governor in federal prison - never mind the widespread belief that his prosecution was politically motivated and dogged by questionable strategies - a handful of lawmakers caught up in various corrupt controversies and a sitting Speaker of the House facing more than 20 felony corruption charges, it’s not difficult to see how researchers might arrive at their conclusions about our state. \nIt begs a question: Where is the Alabama Ethics Commission? \nIn a recent op-ed, former state senator Lowell Barron questions the ethics of the Ethics Commission itself - and with good cause. In a recent advisory opinion, the commission told a state lawmaker, Rep. Patricia Todd, that she could lobby the Legislature on behalf of her employer, an organization that works on gay rights issues. To reach that conclusion, commissioners determined that the six-figure salary the lawmaker was paid by her employer was not “a thing of value.” \nIt’s not surprising that Mike Hubbard, the indicted House Speaker, has cited the opinion in his defense of corruption charges that echo scenarios in the Todd opinion. \nBy what twisted logic is acting as both lawmaker and lobbyist considered ethical? It defies the imagination of government watchdogs and legal officials alike. \nRecently Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange and the Alabama District Attorneys’ Association sent a formal request to the Ethics Commission asking that the Todd opinion be revisited, as it conflicts with existing ethics law. \n“After careful review of this opinion, which practically permits an interest group to pay a legislator to lobby the legislature and state and local governments, we find the ethics commission analysis to be fatally flawed and ask the Ethics Commission to withdraw and reconsider this opinion,” Strange wrote. \nConsidering all the hullaballoo over same-sex marriage in Alabama, it’s important to note that opposition to the ruling has nothing to do with Rep. Todd individually, or with the organization that employs her, or with the positions the organization takes on controversial issues. Instead, it’s about blurring the lines between the responsibilities of an elected official to his or her constituency, and those of a lobbyist to his or her employer. \nAlabama’s reputation as a hotbed of political corruption is an embarrassment. If there’s any hope of cleaning up Montgomery, it must start with an Ethics Commission that’s squeaky clean and possesses a tendency to err to the side of right, rather than the murky, gray areas.Online:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:18:13.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
