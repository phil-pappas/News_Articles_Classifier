The Education Secretary must investigate this.\"\nScottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said:\n\"This is such a laughable statement it’s almost impossible to get upset about.\n\"Worryingly, it seems the Scots Language Centre doesn’t understand children aren’t allowed to vote, and doesn’t know what the population of Scotland is.\n\"People will be rightly asking just why taxpayers are coughing up to spout this nonsense.\"\nEarlier this year, Ms Constance's deputy, minister for learning and languages Alasdair Allan, launched the government's Scots language policy.\nPromoted stories As part of the effort to promote spoken and written Scots, quango Education Scotland will adopt trilingual corporate signage so that messages are written in English, Gaelic and Scots.\nThe Scottish Government currently spends a total of £270,000 on funding the Scots Language Centre and Scottish language dictionaries.\nShare article A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \"The Scots Language Centre is responsible for the content of its website and we understand that the text in question has now been removed.\"\nNo-one at the Perth-based centre was available for comment.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-03T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:12:32.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
