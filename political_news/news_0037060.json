Massengill Both District 13 candidates tout support for education If re-elected to represent House District 13, incumbent Steve Massengill, R-Hickory Flat, says his goal will be more funding for education. Democrat Justin Cluck, an Oxford attorney, said the reason he is running is that education has not been fully funded and legislators, including Massengill, have tried to confuse voters on the citizen-sponsored Initiative 42. The initiative, if approved by voters on Nov. 3, will enhance the stateâ€™s commitment to public education. The Legislature, including Massengill, voted for the first time in history to place an alternative to a citizen-sponsored initiative on the ballot. Cluck said the reason for the alternative is to try to confuse voters.
