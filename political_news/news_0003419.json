But Collins hardly piled up vote totals there that were analogous to Strickland's in East Memphis, and he struggled mightily to break even into double-digit percentages in heavily white polling places.\nAnd the incumbent A C Wharton 's best precinct only delivered 41 percent of the vote to him, exposing a lack of an ability to rely on any particular base in a futile attempt to hang on to his job.\nThose are snapshots from a Commercial Appeal analysis of the mayoral electorate based in large part on the Shelby County Election Commission's unofficial and unaudited precinct-by-precinct results, which the SCEC shared with The CA Wednesday afternoon.\nThe Election Commission meets later this month to certify the results, pending their customary audit by an outside firm.\nThough most obvious geographically, the precinct splits are instructive in viewing what's behind election results given what they say about racial voting dynamics. But even then, firm assumptions about just how much white or black vote a candidate received are always something of a guess — educated, both by the racial makeup of the precincts themselves, public and internal polling and historical voting trends.\nThough it does record turnout by race, the Election Commission does not tabulate how members of races vote. And it has not yet released the entire turnout data from the election, which would indicate the racial split there.\nThat said, the thought in Strickland's camp that the first white Memphis mayor in 24 years gained office with some 20 percent or more of the black vote seems within reason. No candidate, it appears, grabbed a noticeable chunk of African-American votes.\nStrickland's worst precinct percentage-wise, Christ Missionary Baptist Church on South Parkway, gave him 13 percent of the vote. Of the 119 precincts, Strickland got less than 20 percent of the vote in only 34 of them. Strickland scored wins at majority-black precincts such as Lester Community Center, Hickory Hill Community Center and Raleigh-Bartlett Meadows Elementary.\nConversely, Strickland scored big as expected at heavily white precincts in East Memphis, which also turned out noticeably higher than average. Strickland received 83 percent of the votes at Shady Grove Elementary School — getting 1,176 votes, compared to 168 for Wharton, 44 for Mike Williams and 26 for Collins.\nSixteen precincts delivered more than two-thirds of their votes to Strickland. He received 28 percent of his votes at just his 10 best precincts.\nThough the picture remains cloudy without knowing the racial turnout splits, it's reasonable to think if Strickland received 20-25 percent of the African-American vote, he received 65-70 percent of the white vote.\nCollins' best precincts largely mirrored the boundaries of District 3, which roughly runs east from Elvis Presley Boulevard in Whitehaven to Parkway Village and Hickory Hill. Collins racked up a third or more of the vote in those boxes, which roughly saw Wharton finish second and Williams and Strickland tussle for third.\nBut Collins could not duplicate that success elsewhere.\nHe polled in the single digits, percentage-wise, in about a third of the precincts. Many of those precincts were overwhelmingly white areas where Strickland dominated and Wharton's numbers were respectable.\nBeyond his home precinct of Glenview, which came in at 41 percent, Wharton's most successful precincts were mixed, geographically.\nEven in Midtown precincts, where Wharton could be considered to have had an advantage among liberal-leaning whites, Strickland racked up victories — a 62 to 31 percent win at Central Christian Church in Central Gardens and a 56 to 34 percent win at Trinity United Methodist Church in Evergreen.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/informemphis", "http://media.jrn.com/images/precinct_map-Collins-01.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/precinct_map-Wharton-01.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/informemphis", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*143/precinct_map-Collins-01.jpg", "http://www.jasonviera.com/beta/map/mapme.php", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*143/precinct_map-Williams-01.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/precinct_map-Williams-01.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*143/precinct_map-Wharton-01.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:47:48.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
