What's more, each time the offer is shared via Facebook (SmileForService.com/Share), Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HealthyMouthMovement, Aspen Dental Management, Inc. (ADMI) will donate $1 to Got Your 6 , a highly influential veterans' organization that helps strengthen communities and empower veterans nationwide.\nIt's all part of Aspen Dental's larger commitment to veterans, which has included more than $2 million in donated dental care to nearly 4,000 veterans in 2015 through a volunteer effort called the Healthy Mouth Movement.\n\"The Healthy Mouth Movement has been a great way to give back to the veteran community this year, but we know that there are many, many more people in need of dental care than Aspen Dental practices have been able to reach through that effort alone,\" said Mark Censoprano , chief marketing officer at ADMI. \"The fact is that cost remains a major barrier to people seeking dental care, especially our veterans, and A Smile for Your Service is a way to not only make it easier for them to be able to better afford the care they need, but also to give back to Got Your 6, which has been an incredible partner to us in 2015.\"\nAccording to a study released earlier this year, two in five Americans have limited or will delay dental care because of their financial situation. This is despite the fact that 80 percent of them know that delaying routine visits will cost them more money in the long run.\nMoreover, it is not widely known that veterans do not receive government dental benefits unless they are classified as 100 percent disabled, have a service-connected dental condition, or have a service-oriented medical condition that is affected by their mouth, conditions that many veterans do not meet.\n\"Through our partnership this year with Aspen Dental, we've become aware that oral health for some of our veterans is an issue that needs to be addressed. We hope veterans – including their friends and families – use this offer to make an appointment with an Aspen Dental dentist,\" said Rob Gordon , president of Be The Change, who oversees Got Your 6 operations. \"Addressing oral issues early on will help our nation's veterans better prevent more serious issues down the road.\"\nThe partnership with Got Your 6 was announced in April 2015 , when Aspen Dental launched the second year of its Healthy Mouth Movement , a community giving initiative to deliver free dental care and oral health education to people in need across the United States . This year the Healthy Mouth Movement has focused on serving our nations veterans and empowering them by addressing their oral health issues. In total, the Healthy Mouth Movement has seen almost 7,000 patients, resulting in $3 million in donated dentistry since it launched in 2014.\nTo learn more about the A Smile for Your Service promotion, visit www.SmileForService.com/Smile .\nAbout Aspen Dental Practices\nDentists and staff at Aspen Dental practices believe everyone has the right to quality, affordable oral health care.
