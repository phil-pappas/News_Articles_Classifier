You're dead.\"\nAnd strewed on his lawn was one of his campaign signs, he said, containing a spray-painted swastika and another message: \"Hitler . . . You R Dead.\"\nPolice Chief Samuel DiSimone said authorities were investigating but would not discuss specifics of the messages.\n\"We're not ruling out anybody,\" DiSimone said.\nReferencing the two decades of Democratic control of the town that preceded a three-year Republican majority, Chintall noted that challenging a \"Democratic dynasty . . . incites people.\" Chintall and Committeeman John Keuler Jr. lost their seats last year, allowing Democrats to again hold the majority with three of the five committee seats.\nThe timing of the threat did raise questions, DiSimone said. At a town meeting Wednesday night, a resident addressing the committee advised the governing body that he did not want to provide his address - as is requested of those publicly speaking - because of recent threats against Republicans.\n\"It was the first that I had heard of it,\" DiSimone said. \"Less than 24 hours later, this shows up.\"\nIn 2012, Chintall and then-Committeeman Sam Cianfarini, also a Republican, reported receiving threats through the mail and one on Chintall's door, following a decision to discontinue a summer concert series.\nDiCarlo, in a statement, said she supported a \"vigorous investigation\" of the threat and, if substantiated, prosecution of the person responsible. But she added, \"However, I do find it curious that this is the third time Ray Chintall has run for office and the third time he has received an alleged death threat. I am told the other two were unsubstantiated.\"\nCommitteeman Jeff Hansen said the threats are an example of \"why people stay away from politics in this town.\" In early 2014, when he first took office, he said, a threat against the Republican officials was left on the dais.\n\"It's enough of this. We can't throw fear and intimidation because they have different thoughts, different ideas,\" he said. \"Some people brush it off.\"\nThis year's campaign has been contentious. A thread of campaign-related text messages exchanged by Chintall and several fellow Republicans - and mistakenly sent to a township phone, then made public - offered a raw view into behind-the-scenes political dialogue. The messages contained unkind remarks about Democrats in town and included photos depicting DiCarlo as the Wicked Witch of the West.\nThose involved in the texts have said there was no illegal activity and reiterated that the messages were meant to be private. Hansen, who was among them, said he apologized at a meeting Wednesday to Democratic colleagues who may have taken offense at the messages.\n\"Is it that time of year - the political season?\" DiSimone asked. \"Yes.\"\nafichera@philly.com\n856-779-3917\n@AJFichera\nwww.philly.com/glouco", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:16:09.441+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
