(AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush is drastically slashing his campaign spending, including imposing an across-the-board pay cut for staff, as the one-time front-runner seeks to salvage his bid for the GOP nomination. \nThe moves announced to staff on Friday will reduce the campaign's payroll by 40 percent, while also cutting travel costs by 20 percent and eliminating extraneous overhead costs. \nThe changes will predominantly affect staff at Bush's Miami campaign headquarters. Only about 25 percent of campaign staff will remain in Florida. Another one-fourth of the staff was already in early voting states, and the remaining Bush aides will either be offered jobs there or other posts at reduced salaries. \nThe former Florida governor, and son and brother of past presidents, entered the GOP race with significant financial advantages. However, he has struggled to break through in a crowded Republican primary where voters are so far rewarding unorthodox candidates such as billionaire Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. \nBush's campaign and a super PAC supporting him have been spending heavily on television advertisements in early voting states, but there are few signs so far that his standing in the race is significantly improving. \nWhile Bush's super PAC remains heavily funded, his campaign fundraising slowed in recent months. He reported collecting $13.4 million between July 1 and Sept. 30, less than Carson, who led the field with about $20 million. Bush ended September with about $10 million in cash. \nCopyright Â© The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
