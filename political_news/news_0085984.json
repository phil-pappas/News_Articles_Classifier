I Love Juice Bar opened on October 1 in the upscale Midtown Shopping Center, offering a fresh and delicious menu of juices, smoothies and healthy food options—and that's only the beginning! “We’re so excited to provide another option for those seeking a healthy lifestyle,\" says owner Stephanie Keet , adding that in addition to fresh-made juices and smoothies, I Love Juice Bar also offers juice cleanses, the ability to custom-design juices according to individual needs, essential oils and \"power shots\" to give consumers a variety of options for healthy eating. I Love Juice Bar's philosophy stretches beyond just providing healthy, great-tasting products into education. To this end, the restaurant hopes to conduct a series of classes and events in the future to teach the public about the benefits of juicing, including ways to use fresh juice as a means to increase consumption of nutrients, improve digestion, increase energy and remove toxins from the body. Want to see what all the buzz is about? Stop into the I Love Juice Bar at 207 N. University and let the eager team serve you up samples of their healthy products.
