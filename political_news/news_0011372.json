On October 14 and 15, requests for zoning changes must be made in person at the Baltimore County Department of Planning located at 105 W. Chesapeake Avenue, Suite 101, Towson, Maryland 21204 (the “Jefferson Building”). \nBetween the four year periods, the Zoning Map might also be changed through the “zoning cycle” process but only the property owner may petition for a change in zoning and only at designated times. Issues are settled in the “cycle” by the Baltimore County Board of Appeals and not the County Council. There are other differences in the cycle process as opposed to the comprehensive process: (1) The Board of Appeals cannot grant a change in zoning unless the record shows that there has been either a “substantial change in the character of the neighborhood” since the last comprehensive process, or an “error” in the mapping; and (2) When the Council grants a map change on a zoning “issue,” \nThe quadrennial CZMP is governed by the Baltimore County Code (Art. 32, Subtitle 3, Part II, §32-3-211). Any citizen may initiate a request for a zoning change. The requests are reviewed by the Department of Planning and it makes recommendations to the County Council which ultimately determines on each issue submitted as to whether to retain existing zoning or make changes to the Baltimore County Zoning Map. The process is deemed “comprehensive” because the County Council reviews the entire zoning map for the County comprehensively. \nThe “open filing period” for citizens to request changes to the Zoning Map closes on October 15. The Baltimore County Planning Board and Planning Director must submit its and her requests by October 30 th . The County Council filing period for its requests runs from November 2 to November 30, 2015. After that period ends, a “log of issues” is generated and all issues are reviewed by the Planning Staff until January 29,2016. During February, 2016 the Planning Staff makes their recommendations to the Planning Board which holds public hearings on the zoning change requests during March, 2016. During the period April 5 to May 5, 2016, the Planning Board holds “work sessions” regarding the zoning map. The product of those work sessions is then submitted to the County Council which holds public hearings during the month of June, 2016. Beginning July 1 to September 15, 2016, the County Council reviews the Zoning Map and votes upon it on September 16, 2016. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Because of the generality of this update, the information provided herein may not be applicable in all situations and should not be acted upon without specific legal advice based on particular situations. \n© Pessin Katz Law, P.A.
