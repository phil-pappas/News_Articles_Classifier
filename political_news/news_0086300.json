House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., leaves the House chamber following a vote on Wednesday.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Oct. 2, 2015 | 4:08 p.m. EDT + More Kevin McCarthy will almost certainly become speaker of the House, despite his comments linking the ongoing House investigation into Benghazi to Hillary Clinton's precipitous polling decline in the presidential campaign.\nBut his gaffe has given an opening to challengers who might be discontent with the GOP's meager options to replace the retiring speaker, John Boehner of Ohio. Reports Friday indicated that Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah, who had been critical of McCarthy's statements, has begun preparing his own bid for speaker.\nRELATED\nKevin McCarthy Expresses Regret for Benghazi Comments The news comes after a Tuesday night appearance on Fox in which McCarthy touted the Benghazi committee’s lengthy investigation as the primary driver of Clinton’s sinking support.\n\"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\" the California congressman told Sean Hannity. \"But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.\"\nCriticism was swift, with even Republicans seemingly recognizing that they were on the verge of snatching political defeat from the jaws of victory after maintaining for years that the longest investigation in congressional history was “all about getting to the truth.” That led to McCarthy backtracking Thursday, saying that while the Benghazi probe has paid political dividends, he did not mean to imply its intention was political.\n\"This committee was set up for one sole purpose: to find the truth on behalf of families for four dead Americans,\" McCarthy said on Fox News on Thursday. \"Now, I did not imply in any way that that work is political. Of course it is not. Look at the way they have carried themselves out.\"\n[ READ: Kevin McCarthy, Boehner's Likely Successor, Will Face the Same Challenges ]\nDemocrats, led by Clinton and the Benghazi committee’s ranking member, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, sensed a chance to flip the script on Clinton's email server controversy, which was revealed by the committee's investigation earlier this year.\n“When I hear a statement like that, which demonstrates unequivocally that this was always meant to be a partisan political exercise, I feel like it does a grave disservice and dishonors not just the memory of the four that we lost, but of everybody who has served our country,” Clinton, who is scheduled to testify before the committee on Oct. 22, said Wednesday on MSNBC.\nCummings, in a statement Wednesday, expressed a similar view.\n\"This stunning concession from Rep. McCarthy reveals the truth that Republicans never dared admit in public: the core Republican goal in establishing the Benghazi Committee was always to damage Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and never to conduct an even-handed search for the facts,\"\nBut it was Republicans criticism, from his congressional colleagues to GOP presidential candidates, urging McCarthy to apologize and rushing to defend the committee’s work that raised questions about the speaker-in-waiting’s fitness to serve.\nRELATED\nPundits React to Kevin McCarthy, Hillary Clinton and Benghazi\n\"Certainly he is not off to a great start,\" Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, said Thursday on MSNBC. “We need somebody that’s a very, very tough, smart, cunning person. I don’t know that that’s him, and obviously this statement hurt him pretty badly in the eyes of some, unfortunately.”​​\nDespite McCarthy’s flub, there have been few calls to support someone else for speaker, other than from conservatives who already opposed his promotion . Aside from Chaffetz, the only other Republican who has stepped up to challenge McCarthy for the speaker’s job has been Daniel Webster of Florida, who siphoned a dozen votes off Boehner’s re-election total in January and is running again now.\nOne reason McCarthy's bid appears secure is that there simply isn’t anyone else positioned to make a credible run for speaker.​​ McCarthy's rapid rise to the top – he's been in the House for less than a decade – was accelerated by the tea party wave that swept away not only many Democrats but incumbent Republicans. With more than half of the 247 current House Republicans elected in 2010 or later, and Boehner’s first choice for successor, Eric Cantor, defeated by a primary challenger last summer, the caucus has few members who both have the experience and temperament necessary to lead and the ideology to gain the backing of the membership.\n“That goes to legislative experience overall,” says Michael Traugott, a political communications expert at the University of Michigan. “Boehner wasn’t the speaker for very long, and with Eric Cantor’s defeat they had to reorganize the team, which didn’t give anybody below Boehner much experience either.”\nIf Republicans dissatisfied with McCarthy’s candidacy vote against him, he may struggle to cobble together the 218 votes, or an absolute majority of members voting, necessary to capture the gavel.\nSo far, he has the implicit support of Boehner, who has not endorsed McCarthy but defended the committee in a statement Thursday.\n\"This investigation has never been about former Secretary of State Clinton and never will be,” Boehner said. “The fact remains that Secretary Clinton and the Obama administration have done everything they can to delay, derail and stop this investigation.”\nTraugott says Boehner’s quick departure – he said his resignation will be effective at the end of October – makes it that much harder for anyone to challenge McCarthy’s bid.\n“The consequence of establishing the parameters that way is that somebody within a leadership position has a built-in advantage,” Traugott explains. “That works to McCarthy’s favor – we would hear more about his lack of qualifications or his speaking ability if he had one or two real opponents.”\nTAGS: McCarthy, Kevin Clinton, Hillary Republican Party Chaffetz, Jason", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtupa%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=McCarthy%27s%20Benghazi%20Gaffe%20Won%27t%20Sink%20His%20Speaker%20Chances&summary=There%20simply%20isn%27t%20anyone%20else%20who%20can%20win.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtupa%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtupa%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.allgov.com/news/top-stories/house-benghazi-committee-sets-record-as-longest-lasting-special-congressional-investigation-150930?news=857533", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtupa%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtupa%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=McCarthy%27s%20Benghazi%20Gaffe%20Won%27t%20Sink%20His%20Speaker%20Chances", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdtupa%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=McCarthy%27s%20Benghazi%20Gaffe%20Won%27t%20Sink%20His%20Speaker%20Chances", "https://twitter.com/DeseretNews/status/650009949330735104/photo/1"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:46:02.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
