He said that the victims would have to get justice and the real perpetrators should be punished, not innocents. When asked about the tweet, Mr Owaisi said that new evidence had surfaced regarding the real perpetrators of the series of bomb blasts in Mumbai. He said that Rakesh Maria, the then chief of Mumbai Crime Branch, had filed a chargesheet in the case after the arrest of Sadiq Shaik, one of the suspects in the case, alleging that Shaik and the Indian Mujahideen (IM) were responsible for the blasts. A video footage of Shaik’s confession, which was leaked, revealed that the IM had planned the Mumbai train blasts in retaliation to the Gujarat riots. Mr Owaisi recalled that the AP police anti-terror unit “Octopus” had also held IM responsible for the blasts at that time. Surprisingly, contrary to Mr Maria’s chargesheet, Mr Raghuvanshi, head of the Mumbai Anti Terrorist Squad filed chargesheets against 12 persons, he added. This happened when the Congress and NCP were in power in Maharashtra, and the new evidence surfacing now is not only an example of rampant corruption and mis-governance but also victimisation of Muslim youth, the MIM president said.
