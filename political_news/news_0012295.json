Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, from the first Democratic debate, DNC spokesman Luis Miranda said Tuesday the committee \"wants to keep the focus on the candidates.\"\nDespite serving as vice chair of the DNC, Gabbard recently criticized the Democratic Party's primary debate structure during an appearance on MSNBC. The Hawaii congresswoman said hosting just four debates ahead of the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses next February unfairly limits candidates' opportunities to share their messages.\nShortly after the appearance on MSNBC, Gabbard told the New York Times DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's chief of staff had disinvited her from Tuesday night's debate.\n\"The Democratic Party is a big tent party and one of the things you're always going to have is a diversity of opinions, whether it's about the debate structure or the caucus structure,\" Miranda said Tuesday on CNN. \"But tonight we want to focus on the candidates on stage.\"\n  U.S. military: Russia's 'reckless' strikes actually helping ISIS Russian airstrikes in Syria have opened the door for the Islamic State to expand its foothold.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/13/15 12:41 PM He added, \"What was asked asked of Mrs. Gabbard's staff is that we want to keep the focus on the candidates and that's reasonable.\"\nAfter Miranda suggested that Gabbard had chosen not to attend the debate due to concerns that she would divert attention away from the debate itself, \"New Day\" anchor Chris Cuomo accused the DNC communicationd director of misrepresenting the congresswoman's words.\n\"She thought she'd be a distraction because she was disinvited,\" he said. \"She didn't choose not to come, she was told not to come.\"\nAhead of Cuomo's interview with Miranda, Gabbard told the network her rescinded invitation showed a lack of respect for free speech.\n\"The issue here is not about me saying, 'Oh no, I'm going to miss the party,' the issue here is about free speech and defending that which so many have given their lives for,\" she told CNN.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Will black lives 'matter' at the first Dem debate?
