After a summer of sitting just below the radar, Rubio's stealthy performance at the debate and months spent working voter crowds has sent him slowly but steadily climbing in the polls. And that's suddenly making him a target, not least for Jeb Bush, who is now subtly attacking his leadership chops and experience level.\nBut on Friday, Rubio responded to his one-time mentor’s criticisms not with a counterattack but an indifferent shrug.\n\"It's fine. It's not a big deal,” Rubio said during an interview with Mike Gallagher, a nationally syndicated conservative radio host. “When you run for office, and you feel — whatever — you're going to say what you think puts you in the best position; and I guess they've determined coming after me a little bit puts them in a better position.”\nRubio’s slightly patronizing aplomb is that of an increasingly confident candidate. At this critical juncture in the Republican primary fight, as the slowly winnowing field and a new batch of fundraising reports threaten to re-shape the race, Rubio is operating from a position of strength. Although he still trails three outsider candidates overall, he is quietly manuevering to overtake Bush, despite his financial and organizational advantages, as the GOP's new establishment frontrunner.\nJeb’s growing list of unfortunate comments By POLITICO Staff\nRubio’s confidence appears to be warranted, given his upswing in the polls after a second strong debate performance and Bush’s continued struggles, evidenced anew by a Pew poll Friday showing him with 4 percent support.\nAnd by avoiding a tit-for-tat argument with Bush, Rubio is seemingly diminishing the potential for a marquee showdown between the two 2016 candidates favored by the Republican establishment, at least for now. Much like Bush’s initial criticism of Rubio, a mere backhanded compliment, Rubio is preventing things from getting nasty or personal.\nBut make no mistake: he’s also subtly tweaking Bush, who now trails him in the polls, suggesting that the former governor is getting a bit desperate.\n“He’s slipping the jab. He’s moving around the ring and he’s looking good doing it,” said Steve Schmidt, a GOP strategist who guided John McCain’s 2008 campaign. “There are a lot of ways to answer that question: defensively, with hostility, attacking back and escalating a political fight.\n“It’s a deft response. The tone is perfect. He’s basically saying [Jeb] is an old politician, saying things he doesn’t mean to advantage himself politically.”\nBoth Rubio and Bush have been tiptoeing around engaging one another since their campaigns began. Bush’s focus on his own executive experience and his criticism of a do-nothing Congress are implicitly about Rubio—just as Rubio’s central campaign theme, urging voters to “turn the page” to “a new generation” of leadership, is an effort to embody the future in contrast to a rival representative of the past.\n\"In the environment of presidential politics, that's pretty mild stuff,” said Al Cardenas, one of Bush’s closest Florida confidants, who acknowledged that any intensifying attacks between the two, who insist they remain friends, are about politics.\nPoll: GOP voters prefer fresh ideas to experience By Nick Gass\n“They respect each other and consider each other friends. Running for president is the biggest contact sport in politics. Strategists figure out what needs to be done. Within context of all that, I think they will each accept from their strategists advice about pointing out differences, but I don't think either of them intends to make it personal.”\nThe candidates themselves continue to echo that point, insisting that there is no discord between them beyond politics. On Thursday, Bush told reporters he believed Rubio “can put his big-boy pants on.” In another interview Friday morning on Fox News Channel, Rubio brushed off Donald Trump’s suggestion that he and Bush are only pretending to remain friends and actually hate each other.\n\"He doesn't know what he's talking about,” Rubio said of Trump. “I have great admiration for Governor Bush. We're friends; we're running for the same office. I'm not running against him; I'm running for president. It doesn't change my feelings towards him as a person.\n“You don't have to hate the person you're running against,” he continued. “In the case of Governor Bush, who I've known for a very long time, I admire him and we're friends — but we're competitors now too; and we can do that in a way that's deserving of what the American people deserve.\"\nThe friendly rhetoric obscures what is actually a bitter dogfight between Bush and Rubio’s campaigns, which continue to circulate opposition research about one another and spar with far greater intensity than the principals themselves.\nWith both Bush and Rubio holding dueling fundraising events in New York City later this month, a Bush supporter crowed earlier this week about Bush’s “varsity” host committee. “I’m not sure Rubio’s would even qualify as the junior varsity.”\nOn Thursday, Bush supporters not affiliated with his campaign began alerting reporters to a new YouTube video , just posted that day, a complication of old interviews in which Rubio downplayed running for president and said he wanted to be the best Senator from Florida.\nTrump’s own Texas state director called him a 'joke' By Ben Schreckinger\nFriday morning, even as Rubio was playing nice in his TV and radio interviews, his supporters gloated over reports that they’d booted a tracker working for Jeb Bush’s super PAC from their morning town hall in Dubuque, Iowa.\n“The two of them may get along fine, but it’s a civil war in Florida between their campaigns,” said one Florida lobbyist who is supporting Bush. “There’s resentments and animosities on both sides because this is presidential politics and people have all picked sides.”\nWhat remains to be seen is whether the attacks between the candidates escalate, especially as Bush continues to lag behind Rubio and much of the GOP field. If his poll standing doesn’t improve after his super PAC’s first round of television ads, Bush may have no other way to reassure panicky donors than to go all in on attacking Rubio.\n“Voters have made an assessment about Jeb Bush and have a seeming reluctance to want to invest in Jeb Bush as the party’s prospective nominee right now,” Schmidt said. “What the polling would suggest is that [establishment voters] are going to take a very careful look over the coming months at John Kasich, Marco Rubio—even Chris Christie will get a second look.\n“And before voters come back around to Jeb Bush and fuel growth in his numbers, they’re going to have to flirt with, date and then move on from those other establishment candidates. And the faster that that can happen, the faster that Jeb Bush’s numbers will move up.”\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiBKeXVY258"], "published": "2015-10-02T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:25:22.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
