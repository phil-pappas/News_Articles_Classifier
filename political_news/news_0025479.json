More Russia exposes EU divisions on Syria \nIsis said in an online statement that four suicide bombings had been carried out against the Qasr hotel and other targets used by the coalition of Sunni states seeking to reinstall the Yemeni government by pushing back the Houthis and forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh. \nThe Isis claim, if confirmed, would mark the first time the militant group has attacked the Saudi-led Arab coalition, which is preparing for a potential offensive on the capital, Sana’a. Isis has pledged to attack the Gulf monarchies, which it says are not true defenders of Islam. \nThe emergence of Isis operations against the coalition would complicate the civil war in Yemen. \nThe coalition said other sites in Aden had been attacked with rockets on Tuesday, killing three UAE soldiers and one Saudi member of the joint force. \nThe official news agency of the UAE, which is leading the coalition’s ground operations in Yemen , blamed the Houthi-Saleh alliance for the hotel attack. \nThe coalition is determined to check what it regards as Iranian backing for the Houthis and Mr Saleh. \nThe Arab coalition has made gains in recent weeks, including capturing the Marib dam east of Sana’a, and claims to control the Bab el-Mandab strait linking the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. \nThe gains follow a devastating attack last month on a coalition camp in Marib , when a Houthi missile killed 60 soldiers by striking an arms dump. \nCritics of the coalition claim the Sunni forces have avoided conflict with Islamist militants, such as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which control tracts of southern Yemen thanks to links to local tribes. \nThe coalition has said it would deal with such groups once the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who was ousted by the Houthis in January, was reinstated. \nIsis, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria, has branched out into other Arab states. Its Yemeni branch has previously claimed suicide bombings on Shia mosques in Sana’a. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools.
