Nuwame\nAward-winning You Tube cardboard artist and teacher L.A. Nuwame unveils his new book to promote the benefits of using cardboard for upcycling and personal design\nMISSISSAUGA, Ontario , Oct. 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- YouTube cardboard craft instructor L.A. Nuwame – known as The Homemade Game Guru – believes cardboard is the greatest crafting and building material available to all people worldwide. He also believes every single human being has latent creative potential and if given the right encouragement, we all can create amazing things. These two ideals of cardboard's usefulness and personal creativity have culminated into the launch of The Homemade Game Guru's first do-it-yourself craft book, The Cardboard Bible.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277645\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277646\nThe Cardboard Bible is a self-published 112-page full color manual featuring five detailed step-by-step intricate crafts that can be made by anyone out of scrap cardboard, glue and basic household materials. The unique cardboard concepts featured in the first edition include a living room C-table, a transforming sword with infinite mix-and-match possibilities, an ab-roller exercise device, a functioning treadmill and a foosball table. The book provides advice on what types of cardboard to use, where to get abundant amounts of free cardboard and the benefits of upcycling scrap materials into these useful home accessories.\nThe Cardboard Bible is intended to be part of a larger global upcycling trend promoting the reuse of materials usually destined for landfills. Although regional recycling programs help recirculate materials like cardboard and plastics, far too often these materials become regular household refuse. With an uncertain global economy still struggling and household incomes stagnant, reusing materials like cardboard, wood and plastic in innovative ways can prove beneficial to not only the environment, but to the pocket books of family households as well.\n\"The idea of this book is to take a free and abundant material usually wasted and challenge people to challenge themselves to create amazing useful products within the comforts of home,\" stated Nuwame. \"Cardboard is the most useful building material everyone on earth has access to and it's time to use it in ways that provide greater personal benefits beyond sheltering disposable products and then trashing it.\"\nNuwame has carved out a niche for cardboard creativity on YouTube by posting crafting videos on his Homemade Game Guru channel that feature entertaining DIY oddities that include a functioning above-ground cardboard swimming pool, cardboard exercise equipment, comic book crafts and home furnishings. His videos have been seen over 5 million times and have garnered a 2008 MajorFun.com award for innovation and a 2009 World Records Academy World Record.\nThe Cardboard Bible is available for $19.99 on Amazon.com. To coincide with the current Canadian election, The Cardboard Bible is being promoted using a humorous YouTube video for a factious Cardboard Liberation Party of Canada .\nThe book itself is targeted to a worldwide audience. From the U.S.A. to Germany to China , if a reader has access to cardboard, The Cardboard bible will help showcase the beginnings of creative possibilities.\nContact:\nL.A.
