She is under oath. This is not a political rally.\" \n\"I think the FBI has a lot more to go on today as a result of this testimony, because she forgot about that third and hidden audience.\" \nThis is a real stretch, but on Fox News some were promoting how great Gowdy's hearing was and that it was just a matter of time before Hillary was going to be indicted. (He's back: Joe Biden) This is a hail Mary of sorts, but not as outlandish as anything they've ever done before this hearing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:16:02.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
