I know reading can be hard for some, so I snipped out an interesting passage from the article for you: He was then asked by CNN presenter Wolf Blitzer: \"Just clarify, if there had been no gun control laws in Europe at that time, would six million Jews have been slaughtered?\" Mr Carson said he doubted Hitler would have been able to achieve his goals if Germans had been armed at that time.\"I'm telling you that there is a reason that these dictatorial people take the guns first,\" he added. The Anti-Defamation League, an anti-Semitism monitoring group, has previously said that drawing comparisons between the gun control debate in the US and the Holocaust was \"historically inaccurate and offensive\", especially to Holocaust survivors and their families. Ben Carson's comments come days after a mass shooting at a college in the US state of Oregon, in which nine people were killed. Speaking after the attack, Mr Carson said: \"I would not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, hey, guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.\" Survivors and relatives of gun attacks in the US have described his comments as insensitive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:11:57.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
