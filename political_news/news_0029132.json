Through an interview broadcasted by Grillonautas , Héctor Zepeda, best known as the Commander Teto, said that the Templario leaders along the Michoacán coast were never arrested and are waiting for the right moment to attack. Commander Teto said that plaza bosses such as Federico González ‘El Lico’, Pablo Toscano Padilla ‘El 500’, Ignacio Andrade Rentería ‘El Cenizo’ and Carmelo Núñez Vargas remain free and nobody looks for them. They claim that they are in Colima, Puerto Vallarta, Guanajuato and Guerrero just waiting for the autodefensas to weaken. “They [the government] have forgotten about them, now the problem is us, the autodefensas, who obstruct them.” Silvano Is a Liar Following the announcement of Silvano Aureoles Conejo, Governor of Michoacán, who gave them six months in order for them to integrate themselves into the State Police or disarm themselves, Commander Teto called him a “liar like all politicians.” Commander Zepeda says that he and his men voted for Silvano after he promised negotiations with the coastal autodefensas but as soon as he came into office, they haven’t even had a phone call with him. Various autodefensa spokespeople are concerned with the position of Silvano Aureoles who considers the sierra-coastal region as a “red flag.” “Why are we a red flag?” “If we don’t have kitchens, we don’t extort, we don’t kill”, commanders like Teto ask themselves. “We are concerned with anything that comes up,” Héctor ensures referring to the deployment of 5,000 Federal Police announced by Silvano Aureoles for the coming months. Antioco Libre\nJuan Hernández Ramírez (left) & La Tuta\nAccording to the spokesman of the autodefensa movement, one of the signs that an attack against them is imminent is with the recent acquittal of the former mayor of Aquila, Juan Hernández Ramírez and of the leader of the autodefensas of Huahua, José Antioco Calvillo García ; masterminds of the attack against the coordinator and leader of the coastal autodefensas, Semeí Verdía Zepeda. Through a press release, the Attorney General of the State (PGJE) of Michoacán informed that ministerial staff managed to establish the responsibility and participation of Antioco Calvillo, who reported the movements made by Semeí Verdía. José Antioco and the former mayor had meetings on several occasions in Maruata and Aquila with members of organized crime in order to plan the death of Verdía but they were arrested by autodefensas after the attack failed. However, on Thursday, October 15, the judge of the Fifth Unitary Criminal Court revoked the detention order against both defendants after they found that there was no sufficient evidence to hold them guilty in the attempted murder. Lastly, the autodefensas stated that difficult times are coming for all of Michoacán and they see that it’s “sad to see the government harassment” against them.\nJosé Antioco Calvillo‘s confession video where he admits having participated in meetings with the former mayor of Aquila, the Undersecretary of Public Security of Michoacán, Adolfo Eloy Peralta Mora “El Yanki”, and Los Viagras with the plan to assassinate Semeí Verdía and the usufruct of mining concessions in the region of Aquila.\nSource: Michoacán 3.0", "external_links": ["http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2015/06/aquila-mayor-and-autodefensa-leader.html", "http://michoacantrespuntocero.com/gobierno-del-estado-y-caballeros-templarios-vienen-a-atacarnos-autodefensas/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/LNVx_hZ90Ds"], "published": "2015-10-20T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:45:48.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
