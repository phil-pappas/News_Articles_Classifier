How Master's Students Choose Institutions: Research on International Student Segmentation is a new report from the non-profit World Education Services. It provides a lens into the institutional preferences of nearly 2,400 U.S.-bound international students seeking master's degrees.\nThe findings suggest that U.S. colleges and universities can improve their recruitment and international enrollment by understanding and recognizing key differences in international students based on their home country, financial resources and the unique value proposition of each university.\nThe report, the fourth in a series from World Education Services, expands upon an international student segmentation framework. Despite the growing importance of international master's students in the U.S., there is little research about how international students from different parts of the world, determine which institutions to apply to and enroll. This WES report seeks to fill a research gap by examining institutional attributes and characteristics including school reputation, career prospects, location and cost.\nKey findings include:\nNearly half (48 percent) of international master's students reported that career prospects are the most important factor when considering where to apply and enroll. Seventy-six percent of Chinese master's students chose private institutions as \"reach schools,\" while approximately 70 percent of Indian master's students preferred public institutions. Fifty-four percent of master's students from Sub-Saharan Africa have a budget of less than $20,000 per year for their studies, while 40 percent of Middle Eastern master's students can afford more than $40,000 .
