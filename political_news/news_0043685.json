Can the fight to do away with oppressive social hierarchies such as caste that have restricted free choice for individuals in various ways down the centuries be confined to the boundaries of the nation state — especially when the nation state itself is the creation of a much later time? \nWhen the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September, it inadvertently raised these issues once again. According to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, it is “an agenda for people to end poverty in all its forms — an agenda for the planet, our common home”. Ostensibly aimed at reducing inequality in all its forms, it’s no surprise that rights movements in India are agitated over the exclusion of caste — the religion-sanctioned ideology and practice of discrimination based on birth that has been central to social organisation in India from ancient times, centuries before the formation of the Republic of India in 1947. \nMost Dalit activists are appalled by the absurdity of any agenda to reduce inequality in India (and, as some point out, even in other countries with a substantial Indian-origin population) without addressing caste. After all, caste based atrocities continue to be reported with alarming regularity from all over the country. Yet, activists across South Asia allege that it was on India ’s insistence that the mention of caste was omitted in the UN document. \nThe Agenda for Sustainable Development comprises 17 goals and 169 targets for alleviating poverty, reducing inequality and tackling climate change over the next 15 years. It is part of the plans for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGS) adopted in 2000. A new phrase that has been brought into the discourse with the 2030 document is “indignity of poverty”. The General Assembly hailed the document as the blueprint for a better future that would “leave no one behind”. After it was adopted, Ban Ki-Moon said, “The 2030 document compels us to look beyond national boundaries and short-term interests and act in solidarity for the long term.” \nThe agenda document explains the measures to be undertaken and the problems to be overcome as the international community moves towards a world where there is ‘No Poverty’, ‘Zero Hunger’ and ‘Reduced Inequalities’. Clearly, in setting the goals that are to be achieved by 2030, the UN has underlined the need to make growth inclusive. \nGoal No. 10 specifically addresses the issue of inequality. It seeks to “empower and promote the social, economic and political inclusion of all irrespective of age, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status” by “ensuring equal opportunity and reduce inequalities of outcome, including the thorough elimination of discriminating laws, policies and practices”. \nDalit activists in various South Asian countries allege that it would be impossible to achieve the sustainable development goals in the entire region without addressing caste as a social system that perpetuates inequality and deprivation. In fact, soon after the draft of the document was made public, the Asian Dalit Rights Forum (ADRF) headquartered in Kathmandu had suggested to the UN that caste-based discrimination should be included in the final agenda but the suggestion was ignored. \n“‘Leave no one behind’ encapsulates a holistic development framework,” reads a statement issued by the ADRF “However, this framework needs to take into account the situation of Dalits as those vulnerable and are affected by intergenerational poverty due to inherent systems of hierarchy and exclusion that prevent, discriminate and prohibit access to development and rule of law. Dalits have been victims of discrimination and hate crimes for centuries and have been considered as impure and polluting. Significance of caste in social exclusion is indeed recognized by Post 2015 development agenda (working committee) but seems to have failed to make into the Sustainable Development Goals or its Targets (sic).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:20:17.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
