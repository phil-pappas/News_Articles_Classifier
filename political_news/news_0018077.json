Kimball Research Institute has received a significant federal grant to identify the immune cells that block medications commonly used to treat patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) â€“ an autoimmune bleeding disease in which patients attack and destroy their own platelets, the blood component primarily responsible for controlling bleeding. Approximately 90,000 adult patients in the United States and Europe have the disease, which afflicts twice as many women as men.\n\"New medications that boost platelet production are increasingly used to treat ITP patients, but they don't work for everyone,\" said Dr. Karina Yazdanbakhsh , head of the Complement Biology Laboratory. \"We believe that the lack of response in these individuals is due to their having hyperactive immune states. Our goal is to identify the immune cells that cause non-responsiveness to these ITP drugs, which would not only help these individual patients, but will also provide a strong foundation for the development of a possible cure for all ITP patients.\"\nThe National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health have awarded Dr. Yazdanbakhsh and her colleagues almost $2 million over 3.5 years for their work, which includes a subcontract to investigators at Cornell University.
