Author: Stephen Sestanovich , George F. Kennan Senior Fellow for Russian and Eurasian Studies October 15, 2015 -- -- \nThe Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on Russia last week to address this question: How should we think about Russian actions in the Middle East and Europe? Having been invited to speak, I found that one theme of my testimony stirred up an argument—among other witnesses, senators, staff, and even (in follow-on e-mails) administration officials. This back-and-forth captures U.S. policy confusion as we adjust to a new phase of relations with Russia . \nHere’s the gist: My opening statement argued that it was a mistake to respond to Vladimir Putin ’s new activism by calling Russia an “ existential threat ,” as some officials have done. When Russians hear us saying that we feel they threaten our existence, their nationalist hysteria grows. They conclude that our countries are on a collision course toward war and that Washington must be preparing for it. We sound as crazy as they do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:37:09.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
