Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah speaks at the start of a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Secret Service accountability stemming from a March 4, 2015, incident. A new government report concludes that scores of Secret Service employees improperly accessed the decade-old job application of Chaffetz, who was investigating scandals inside the agency. A deputy director was caught suggesting officials leak embarrassing information to retaliate against Chaffetz. The report said the actions could represent criminal violations under the U.S. Privacy Act.
