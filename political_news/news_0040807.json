Everyone is a potential crime victim, and October is when government agencies, civic groups, schools, businesses, and youth organizations join in trying to reduce the threat. This is National Crime Prevention Month, with special awareness and education events planned across the country. During this time, we are all encouraged to help reduce violence, drugs and property crimes with efforts at three levels - family, neighborhood and community. Suggestions include setting up a neighborhood watch program, making sure streets and individual homes are well lighted and locking your car. Such efforts supplement the work of the nation's 780,000 police officers and detectives, and the 675,000 employees of the nation's more than 10,000 security guard and patrol services.
