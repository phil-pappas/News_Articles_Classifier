In addition to negating nearly 100,000 gallons of propane, the world's most sustainable fuel program will also plant a tree in the Santa Fe National Forest on behalf of each 550 hot air balloons participating in the popular event.\n\"Every year we look for new and innovative ways to improve the Balloon Fiesta. Partnering with STRIVE for these offsetting and tree planting programs in our backyard lessens our impact on the environment and creates a lasting legacy in the Santa Fe National Forest,\" says Paul Smith , executive director for the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta. \"ALON 7-Eleven has been one of the Fiesta's valued sponsors for years, and we're excited to work with them on their latest initiative.\"\nCreated through a partnership between ALON Distributors and GreenPrint, the STRIVE Fuel program reduces carbon emissions sustainably and counteracts the negative effects they can have on the atmosphere, climate and lifestyles. To offset the balloon flights, STRIVE will invest in U.S. based carbon reduction projects to eliminate emissions that harm the atmosphere. The projects are certified and verified to sequester carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. In addition, STRIVE Fuel is partnering with The Arbor Day Foundation to plant 550 trees in the Sante Fe National Forest, ensuring a long-term localized carbon reduction solution for the balloon emissions. All of this is in addition to the ongoing investment STRIVE Fuel is making in Albuquerque to offset tailpipe emissions for ALON's customers and to plant trees locally in partnership with Tree New Mexico and Keep Albuquerque Beautiful.\n\"The Balloon Fiesta is an important event to the city of Albuquerque and one that we look forward to every year,\" states Eric Corley , regional manager in Albuquerque for 7-Eleven. \"We launched STRIVE to improve our community and make an impact on the footprint we leave behind. Being able to do the same for this internationally-acclaimed event is an honor and something we hope to make a lasting tradition.\"\nFor more information, visit www.strivefuel.com/stations or look for the icon in the GasBuddy mobile application.\nAbout the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta\nThe Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is an annual festival of hot air balloons that takes place every October in Albuquerque, New Mexico , USA.
