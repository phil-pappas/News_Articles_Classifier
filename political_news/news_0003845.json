The NDC in particular is pushing for an audit to clean it whilst others are advocating for the compilation of an entirely new electoral roll. \nIssues bordering on some proposed reforms ahead of the 2016 general elections and continuous voter registration exercise were also said to have been discussed at the meeting. \nEven though the EC officials were prepared to make a presentation on how they were going to proceed on the continuous registration exercise, the parties reportedly demanded written guidelines on how it (EC) wants to go about it in order to look at it vis-Ã -vis the country's electoral laws. \nThe political parties are therefore waiting for the EC to furnish them with the modalities before making any inputs. \nPresent were representatives of the various political parties, including the two largest political parties in the country – the ruling NDC which was represented by its National Chairman, Kofi Portuphy and General Secretary Johnson Asiedu Nketia, with the NPP represented by its General Secretary, Kwabena Agyepong, former National Chairman, Peter Mac Manu, Member of Parliament (MP) for Akuapim South, Osei Bonsu Amoah and Director of Elections, Martin Adjei-Mensah Korsah. \nNew York Demo The development at the EC headquarters yesterday came at the heels of an event in New York. A group of Ghanaians presented a petition to the United Nations Human Rights Council about the ill-treatment of the Let My Vote Count Alliance (LMVCA) demonstrators recently. \nA large turnout of placard-bearing Ghanaians rendered support to the submission of the petition at the UN headquarters in New York where President John Mahama is attending the ongoing UN General Assembly. \nThe petition was jointly signed by Kwame Agyeman-Budu, Ibrahim Sanni, Issah, Ballah and Mujeeb Mogtari from the Staten Island, New York. \n'We respectfully request that the United Nations and its Human Rights office act for humanity sake by finding that the Ghanaian Government is acting in violation of international human rights law and, more importantly, with an intentional and reckless disregard for human rights by unilaterally ordering and directing a “pre-emptive strike” against unprovoked and legitimate expression of fundamental human rights of Ghanaians, which will have a scathing effect on the peace and stability of the country. It is the utmost duty of the HRC to promote universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinctions of any kind and in a fair and equal manner.' \nBy Charles Takyi-Boadu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:17:40.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
