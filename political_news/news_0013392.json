Covered California - the state's marketplace for the federal Patient Protection and the Affordable Care Act - has given Kaiser Permanente's plan 4 stars, the highest possible rating, for quality and service.\nLast week, Kaiser Permanente's Medicare health plans in California earned 5 stars - the highest overall rating for quality and service - from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. In addition, the California Office of the Patient Advocate announced that Kaiser Permanente's health plans in Northern California and Southern California were given 4-star ratings, again the highest possible, and that they were the only health plans in the state so ranked for overall quality of care. This is the third year in a row Kaiser Permanente's health plans have been rated 4 stars by Covered California.\n\"We are proud to receive 4 out of 4 stars in Covered California's 2015 quality ratings. These ratings affirm Kaiser Permanente's deep commitment to being a leader in providing an exceptional level of service to the members, patients and communities we serve,\" said Patrick Courneya , MD, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. \"This recognition reflects not only our integrated approach, but also the work of our dedicated physicians, nurses, clinicians and care teams, who excel in providing high-quality care and service.\"\nAs open enrollment begins this week, Covered California provides consumers an additional resource to select the best health plans for them and their families. Covered California's ratings reflect exchange enrollees' satisfaction with their health plan, as well as their experiences with their doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. California residents using the \"Shop and Compare\" tool on the Covered California website will see the quality ratings displayed with each plan that meets their shopping preferences in the geographical area where they live.\n\"Kaiser Permanente is focused on bringing extraordinary value to our members. The Covered California Health Plan Quality ratings demonstrate that we are providing the high-quality care and service that consumers need and expect,\" said Wade J. Overgaard , Kaiser Permanente's senior vice president for Health Plan Operations. \"We also applaud the type of transparency Covered California promotes - giving consumers the ability to easily compare standard plan designs, without the fine print.\"\nAccording to Covered California, a 4-star plan placed in the top 25 percent of all rated plans. Three stars are given for those that landed in the 50 percent to 75 percent range, while a 2-star plan means it scored in the 25 percent to 50 percent range for all plans. One star is given for those plans scoring in the bottom 25 percent.\nAbout Kaiser Permanente\nKaiser Permanente is committed to helping shape the future of health care.
