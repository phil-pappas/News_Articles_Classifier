Fund balances have been growing almost every year, including this year.\nFund balances are necessary for cash flow management. The issue is what levels of balances are necessary. Based on data from the Kansas State Department of Education, fund balances rose rapidly after 2008, and have remained largely level since 2011.\nI’ve gathered data about unspent Kansas school funds and presented it as an interactive visualization.
