Mr Obama will then host the chief executives of five large companies — Johnson & Johnson , Intel , Hershey’s, California-based utility PG&E and Berkshire Hathaway Energy — and some of their suppliers for a discussion about how companies can cut carbon emissions around the world. More Martin Wolf Carney alerts UK insurers \nAlthough the 81 companies included a handful of energy companies, large oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron were notably absent. \nMr Obama hopes that support from companies with a combined market capitalisation of more than $5tn will boost the chances that the delegates from almost 200 countries can reach a climate accord in Paris. He also plans to use the pledges to craft a legacy on climate change during his final 15 months in office. \nThe push to secure backing from corporate America comes as the issue of climate change remains politically divisive in the US. Republicans, including many of their presidential contenders, are highly critical of the way Mr Obama is forging ahead on climate change. \n“It is... quite significant six weeks out from the Paris conference to have the president [meet] with these corporate leaders to underscore that the American private sector is squarely behind the outcome that we are trying to achieve,” a senior administration official told the Financial Times. \nAlex Gorsky, chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, said having a large number of companies join the pledge would have a “very significant impact” on pushing for a deal. “We’re excited that it does seem to be picking up momentum,” Mr Gorsky told the FT. “The more large companies work together . . . it will create significant momentum around the world.” \nIn making climate change one of his signature issues, Mr Obama has taken actions that have won praise from environmentalists to Pope Francis. But they have drawn scorn from Republicans who say his efforts are unconstitutional and risk hurting US economic competitiveness. The White House hopes that the industry support will act as a “very powerful voice” to help counter the view that cutting carbon emissions and economic growth is a zero-sum game. \n“One of the old and tired critiques . . . is that the only way to act is to do so by putting more businesses in your private sector at a competitive disadvantage,” said the US official. “The commitment by these companies and their voice in supporting an ambitious international agreement really puts that argument to rest.” In depth \nClimate change \nThe latest news and analysis on the world’s changing climate and the political moves afoot to tackle the problem \nThe Obama administration says the 81 companies that have signed the pledge, which includes Dell, Hewlett-Packard , Siemens , McDonald’s , Sony and Starbucks, represent 30 per cent of the largest 50 companies in the US and employ 9m people in 50 states across the country. \nThe official added: “If you look at where these companies are headquartered, if you look at who their customers are and who their employees are, they represent America and they represent a broad cross section of America, including places where Republicans are representing them.” \nIn addition to signing the pledge to support a climate change deal in Paris, many of the companies announced commitments that included reducing carbon emissions by up to 50 per cent, cutting water usage by up to 80 per cent and guaranteeing that 100 per cent of their purchased energy came from renewables. \nIkea committed to produce as much renewable energy as it consumed globally by 2020, while Johnson & Johnson vowed to cut carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 and to power all its facilities with renewable energy by the same year. Dell said it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2020, compared with 2012, and boost purchases of renewable energy to at least 50 per cent of the total by 2020. PG&E aims to provide its customers with electricity that is more than 60 per cent carbon free by 2020. Nike plans to use 100 per cent renewable energy in its owned or operated factories by 2025. Siemens pledged to reduce its global carbon footprint by 50 per cent by 2020 and cut net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. \nWhile some of the commitments had been previously made, the official said the bulk were either new or expanded on previous goals. \nThe official said the signatories reflected a wide cross-section of companies, including energy groups, but added that the White House hoped to engineer a third round of pledges before Paris. “We feel very good about not just the volume of companies but actually the cross section that they represent. Now the opportunity for us is to take these leaders in sectors across the economy and encourage them to bring their peers into this as well.” More video \nThe pledge marks the latest example of corporations taking action on issues when they perceive that the mood of their consumers has shifted. This year, Indiana and Arkansas abandoned “religious freedom laws” that critics said would allow discrimination against gays following a wave of criticism from companies that included GE, Apple and Walmart. \nMr Gorsky said climate change was another issue where companies were becoming quicker to follow their customers. \n“Just as the opinion of customers, and in our case patients, around the world are more sensitised to this issue . . . they are demanding more from the companies from which they purchase their products,” he said. “The overall trend about ultimately trying to reduce carbon emissions, trying to move towards cleaner, greener more sustainable sources of energy . . . will certainly continue into the future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:27:08.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
