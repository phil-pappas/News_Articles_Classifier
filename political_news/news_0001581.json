THE NEW US ambassador to Thailand, Glyn Davies, yesterday expressed hope that the Kingdom would return to democracy and have an early election. He told reporters after a meeting with Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai that the United States hoped Thailand would strongly commit to its own road map towards democracy and reconciliation. \"I would not talk about this issue too much since it is a domestic affair of Thailand but would spend my time to get to know about Thai people and their thoughts,\" he said. As Thailand is one of the oldest allies of the US, he said Washington attached importance to their long-term bilateral relations, and the US would cooperate with Thailand in various fields including security, social issues, law enforcement, the environment and people-to-people ties. Don said he had explained to the new ambassador that democracy was the ultimate goal of his government. Now, the country is in the process of drafting a constitution and reform, he said, and claimed that Davies understood the process and the goal. Davies arrived in Thailand a few weeks ago to fill the vacancy of head of US mission in Thailand. Despite strong criticism from Washington over suppression of democracy and poor human-rights practices after the coup in May last year, Don said diplomatic relations between the two countries were normal. The two countries are still \"good friends\", he said. Cooperation will continue and expand, he said. The two sides will call a meeting of the fifth strategic dialogue in Thailand in December to boost cooperation in all aspects, Don said, and noted that Daniel Russel, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, would head the US delegation at the meeting. The US also will not impose any sanctions against Thailand due to its bottom status in the \"Trafficking in Persons\" report, he said. Thailand was graded at the lowest Tier 3 in the TIP report this year. The US president will consider within 90 days from July 27 if it is necessary to take any further action to improve the human-trafficking situation. Don said Washington would not punish but would advise Thailand on how to cope with the problem. Officials from the State Department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons will come to advise their Thai counterparts today, he said. 342 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:19:03.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
