He says an agreement Tate signed prior to FBI interviews limited how prosecutors could use what he said. Charges that he was untruthful could be refiled later in a separate case. \nThe ruling leaves Paul's 2012 deputy campaign manager, Demitrios Kesari, and Jesse Benton, a long-time political adviser, to stand trial in Des Moines. \nBenton faces one count of making false statements and Kesari faces five charges, including conspiracy and obstruction. \nProsecutors allege they hid payments to a former state senator who endorsed Paul.
