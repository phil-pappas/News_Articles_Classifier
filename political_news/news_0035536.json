Some say we shouldn’t shout about it, that I shouldn’t shout about it,” Clinton said yesterday in a thinly veiled reference to the Vermont senator’s jab at her during the Las Vegas showdown.\n“Well, I think we have to keep talking, but more importantly we have to act. We have to be willing to take on those who are not in favor of sensible gun safety measures.”\nThe former secretary of state sharpened her attacks on the gun industry and even floated the idea of doing a nationwide gun buyback before a largely supportive crowd of 250 at Keene State College.\nThe gun control issue put some daylight between her and Sanders on the Las Vegas debate stage, where Clinton hammered him for voting against legislation that would have put in place background checks on gun purchases.\nSo not surprisingly, she spent the first 10 minutes yesterday on the issue. Later, a man asked her why other countries such as Australia have been able to crack down on gun violence while the U.S. hasn’t. Clinton said one reason was that Australia installed a nationwide gun buyback program in the wake of a mass shooting.\n“I think that is worth considering (here),” Clinton said. “I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work. But the Australian (example) is worth looking at.”\nStill, at least one veteran Granite State observer doesn’t believe Clinton will get very far trying to out-lefty Sanders on guns.\n“I don’t think she can position herself as the more committed, solidly left-wing candidate because she can’t win that battle,” said R. Kelly Myers, a Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald pollster.\n“I think she’ll test it out and see if it holds or not. … But she needs to talk about legislative accomplishment rather than merely talking about issues. I think it’s an open question as to whether or not that one issue will be enough to set her apart from Sanders,” Myers said.\nClinton’s return here came as newly released fundraising figures show her finishing the last quarter with $33 million on hand after raising $29 million during the three-month span.\nShe also spent nearly $26 million, while Sanders, buoyed by 650,000 small donors, ended the quarter with $27 million in the bank, putting both far ahead of anyone in the sprawling Republican field.\n“From a fundraising perspective, you’d much rather be in Sen. Sanders’ shoes because of the small donor base … because small donors still have room to come back,” said Steve McMahon, a veteran Virginia Democratic strategist.\n“But from a political perspective, you’d much rather be in Clinton’s shoes. Her base is broader and deeper and much more diverse than Sen. Sanders’.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:29:43.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
