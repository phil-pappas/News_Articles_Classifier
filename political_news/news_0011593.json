Related \nWatch this story \nThose are still big “ifs” at this point, but no matter how it turns out, it is a sign that the political landscape has changed for women.“I really felt the time was right for me to step out and take on a new leadership role,” candidate for leiutenant governor Kesha Ram said. \nState Representative Ram announced Monday she is running for lieutenant governor of Vermont. \nEight years ago, at just 22 years old, Ram was elected to the State House, but not without some backlash. \n“I remember at the time one of my opponents said, ‘I'd be curious to see what she thinks she brings to the table,’” Ram said. \nRam was inspired to take on the new leadership role by women like Madeleine Kunin, the only woman to hold the state's top office. \nShe served as governor for six years from 1985 to 1991. \nShe said there were hurdles when she ran but believes a lot has changed since then. \n“I must confess, I thought after I won the barricades had been lowered and we were going to have a parade of women running for governor and we haven't. It's still rare to have a woman governor,” Ram said. \nNow Sue Minter is taking on that challenge, last week announcing her bid for governor. \n\"I think Vermonters are ready for new leadership and a different voice,” Minter said when kicking off her campaign in Waterbury. \nKunin said she's delighted to see two ladies running for the state's highest offices. \n“We think nothing of two men running for governor and lieutenant governor, so it shouldn't be a big deal to see two women running for governor and lieutenant governor,” Kunin said. “I think it's a healthy American phenomenon.” \nRam agrees. \n”When women run they win, and when they win they lead with the best interest of Vermonters at heart,” Ram said. \nThe primary election is in August 2016, followed by the general election in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:57:34.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
