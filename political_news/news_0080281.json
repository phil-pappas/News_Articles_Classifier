As the world confronts the biggest refugee and migration crisis since WWII, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called UN Member States to accept the responsibility of sharing in terms of boosting the number of refugee resettlement places.\nOn 30 September, Ban held a meeting, at the UN Headquarters regarding the global refugee crisis. The UN Secretary General outlined eight guiding principles to the UN Member States to improve preparedness, beginning with saving lives. “The preservation of life must guide all our efforts, from asylum policies to robust search-and-rescue mechanisms,” he stated.\nAlso vital is protection; non-discrimination; preparedness to better adjudicate claims; responsibility sharing in terms of boosting the number of refugee resettlement places; better cooperation between countries of origin, transit and destination; managed migration to ensure safe and legal channels for refugees and migrants; anticipating future challenges – including the plight of those escaping areas progressively ravaged by climate change. “Together, we must translate these principles into reality,” Ban said.\nThe Secretary-General’s Special Representative for International Migration, Peter Sutherland, said the issues being discussed are “issues for humanity” that are not going to go away, and which are likely to grow in the coming period.\nSutherland, noted that there are still far too many countries which believe in unilateral action to address migration challenges. “Cooperation is central to where we have to go. Those who seek unilateral solutions sometimes rely on sovereignty. But the only way to exercise sovereignty effectively in the day and age in which we live is through cooperation in an interdependent world. If we don’t take that course, then the winners will be those who seek to undermine society and the rule of society which we all claim to wish to uphold,” he stated.\n“In the context of migration, the winners will be smugglers, traffickers and unscrupulous employers. Those who lose will be the dispossessed, the hungry, the vulnerable, the defenceless and the children.” He also underscored the principle of global responsibility, stating that “proximity doesn’t determine responsibility.”\nOrban calls for global refugee quotas\nThe Associated Press reported that during the meeting that was led by Ban, European leaders urged UN member states to introduce global refugee quotas to help in addressing the global refugee crisis.\nAccording to AP, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that Europe will not be able to carry the burden of the crisis on its own and needs a global quota system to ensure a fair distribution of people who qualify for asylum. Europe, he added, doesn’t have an obligation to give refugees a “new European life,” but it has a “moral responsibility” to help them “regain their lives back home.”\nMalta’s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat called for the establishment of “a Bretton Woods system of migration.” Muscat also stressed that the international community is responsible for ensuring that global migration quotas aren’t “decided by criminals and smugglers,” but by democratically elected leaders.\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, Antonio Guterres, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, praised Orban’s proposal for a global refugee quota system as highlighting “universal responsibility” for people fleeing violence and persecution.\nThe International Organization for Migration says a record number of people have crossed the Mediterranean into Europe this year, straining the 28-nation European Union and prompting a rash of border closures.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:46:03.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
