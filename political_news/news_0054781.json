Striking the right balance in these two objectives has been the most difficult thing to accomplish in these negotiations, but after many hours of dialogue and debate between the UAW and FCA US leadership, the Company felt that a just and equitable compromise had been reached.\nThe memories of our near-death experience in 2009 are vivid to this day in the minds of most of us at FCA. A large number of new employees have been brought into the Group since then who, thankfully, did not have to endure the pain and sacrifices that were required of the workforce then.\nBut it is that knowledge and those memories that continuously reinforce the FCA leadership's resolve to never let those events repeat.\nWhile significant progress has been made since the events of less than seven years ago, much more work remains to be done and challenges remain while new, significant ones surface. The cyclical nature of the automotive business demands that while we must recognize the need for rewarding employees during times of prosperity, we must also protect against the inevitable market downturn. This agreement accomplished both of these objectives.\nThe tentative agreement was designed to yield a strong and competitive FCA US , thus providing stability for our workforce and opportunity for future growth and investment in an increasingly complex global marketplace.\nThe Company will make decisions, as always, based on achieving our industrial objectives, and looks forward to continuing a dialogue with the UAW.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-regarding-uaw-ratification-vote-300152718.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DE17400&Transmission_Id=201510011230PR_NEWS_USPR_____DE17400&DateId=20151001", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-regarding-uaw-ratification-vote-300152718.html"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:48:16.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
