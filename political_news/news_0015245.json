Prison officials said he will serve his remaining sentence under house arrest after a year behind bars for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. \nThe bladerunner was allowed from Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria a day early in an attempt to avoid media glare. \n“He is at his uncle Arnold’s house in Pretoria, adding that the family was hunkered down”, said Pistorius family spokesman Anneliese Burgess. She added the family would issue a statement on 21 October. \nPistorius, 28, granted parole after he had served one sixth of his five-year sentence for shooting his girlfriend dead, “has been placed under correctional supervision tonight,” said correctional services department spokesman Manelisi Wolela. \n“The handling of the actual placement is the local management’s operational matter. How they handle it is their prerogative, but it is carried out in the interest of all parties concerned—the victim, the offender and the Department of Correctional Services.” \nPistorius was due to be released on Tuesday.“He should have been released on August 21,” his lawyer Brian Webber told AFP, hours before his release. \nPistorious faces a further test at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. on November 3 when prosecutors will appeal for a murder conviction and a tougher sentence that could see him jailed for at least 15 years. \nHis parole conditions included an instruction that he must meet Steenkamp’s parents if they wish to do so. \n“Also, he will be expected to report to the police periodically. There may be provision for drug tests and random visits by correctional services,” said criminal lawyer Martin Hood. “If he doesn’t comply, he can go back to prison,” he added. \nThe Department of Correctional Services earlier announced he would undergo “continued psychotherapy” and face restrictions on owning firearms. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:29:56.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
