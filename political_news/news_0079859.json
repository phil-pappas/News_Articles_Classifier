Does this mean the official position of Saudi Arabia towards the Egyptian state and President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi has changed?\" Egyptian TV host Lamis El-Hadidy inquired on her CBC show on Sunday.\n\"Will the Saudi administration accept the Egyptian ambassador in London receiving leading figures of the Saudi Opposition on Egypt's national day?” she asked angrily, reminding Saudis that Sheikh Qaradawi previously attacked Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\nIt is worth mentioning that Qaradawi’s invitation to the Saudi embassy in Doha comes at a time when Egypt and Saudi Arabia are taking different stances on the Russian strikes in Syria and the future of President Bashar Al-Assad.\nSaudi Arabia rejects Russia’s strikes on Syria and believes Al-Assad has no place in the country’s future. Egypt, however, takes a different stance.\nOn Sunday, Egypt's foreign minister Sameh Shoukry announced his support for the Russian strikes, saying they will help to curtail the spread of terror and help deal a fatal blow to the ISIS group.\nEgypt also supports a political solution in Syria consisting of dialogue with all parties, including the opposition and Al-Assad’s regime.\nEdited by Ahram Online", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:25:38.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
