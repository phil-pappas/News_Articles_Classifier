They went over details such as the primary calendar, filing deadlines and state-by-state processes for selecting delegates and super delegates. \nSimilar meetings were held with the other Democratic candidates: Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee. \nA source told the outlet: I think it means he’s running. \nA DNC spokesman did not confirm or deny that the meeting took place, according to the report. \nEven though Biden hasn’t entered the race, speculation about the vice president’s potential candidacy has shifted into high gear in recent weeks. He’s shored up support in the polls and the Draft Biden PAC says its on track to raise $2.5 million to $3 million . \nAn announcement may come soon, possibly after next week’s Democratic candidate debate. Still, as the New Yorker noted, this week’s DNC meeting may mean he’s still gathering information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:16:48.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
