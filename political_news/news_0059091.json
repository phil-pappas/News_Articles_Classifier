My cousin made me do it: Ahmed Manasra, the 13-year-old Palestinian boy that wounded two Israelis in the Pisgat Ze’ev section of Jerusalem last week, changed his story when questioned by authorities about his part in the assault his claims contradict his initial statements made to the authorities soon after his arrest, when he said that he and his cousin wanted to stab Jews in response to a perceived violation of the status quo on Temple Mount. [JPOST] \nArabs attacking Jews: Over 100 years of excuses: Before the partition, before Israel, before the settlements, before the ‘occupation’, before the refugees, before Sharon walked onto Temple Mount, before the ‘wall’, before immigration, before Balfour and before even Zionism itself. In the beginning there was an Arab with a knife and he murdered a Jew, simply because he was a Jew.It is an absurd logic that attempts to blame Zionism for creating violence against Jews when Modern Zionism *only came about* because of relentless violence against Jews; both in Europe and in the Middle East. You cannot place the cart before the horse.Enough with the excuses. [UKMEDIAWATCH] Boy 13, wounded in Jerusalem stabbing, wakes up: The boy has even begun to communicate with medical personnel and family members, according to a statement by the hospital.The boy was one of two Israeli victims stabbed by Ahmed and Hassan Manasra, 13 and 15, respectively, on October 12.He was taken to the hospital in life-threatening condition, placed in an induced coma and connected to a respirator.

[JP] \nHamas making efforts to carry out suicide attacks against Israel: Mahmoud al-Zahar, a senior figure in Hamas’ political bureau, told an Islamist-affiliated web site in Gaza that he was hopeful the current violence would escalate into “an armed intifada.”The Hamas leader said that it was incumbent on the Palestinians to use firearms and more deadly means “since this is what the Israeli side is doing.””Those who are coming out against an armed intifada are doing so out of personal interest and VIP status,” he said, taking a veiled verbal swipe at Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. [JPOST] \nChairman of House Foreign Affairs on Israeli Violence: ‘It Must Stop’: U.S. Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee announced on Monday that on Oct. 22, the committee will convene a hearing entitled, “Words Have Consequences: Palestinian Authority Incitement to Violence.” [JP] \nJP News Roundup \nCanadian Election Underway as Long Campaign Heads to Photo Finish: Prime Minister Stephen Harper, a Conservative who has held power for almost a decade, called the vote on Aug. 2 hoping that the more voters saw of Justin Trudeau the less they would like him. For many Canadians, the election was a referendum on Mr. Harper’s approach to government: [NYT] \nRecreational drones in the United States will soon have to be registered: For recreational drone pilots in the United States, the flight rules are clear: no higher than 400 feet, always within sight and nowhere near an airport without prior permission.But authorities admit they are currently powerless to clamp down on reckless behavior.“Finding the drone has not been as much of a problem as finding the person who was using the drone,” Foxx said. “The registration is designed to close that loophole.” [AFP] \nTwitter \nBill de Blasio .The Western Wall reminds us of the power of faith and our shared hope for peace.

In September 2014, there were upwards of 299 registered tour buses in the city. [DNAINFO] \nThe criminal probe of former Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes is heating up: Almost a dozen investigators from the Brooklyn US Attorney’s Office, the state Attorney General’s Office, and both the city and state comptroller’s offices asked the ex-staffers whether Hynes’ neighborhood community relations offices were being used as de facto campaign outposts in the 2013 race, a source said. [NYP] \nThe NY Post Gets It All Wrong: De Blasio’s ‘Vision Zero’ Works: New York Post report, the de Blasio administration was accused of “pandering” to the Orthodox Jewish vote in Williamsburg by issuing fewer traffic tickets in an effort to “keep them happy.”The accusation is even more questionable in light of the two Satmar sects in the area, in which one of the sects, led by Rabbi Zalmen Teitelbaum, did not even support de Blasio in the mayoral race the first time around, opting to shower City Comptroller Bill Thompson with support instead.So how does a police officer know which side of Satmar the driver belongs to? [JP] \nWhooping cough cases spike in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods: A wave of whooping cough has hit the Orthodox Jewish Brooklyn neighborhoods of Crown Heights, Williamsburg and Borough Park, city health officials said Monday.A total of 109 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, were reported over the past year in the three neighborhoods, with an increase in cases over the past four months, the Health Department said.Health officials are urging doctors to recall patients who are not up to date with vaccines so they can provide prompt antibiotic treatment to affected patients.
