(Photo: AP/PTI) Chennai: Faced with a do-or-die situation against South Africa in Thursday’s fourth ODI , senior Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Wednesday said his team's bowlers will have to be smarter than what they have been so far in the series.\nIndia are 1-2 down in the five-match rubber and need to win on Thursday to be in with a chance of upstaging the rampaging Proteas in the fifth and final match scheduled in Mumbai on Sunday.\n\"Obviously, we are in a tricky situation. We have to win tomorrow to be in the series. We have got the team which can turn things around. I want to say one thing that the team will be going all out to win the game tomorrow and from there onwards, we will hopefully put up another good performance. Things can be different in one week's time,\" Harbhajan told reporters in the pre-match press conference here.\n\"No bowler is (so) perfect that he can keep on bowling at one length and one line. We need to be a little smarter than what we have seen in the last three games,\" he said.\nHave to be smarter than the last 3 games, says Harbhajan Singh https://t.co/YVwAQET4mU #BCCI #INDvSA\n— DC Sports (@_DCSports) October 21, 2015 Harbhajan said the team's batsmen are also quite capable of turning the tide. \"We have got such quality in our team that we can score runs on any track. They are all performers and they have won games for India. It is just a matter of time to get adjusted. It could be tomorrow and winning the series will be a great fun,\" he said.\nThe senior tweaker said he, along with the other Indian bowlers, will look to be attacking in their approach even if it means conceding a few runs.\n\"I have come here with one purpose only to win games for India no matter what situation I am bowling. Looking to take wickets and to contain the batsmen is by getting them out. With our spinners, we are looking to put pressure on them and not to give them easy singles if they are looking to go over the top, that is fine by us,\" Harbhajan said.\nRead: ‘We have lost the series but still lot to play in final’\n\"We want to take wickets as a spinning unit. Whoever is bowling at any point of time, we want to attack. In that process you will go for boundaries here and there. At the same time, if you pick up a wicket you can control the game,\" he added.\nHarbhajan praised fellow spinners Amit Mishra and Axar Patel and said the duo add variety to the attack. \"It is nice to have lot of variety in the team. All the spinners are doing a different role. Amit has been playing for many years and brings a lot of experience on the table. Axar is doing really well. He played the game in Indore and picked up two crucial wickets. It is nice to be bowling along with these guys,\" he said.\nAlso Read: Amit Mishra to 'co-operate' with police after ODI series, says his brother\nAsked for his reaction at not being picked for the Test series, Harbhajan said he prefers to focus on performance. \"My job is to play whatever opportunity that I get to play. I am very happy that I am part of this side. It is nice to be playing again for India in ODIs. Coming to the Test matches, it is part and parcel that sometimes you get picked. I should not get too worried about selection stuff. I will get the opportunity and look to do what I can do from my side,\" he added.\nHarbhajan lavished praise on skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has drawn criticism owing to India's lacklustre show in the series.\n\"You go with your plans to the captain and he has lot of options. Dhoni has been a brilliant captain for India. We won a brilliant game in Indore and in Rajkot, we did not play as well. Hopefully things will change from tomorrow. Everybody is discussing as to what to do and what not to do. What is important is to win games,\" he said.\nBeleaguered leg-spinner Mishra is \"available\" for the fourth one-dayer against South Africa and his selection in the playing XI would depend on nature of the Chepuk track, senior off-spinner Harbhajan Singh has said. A police complaint has been filed against Mishra in Bangalore by a woman, who alleged that the India cricketer abused and assaulted her. Harbhajan said that the incident does not affect Mishra's place in the team. \"Amit Mishra is definitely available for tomorrow. If the management feels that he should be playing on this track, he will play,\" Harbhajan said. Mishra, who played the Kanpur and Rajkot ODIs, has to appear before the court to put his version of the story. The 'turbantor' though was not clear if R Ashwin, who suffered a side strained during the Kanpur ODI, would be available or not for tomorrow's game but hinted that the team would prefer him. \"Actually, I do not know what his fitness is like. Obviously, having him fit will be a a great thing. Hopefully, he is fit tomorrow. As for his injury recovery I do not know what he is feeling,\" he said. \"We do not want to definitely make him play so early as we need him for longer period of time. He is obviously India's match winner. If he is fit tomorrow, he will definitely be playing and if he is not, we guys will do the job.\" Cricket Team India South Africa Harbhajan Singh MS Dhoni Amit Mishra Axar Patel Also Read IND vs SA, 3rd ODI: Indian batsmen flounder as South Africa win by 18 runs ‘I want to learn from Harbhajan Singh,’ says girlfriend Geeta Basra Amit Mishra to 'co-operate' with police after ODI series, says his brother", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Bhajji_AP_PTI_0_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Bhajji_AP_PTI_0_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://t.co/YVwAQET4mU", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/INDvSA?src=hash", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/sports-cricket/article/video-‘not-too-worried-about-selection-have-be-smarter-last-three", "https://twitter.com/_DCSports/status/656783496673792000", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/BCCI?src=hash", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:47:14.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
