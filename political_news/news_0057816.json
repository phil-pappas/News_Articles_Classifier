And despite the debate being held in what's described as a \"banquet-type room,\" most of the media covering the debate will be sequestered in a second-floor room where candidates can choose to appear after the debate for interviews and reaction.\nThe debate will consist of a panel of members of the media, but no other media is allowed in the room. The debate rules describe the room as \"controlled atmosphere = no public, media in room except for panel.\"\nQuestions will not be provided in advance, although there was confusion about whether that was the case early in the process.\nIt's not clear why such rules were put in place at a public higher education institution where students and the educational community are often thought to benefit from watching the debate in person. At events previously held on Oct. 7 at Dunham School in Baton Rouge and Sept. 2 at Southeastern University in Hammond, audiences were both present, but U.S. Sen. David Vitter was the only candidate not to attend.\nAll four campaigns said they did not request barring a live audience or having media present in the room before, after or during the debate. Neither did KTBS, whose news director Randy Bain said would have proceeded with the debate with or without an audience or the media present.\nAsked whether Louisiana Tech officials negotiated with campaigns to prohibit an audience, Bain said, \"I cannot answer that question because I was not part of that discussion.\" Louisiana Tech officials did not return two messages left seeking comment on Thursday and Friday, respectively.\n\"When we went out there they let us know they weren't going to have an audience and we were fine with that,\" Bain said. Asked about why the media isn't allowed in the debate area, Bain said, \"once again, that was Louisiana Tech. They wanted a controlled atmosphere in that studio area.\"\nThe presence of all four major candidates in televised debates has been a recurring topic of discussion throughout the campaign season. One of the longest-running televised debate traditions, an event hosted by Louisiana Public Broadcasting and the Council for a Better Louisiana, will not feature Vitter.\nThat debate will be held the evening before the Louisiana Tech-KTBS event. Barry Erwin, the president of CABL, said his organization was told that Vitter wouldn't attend because he'd already committed to the Ruston debate and a debate held on Oct. 1 and broadcast on WDSU-TV in New Orleans.\nOther features of the Louisiana Tech-KTBS event include a format that will allow candidates rebuttal time after the candidate asked the question provides a one-minute answer. Any candidate mentioned by name during a rebuttal then also has time to respond to their name being mentioned.\nThe format appears to be designed to encourage the candidates to question each other's positions. There were similar rules during the WDSU debate.\n. . . . . . Kevin Litten is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge. Reach him at klitten@nola.com or 225-436-2207.
