We think the changes we have put forward are right.”\nHis stubborn response dismayed fellow Tory MPs who are increasingly worried ordinary working voters will punish them when the cuts kick in next April.\nLabour, trade unionists and anti-poverty campaigners are already fighting hard to reverse the plan.\nJon Ashworth , Labour’s shadow cabinet office minister, said: “ David Cameron has shown his promises to stand up for working families are a complete farce.”\nVideo loading\nUnison general secretary Dave Prentis added: “Millions of low to middle-income working families will be the victims of the Chancellor’s cruel tax credits snatch-and-grab next year.\n“Ministers are punishing millions of working people who just want to provide for their children.”\nThe Tories faced further accusations of hypocrisy when it emerged their first two policy pledges of the conference were stolen from Labour’s 2015 election manifesto.\nMr Cameron’s announcement yesterday that maternity leave can be transferred over to grandparents was lifted directly from Ed Miliband.\nAnd George Osborne will announce a new independent quango to oversee spending on roads, railways and power stations - something which was Ed Balls’s idea.\nRead more: Ups and downs at the Tory Conference see David Cameron sticking to pig-headed form Newcastle Journal Poached: George Osborne has brought Labour peer Lord Adonis on board\nThe Chancellor has even pinched a Labour peer - former Transport Secretary Lord Adonis - to chair the commission.\nThe Blairite peer will resign the Labour whip and sit as a crossbencher while he chairs the National Infrastructure Commission.\nIt will advise Ministers on where new projects should be built and set timetables for their delivery.\nAides to Mr Osborne accepted both ideas were stolen from Labour, but said: “The Chancellor is open to good ideas.”\nMr Cameron also spent much of the conference’s first day battling to contain a shadow cabinet revolt over Europe.\nThe PM all but confirmed he will campaign to stay in the EU in the coming referendum and slapped down eurosceptic cabinet ministers who want Britain to leave.\nRead more: Tory transport minister tells cyclists to wear helmets - even though he doesn't wear one himself\nWarning: Philip Hammond threw down the gauntlet to Cameron on Europe\nForeign Secretary Philip Hammond warned the PM he must deliver “genuine and irreversible change” in his renegotiation of Britain’s EU membership ahead of the coming referendum.\n“It’s got to be a deal that will stand up to the toughest scrutiny of all - the verdict of the British people in that referendum,” Mr Hammond said, in a clear shot across Mr Cameron’s bows.\nBut it is the row over tax credit cuts which is the most damaging to the PM following his claim the Tories are now the “workers’ party.”\nAnd pressure is mounting for the Chancellor to offer more support for the poor in his Autumn Statement next month.\nTory policy guru David Willetts, the former Universities Minister, was the first backbencher to break cover at the weekend and urge Mr Osborne to “ease” the pain.\n“There is a real risk that it could turn sour as some of those hard-working families that politicians love realise they are heavy losers,” he warned.\nSee more: Five things we learned from Day One of the Tory conference Concern: David Willetts says Cameron will need to ease pain on tax credits\nYesterday Ruth Davidson, the Tory leader in Scotland, agreed the under-fire chancellor may have to take action next month.\n“When it comes to the application of the policy, I think we do need to see a little bit more detail about how it will work in practice,” she said. “I would expect that to be brought forward in the Autumn Statement.”\nBut appearing on the Marr Show, a defiant Mr Cameron repeated his now-discredited claim that next year’s meagre hike in the minimum wage will leave families better off overall.\nHe brushed off detailed evidence from the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies that it would be “arithmetically impossible” for the 50p-an-hour hike to compensate for £12billon of welfare cuts.\nGetty Stepping in: Ruth Davidson wants “more detail” on tax credit changes\n“If you take a family where someone is on minimum wage, when you take into account all the things we are changing in tax, in the national living wage, and tax credits, that family will be better off,” Mr Cameron said.\nThe PM was equally evasive when asked about Tory billionaire Lord Ashcroft ’s claims the PM knew about his ‘non-dom’ tax status while accepting donations for the 2010 election campaign.\nAnd he did not deny offering the grandee a job in return for the cash.\n“If you go back to 2009, what you’ll find is that actually I said we should pass a law that anyone sitting in either the House of Commons or House of Lords should be a full resident UK taxpayer,” he said.\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201510/3341/4221396001_4530392955001_4530206018001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/benglaze", "https://twitter.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:57:15.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
