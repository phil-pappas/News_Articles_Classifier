(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\nAssociated Press Oct. 10, 2015 | 2:49 p.m. EDT + More By STEVE PEOPLES and JULIE BYKOWICZ, Associated Press\nLAS VEGAS (AP) â€” In the 2016 campaign for president, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio are competing for the same set of donors who traditionally support Republican White House candidates.\nBut while Bush is a son and brother of former presidents and comes to the race with a sprawling network of experienced fundraisers, Rubio has none of those advantages.\nAs a result, his campaign and the super PAC that supports him collected less than a quarter of the $114 million the Bush team raised in the first six months of the year.\nIt's a distinction already playing out in TV advertising. Bush and his allies have begun a planned $50 million television advertising blitz.\nMeanwhile, Rubio and the super PAC helping him have reserved ad space worth about half of that amount.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
