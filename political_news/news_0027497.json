Share This Article The Uber ride-hailing service is now operating officially and legally at Salt Lake City International Airport, joining Lyft, a competing service that won earlier approval for airport operations. The announcement Wednesday shows a continued taming of what only months ago was called a \"Wild West\" ground-transportation environment at the airport. Uber and Lyft had operated there unofficially without paying airport fees, while some taxi drivers gouged riders after new laws made moot the fixed mileage rates in prior contracts. Since then, new fare limits have been imposed on taxis from the airport ($25 to downtown and $30 for locations east of 500 East). And Uber and Lyft have agreed to revamped regulations that require them to register and obtain permits as part of a one-year pilot project.

Uber said its pickup from Terminal 1 will be across the street from door 7 by the first median. For Terminal 2, it will be across the street from door 12. Drop-off will be curbside at the terminal entrance. Lyft and Uber provide smartphone apps to connect people who want a ride with nearby drivers who use their own cars. Riders can see how others have rated the driver, what they will charge and when they will arrive for pickup. Drivers, in turn, can see how colleagues have rated the rider. All payments are made through the online app. The companies say they perform background checks on drivers and reject those with poor driving records or serious criminal backgrounds. They usually provide $1 million in insurance. The companies keep 20 percent of each fare, but maintain that the driver is the one providing the service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:15:40.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
