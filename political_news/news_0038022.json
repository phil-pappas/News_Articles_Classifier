However, the joy was short-lived as the purchase was cancelled in a few minutes.\nBut for Sanmay, an ex-employee of Google, Hyderabad, who quit his job to pursue his MBA from the Babson College in the US, the whole experience is still unbelievable. The fact that he owned the domain for even a little bit, has given him a huge high. Sanmay is super excited by the fact that he noticed google.com being available for $12, when he was learning more about Google domains and its registration service.\nWithout wasting any time, he added the domain to his cart and checked out. “I was hoping to get an error at sometime saying transaction did not go through, but I could complete it... And my credit card was actually charged,” he says. But sadly, an email arrived in his inbox saying his order has been cancelled.\n lifestyle google Hyderabad Public School Babson College Also Read Beware of the size of your breakfast cereals!
