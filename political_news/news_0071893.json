Not to be outdone, the Cubs struck back with a little small ball.\nAfter outfielder Austin Jackson stole third, Kyle Hendricks scored him with a well-placed bunt.\nGarcia panics, Cubs tie game! pic.twitter.com/e5iWJkJXVU\n— ✶ Sports Mockery ✶ (@sportsmockery) October 10, 2015\nOn the next at-bat, Addison Russell laid down a bunt that scored Jose Montero, increasing the Cubs’ lead to 2-1. Then Dexter Fowler would continue the scoring ways by beating out an infield single and scoring Hendricks.\nAt 3-1, you would think Chicago would be satisfied with a nice lead.
