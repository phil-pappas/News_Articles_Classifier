Wade is \"on the ballot\" for next year's presidential election.\n\"The battle lines were drawn last week,\" said Richards, the daughter of the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards. \"This isn’t about Planned Parenthood or fetal tissue,” she added, referring to anti-abortion activists' release of undercover sting videos showing doctors and medical professionals discussing the donation of fetal tissue.\nRepublican candidates, she added, have done her organization a favor by putting \"this issue way up high in the consciousness of the American people.\"\nChaffetz asks colleagues for House reform ideas By Lauren French\n\"It’s not like people are going to go ‘oh God I had no idea.’ If a candidate for president wants to end safe and legal abortion, get rid of Planned Parenthood and end access to family planning? That’s a very tough sell for the American people,\" she predicted.\nDuring last month's GOP debate, Carly Fiorina, the only woman running for the Republican nomination, said she had seen a video of an aborted fetus with its \"heart beating\" and \"legs kicking\" with doctors discussing how they could harvest its brain.\n“Look ... she can have her own position about abortion, and people have deeply personal feelings about that. But you don’t get to lie about an organization. That has stunned me,\" she said, inviting Fiorina to visit a Planned Parenthood health center to get more information.\nWhen Fiorina visited a crisis pregnancy center last September, Planned Parenthood tweeted:\nUgh: @CarlyFiorina campaigned at a crisis pregnancy center (fake clinic run by anti-abortion people) #NotMyCandidate https://t.co/BS1WwFIJ0Y\n— Planned Parenthood (@PPact) September 25, 2015\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/08/cecile-richards-planned-parenthood-roe-v-wade-republicans", "https://twitter.com/PPact/status/647488560648601601", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotMyCandidate?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/CarlyFiorina", "https://t.co/BS1WwFIJ0Y"], "published": "2015-10-08T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:27:36.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
