Bernie Sanders. \nClinton's campaign spent roughly $25 million from July through September, according to figures her campaign released Thursday, a large chunk of the $28 million she raised during that period. That means she set aside just $3 million of that total. \nSanders raised almost as much as Clinton during those same three months, bringing in roughly $26 million, according to his campaign. But Sanders saved approximately $13 million of that total, helping him significantly cut into his rival's cash edge. Clinton now has $32 million cash on hand to Sanders' $25 million. View Gallery 2016 presidential candidates \nClinton's campaign argues that their heavy early spending will pay off, arguing that they've built out a \"formidable\" campaign organization that will help her win the ground game. \"In addition to television ads we continued to invest heavily in list building and data with a large analytics and data team. We have put a premium on organizing and built a formidable team early,\" a Clinton aide told the Daily News. \nThat may be in part be accurate, though Clinton has also spent heavily on TV ads in recent weeks to help keep her poll numbers up during a rough stretch where almost all the press about her campaign was focused on her use of a private email server. Paul Beaty/AP Bernie Sanders raised almost as much as Clinton during those same three months, bringing in roughly $26 million, according to his campaign. \nSanders has been scrambling to catch up to Clinton's ground game. And Clinton has still out-raised Sanders by a hefty sum so far, bringing in $75 million total to Sanders' $40 million, well on her way to the campaign's publicly declared (and potentially low-ball) goal of raising $100 million for the primary. \nBut Sanders' near-parity in cash on hand means he has plenty of money to catch up on that front, and his campaign is already talking about expanding early-primary operations with more staff. And Clinton has raised more from large donors who have already given the legal maximum they can provide, meaning it might be tougher for her than Sanders to keep up her fundraising pace. \nSanders has also been able to raise money with much more ease — he held just seven fundraisers in the last three months while raising most of his money online, while Clinton had to grind out 58 fundraisers in the same period to keep ahead of him.
