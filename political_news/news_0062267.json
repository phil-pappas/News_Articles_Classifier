More New grammar school given green light \nThe SNP, which is now the third-largest party in the chamber, could hold the key if Mr Cameron subsequently puts the decision to a final Commons vote. \nThe prospect of Scottish MPs acting as kingmakers in those circumstances could irritate Londoners opposed to the airport’s expansion. \nBut the Scottish nationalists are determined to use the opportunity to force Heathrow to reverse the cuts to services that have taken place in recent years. A senior figure at Heathrow said that there was a clear deal to be cut with the SNP in return for the party’s support. \nHe said that the Scots wanted a firm long-term commitment to protect existing routes such as Aberdeen. They also wanted to see the opening of new ones, for example between Heathrow and Dundee or by reopening the direct route to Inverness. \nIn the past decade Heathrow has almost halved the number of services every week to Scotland — from 50 to 26. \nDrew Hendry, SNP leader on transport at Westminster, said that the party was neutral between a third runway at Heathrow or a second one at Gatwick. \n“We want the UK government to get a move on and make a decision,” he said. “We have challenged all those involved to come up with their solutions to current issues. We want to sustain Scottish landing slots...and want to protect the best interests of Scotland.” \nLobbyists from Gatwick and Heathrow are at the SNP conference in Aberdeen, with Heathrow paying for large banners in the main lobby of the exhibition centre. \nMr Cameron was advised to back Heathrow by the Davies Commission on aviation — which he set up during the last Parliament to advise him on the best place to expand aviation capacity in the south-east. \nBut the commission did not completely rule out Gatwick as an option. Mr Corbyn has signalled to his MPs that he wants them to vote against the Heathrow third runway in the event of a Commons vote. He has written a memo to Kerry McCarthy, shadow environment secretary, and Lilian Greenwood, shadow transport secretary, saying that he wanted to make air pollution a key issue for the party. \nBut Labour’s new head has only a slender grip over his 232 MPs, most of whom never backed him for the leadership. “He hasn’t a hope in hell of whipping people against the airport,” said a senior MP. “I imagine he is playing to the green lobby but there are around 100 MPs who will vote for the runway.” \nGraham Stringer, a Labour MP, said: “I see there being nil whip at the moment. Jeremy voted against the whip 500 times, so I will vote as I choose now.” \n“I will certainly vote for a third runway at Heathrow. There is a natural Parliamentary majority for the project. Jeremy is a southern MP and doesn’t understand anywhere outside London.” \nHeathrow said it was in discussions with politicians across the UK on how to maximise the benefits for their constituents. “Scotland, like all regions and nations of the UK, stands to benefit from the 180,000 new skilled jobs and £211bn in economic growth that Heathrow expansion will deliver.” \nStewart Hosie, deputy SNP leader at Westminster, told a Heathrow-sponsored event at his party’s conference that “the first airport that offers us connectivity in abundance will be in a prime position to win our support”. \nHe hinted that Heathrow had an advantage: “The Scottish business community say they like Heathrow because it’s easy.” Regional flights sqeezed out of London airports \nAmsterdam’s Schiphol airport once joked about being London’s third runway, because of the high number of UK connections and passengers who travel through its terminals. \nBut under this cheeky comment lies the truth. Over the last decade, Heathrow has seen a decline in the number of domestic routes , leading to a situation where several European airports offer more connections to UK destinations than London’s largest airport does. \nSchiphol serves almost four times as many British airports as Heathrow does, with connections to 27 destinations. Paris Charles de Gaulle also does better, operating 16 UK routes. \nIn comparison, regional flights have been squeezed out at Heathrow as passengers numbers have risen — in 1990 it served 18 domestic routes but that has dropped to just seven. About 7 per cent of its 73.4m passengers a year fly on domestic routes. \nGatwick has a slightly better record on regional flights. It serves 11 UK destinations — the same amount as in 1990 — and expects this to grow to 15 by 2050 if it gets the go-ahead to expand. \nThe decline in domestic routes has largely been down to airlines, faced with limited space at London airports, favouring more lucrative international destinations over short regional flights. \n“If you could rewrite history and Heathrow had four runways 20 years ago then domestic flights would still be there. But it’s about the scarcity of resource,” said John Grant of OAG, the aviation consultancy. \nAnother factor has been faster train connections between UK cities. Most people will opt to travel by train if a journey is around three hours in order to avoid lengthy security queues at the airport. \nOver the past 10 years, the number of daily domestic connections at Heathrow has fallen from 86 to 61. This is likely to decline further following the closure last month of Little Red , a subsidiary of Virgin Atlantic that flew to Edinburgh and Aberdeen from Heathrow. \nHeathrow is attempting to reverse this regional decline as part of its campaign to win the government’s backing for a third runway. \nThe airport has already revealed plans to cut the amount it charges airlines to fly domestic passengers by a third, a change that is expected to come into effect in January 2017. \nThe airport has also proposed a £10m fund for up to five new domestic routes for three years. This will be on top of the four extra routes that easyJet has said it would look to run if Heathrow gets a third runway. \nGatwick has said it will set up a £20m fund to incentivise airlines to introduce new domestic services.
