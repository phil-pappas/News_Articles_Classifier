LOUIS , Oct. 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Watchdog Creative announced the release of a new tool to help fight bullying, harassment and domestic abuse, the Stop Harassing Me Now app .\nEvery year 4.7 million Women are victims of violence and between 20% and 30% of students experience some form of bullying. Many millions more people are forced to seek restraining orders or go through messy divorces-suffering this abuse because they don't have the evidence they need to end it.\nThe Stop Harassing Me Now App empowers victims of harassment by giving them tools to record, in real time, harassing phone interactions and preserve evidence of abuse in safe and secure cloud storage.\nBrian Rohlfing , co-founder and CEO said, \"I've watched good friends become victims of domestic violence. Each situation had two common characteristics: the victim struggled to find validation, and the victim needed to regain personal power, our app does both for these victims.\"\nOften, victims of abuse find themselves trying to get relief in a court, but simply lack evidence. Michael Lang , CTO and co-founder added, \"The App records and preserves this evidence, and is designed to increase the odds of its admissibility in a courtroom.\" Derek Haake , attorney and co-founder added, \"Getting evidence into a courtroom is essential in these cases. It avoids the 'he said, she said' scenario and allows evidence to quickly demonstrate that abuse occurred.\"\n\"All too often the victim wants to rationalize feeling threatened by questioning their fear or thinking it will just go away.\" therapist, Cyd Dodson explained. \"If they have the Stop Harassing Me tool, it will be easy for them to work with a trusted partner to validate their feelings. This app could be their best and first decision to own and retain harassment evidence and get help and support to stop it.\"\nToday's release includes the app for Android phones, with support for iPhone planned.\nAbout Watchdog Creative\nWatchdog Creative provides technical services and solutions to help end harassment, bullying and help victims of abuse fight back, starting with their first app Stop Harassing Me Now.
