Calgary, Edmonton could show cracks in Conservatives' fortress Alberta \nThis is the eighth in a series that will run until the end of the campaign, taking an in-depth look at where the polls stand in every region of the country and which seats are up for grabs. Check out the last instalment, where the spotlight was on Toronto . \nAt the outset of the election campaign, the New Democrats all but had the French-speaking parts of Quebec in the bag. But that bag has now been torn open, and all four parties are scrambling to grab what they can.

Apart from five seats won by the Conservatives and three by the Bloc Québécois, the NDP swept all before them. The party won every seat in Quebec City, in the Montérégie, and in western and northern Quebec. Only in eastern and central Quebec did the NDP fail to keep the other parties off the board outside of Montreal. \nThe New Democrats were poised to repeat the feat earlier in the campaign, when they were polling at between 48 and 51 per cent among francophones. The Bloc Québécois was in distant second with 19 to 23 per cent, followed by the Liberals at 13 to 15 per cent and the Conservatives at 12 per cent. \nBut the latest polls have suggested a big swing in voting intentions among francophone Quebecers. Numbers from the last two weeks from Quebec-based Léger put the NDP at between 27 and 31 per cent, in a tie with the Bloc, which is posting 28 to 30 per cent support. The Conservatives have edged up to 20 to 22 per cent, and the Liberals to between 18 and 20 per cent. \nAt these levels of support, a lot of seats could swing in the régions of Quebec. The NDP could win between 15 and 25 seats, the Conservatives between 12 and 17, the Bloc between one and six, and the Liberals between one and five. But with the shifts we've seen in the province over the last month, and with over a week to go in the campaign, this is only the tip of the iceberg. ThreeHundredEight.com projections for Quebec as of Oct. 8, 2015. (Stephen McMurtry/ThreeHundredEight.com) \nThe New Democrats are playing defence in francophone Quebec, a region they had targeted for gains only weeks ago. Their focus will have to be on holding the seats they won by wide margins in 2011, particularly in the Outaouais, the Laurentides, the Eastern Townships and in eastern Quebec. \nA good night in Quebec would see the NDP holding off the Conservatives in Quebec City and the Saguenay, but the prospects of pushing the Conservatives and Bloc entirely off the map now seem dim. Instead, the best chance for NDP gains come in the ridings in which their MPs, in one way or another, found themselves outside the party caucus. \nThe following is a list of ridings that each of the parties could pick up on election night. Favourable gains are those in which there is a good chance of the party winning, potential gains are those in which the results may be close and marginal gains are seats in which the party has an outside chance. \nFavourable NDP gains:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:07:23.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
