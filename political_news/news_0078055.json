Sales growth in July-September 2015 of a sample of 109 companies. \nWhy is it important? It’s the slowest pace since March 2009. Industry accounts for 30% of India’s GDP . A sluggish sales growth will put downward pressure on meeting the government’s target of 7.5% GDP growth this fiscal. Agriculture is in trouble already because of a successive deficit monsoon. The net profit of these companies though grew 4.74% aided by lower commodity prices.\nTell me more: Another study of 154 companies (excluding banks, non-banking finance companies and financial services firms) that have declared their September quarter results shows a sales decline by 12%. \n\n15 years \nWhat is it? The tenure of annuity that would be paid to corporates for building and maintaining sewage networks in 118 towns and cities that pollute river Ganga. \nWhy is it important? It might improve execution. The project to clean up river Ganga has suffered from poor implementation. Between June 2011 and June 2014, only 28% of projected spending was disbursed . \nTell me more: Only 45% of waste water from 30 class I cities (population more than 100,000) on the banks of Ganga. Among 14 class II cities, less than 33% of waste water is treated. The river supports 40% of India’s population, accounts for 25% of the water resources, and 90% of its water is used for irrigation. \n\nRs. 5 \nWhat is it? The price of a BGR-35 tablet, a herbal drug to treat diabetes. \nWhy is it important? The herbal drug, jointly developed by two state-funded laboratories National Botanical Research Institute and Central Institute for Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, will be commercially produced and marketed by a private pharma company. Diabetes could emerge as an endemic in India with more than 62 million individuals currently diagnosed as diabetic. A locally-produced cheaper and safe drug could lead to savings. \nTell me more? The drug claims to have 66% success rate under clinical trials, and scientific study has shown it to be safe. \n\n40.3 \nWhat is it? India’s score under the Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index. Of the 23 countries compared, India scored the lowest. \nWhy is it important? With people living longer and retirement age remaining the same, a low pension index reflects poor financial security post-retirement. Denmark, which scored the highest, has a state-funded minimum pension scheme, which is supplemented by “means-tested” pension benefit. The report suggests minimum support for poorest aged individuals and increasing coverage of unorganized working class. \nTell me more: India’s score has fallen from 43.5 in 2014 on account of downward revision of the household savings rate. \n\n13.91 lakh \nWhat is it? The number of electronic voting machines (EVMs) that need to be replaced before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This represents more than 80% of the current stock of EVMs . \nWhy is it important? This would require Rs. 2,000 crore in a staggered manner, so that new EVMs are sourced. The difference of views between the government and the Election Commission of India is holding up the release of funds for replacing the EVMs. The government says it’s too early to source, given fast advancement of technology, while the Election Commission claims there may not be the capacity to source large numbers in a short period of time. \nTell me more: State-run entities Bharat Electronics Ltd and Electronics Corp. of India supply EVMs in India. \n\nhowindialives.com is a search engine for public data", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T15:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:55:16.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
