At the attorney’s request, the judge set Oct. 28 as the date for the 73-year-old Illinois Republican to change his plea.\nDefendants typically agree to plead guilty in hopes of a more lenient sentence. A plea deal would also avert a trial that could divulge more about the misconduct behind the criminal charges.\nNeither Gallo nor prosecutors offered details about any possible deal, including which counts Hastert would plead guilty to or whether the man who was once second in the line of succession for the presidency would go to prison. Hastert did not attend Thursday’s hearing.\nFormer House Speaker Dennis Hastert intends to plead guilty in a hush-money case linked to allegations of sexual misconduct, a defense attorney said Thursday.

Lee, File)\nHe faces one count of breaking banking laws and one count of lying to the FBI about agreeing to pay $3.5 million to someone referred to in the indictment only as “Individual A.” The money was supposedly to hide claims of unspecified past misconduct.\nA plea deal would mean that Individual A, who has never been identified, would not have to testify about receiving any of the money.\nThe Associated Press and other media, citing anonymous sources, have reported that the payments were meant to conceal claims of sexual misconduct.\nIn all, Hastert withdrew $1.7 million from 2010 to 2014, according to the indictment. Each count carries a maximum five-year prison term.\nWhen Hastert was charged in May, the indictment noted he had taught and coached high school wrestling from 1965 to 1981 in close-knit Yorkville, a suburb west of Chicago. That strongly suggests the charges are linked to that history.\nThose acquainted with Hastert from his days in Yorkville have tended to express sympathy for him.\nHelene McNeive, whose husband taught at Yorkville High School with Hastert and now lives in Arizona, said Thursday’s word about the plea left her feeling “very sad” for the whole Hastert family.\n“From the beginning, this was not the Denny we knew,” she said. “He was a great father, a great husband and a great friend, and nobody in their wildest dreams could ever think this could have happened.”\nRelated allegations emerged after Hastert’s indictment. A Montana woman told the AP that the FBI interviewed her about allegations her late brother had a sexual relationship with Hastert.\nHastert, who led the House for nine years, could change his mind about a plea deal.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a04_jd_16oct_hastert-400x319.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:28:27.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
