The Broadcom Foundation has been the title sponsor of the Broadcom MASTERS since 2011.\nBroadcom MASTERS is a competition for sixth to eighth grade students designed to inspire and encourage young scientists, engineers and innovators to continue with STEM studies into high school. In the past five years, approximately 30,000 nominations to the program have been issued and more than $500,000 in awards has been distributed to finalists and schools throughout the United States . The finals of the competition have been held both in Silicon Valley, CA and in Washington, DC , providing students with diverse hands-on challenges and experiences.\nThe Broadcom MASTERS International program began in 2012 to provide a unique opportunity for middle school students from around the world who participate in SSP-affiliated science fairs. Broadcom MASTERS delegates from approximately 20 countries participate in a weeklong STEM leadership immersion program during the Intel International Science & Engineering Fair, where they also participate as official Student Observers. Broadcom MASTERS International has received recognition from Ministries of Education and renowned STEM leadership throughout the world.\n\"We are thrilled to announce the extension of our relationship with the Broadcom Foundation. They have been an excellent corporate partner and we look forward to continuing to grow and enhance the Broadcom MASTERS program,\" said Maya Ajmera , President and CEO of Society for Science & the Public and Publisher of Science News . \"As a student who became interested in scientific research while in middle school, I understand how important it is to support an interest in STEM for this age group, and the Society is appreciative of Broadcom's commitment and support to this goal.\"\nIn addition to the opportunity to win awards for further education, research and STEM summer camp experiences, Broadcom MASTERS finalists have had the opportunity to meet with President Obama, be interviewed by national media, and discuss their research interests and career plans with professionals from leading STEM organizations. Many Broadcom MASTERS alumni have gone on to compete in the Society's additional educational competitions, the Intel Science Talent Search and the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.\n\"The Broadcom MASTERS has made it possible for us to enter the international conversation about the importance of project-based learning in STEM education, and capitalize on the increasing awareness that middle school is a pivotal age for a young adult to find a subject or activity they love and follow this passion into college and career choices,\" says Paula Golden , President and Executive Director, Broadcom Foundation and Director, Community Affairs, Broadcom Corporation. \"It is their inspiration that motivated our foundation board to extend its sponsorship, enabling Broadcom MASTERS to continue through SSP's 100 th anniversary in 2021.\"\nBoth the Society and the Broadcom Foundation are committed to increasing interest in STEM by encouraging hands-on research for students of all ages, not only to develop the STEM talent pipeline but to create a more scientifically literate population.
