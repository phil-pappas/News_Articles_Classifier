Such is the result of success. In power in Edinburgh, dominant among Westminster seats and riding higher and higher in the polls, the SNP of 114,000 members is a long way from the chaotic ragbag of decades past. \nWhen the SNP came to Aberdeen in the 1970s it hired a small ballroom. This year it occupies a vast arena surrounded by industrial parks serving the oil and gas industry. “This is a different party, an SNP 2.0,” says one MP. It is a different type of conference, too: bigger, slicker and replete with representatives from all parts of Scottish life. \nSome members worry that it is too corporate. “You see these English conferences: they’ve got no soul. That’s what we need to guard against,” says Jack Paterson, an SNP member for 40 years. \nThe power the SNP wields has inevitably attracted lobbyists, many here for the first time. “We wanted to come so we could really understand the party,” said David Walker, of US banking giant Citi. “We felt we could not ignore it this year,” said a spokesperson from McDonald’s. Businesses pay up to £1,265 for a “corporate day” ticket, about half the price of the equivalent at the Conservative event. \nReferendum caution \nNicola Sturgeon has moved to cool impatience for independence in the Scottish National party by declaring it will not seek another referendum until there is “strong evidence” of majority support for leaving the UK. Read on \nThere are diplomats from 22 counties in attendance. “You never know when we might need an ambassador in Edinburgh,” said an official from the Latvian embassy. \nIn truth, though, the SNP conference is not so much corporate as corporatist. “Our way of working is that we take people with us,” says one shadow cabinet minister. “Taking on vested interests is a very Westminster way of viewing things.” \nOthers admit that the SNP is not a party with furious policy debates. “There needs to be deeper thinking about why we lost the referendum,” says one senior MSP. \nAnd yet there is very little of that in Aberdeen. Away from the Heathrow-sponsored “lounge” , the fringe events are popular with people from charities and trade unions, both of whom have been courted by the SNP. \nBut compared with the fierce debates at equivalent events at Labour and the Conservative conferences, the atmosphere at SNP fringe events is staid. \nPrivately, think-tank leaders criticise the quality of policy discussion in Scotland. Others point to the closure this month of Fiscal Affairs Scotland, a think-tank concerned with tax and spending, just as Holyrood is to take on more fiscal power. \n“We don’t really do policy,” adds one former SNP adviser, noting that the biggest announcement in John Swinney’s speech was a “copy” of George Osborne’s conference pledge on business rates. \nNew council powers \nThe Scottish government will give councils the power to cut business rates to boost their local economies, matching a devolution promise made by George Osborne this month. John Swinney, deputy first minister, told the BBC that councils would be allowed to reduce rates across their areas. Read on \nInstead of constructive criticism, there is co-operation. At an event on “fair pay” on Thursday, for example, the heads of Scottish Trade Union Congress and Prospect union lauded the Scottish government for its “working together” approach to industrial relations. \n“Our analysis is your analysis,” the Prospect union head told Roseanna Cunningham, the cabinet secretary present. \nFrom Barnardo’s to McDonald’s to the STUC, the SNP thinks it is the best servant for their cause. Other parties are still relics of the class they represent; the SNP feels no such burden. If other parties are in some ways boutique offers, the Nationalists are trying to be a political supermarket, offering every product. \nBut can the new SNP absorb the desires of big companies, trade unions and charities, as well as balancing the enthusiasm of its activists with the pragmatism of middle Scotland? \n“We are trying to be all things to all people,” worries Mr Paterson. Given that Nicola Sturgeon is trying to build a party that can win over those unconvinced by the case for independence, a consensual, corporatist approach makes sense. \nThe question is whether it is sustainable? When Holyrood has to tax nearly as much as it spends, can it continue to try to please everyone? \nCan the SNP fend off criticism of its record on public services without upsetting those who deliver them? Can it be genuinely “progressive” without upsetting the middle classes? Would it ever dare? \nIn Aberdeen, there is, of course, talk of independence. But even louder is a delight in the party’s size and its stunning success. A delight that in this moment the SNP is the everything party. Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
