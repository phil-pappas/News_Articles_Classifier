Promoted stories \nIn its report, the review concluded the existing regulatory system - based around the Fundraising Standards Board (FRSB) - was \"no longer fit for purpose\" and had lost the confidence of both the public and the fundraising organisations. \nIt said it should be replaced by a new body - the Fundraising Regulator - with powers to mount investigations and a wide range of sanctions including naming and shaming, \"cease and desist\" orders and compulsory training. \nThe Government has accepted the findings of the Etherington Review but will go further by writing the new system into law, with a \"reserve power\" to compel large charities - expected to cover those which spend more than Â£100,000 on fundraising - to sign up to the new regulator if the voluntary approach fails. \nMinister for Civil Society Rob Wilson said: \"Charitable giving is one of the most decent and generous attributes of a civilised society - and we need to rebuild people's faith in the big charities. Those who give to charity should know their donation is going to further a worthy cause and this trust will never be abused. Share article \n\"We are building a new regulatory structure to make sure the right safeguards exist to protect those people at risk of exploitation. This should help the charities to draw a line under previous bad practice and I hope we will see even more people making donations and giving their time to help others in the months and years ahead.\" \nThese powers will add to changes in the Charities Bill that give the Charity Commission more teeth to tackle abuse.
