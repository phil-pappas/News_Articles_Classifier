These Democrats have not been advised that Biden was retreating from his desire to join the race, even though they were uncertain he would pull the trigger.\nBut several top Democrats supporting Clinton said time was running out for Biden to make a decision. Some party leaders worried that Biden's exploration of a candidacy would be an unwelcome distraction .\nJohn Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign, said Wednesday that Biden needed to come to a decision soon about whether he wants to jump into the race. He told CNN that Clinton \"crushed it\" in her debate performance, which should send the message to Democrats that the presidential field is set.\nPodesta said he did not know whether Biden would run, but said it was time for Democrats to move beyond this period of speculation and focus on electing the party's strongest nominee to run against Republicans.\nTwo people close to Biden, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the vice president, said the conventional wisdom that Clinton's strong debate performance would keep him out of the race is wrong. The key factor in the decision, they say, is whether Biden would forever regret not running if he chose to sit out the race.\nThe moment is looming for Biden to make his plans known, with the first deadline coming up Oct. 29 to qualify for the ballot in Georgia. Several others states have ballot deadlines in November.\nJosh Alcorn, a senior adviser to the Draft Biden movement, said Wednesday the door had not closed to the prospect of a presidential campaign. He said unifying Democrats would not be a problem, but it was important for the party to put forward the most competitive nominee for the general election.\n\"There's still time for Joe Biden,\" Alcorn told CNN. \"The vision for America that he has is something that would be welcomed in the presidential race.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:20:55.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
