and accused Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn of undermining national security by saying he would not do so He gave details of a new voluntary contract for GPs to deliver seven-day care for all patients by 2020 He rejected an offer from Unite union leader Len McCluskey to accept higher strike ballot thresholds in return for allowing online voting, saying such a move would be open to fraud Mr Cameron said he could not guarantee he'll get the changes he wants from his EU negotiations but Britain benefits from being in the EU He said there was nothing he could bring back that would satisfy some Eurosceptics in his party The TUC is planning what it claims will be a 70,000 strong march against austerity in Manchester later, as the Conservatives gather in the city for their annual conference.\nAnalysis: the government's welfare changes\nNational living wage unveiled\nWhat are tax credits and how do they work?\nWho will be affected?\nInstitute for Fiscal Studies on welfare spending\nMore than three million low paid workers will be told how much they will lose from the changes to tax credits just before Christmas.\nFormer Conservative minister David Willetts has urged Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne to look again at the changes - a view supported by Labour MP Frank Field and Conservative MP Boris Johnson.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned it is \"arithmetically impossible\" for nobody to lose out under the changes, while another think tank, The Resolution Foundation, said more than a million households will lose an average of £1,350 a year.\n'Better system' But speaking to The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Cameron said the introduction of the National Living Wage and continued increases to the personal tax allowance would protect the poorest.\nHe said: \"We have had the vote in Parliament on tax credits and I think people respect this argument that the National Living Wage - a 50p increase next year, so a £20-a-week pay rise, rising to £9 by the end of this Parliament - that is a very significant change that really helps to make work pay rather than a tax credit system that recycles money back to people.\"\nHe said the UK was moving to a \"better system\" where people pay less in tax and keep more of the money they earn but \"difficult decisions\" had to be made to tackle the deficit and protect the NHS and education.\nAsked about the possibility a further review ahead of next month's Autumn Statement, Mr Cameron said: \"No, we think the changes we have put forward are right and they come with higher pay and lower taxes.\"\nTrade Union Bill Giving Labour's reaction to the prime minister's comments on tax credits, shadow minister Jonathan Ashworth said: \"David Cameron has shown that his promises to stand up for working families are a complete farce.\"\nHe said the PM's promises on a seven-day NHS had been made before and not delivered and the PM had \"refused to come clean\" in his Marr interview about when he was \"informed directly\" about the non-dom tax status of former Conservative Party donor Lord Ashcroft.\nImage copyright PA Image caption Unite leader Len McCluskey told the Andrew Marr Show he has never met the prime minister Mr Cameron appeared to offer an olive branch to trade unions angry at plans to raise strike ballot thresholds, describing their offer of a compromise involving the introduction of electronic voting as \"interesting\".\n\"The trade unions are accepting these thresholds are right, that you shouldn't have damaging strikes that close schools or shut hospitals or stop underground systems working, you shouldn't have those things without a proper turnout of voters,\" he told Andrew Marr.\nBut he added: \"The Speaker of the House of Commons did put together a commission to look at electronic voting and the conclusion of that commission was that it wasn't safe from fraud. So I think there are problems with that approach.\"\nMr Cameron suggested controversial parts of the Bill such as a requirement for people on pickets to wear armbands and to have social media posts vetted in advance could be reviewed.\n\"All these measures in the legislation can be discussed as they go through Parliament,\" he told Andrew Marr.\nQuizzed about Unite leader Len McCluskey's claim on the same programme that he had never met the prime minister, Mr Cameron said: \"I've met the TUC in my office, they can bring who they like frankly.\"\nBut TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady denied claims of a meeting at Number 10 to discuss the controversial Trade Union Bill.\n\"Not true. I wrote to him just after the election, but still no reply,\" she tweeted .", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3EA7/production/_83793061_motherchild.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33429390", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/25D9/production/_85898690_2c928a0d-db17-4191-b020-0398fbdc0702.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33224896", "https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/650599499585454080", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33437115", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-34437542", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33009399"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T14:07:16.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
