With less than four weeks left in his decades-long congressional career, Boehner is maneuvering to shape the House Republican Conference on his way out. His goal is to leave the conference he helped build —with countless hours of grunt work and hundreds of millions of dollars in fundraising — in the strongest position possible.\nHe has all but officially endorsed Rep. Kevin McCarthy to succeed him, giving the majority leader enough of a nod to express confidence but short of the full-throated endorsement that could sink him. Boehner tried to lure a candidate into the majority leader race against one of his own top lieutenants, a move aimed at bolstering McCarthy's right flank.\nAnd on Monday, he delayed for several weeks the election of the party's next majority leader and whip. This move gives the conference time to reconsider their internal rules, and could quash arguments that the leadership is rushing to a vote.\nNone of the moves are seismic, but they are meaningful. And one man in particular is feeling the brunt: Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the current whip who is running for majority leader.\nChaffetz says he's flipped some McCarthy backers By Rachael Bade\nFirst, Boehner secretly met with Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to try to convince him to challenge Scalise and Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) for majority leader. Scalise’s allies immediately dismissed Boehner’s meddling as useless, saying the speaker has a track record of unsuccessfully trying to recruit candidates for leadership.\nThen this week, with Scalise’s team saying they were on the brink of securing the support to win the internal party contest for the No. 2 post, Boehner decided he would push back the vote on majority leader and whip by three weeks. Scalise’s top aides were less than pleased. Some conservatives plan to use the time to recruit another candidate into the race for majority leader.\nScalise and Boehner’s chiefs of staff were in touch about the date change over the weekend, and say all of their discussions were \"professional.\"\nBoehner aides said he doesn’t have it out for Scalise – the pair have a perfectly cordial relationship – but in the waning days of his speakership, Boehner finds himself at cross-purposes with his No. 3.\nBoehner’s team wants to ensure McCarthy a smooth path to the speaker’s chair. That’s why they tried to recruit Gowdy to run for majority leader; the speaker believed Gowdy in the No. 2 leadership job would insulate McCarthy from criticism on the right in a way Scalise couldn’t.\nScalise and his team, meanwhile, have been working feverishly to round up votes. Scalise told his supporters on a call Sunday night that he already has the support to win the majority leader post, and will continue courting more backers.\nBen Sasse, unplugged By Burgess Everett\nScalise prefers the election to be as soon as possible, as any delay could be a chance for conservative hardliners in and out of Congress to make trouble for him. The Scalise camp's official statement is that they “look forward to having all of these elections take place as soon as our conference is ready.” But the longer Boehner waits, the more time the right has to try to beat Scalise.\nKevin Smith, Boehner’s spokesman, said the speaker believes “Mr. Scalise has done a great job as whip and they will continue to work closely together in the weeks ahead.”\n“We respect the decision Speaker Boehner has made,” added Chris Bond, a spokesman for Scalise. “As we’ve made clear, Congressman Scalise’s support is strong and growing, so this poses no problems for us. We’re going to keep our foot on the gas pedal, and we’re looking forward to holding these elections when the conference is ready.”\nTo be sure, Scalise is the favorite in the majority leader race. He has a superior operation, handily won the race for majority whip last year. Price – the only other man running for leader – has been dogged by allegations that he sought to slash defense spending as part of his 2016 spending blueprint earlier this year. Scalise has said that he would work to bolster defense programs.\nIn a move to show strength, Scalise has rolled out a broad list of endorsements, including from lawmakers who opposed his election as whip in 2014.\nBut Scalise's biggest problem is that conservatives - especially the House Freedom Caucus - do not want to simply promote McCarthy and Scalise. Doing so would leave in place a leadership team they believe has failed to win showdowns with President Barack Obama and Democrats. They've been unable to recruit a candidate to give McCarthy a true challenge. Many privately say they see their best hope as taking Scalise on.\nThe internal party vote for speaker will take place Thursday. Republicans will choose between McCarthy, Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) and Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). Webster has a handful of endorsements, and Chaffetz has not announced a single person who is backing him. In an interview with ABC News Monday, he said he expects to lose the contest. The full House will choose the next speaker on Oct. 29, and whoever wins that contest will set the date of the majority leader and whip race.\nChaffetz makes it official By Jake Sherman\nBoehner's move to delay the elections also raises another huge issue for Republicans. The nation will reach its debt limit on Nov. 5 -- around the same time the party will chose its new leader and whip. If Boehner attempts to hold a debt ceiling vote before the speaker election, it could be a major problem for McCarthy. If it occurs afterward, then one of McCarthy's first fights as speaker is to over the contentious borrowing cap.\nScalise, Price or other leadership hopefuls could be forced to vote \"no\" on such a measure in order to preserve their standing with the right wing. The new leadership team might be split before it even has time to jell.\nFollow @politico <div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/politico"], "published": "2015-10-05T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:07:25.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
