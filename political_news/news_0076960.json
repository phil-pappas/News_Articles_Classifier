Paul Ryan to stand for House speaker — well, sort of. In an interview with John Dickerson for CBS's “Face the Nation” set to air Sunday, Trump said it “would be OK” if Ryan (R-Wisc.) became speaker.\nRyan has been pressured by GOP lawmakers to consider running after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) suddenly dropped out Thursday.\n\"I think he's a very nice person. I think he doesn't want it very badly, but you never know. Maybe he's playing one of the great games of all time,” Trump said. “It is speaker of the House, I mean, it's a great position. But he doesn't seem to want it. But I'll bet you that if it was actually offered to him, he would take it.\"\nTrump, the front-runner in early polls for the Republican nomination, said he thinks Ryan is strong but also that he didn’t agree with Ryan on everything.\nTrump also took some credit during his Las Vegas rally Thursday for McCarthy dropping out.\n\"I've been taking a little bit of credit because people have been giving me credit on @realdonaldtrump. They're saying that I spoke up against him only because it's a question of toughness,\" Trump said. \"He didn't seem like that. We need toughness. We need fists, we need the brainpower, and we need toughness.\n\"It may not be him. I mean, they have a couple of people in there, I'm not going to mention names. But people I know that are really tough and really smart. And right now, that's what we need because the Republicans never win,” Trump continued.\nRepublicans mull 'Plan C' for speaker By Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan\nHe went on to list the series of losses House Republicans have faced including Obamacare and the debt ceiling.\n“No matter what we have, there's never, ever a victory,” he said.\nWhile Trump is still lukewarm on Ryan he did encourage someone else to run Friday night.\n“Mark – They could use you,” he tweeted at Mark Cuban, after the billionaire businessman tweeted “Maybe I'll run for Speaker of the House. Can I convince 200+ politicians to write me in? Constitution says I can try. If not me how about?”\nThere is no rule in the Constitution that bars non-representatives for running for speaker but the chances of it actually happening are slim.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/652610045130219520"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:23:28.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
