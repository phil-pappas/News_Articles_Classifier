Supporters aim to make the sentencing system fairer, reduce recidivism and contain rising prison costs.\nThe federal prison population has exploded since 1980, in part because of mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:24:46.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
