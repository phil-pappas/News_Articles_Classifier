The deadline for applications is Dec. 18 . A question-and-answer teleconference for interested applicants is scheduled for Nov. 13. Interested school teams should contact Greg Guzik at guzik@phunds.phys.lsu.edu for more information.\nHASP can support up to 12 student-built payloads. It houses and provides power, mechanical support, interfacing, data downlink and command uplink communications for the instruments. Launched from NASA's balloon launch facility in Fort Sumner, New Mexico , flights typically last 12 to 15 hours, flying at an altitude of approximately 23 miles.\nNASA's scientific balloons offer low-cost, near-space access for payloads weighing up to 8,000 pounds to conduct technology demonstration tests as well as scientific investigations in fields such as astrophysics, heliophysics and atmospheric research. Depending on the goals and objectives of a specific mission, balloon flight durations can run hours to multiple days or weeks for longer-term tests and data collection.\nSince 2006, the HASP program has selected more than 110 payloads for flights, involving more than 800 students from across the United States. Past student groups have flown instruments to flight test compact satellites and prototype long-range communication devices, perform space science experiments, sample particles at the edge of space, perform remote sensing experimentation, test rocket nozzles, and measure infrasound to correlate with geophysical events.\nFor information about NASA's education programs, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/education\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO\n releases/nasa-seeks-student-experiments-for-edge-of-space-balloon-flight-300166067.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC38317&Transmission_Id=201510261303PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC38317&DateId=20151026", "https://www.nasa.gov/scientificballoons", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.nasa.gov/education", "http://laspace.lsu.edu/hasp", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20081007/38461LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nasa-seeks-student-experiments-for-edge-of-space-balloon-flight-300166067.html"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:50:06.256+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
