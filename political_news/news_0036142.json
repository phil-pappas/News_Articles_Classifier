Andrew Cuomo's special adviser on the mega-project. \nHis last day on the job will be Nov. 6. \nConybeare informed Cuomo of his decision Monday, saying he was \"incredibly proud\" of the progress the state had made in the past three years. \n\"It is particularly satisfying to see the beautiful new twin-span bridge rising out of the Hudson River, with its concrete piers and steel girders very visible proof that great things can be accomplished when New Yorkers work together,\" he wrote in his letter of resignation. \nHired from News 12 three years ago to explain the scaled-down bridge replacement to the public, Conybeare said he wanted to explore other opportunities. \n\"With construction now reaching the halfway point , it is time for me to focus on my future both professionally and personally,\" the Eastchester resident wrote. \nConybeare, 53, who is married with four children, declined to comment beyond his letter. \nHe thanked Cuomo for the \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to work on the $4 billion public works project, the largest in the nation. \nAs a local cable TV news anchor, Conybeare was already a familiar face to many in the Lower Hudson Valley when he was hired for the bridge project in the summer of 2012. At the time, the Cuomo administration was under heavy criticism from residents and officials for not sharing enough information on the floundering project that the governor had revived with the help of the Obama administration. \nGov. Andrew Cuomo, right, and Brian Conybeare, special advisor on the Tappan Zee Bridge project, study a model of the replacement bridge in 2013. (Photo: Thruway Authority submitted photo) \nIn his 2014 memoir \"All Things Possible,\" Cuomo called Conybeare \"the Walter Cronkite of Westchester\" and explained why he hired him. \n\"'Brian,' I said, 'do you want to make the world better and do something that your children can show your grandchildren? How about making news rather than reporting it?'\" Cuomo wrote. \"Conybeare agreed to join the state to help explain to citizens why it was a good idea to undertake a multibillion-dollar government project with a history of chaos.\" \nConybeare and his team would go on to hold more than 700 community meetings with tens of thousands of residents and students, explaining the specifics of the project, the nuances of construction and answering questions in forums large and small. \n\"The popular and friendly TV star was a hit with local officials,\" Philip Plotch wrote in \"Politics Across the Hudson: The Tappan Zee Megaproject,\" noting Cuomo \"took a page from Governor Thomas E. Dewey's playbook\" by hiring a media personality to build support for the project. \nConybeare has officially been an employee of the state Thruway Authority, earning more than $163,000 in 2013, according to public records.

(Photo: File photo Tania Savayan/The Journal News) \nThruway Authority Executive Director Robert Megna, who took over this past January, called him \"integral to the success\" of the project and wished him well. \n\"His talent and leadership have kept the public well-informed and engaged throughout the various stages of construction of the bridge,\" Megna said in a statement. \"We are grateful that Brian dedicated more than three years to public service and we understand his desire to return to his private sector career.\" \nConybeare, often in partnership with bridge builder Tappan Zee Constructors, also worked with local government officials, occasionally seeking to quell controversies like construction noise violations in South Nyack in the summer of 2014 and, more recently, where the walking and biking path on the new bridge would end in the village . \nConybeare's replacement has not been named. \nFollow the new Tappan Zee Bridge project on Facebook . 95 CONNECT 21 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RWIhmE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:16:46.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
