In her first six months in the job, she has spent much of her time scaling back subsidies for renewable energy , leading to concerns the UK will not have enough energy to power its homes and businesses in the future. \nOne official said: “We have spent the first part of this government talking about what we’re not going to do. Now we need to tell people what we are going to do.” \nMs Rudd insisted on Thursday that she would “keep the lights on” despite the fact that peak supply this winter will be only slightly above peak demand. \nFigures released by National Grid showed that the buffer between the two is just 1.2 per cent, which will grow to 5.1 per cent after the company has taken emergency measures to increase supply and reduce demand. \nThese measures mainly involve bringing mothballed power plants back online, but the grid operator has also paid companies to power down or move to backup generation at key times in an effort to reduce demand. \nFigures released by the company on Thursday showed it has persuaded businesses to save enough electricity to power a city the size of Bristol over the winter — though it expects only to use around a quarter of that. Steve Holliday, National Grid’s chief executive, said: “[These reductions] can help us dampen down those sharp peaks in demand.” \nAn entire industry is being established of companies acting as brokers between National Grid and smaller businesses to provide this so-called “demand-side management”. Chris Kimmett, commercial manager at Open Energi, one of those brokers, told the FT: “There must be a more efficient way of running the system than for small firms to run diesel generators, but for now this is what National Grid needs to do.” \nPart of the reason for the reduced gap between supply and demand is that thermal energy units such as coal-fired power plants have been shut down, with relatively little capacity built to replace it. \nNational Grid held an auction last December for companies to provide extra capacity. But that auction saw only one successful bidder promise to build a new power station to do so. \nThat company, Carlton Power, this week told the Telegraph that its proposed new gas plant at Trafford, Greater Manchester, was behind schedule and had no financial backers. \nMs Rudd suggested on Thursday that she would be prepared to offer more incentives for new power plants. She told journalists in Westminster: “We would like more investment in infrastructure, and we will be addressing that.” \nWhile she refused to say how she would address the problem, officials have told the Financial Times they are considering changing the rules of the capacity auction to encourage more new building.
