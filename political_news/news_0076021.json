Nolen is also charged with assault and battery with a deadly weapon in an attack on a second colleague, 43-year-old Traci Johnson , who survived.\nHe has pleaded not guilty to both charges. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.\nCleveland County District Judge Lori Walkley cannot set a trial date until she has determined whether Nolen has the mental capacity to participate in a trial.\nTo be convicted of a crime, federal law requires that a defendant is able to consult with his lawyer and understand the nature of the legal proceedings against him. Nolen's defense attorneys claim he is unable to help them prepare his defense and thus should not stand trial.\nA rare non-jury competency trial is scheduled to begin Monday and could take up to three days. District Attorney Greg Mashburn said the competency trial will include psychological testimony from witnesses for both sides.\nJoseph Thai, a professor at the University of Oklahoma College of Law, says determining a defendant's competence for trial is different from determining whether a defendant was insane at the time of the offense.\n\"Due process guarantees a fair trial, and a trial cannot be fair if the accused is incapable of assisting in his own defense,\" Thai said.\nPsychological examinations of Nolen have been filed under seal in the case and defense attorneys have not said whether they plan to pursue an insanity defense if the case goes to trial.\nDefense attorney Mitch Solomon did not return a telephone call seeking comment.\nInvestigators said Nolen had just been suspended from Vaughan Foods when he walked into the company's administrative office and attacked Hufford with a large knife, severing her head. He then repeatedly stabbed Johnson before he was shot by Mark Vaughan , a reserve sheriff's deputy and the company's chief operating officer.\nAuthorities have said Nolen had recently converted to Islam and apparently uttered Arabic words during the attack. Mashburn has said Nolen had \"some sort of infatuation with beheadings,\" but that the attack appeared to have more to do with his suspension than his religious conversion.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:16:54.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
