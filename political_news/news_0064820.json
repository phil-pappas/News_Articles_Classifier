Julian Bell, 44, who runs the intensive care unit at Providence Medford Medical Center, filed election papers Wednesday. He is the first candidate to file on the Democratic side, although Gov. Kate Brown has indicated that she will run for the office she stepped into following the resignation of Gov. John Kitzhaber. According to the Oregonian newspaper, Bell has reported $2,005 in contributions to his campaign — $2,000 of it his own money. Brown has raised just over $200,000. On his website, www.julianbellforgovernor2016.com , Bell says he has two small children, ages 1 and 4, and focuses on what he describes as the \"disaster\" of looming climate change. Bell says he has volunteered with Southern Oregon Climate Action Now and Rogue Climate, local advocacy groups that are active in climate change discussions. He says he and three other Southern Oregonians also formed Hair on Fire Oregon, which \"works on mainstream advertising to spread the word that there is a solution to the climate crisis.\" MailTribune.com Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 9:13 AM Updated at 10:06 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:47:27.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
