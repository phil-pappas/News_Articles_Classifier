But newer technology that creates three-dimensional (3D) mammograms offers important advantages, including greater detection of breast cancers that cannot be seen using those traditional mammograms.\nIn one study of almost 13,000 women, use of 3D mammograms resulted in a 40 percent increase in detection of invasive breast cancer. This new technology is available at both Cleveland Clinic Florida’s academic medical center in Weston, as well as the West Palm Beach location.\nCassann Blake, MD Cleveland Clinic Florida breast surgeon The 3D mammogram is also called “breast tomosynthesis.”\n“Tomosynthesis gathers images of the breast from several different angles, to create a series that forms the 3D image,” says Maria Artze, MD, a Cleveland Clinic Florida radiologist who specializes in breast imaging. “Having these various images reduces the challenge of seeing areas where tissues overlap, and so improves the radiologist’s ability to detect breast cancer.”\nThe technology makes it possible for the first time for radiologists to see a 3D image of the breast. Because of the high level of detail it provides, the images also highlight masses and abnormalities that conventional mammograms might miss. “In images of the breast, dense tissue appears white, and cancer appears white,” says Cassann Blake, MD, Cleveland Clinic Florida breast surgeon. “Tomography gives us much more detail compared to other types of mammograms. Especially for women with dense breast tissue, this detail is important.”\nMaria Artze, MD, Cleveland Clinic Florida radiologist For the patient during the screening, the procedure will be familiar to other mammograms they’ve had. The only difference is that part of the equipment moves in an arc around the breast, instead of staying stationary.\nStudies also show that with tomosynthesis, fewer patients need to return for additional mammograms, visits that can cause stress and expense, plus exposure to additional radiation. Research further shows this procedure provides a 15 percent decrease in the number of “false positives,” where tissue looks cancerous but through biopsy (tissue sample) or another exam is later found to be normal. So 3D mammograms can also help women avoid unnecessary biopsies.\n“Early detection of breast cancer is a key area that we want to highlight,” Dr. Blake says. “Offering the advantages of the 3D mammogram is part of our goal to provide our patients with the best quality of care. Talk to your doctor about whether a 3D mammogram is best for you.”\nFor a consultation with a breast cancer specialist call 855-324-8153, or to learn more visit clevelandclinicflorida.org/cancercare .\nFor a consultation with a breast cancer specialist call 855-324-8153, or to learn more visit clevelandclinicflorida.org/cancercare .\n</p", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/23/ea/86/100615-HL-Dr.-Maria-Artze.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/09/23/19/95/011414-Blake.jpg", "http://my.clevelandclinic.org/florida/departments/cancer.aspx?utm_campaign=cancer-fla-url&utm_medium=offline&utm_source=redirect"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:53:11.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
