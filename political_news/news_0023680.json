Those actions range from reducing the emissions associated with the Council’s own operations, through to supporting energy efficiency, negotiating with public transport operators to achieve lower emission transport options, and ensuring we have up-to-date information about both the region’s GHG emissions and the anticipated impacts of climate change\". \nGWRC has also been working with Wellington City Council, and both councils are keen to promote a region-wide collaborative approach which promises to be more effective than individual councils working in isolation. \"A concerted, joined-up approach is an absolute no-brainer and I’m anxious to get on with it,\" said Chris Laidlaw. \nThe strategy and implementation plan are available at www.gw.govt.nz/climatechange \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
