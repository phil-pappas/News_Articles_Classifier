Harte Elementary School. \nVoters in precincts 6-8 and 6-9 who normally vote at Our Lady of the Rosary will now vote at McDonogh City Park Academy. \nVoters in precincts 5-5 and 5-6 who normally vote at John Dibert School will now vote at Pierre Capdau at Thurgood Marshall. \nVoters in precincts 6-6 who normally St. Peter Claver School will now vote at St. Peter Claver UJIMA Fern Brady Building. \nVoters in precincts 13-9, 10, 12, 13, 14 who normally vote at Isidore Newman School will now vote at Isidore Newman School the Henson Building. \nVoters in precincts 16-5 and 16-6 who normally vote at Kipp Believe College Prep will now vote at Central St. Matthew United Church of Christ. \nClerk of court Arthur Morell says nearly 13,000 Orleans Parish voters cast their ballots early. That's a few thousand fewer early voters than during the last gubernatorial race. For Election Day, Morrell and his office are expecting 30-32 percent turnout -- which could make for long lines. So Morell says all voters need to be prepared when casting their votes. \n“You can take as much time as you want in the polling booth, but you only have three minutes. We're not going to rush you, but we'd like you to move because we expect to have a little crowd. Sometimes you can have lines, but be a little patient. We'll move you pretty quickly,” said Morrell. \nPolls open on Saturday at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m., but the Secretary of State's office says if you're in line at 8 p.m. \nClick here for more details on where you can find a sample ballot specific to your precinct, candidate information and more to prepare you for Election Day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:22:40.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
