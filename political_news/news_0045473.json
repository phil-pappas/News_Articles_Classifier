Videos Clinton sent GOP 2016ers copies of... \nSanders tweeted, \"China -- not exactly seen as a model when it comes to human rights -- provides 14 weeks of paid maternity leave. The US provides zero.\" \nWoods responded within a few hours: \"China has notoriously killed female infants for population control, you utter moron. #ChinaGendercide\" \nSanders did not respond to Woods' tweet on either his senatorial account or his presidential Twitter accounts. In his senator bio, it says that tweets signed by \"-B\" are from the senator and the rest are from his staff. His tweet about China was not signed. \nAfter that tweet to Sanders, Woods wrote on Twitter, \"Basically Bernie is this commie scarecrow put up to make Hillary look palatable by comparison, right? There is no other rationale possible.\" \nWoods, who best known for his roles in movies such as \"Casino,\" \"Nixon\" and most recently, \"White House Down,\" frequently tweets critiques about the Democratic presidential candidates, especially the party's front-runner, Hillary Clinton. He is also not a fan of President Barack Obama, calling him \"the worst president in history.\" \nEarly Tuesday morning, Woods tweeted, \"Illuminating the degradation of America under the worst president in history and preventing it under Clinton is ALL we should be doing,\" referencing Obama and Clinton. \nWoods has also taken to Twitter to say how much he admires Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, saying he is \"proud to support this remarkable woman and her historic campaign.\" \nAnd another politician Woods does like? Ronald Reagan. \n\"Ronald Reagan was a great president AND campaigner because he UNIFIED his party. He let the Democrats fumble around and UNIFIED America,\" Woods tweeted Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:46:57.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
