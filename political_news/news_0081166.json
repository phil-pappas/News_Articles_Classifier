Cameron says Britain is on the road to financial recovery, and his Conservative Party will unleash economic energy to make it \"a land of opportunity for all.\" (AP Photo/Jon Super) | ASSOCIATED PRESS reddit \nDavid Cameron was berated as he arrived for the Tory party conference in Manchester on Saturday. Protests gathered outside the Midlands hotel waiting to chide the PM over the Government's austerity measures. \nCameron refused to speak to reporters as he arrived in the city centre, but would have heard the demonstrators outside the secure zone surrounding the hotel and Manchester Central conference centre. \nProtesters have scheduled a march on Sunday, the day of the conference opening. Fledgling Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected in Manchester on Monday, and will take the stump to address the gathered masses in opposition to Tory reforms. \nThe main issue likely to vex conference attendees is the ongoing debate over Europe. Cabinet minister have already been speaking out on the EU, with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warning that Britain will reject any deal from Brussels without \"substantial\" reforms. \nSpeaking to the Daily Telegraph , Hammond said the British public would blow a \"raspberry\" to the Government if a renegotiated deal did not include genuine change. \nThose sentiments were echoed by Sajid Javid, who suggested Cameron would be willing to push for a Brexit should insufficient reforms be granted. \nLikewise Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who said mass migration and Greek debt have hit the EU like an \"an out-of-control bulldozer,\" making reform more agreeable to the EU hierarchy. \nEarlier, Cameron lambasted the Russian military intervention in Syria and called President Bashar Assad a \"butcher.\"The strongly worded comments accused Moscow of propping up the despot.
