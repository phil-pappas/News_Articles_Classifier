Evans speaks to the media yesterday at the State House after meeting with members of the law enforcement community and Gov. Charlie Baker, left, about opioid legislation. comments Tweet Facing pushback on his bill targeting the state’s opioid crisis, Gov. Charlie Baker has the backing of City Hall, with Police Commissioner William B. Evans saying he and Mayor Martin J. Walsh are “behind it.”\n“Me and Mayor Walsh fully support the governor,” Evans said yesterday at a press conference, where he was flanked by Baker and a group of law enforcement officials who rallied together for the pending legislation. “I know they’re working very closely on this issue that is killing way too many young kids, both within the city and across the state.\n“There might be one or two issues,” Evans said about the legislation, but he added, “I believe me and the mayor are behind it.”\n“The governor’s bill is on the right track and the mayor is fully supportive of a push to address addiction and recovery,” spokeswoman Laura Oggeri said later.\nBaker’s proposal, released last week, includes two parts he acknowledged were controversial: One seeks to limit first-time patients getting an opiate prescription to a 72-hour supply, and applying the same limit to those seeing a new doctor; the second gives medical professionals the authority to involuntarily commit someone for treatment for 72 hours if they pose an immediate danger, including to themselves.\nDoctors, hospitals and other groups were quick to push back on the proposed restrictions, and legislative leaders also sounded notes of caution. The debate comes as new state data showed that an estimated 684 people died of overdoses through the first six months this year, outpacing the same numbers from 2014.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Walsh%2C+Evans+back+gov%E2%80%99s+bill+targeting+opioid+crisis"], "published": "2015-10-23T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:32:13.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
