(Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) \nCanada has deployed CF-18s to take part in the U.S.-led coalition's airstrikes against ISIS. But Trudeau has said he wants to pull those fighters, provide more humanitarian aid in Iraq and Syria and have Canada's military involved in training missions, not bombing missions. \nTrudeau, who spoke with U.S. President Barack Obama on Tuesday, said they discussed Canada's role in the mission and that the president \"understands the commitments I have made around ending the combat mission.\" U.S.-Canada differences 'small,' ambassador says \nHeyman denied that relations between the U.S. and Canada have been damaged under Prime Minister Stephen Harper's watch. Some suggest a tense relationship has developed over the Keystone XL pipeline. Harper has lobbied the U.S. for years to approve the pipeline, calling the approval a \"no-brainer\" and that he \"would not take no for an answer.\" \n\"I wouldn't use that term [damaged] at all,\" Heyman said. \"In fact, I reflected back over the last couple of days on the U.S.-Canada relationship, and as I think about the U.S.-Canada relationship right now, there were a lot of successes, and we have to thank the prime minister for the work that he did on enhancing it.\" \nHeyman said the U.S. and Canada are at record levels of trade and they had just signed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. \n\"I would say there are smaller differences on a few issues.\" \nMansbridge also asked Heyman about the suggestion by Wisconsin governor and former Republican presidential contender Scott Walker that he would consider putting up a wall at the Canada-U.S. border. \n\"That's absurd,\" he said. \"That's just absurd.\" With files from Meagan Fitzpatrick", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:27:57.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
