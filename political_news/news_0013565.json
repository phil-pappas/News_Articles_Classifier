Democrats Sanders and Hillary Clinton both criticized Turing. \nSanders has proposed regulating prices for drugs, saying the lack of such price controls in the United States has \"been an unmitigated disaster.\" \nShkreli recently endorsed Sanders' bid for the Democratic ticket. \nBut Sanders effectively rejected Shkreli's $2,700 donation by saying he would give a donation of the same amount to a health clinic. \nNow Shkreli's backing has soured. \nHe tweeted Sunday that he's so angry at Sanders that he \"could punch a wall.\" \nShkreli told CNNMoney on Sunday night that he donated to Sanders \"in hopes of meeting him and discussing\" pharmaceutical policy. \n\"I find it bizarre that he won't engage me because he's been willing to use my name,\" Shkreli said. \"He singled me out, but dozens of drug companies have done what I've done.\" \nShkreli said he hasn't spoken directly to any of the current presidential candidates and has not decided who he will back for president.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:11:45.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
