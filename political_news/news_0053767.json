Other DHBs are under the same sort of pressure. \n\"Not having the staff and resources to meet demand is symptomatic of an underfunded health system. \n\"These are frontline workers. They are committed to providing the best possible care. When they are raising fears about unsafe work environments then someone should be listening. \n\"That someone should be Health Minister Jonathan Coleman. Unfortunately he appears more eager to continue his predecessor’s habit of pumping out so-called ‘good news’ and blaming others.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:24:58.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
