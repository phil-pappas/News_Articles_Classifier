FBI sources told the Chicago Tribune that they interviewed multiple people who brought up similar allegations of abuse.\nProsecutors and defense attorneys did not say what the specific allegations were, or whether Hastert, who served as speaker from 1999 to 2007, would serve time in prison. Hastert, who pleaded not guilty in July to the two charges, did not appear in court today and has not been charged with any past misconduct or sex crimes.\nThe plea agreement is expected to be submitted to US District Judge Thomas Durkin on October 19, Hastert's attorneys said during a brief court appearance. Hastert is scheduled to plead guilty October 28.\nLast month, lawyers for both sides said they were negotiating a plea deal to keep the case from going to trial, which would reveal potentially embarrassing details about Hastert and the anonymous person to whom he was providing the money. Durkin had told both sides that he would set a trial date if they didn't bring him an agreement this week.\nAccording to the indictment, Hastert withdrew $1.7 million in cash from his bank accounts from 2010 to 2014. He is charged with structuring $952,000 of the withdrawals by taking the funds out in increments of less than $10,000 to avoid a requirement that banks report large cash transactions.\nRelated: Illinois Governor Signs Sweeping Law Banning Gay Conversion Therapy\nHastert then told the FBI he was keeping the cash for himself, which the indictment said was false. Prosecutors described a series of meetings between Hastert and an unnamed person in which Hastert handed over cash in exchange for the person's silence.\nHastert left public office in 2007 and became a lobbyist in Washington, DC.\nEach of the two charges carries a possible maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\nFollow VICE News on Twitter: @ViceNews", "external_links": ["http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-dennis-hastert-status-hearing-met-20151014-story.html", "https://twitter.com/vicenews"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:55:08.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
