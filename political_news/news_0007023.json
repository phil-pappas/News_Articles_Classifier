They were being placed in the subway system in part to counter a campaign by an organization seeking to display ads critical of Muslims, the judge noted.\nOne among six proposed ads included the statement: “The Ugly Truth About Muslims: Muslims have great frittata recipes.”\nAnother said: “Muslims hate terrorism! They also hate: People who tell you they went to an Ivy League school within 10 seconds of meeting them … When the deli guy doesn’t put enough schmear on your bagel … Hipsters who wear winter hats in the summer … the pickling of everything…”\nThe MTA said it was reviewing the judge’s decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:59:14.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
