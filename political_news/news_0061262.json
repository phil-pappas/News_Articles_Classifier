The cyberstalking conviction, which prosecutors have said is unprecedented, carries a possible life sentence.\nThe judge on Tuesday rescheduled sentencing for Jan. 13.\nIn seeking the delay, Gonzalez's attorney said the case involved many issues that require significant research and preparation. He also said defense lawyers want to review a pre-sentence investigation report to determine whether additional issues need to be presented.\nBelford was shot by Thomas Matusiewicz, who then killed himself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:53:26.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
