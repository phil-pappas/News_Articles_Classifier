(Patrick Doyle/Canadian Press) Related Stories Niqab ban at citizenship ceremonies unlawful, as Ottawa loses appeal \nThe Federal Court of Appeal has denied the application for a stay of the Federal Court ruling in favour of Zunera Ishaq, clearing the way for her to wear a niqab during a citizenship ceremony. \nRegulations have banned wearing of face veils at citizenship ceremonies, but Ishaq challenged the rule and won in Federal Court. On Sept. 18, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld that decision in a quick ruling from the bench. The federal government had sought a stay of the ruling and said it intended to appeal to the Supreme Court. \nBefore reciting the oath, would-be Canadians are required to provide multiple proofs of identity. Those who wear face coverings must remove them before the ceremony in private before a citizenship official. ANALYSIS | The niqab debate, let's not forget, is about individual rights \nIshaq's lawyer said he welcomed the ruling, though he had yet to speak with his client. \n\"At this point, the Federal Court of Appeal has made a clear statement that there's no basis to grant them a stay, that they upheld their previous ruling that this case has nothing to do with the niqab,\" Lorne Waldman said in a telephone interview with CBC News. \n\"It's an issue from the rule of law, and the minister acted illegally in creating a policy that went contrary to the legislation, and that's what this case is about.\" \nConservative Party Chris McCluskey told CBC News in an email, \"We are disappointed in the court's decision, especially as we were waiting on the Supreme Court to hear our appeal. \n\"We have committed to rectifying this matter going forward by introducing legislation that will require one to show their face while swearing the oath of citizenship. Legislation will be introduced within the first 100 days of a re-elected Conservative government.\" \nIshaq is one of two women who have refused to unveil before taking the citizenship oath since the Conservatives introduced the policy directive in 2011, \nThe Department of Citizenship and Immigration must formally invite Ishaq to attend a ceremony. Several are scheduled in Ontario between now and the Oct. 19 election.
