Pushed hard by the Obama administration, it now faces months of scrutiny in Washington, where Congress must sign off on it before it can be enacted.\nCongress can either approve the deal or vote it down but cannot amend it.\nDetails of the sprawling, 30-chapter agreement won’t be made public for at least another month, but some key facts are emerging. For example, the U.S. Trade Office estimates the deal would eliminate more than 18,000 tariffs on imports of goods from the United States into the 11 other participating countries. That could spur business growth in the U.S., but skeptics of the deal – including some U.S. labor unions that oppose it – say it would result in fewer worker and environmental protections and send more American jobs overseas.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton came out against the agreement last week after months of sitting on the fence.\n“I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made,” Clinton said in a statement. “But the bar here is very high, and based on what I have seen, I don’t believe this agreement has met it.”\nMeanwhile, Republican presidential candidates are all over the map with respect to the deal.\nFront-runner Donald Trump has called the agreement “an attack on American business.” Carly Fiorina, a former business executive whose campaign has surged in recent weeks, has said the agreement makes her “uncomfortable.” Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have both spoken in favor of the pact.\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is lobbying Capitol Hill fiercely in support of the deal, which puts the powerful business organization in rare alignment with Obama on a key policy goal.\nThe national Business Roundtable also supports it and points out that New Mexico, whose exports have been growing, could increase its trade even more with five participating countries – Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand and Vietnam – that are not a part of existing U.S. free trade agreements.\nGov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, supports the deal.\n“We view this legislation as positive,” said Jon Barela, New Mexico’s economic development secretary. “The state is strategically positioned because of its geography to make our southern border and the entire state a place where commerce can flow. The bottom line is if you reduce tariffs, trade and investment flows.”\nNM pitch\nThe White House said Friday that, under the deal, New Mexico would see reduced tariffs on its prized exports of green chile, pecans and cheese, which are now taxed as high as 12, 30 and 40 percent, respectively, in some of the countries participating in the agreement.\nBut New Mexico’s delegation, including Democrats and its only Republican, remain wary.\nThis past summer, all five members of the delegation voted against fast-track trade authority that gave Obama latitude to negotiate key details without congressional input.\n“I will study the agreement, but at the outset, I am deeply skeptical,” said Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M. “This is a sweeping agreement negotiated behind closed doors, which hasn’t yet been released to the public. It would impact wages and the labor protections and environmental standards that American workers have fought for over many decades – as well as intellectual property rights, government procurement, investment, privacy, and international environmental issues.”\nThe announced resignation last month of U.S. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican who was a staunch supporter of the deal, also clouds its chances.\nThe most conservative U.S. House members, including Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico, opposed giving fast-track trade authority to Obama, largely because it would expand his powers. Some Republicans are also concerned the deal could result in an influx of new foreign workers into the U.S.\nBoehner’s resignation could bolster their opposition.\nRep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican whom many in the GOP are now urging to run for House speaker, has signaled his support for the trade deal, telling National Public Radio in June that it would help “level the playing field” for the U.S. in trade with other countries.\nIn a Journal interview, Pearce said that he was open to supporting the deal but that his many of his constituents are “alarmed” by it.\n“I am absolutely on the side of free trade, but I want it to be fair trade,” said Pearce, who represents the state’s border with Mexico. “If we get enough out of it and it doesn’t hurt New Mexico businesses, sure I’ll be for it. But we’re looking both ways and trying to tell people who are calling in alarmed about it – especially businesspeople – just wait until we see it (the contents of the deal). We have plenty of time. I’m just being cautious about it.”\nIn a separate statement, Pearce’s office noted that the U.S. trade deficit is rising and that “time and again, free trade agreements have reduced the deficit between agreeing nations.”\n“With 95 percent of the world’s consumers outside the United States, our nation must look to expand our economy into these foreign markets,” Pearce said in the statement. “Congress now has the responsibility to carefully review the final agreement, and ensure the provisions included, such as agricultural, financial services, and intellectual property, have the best interest of our state’s and our nation’s economy in mind.”\nSen. Martin Heinrich and Rep. Ben Ray Luján, both New Mexico Democrats, said they remain undecided, but Luján, in particular, sounded skeptical.\n“Too often, previous trade deals have resulted in American jobs going overseas,” said Luján, who is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Our workers need policies that will help grow their paychecks and create opportunities to get ahead here at home, and it’s through that lens that I will scrutinize all aspects of this trade deal.”\n“My position on this proposed agreement will be based on whether it benefits American workers and our economy,” Heinrich said. “The text must be released to the public, and I will be a part of a thorough congressional review of the proposed agreement in the Senate. It’s time to shine a light on this latest free trade deal.”\nRep. Michelle Lujan Grisham, D-N.M., said she needs more time to digest the details before reaching a conclusion on the deal.\n“Because the trade negotiations were not transparent and did not include congressional input, I will take as much time as needed to thoroughly scrutinize the final agreement,” Lujan Grisham said. “I am particularly interested in analyzing the last-minute compromises to determine the impact on New Mexico workers and our state’s economy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:28:55.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
