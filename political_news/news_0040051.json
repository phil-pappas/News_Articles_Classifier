However, insiders have disclosed to the press that the CCDI decided to investigate Su after coming across irregularities during an audit inspection of Sinopec in November last year.\nLike Us on Facebook\nSu headed China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) for five years between 2007 and 2011 before moving on to become the governor of Fujian province. Prior to his stint at Sinopec, Su had worked as the deputy general manager of China National Petroleum Corporation (PetroChina).\n53-year-old Su is the first incumbent governor to be investigated for corruption under President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. Several high ranking officials in China's petroleum sector have fallen since the anti-graft drive came into effect in 2012.\nIn June, the CCDI announced that Liao Yongyuan , the former vice chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) had been placed under investigation for corruption. Liao was reportedly found guilty of several crimes, including accepting bribes and committing adultery. In June, prosecutors said Liao had been placed in custody as he was formally indicted. It is unclear when his case would go to trial.\nIn September, the CCDI announced that the former president of Sinopec Wang Tianpu has been found guilty of corruption. China's anti-corruption watchdog revealed in April that Wang was being investigated after he was momentarily detained.\nAccording to the commission, Wang embezzled public funds, accepted bribes and illegally used his office to benefit himself and his relatives. Wang's case has reportedly been handed to the judiciary.\nTag: Su Shulin Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) Sinopec Liao Yongyuan PetroChina Wang Tianpu ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Chinatopix", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/15/us-china-corruption-petrochina-idUSKBN0OV0B020150615", "http://trends.revcontent.com/serve.js.php?w=3369&t=", "http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1865108/fujian-governor-under-investigation-anti-corruption"], "published": "2015-10-08T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:47:34.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
