Natalie Brand, KING 5 Political Reporter 6:58 p.m. PDT October 23, 2015 KING 5 talks to both candidates in the Seattle City Council District 5 race - Sandy Brown and Debora Juarez - about one of the big issues in the area: tackling crime. (Photo: KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSEATTLE -- Situated near 90th and Aurora, the Gehrke family has operated their family business, Acme Auto Electric, in North Seattle since 1945. They know the neighborhood, both the good and the bad. \n\"You got your prostitution, drug dealing, homelessness,\" said Curtis Gehrke, who also serves as president of the Aurora Avenue Merchants Association. \nGehrke says his group has had to step in when police resources run short. That includes buying cameras, putting up signs, even patrolling the streets. \n\"That kind of stuff is like the Wild West,\" said District 5 candidate Debora Juarez. \"That shouldn't be happening on Aurora.\" \n\"We have zero police presence,\" said Gehrke. \n\"I've talked to people all over the district,\" said District 5 candidate Sandy Brown. \"They call police for property crime, and what they get is a five- or six-hour response.\" \nKING 5 invited both candidates to meet with Gehrke and lay out their public safety plans, if elected in November. Below are quotes from our interviews: \nDebora Juarez \n\"I know how bad it is on Aurora. I know that their number one concern is public safety,\" said Juarez. \"Until I'm in there, I'm not going to be privy to how decisions are made, but I know one thing is for certain: We need more police officers in the North End.\" \n\"This is a state highway; it's an economic engine. It's residential and it's business, and it has been around for a long time and it's been severely neglected,\" Juarez said of Aurora. \n\"We have to protect Aurora and we have to get the state involved as well. District 5 isn't an island,\" she continued. \"Aurora is an economic engine and a powerhouse and a jewel that we need to protect and advocate for.\" \nSandy Brown \n\"I've put public safety as number one on my list for my campaign,\" said Brown. \n\"My solution has been let's hold a Seattle-based police academy and not rely on the State police academy for us to be able to fill the need.\" \n\"We're not just looking for officers to arrest people. We're looking for officers to bring solutions, and so one of the key solutions they can provide is law enforcement assisted diversion.\" \n\"The police officer needs to be a problem solver, and if there are not enough police officers, then they're not going to be able to solve the problems that exist with the people out here.\" \n\"Let's attend to these issues because they're driving away business, they're driving away residential,\" concluded Brown. \"People live here and they want to live in a place that's safe.\" \nMore on earlier responses to public safety issue, plus additional issues in our KING 5 District 5 debate.
