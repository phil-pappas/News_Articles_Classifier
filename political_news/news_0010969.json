(Lynne Sladky/AP) By Bethany McLean October 15 Follow bethanymac12 Bethany McLean is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair and the author of \" Shaky Ground: The Strange Saga of the U.S. Mortgage Giants .\" If there’s one thing with which most of Washington has long agreed, it’s this: Fannie and Freddie must die.\nThat’s Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants that prop up much of the American housing market and have been operating under government control since the financial crisis seven years ago. “There’s a majority of people here that believe that they should be wound down and replaced so that the taxpayers are not backing them up as they are today,” is how Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) put it last week . In one of his few mentions of the topic, President Obama described Fannie and Freddie’s business model as “heads [they] win, tails taxpayers lose,” meaning that although their executives and shareholders profited in the good times, the implicit belief that the government stood behind them — which was the core of their business model — would force taxpayers to cover the losses in a crisis. Which we did.\nThe critics are right about the flaws of both institutions: Fannie and Freddie agglomerated too much political power before they went bust, and their drive for market share during the housing boom early in the past decade left taxpayers on the hook to bail them out.\nBut we still need Fannie and Freddie, even more now than before.\nThey own or guarantee the payments on more than $5 trillion in American mortgages, or about 60 percent of the total. In the years since the financial collapse, they have been the major source of credit for most people who got mortgages, and the only source of credit for less-than-pristine borrowers. Washington is paralyzed. Even Corker, when pressed, backed away from his call to eliminate them, because despite the hatred of the housing giants, collectively known as “government-supported entities,” or GSEs, no one wants to see what would happen without them, and no one can agree on how to replace them.\nAs a result, there’s no plan for how the United States will finance housing in the future. Without a housing finance policy, there is no housing policy. And that’s a huge problem, because another crisis — about how people will afford a place to live — is brewing.\nSince 2008, while Fannie and Freddie have sat in limbo, homeownership has plunged.
