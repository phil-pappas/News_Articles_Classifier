Ginther, to failing to uncover fraud in a federal tutoring program almost a decade ago. Ginther’s camp shot back that Scott has become “desperate.” \n\nScott hosted a news conference at his campaign headquarters today with Bernadine Kennedy Kent, now a candidate for the Columbus school board, who wrote a letter to the Board of Education in 2006 alerting members of potential fraud in the federal tutoring program. State investigators concluded last week that tutors had bilked taxpayers out of more than $800,000. \n\nScott says the documents show that Ginther failed to investigate when he served on the school board and led district’s audit committee. Ginther left the school board in early 2007. \n\n“What were you doing?” Scott said of Ginther’s time chairing the audit committee. “I have no clue what the guy was doing.” \n\nBut Ginther’s campaign spokesman, Bryan Clark, said Ginther had stepped down as chairman of the audit committee right around the time that Kent sent a letter to all seven school board members requesting an investigation into “fraud, waste and abuse” into the tutoring program. A few months later, in January of 2007, he was appointed to the City Council. \n\n“This is just a desperate attempt by a desperate campaign,” Clark said. “It’s not clear if Zach Scott is running for mayor, school board or dog catcher, but it’s clear that he is not qualified for any of those jobs.” \n\nAllegations about the tutoring program are only part of the lengthy four-page email that Kent sent board members in October 2006. Most of the email laid out a wide list of complaints about perceived district abuse and mismanagement. Those allegations included altered checks, “ profiteering as a result of insider knowledge of investment securities activities,” “disappearance of records, furniture, fixtures or equipment,” and not allotting the proper payments to charter-school busing, to mention a few. \n\nOnly one of the complaints in that email came up today. \n\nIn a couple passages, Kent listed tutoring services that she believed had failed to offer proper documentation to the district for their federal payments. Last week, State Auditor Dave Yost said several of those same firms must now repay the taxpayers’ money – although he’s not sure the money can be recovered. \n\n“There were no allegations that there were any concerns with this new federal program” at the time that Kent wrote her letter, Clark said, noting that Yost only looked at tutoring between 2008 and 2011, a time when Ginther had long been gone from the school board. \n\nKent said she thought Ginther and the rest of the board should have referred the matter to district auditors, “since they were being made aware of it.” \n\n“It’s an issue for all of them,” Kent said, given a number of red flags that she raised. \n\nSeveral years later, in 2010 and 2011, the district and state began to question those tutoring programs, finding that providers lacked documentation that they actually provided services. \n\nLast week, Yost said the lack of basic controls in place in Columbus was puzzling. Scott said it wasn’t puzzling – district leaders didn’t care.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:38:28.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
