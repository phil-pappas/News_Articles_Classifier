How has life been?\nIt has been good. I have been able to do a lot of things, the things that I was not able to do during my playing days. I am getting to see the other side of the coin after so many years, and then being able to rub shoulders with well wishers and fans from close vicinity. I am actually feeling from close quarters the love and affection showered on me in the last 25 years.\nHow competitive will these matches be? Exhibition matches are usually fun, aren't they?\nYes. It will be fun. We will have fun. At the same time, we will be playing good, serious cricket. We don't want to go there and fool around. We want to interact with spectators, go out and give them some quality cricket to watch. I am sure the cricket will be played seriously. Nobody wants to fool around. The 28 champion players we have selected have all been extremely competitive throughout their careers. Now, for them just to cross the rope and take things lightly, that is not going to happen so easily. They will still get competitive, which will be good for the spectators.\nWhy USA? Did you have other non-cricket playing countries as options?\nCricket is also popular in the USA. There are a lot of Asians staying there. People from the Caribbean islands, England, Australia, people who followed cricket in their countries now reside in America. Unfortunately, there is no live action when you want to go inside a stadium and want to watch live action. No competitive cricket is being played there. We want to do that. We want to generate that interest and encourage youngsters to play the game. I know a lot of friends who play club cricket there. We want to continue to keep that interest level really high. For ripple effect, you need superstars to go there and play. That is when it (interest level) is going to start. We are looking forward to it. It is going to be extremely exciting.\nWill you be spreading this series to other non-cricket playing nations in future?\nWe will be looking into that. For the time being, we are focussed on the first three games. And, the best part is International Cricket Council (ICC) is backing us. We appreciate their support. We all are retired cricketers. For a long time, we played under the ICC umbrella. To have ICC on board with us is very good for the game and for the players as well. To travel there as ICC and cricket ambassadors will make a huge difference.\nThat's what Dave Richardson said when you and Warne met him in June first week in Dubai when discussing the plans for your series...\nThat's right. We wanted to have them on board with us. We want to work together. ICC, obviously, is managing the current players. Also, if their blessing is there, if their support is there for the retired cricketers, that would also play a big role.\nYou have got players with and against whom you have played in your career. Any plans about having players who played before you, giving them a role in any way?\nRight now, we have commentators and all that. Right now, we only thought of taking these players to play. Later on, I don't know. We have not thought about it. There are too many things we have had to plan and we just want to focus on this right now. As time goes by, we might think of other options.\nShane Warne is regarded as one of the finest never to have captained Australia. He will be leading Warne's Warriors against your Sachin's Blasters.\nI cannot tell you what the Australian selectors or what the board thought (about Warne not being made captain of Australia). It would be unfair to pass a judgement on that without having any knowledge.\nHow will it be against Warne the captain?\nWe both are looking forward to this. We want to do justice. The response has been fabulous. People have responded very positively. They are going to turn up to relive all those memories and we are also trying to re-establish that. We are trying to reconnect our passion with cricket. We want to give them the best possible result.\nWill you be having local USA players in the teams?\nNo. We don't have local players. But we are going to run community clinics, go and mix around with the locals, teach them how to play, get school children to come and practice. Those kind of things are going to happen. Everything is planned. We are going to have locals engaged and make every effort to make them fall in love with cricket.\nWhat has been are your experience of playing cricket in USA? Of course, you have played in international cricket nearby Toronto...\nI have played competitive cricket in Toronto. I just played once in America, an exhibition game in 1990. Otherwise, have not played at all there.\nOr the experience of watching competitive sports in USA?\nI have been to American football game and a baseball game. I was there at Derek Jeter's (New York Yankees legend) last game (in 2014). I caught up with him. It was a lovely experience. The crowd responded brilliantly. Derek is a legend. He was there in Australia as well, where we caught up and had dinner together. That is something I would always remember, being present at his last game.\nRecently, Ian Chappell said, “I have always thought the reason for retiring is you wanted to stop playing. Why would people want to watch older players?” How do you respond?\nSee, each person is entitled to have an opinion and need not always be right. Why only ex-players? You go on the street also and catch five people, they are going to have their opinions.\nHow excited are you about this tournament? As excited as you were about matches in your playing days?\nThe excitement level is there. It is a new experience. It is a new chapter. We are looking forward to it. It is going to be a lot of fun.\nWe have had Masters cricket for the retired players, veterans matches etc. in the past. Is this a sort of revival of those kind of matches?\nThis is completely different. Earlier, there were two countries playing. In each team, possible you had two or three real big names, superstars. Here you have all 28 who superstars. The world has not seen something like this. Either you are going to see Glenn McGrath bowl to Ricky Ponting, or a Shane Warne bowl to Andrew Symonds or Brian Lara face Curtly Ambrose or Allan Donald, Jacques Kallis batting against Graeme Swann. People cannot possibly get bored. At all times, there is something interesting happening. There is going to a superstar bowler and a superstar batsman batting all 40 overs.\nYou have finalised the players but have you decided who plays under you and who under Warne?\nIt will happen soon. In the next few days, we are looking to do that. So, you will know shortly about it.\nWhat other interests do you and Warnie have in common?\nCricket (laughs). Cricket is something that has helped us become friends. Cricket has given us the opportunity to meet every now and then. It is cricket which has brought all 28 of us together.\nSachin's Blasters vs Warne's Warriors\nPLAYERS IN ACTION:\nSachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, VVS Laxman, Ajit Agarkar (all India), Shane Warne, Matthew Hayden, Andrew Symonds, Glenn McGrath, Ricky Ponting (all Australia), Shaun Pollock, Jacques Kallis, Lance Klusener, Jonty Rhodes, Allan Donald (all South Africa), Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Muttiah Muralitharan (all Sri Lanka), Graeme Swann, Michael Vaughan (both England), Courtney Walsh, Brian Lara, Curtly Ambrose, Carl Hooper (all West Indies), Daniel Vettori (New Zealand), Wasim Akram, Moin Khan, Shoaib Akhtar, Saqlain Mushtaq (all Pakistan)\nSCHEDULE:\nNovember 7 at Citi Field, New York (1 pm), November 11 at Minute Maid Park, Houston (2 pm), November 14 at Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles (6.30pm)\n(All local times)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:42:00.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
