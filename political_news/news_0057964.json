But it could have been if the former first lady was the kind of person who fell for email scams. (Video via The White House , ABC ) \nA report from the Associated Press says Clinton's server received at least five scam emails disguised as traffic tickets in 2011. \nThe emails contained an attachment which, if opened, would have sent data from Hillary's computer to the hackers' servers, including one in Russia. (Video via Federal Trade Commission ) \nThe report doesn't say whether Clinton ever opened one of the emails or whether the hackers themselves were from Russia. (Video via CNN ) \nBut it looks like it wasn't a targeted attack on Clinton herself. The security company Sophos reported on the common scam at the time, calling it a \"widely spammed-out malware attack.\" \nFBI director James Comey reportedly has said that the agency is working round the clock to see whether any classified information was leaked from Clinton's server. Clinton's campaign denies her system was ever breached.
