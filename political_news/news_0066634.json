Jerry Brown action on legislation By Jessica Calefati and Tracy Seipel Staff writers Posted: 10/04/2015 09:08:29 PM PDT Updated: 10/04/2015 09:08:30 PM PDT SACRAMENTO -- With less than a week to go before Sunday's deadline for Gov. Jerry Brown to act on a bevy of bills, lawmakers and activists are anxiously awaiting word about the fate of some of the year's highest-profile legislation. \nBrown is widely expected to sign bills his administration worked behind the scenes to craft, including measures to combat climate change and regulate the state's medical marijuana industry. \nBut he's been tight-lipped about other measures, including legislation that would better protect foster youth who are over-prescribed potent psychotropic drugs and allow terminally ill Californians to end their lives with a lethal prescription obtained through a doctor. \nOver this past weekend, the governor was busy signing dozens of other bills, including one that requires police to collect data about race and other information on civilian stops they make. He also signed a bill outlawing the sale of ivory elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns. \nThe governor has until Wednesday to balance the pros and cons of the right-to-die legislation, which would make California the fourth state in the nation to legalize the practice if it's signed into law. Sunday is the deadline for action on more than 400 other bills. \n\"The governor is taking his time and treating this bill with the seriousness it deserves,\" said Sen. Lois Wolk, D-Davis, a co-author of the right-to-die legislation. \"I'm cautiously optimistic.\" Advertisement \nSupporters of Assembly Bill X2-15 were inspired by the story of Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old UC Berkeley graduate and newlywed diagnosed with aggressive terminal brain cancer who moved to Oregon to end her life last year. \nThe proposal seemed destined for failure in July when it stalled in the Assembly Health Committee due to opposition from a group of mostly Southern California Democrats, citing personal and religious objections. \nBut several weeks later, it was revived when Assemblywoman Susan Talamantes Eggman, D-Stockton, reintroduced the legislation during a special session on health care funding, adding a provision that the law will expire in 10 years unless legislators vote to extend it. \nOpponents who believe the legislation will endanger the lives of elderly and disabled Californians say they're still hopeful Brown will veto it. \n\"Assisted suicide would become the cheapest end-of-life alternative in a health care system driven by costs,\" said Tim Rosales, a spokesman for Californians Against Assisted Suicide. \"I'm not surprised that he's being so thoughtful and thorough.\" \nThe fact that Brown hasn't yet announced his decision on the controversial bill means it's likely among a small group of \"brain busters\" that keep him up at night, said Bill Whalen, a veteran GOP strategist and speechwriter who is now a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution. \n\"Jerry Brown is more of a free agent than past California governors,\" said Whalen, who described the governor's bill-signing strategy as quizzical. \"That means most of us don't have a clue what he'll do or when he'll do it.\" \nLast year, Brown waited until the deadline to sign a raft of key bills, including controversial measures that outlaw single-use plastic grocery bags, force juvenile sex offenders to obtain treatment and allow relatives of mentally ill gun owners to temporarily take away their guns. \nIf Brown fails to act on any pieces of legislation by this year's deadlines, those measures automatically become law. \nThe right-to-die measure isn't the only piece of legislation on the governor's desk that could decide matters of life and death. Brown must also weigh the merits of Assembly Bill 159, authored by Assemblyman Ian Calderon, D-Whittier, and Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Temecula. \nTheir right-to-try bill would allow terminally ill patients who have exhausted all other options to access experimental drugs, products or devices that have not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. More than 20 other states already have similar laws on the books. \nThe Association of Northern California Oncologists warns that providing unregulated treatments for people desperately trying to extend their lives takes advantage of their frailty. Proponents insist that dying patients don't have time to wait for the FDA to act to formally approve new therapies. \n\"Americans shouldn't have to ask the government for permission to try to save their own lives,\" Calderon and Stone wrote in a recent op-ed, urging the governor to sign the measure. \"They should be able to work with their doctors directly to decide what potential treatments they are willing to try.\" \nA trio of bills sitting on Brown's desk that seek to better protect foster youth were introduced after an investigation by this newspaper found almost a quarter of California foster teens receive psychotropic drugs that are mostly unapproved for children and can have serious side effects. \nIf signed into law, Senate Bills 238, 319 and 484 would mandate regular reporting on the number of prescriptions children receive and require judges, lawyers and social workers to participate in training on the drugs and their side effects. \nThe legislation, authored by Sens. Holly Mitchell, D-Los Angeles, and Jim Beall, D-San Jose, would also provide more information about medicated kids to the juvenile courts responsible for assessing their well-being. \n\"The fact that the governor hasn't signed the bills yet isn't concerning,\" said Frank Mecca, executive director of the County Welfare Directors Association of California, which supports the legislation. \"I'm confident we've done enough to convince him of their value.\" \nEnvironmental activists are certain Brown will sign Senate Bill 350 -- authored by Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le√≥n, D-Los Angeles, and Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco -- which sets ambitious targets for boosting building efficiency standards and increasing the share of electricity generated from renewable sources. \nThe governor's perspective is less clear on measures banning tiny plastic microbeads found in soaps and cosmetics that are polluting major bodies of water such as San Francisco Bay. \nOther bills awaiting Brown's signature or veto include legislation that would: automatically register to vote Californians who obtain new driver's licenses; prohibit cities or counties from banning artificial lawns or other drought-tolerant landscaping; and suspend the high-school exit exam for the next three years.
