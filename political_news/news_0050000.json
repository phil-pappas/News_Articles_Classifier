At a private gathering in New York with top fundraisers, donors were urged to help increase the number of supporters and bundlers. According to multiple investors at the weekend meeting, the campaign shared data showing roughly 150 people have brought in at least $100,000 for the campaign, and around 50 have collected $270,000 or more.\nAnd prominent members of both the East and West Coast Democratic financing communities reported even more interest in giving to the party’s front-runner after her Benghazi testimony last week — an event that bought the Clinton operation its most lucrative hour of fundraising yet.\nThe weekend’s celebratory atmosphere was unmistakable. The campaign’s finance leadership gathering started with a Saturday evening reception (“justifiably, spirits [were] good,” one high-level bundler in attendance emailed), and ended with a 1,400-person fundraising bash in midtown Manhattan for Clinton’s 68th birthday. Bill Clinton attended the party at which John Legend, Demi Lovato, Amy Schumer and Tony Bennett performed.\nPoliticians also showed up Sunday night, including New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, and its senators, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer. Earlier in the evening, Clinton headlined a smaller fundraiser hosted by fashion designer Vera Wang.\nWhile Clinton’s campaign was sitting on $33 million in cash by the end of September, it still needs to increase its donor base, various fundraisers say they were told. That’s partly because the Clinton team knows Sanders’ campaign (with $27 million in cash on hand) has fewer backers who have already given the full legal maximum, meaning the senator can tap many of his existing contributors again while Clinton cannot.\nThe Clinton campaign also continues to ask some top donors for roughly $360,000 for its joint fundraising effort with the Democratic National Committee and 33 state parties, and it has received new commitments since the end of September, said donors briefed on the progress. Federal Election Commission reports showed a small group of contributors giving that amount by the beginning of October, including California philanthropist Laure Woods, Chicago mogul Fred Eychaner, Esprit founder Susie Tompkins Buell and both billionaire J.B. Pritzker and his wife, Mary Kathryn.\nTrump gets it wrong on Ford plants in Mexico By Nick Gass\nAfter a strong October, these asks are being received more warmly than they were over a politically difficult summer, some fundraisers said.\n\"I think there is a real sense that dawn has arrived and it looks to be a sunny day, which is lifting all spirits exactly at a time when real voters in the early states — not just the chattering class — are focusing in,\" said Chris Lehane, a California Democratic strategist who has been closely involved with the campaign's fundraising.\nThe campaign declined to comment for this story.\nHeading into the weekend, many top bundlers said they were eager to meet up due to rumors of a flood of new financial interest in the campaign. Bill Clinton stepped up his fundraising while his wife prepared for the first Democratic debate and for the Benghazi hearing. To longtime Clinton loyalists, the re-emergence of Bill Clinton on the campaign trail in Iowa on Saturday — matched with the Friday morning revelation that Jeb Bush’s campaign is apparently faltering — was icing on the cake.\nThat, plus Vice President Joe Biden opting out of a 2016 run, has generated an influx of interest from Democrats who were previously on the sidelines.\nAs the weekend closed, Clinton was set to largely focus on public campaigning over the coming week. But she’ll be back to a heavy fundraising schedule in early November, according to event invitations viewed by POLITICO. Some West Coast backers are looking to build on the month’s momentum by focusing on a Nov. 4 event hosted by singer Christina Aguilera in Beverly Hills, and other star-studded receptions surrounding it.\n“She’s beginning to do well fundraising-wise because people are now beginning to focus on her policies. She gets that the economy is a major part of succeeding in the world, and if she does as good a job as President Bill Clinton did, America will be in good shape,” said Imaad Zuberi, one of the campaign’s top fundraisers.\n“If you look at the Benghazi hearing going really well and the vice president dropping out, anyone who was sitting on the sidelines is all in, on the bandwagon now.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:19:26.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
