CBS, wtsp.com 6:26 a.m. EDT October 16, 2015 U.S. Vice President Joe Biden reacts to reporters' questions about him running for president while he waits for the arrival of President Park Geun-hye of South Korea at the Naval Observatory October 15, 2015 in Washington, DC.

Ted Kaufman, who has known Joe Biden since 1972 and is in the close circle of those advising him on a potential presidential run, sent a letter Thursday night to Biden alumni - many of his former staffers - about Biden and the decision before him. CBS News' Julianna Goldman obtained a copy of the letter. \nKaufman said in the letter that he has \"spoken with [Biden] extensively\" about his thoughts on a bid for the presidency and the timing of his decision. Though Kaufman \"couldn't add much\" on the question of timing, he did talk about a Biden campaign. \nIt would be, Kaufman wrote, \"An optimistic campaign. A campaign from the heart. A campaign consistent with his values, our values, and the values of the American people. And I think it's fair to say, knowing him as we all do, that it won't be a scripted affair-- after all, it's Joe.\" \nThe letter assured them that the vice president \"has a good grip on the mechanics around this decision\" and Kaufman said he's \"confident that the Vice President is aware of the practical demands of making a final decision soon.\" \nHe closed, \"If he decides to run, we will need each and every one of you - yesterday!\" \nThe likely intent of the letter is to quiet the narrative that Hillary Clinton's commanding debate performance turned Biden away from running. \nBiden has been \"touching base with good friends\" in early-voting states, CBS News' Nancy Cordes reports, citing a source in the vice president's orbit. He has been talking with people who have worked with him on previous campaigns, should he take the leap and make a third run for the presidency. \nBiden has been making these calls personally, in the last day and a half - \"it's kind of like the last box you check before you jump in,\" the source told Cordes. Though that timing might suggest that his actions are tied to the Democratic debate this week, it is more the impending deadlines in the states for ballot access that have created a sense of urgency around making a decision. \nThe source said there has been some discussion among those close to Biden about delaying an announcement until after Hillary Clinton testifies before the Benghazi committee next Thursday. The thinking behind this is not concern about how Clinton well or poorly her testimony is received, but rather that if Biden were to jump into the race on Monday or Tuesday, his momentum could be impeded by the need for the press coverage to pivot on Thursday and Friday to Clinton's Benghazi testimony.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:57:42.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
