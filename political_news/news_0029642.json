(AP) â€” Snohomish health officials have detailed regulations to go along with a proposed ban on vaping brought forth earlier this year.\nThe Daily Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/1MmJVcJ ) that the proposal outlined by the Snohomish Health District would prohibit the sale of vaping products to minors, provide licenses for businesses that sell vaping products and ban vaping in public similar to how smoking is regulated under state law.\nThe proposal also offers something that vaping retailers had been in strong support of -- allowing the sampling of vaping products by adults in vaping stores.\nThe health district has received hundreds of responses from the public on the proposed ban. They will continue to accept public comment through Oct. 23.\n___\nInformation from: The Daily Herald, http://www.heraldnet.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1MmJVcJ", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:57:05.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
