The discussion here is about whether our voting system confers democratic legitimacy for every aspect of the Govt. of the day's programme, whether or not it featured in a party's manifesto. Absolutely bugger all to do with right vs left. His point I think was that the 25% 'constitutional' problem you highlighted, is nothing of the sort. And again your 'democratic legitimacy' and 'manifesto commitment' is a complete distraction. Governments are not beholden to manifestos to pass legislation apart from being perceived as having originally stated one thing and being seen as doing another. There is no constitutional bar there.The government put the change through the Commons using a mechanism to forestall amendments. Elements within the Lords are minded to scupper the progress by declining to pass, or more precisely passing a fatal motion stating that it isn't approved. Just to iterate Loafer's point: the point of the Lords is to consider bills (refine) and to hold the government to account via debates. What it isn't there to do is to strike down Government business. You've missed the point. The reason for mentioning the 25% is that the OP was claiming that the Govt. is enacting the will of the people in trying to force this legislation through when it simply isn't true. Under our very limited system of democracy no Govt. can make that claim with a straight face - left or right.As to the rest, the Govt is trying to prevent the Lords from exercising its proper role of scrutinising legislation (which will have a significant impact on very large sections of the electorate and which has led to considerable disquiet within the parliamentary Conservative party) by pushing this through as an SI. That is playing fast and loose with our constitutional system and the Lords would be within its rights to strike it down and force the Commons to present this legislation to it in the usual way, so a proper debate can be had.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:14:33.245+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
