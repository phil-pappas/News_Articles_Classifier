Cyrus kicked off the show's season premiere with a song about some of the most memorable parts of the summer. Robin Williams' Widow, Kids Settle Estate Fight Cast members impersonated Walter Palmer, the dentist who killed Cecil the lion , Rachel Dolezal , the woman who said she was black for over 20 years, the donut licked by Ariana Grande , Kim Davis trying to hug a reluctant Pope Francis and of course, pizza rat , during a montage while Cyrus sang a ballad. Most political candidates play themselves on \"SNL,\" often for just a cameo in a sketch or to declare the show's famous tag line, \"Live from New York â€” it's Saturday night!\" Seldom do they go all-out thespian and play a character in a sketch. But Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton appeared on the season opener as a wise bartender named Val serving, ahem, Hillary Clinton played by Kate McKinnon. Set 'em up, and lend an ear to the troubles of a presidential candidate. A photo posted by Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) on Oct 3, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT In the sketch, McKinnon sat with Cecily Strong, who was playing Clinton's long-time aide Huma Abedin, the wife of embattled former Rep. Anthony Weiner. McKinnon starts to share all her quarrels with Val. \"So, Hillary,\" Clinton asked McKinnon, \"what brings you here tonight?\" Behind-the-Scenes with 'The Martian' Cast \"Well, I needed to blow off some steam,\" McKinnon said. \"I've had a hard couple of 22 years.\" Asked what she does for a living, McKinnon says in imitation of Clinton's earnest monotone: \"First, I am a grandmother. Second, I am a human, entrusted with this one green Earth.\" Tom Daley and Dustin Lance Black Are Engaged \"Oh, I get it, you're a politician,\" Clinton responded. When McKinnon asks Val who she is, Clinton deadpanned, \"I'm just an ordinary citizen who believes the Keystone pipeline will destroy the environment.\" Kelly Clarkson Cancels All 2015 Tour Dates \"It took me a long time to get there but yes, I believe that too,\" McKinnon said. The skit poked gentle fun at Clinton's slow opposition to the pipeline, her late-arriving support of gay marriage, and her inability to take a vacation. Notably absent was a crack about her private email server, the source of months of criticism from Republican lawmakers and candidates. 'Peanuts' Turns 65, Schulz Inducted Into Hall of Fame Former \"SNL\" cast member Darrell Hammond also made a surprise cameo playing Bill Clinton. \"Oh my God. They're multiplying!\" Hammon exclaimed at the site of two Hillary's before bolting out the bar door. Titanic's Last Lunch Menu Goes for $88K The two Clinton's closed out the skit by singing Bill Withers' \"Lean on Me\" before Val the bartender disappeared. Strong returned to coax McKinnon from the bar as she recounted her experience with Val the bartender. Strong suggested she may have had too much to drink and imagined everything. McKinnon finds a tan \"business shoe\" on the floor, affirming that Val \"is real.\" The Associated Press contributed to this story .
