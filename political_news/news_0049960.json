Clinton’s operation raised more than $28 million in the third quarter after a grueling fundraising schedule, compared to just over $24 million for the Vermonter — who raised his money largely from online donations, and few in-person fundraising events.\nThe narrow gap illustrates Sanders’ momentum in the third quarter, as he overtook Clinton in polling in both New Hampshire and Iowa. But Clinton’s overall fundraising machine remains formidable: combined with the $47.5 million she raised in the second quarter, her campaign has brought in roughly $75 million in six months. Sanders, by comparison, raised just $15 million in his first few months.\nWhile considerably less than her first haul, Clinton's $28 million figure doesn’t come as a huge surprise to her team. The campaign had expected her numbers to drop during the summer months, while she was dogged by questions about her email practices at the State Department and falling poll numbers in the early-voting states.\n\"We are thrilled and grateful for the support of hundreds of thousands of donors across the country, helping us raise a record $75 million in the first two quarters,\" said Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook in a statement.\nThe campaign's joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee and state parties brought in over $3 million, the campaign said.\nBut Sanders’ own eye-popping haul gives Democrats reason to pause. Much of the party establishment’s argument against Sanders centers on whether he could stand head to head against a well-funded Republican in the general election. His now-demonstrated fundraising prowess hardly erases such concerns, but it calls the assumption into question.\nClinton’s allies also take solace in knowing that she has affiliated super PACs with considerable fundraising power, while Sanders refuses to associate with any such groups. Priorities USA Action, the big-money Clinton group, told POLITICO it had raised $40 million so far in 2015 by mid-August.\nSanders’ campaign said on Wednesday that it had passed the one-million contributor mark in the third quarter, while Clinton’s own operation said that 93 percent of her third-quarter donations came in increments of less than $100.\nThe full disclosures for the period that ended Sept. 30 will be released next week, and filings from both contenders will be scrutinized not only for the details about where the money came from but how the campaign then spent it.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:50:36.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
