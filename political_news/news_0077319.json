Unofficial, incomplete totals reported Thursday night showed Strickland well ahead. \nThis majority-black Mississippi River city hasn't had a white mayor since 1991. Strickland ran on a platform of change to tackle problems of poverty, rising crime and strained city finances. \n\"The people of Memphis spoke to the common hope in all of us, that Memphis can be better and that we must address the great challenges we face with a sense of urgency,\" Strickland said. \nWharton was first elected mayor in 2009.
