Anthony Weiner to resign in 2011 over lewd tweets to a woman who wasn't his wife, Hillary Clinton's State Department,chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, kept her apprised of the latest developments -- including those pertaining to Weiner's wife, close Clinton confidante Huma Abedin. In the week before Weiner resigned, on June 15, 2011, Mills sent 10 emails to Clinton related to the controversy, - including a June 8 POLITICO story about Abedin seeking Clinton's counsel on the unfolding scandal. Emails primarily included news stories of the latest developments with an emphasis on the growing number of calls for Weiner's resignation. Mills sent Clinton the statements released by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Steve Israel calling on Weiner to step down.\nMills largely sent the stories without comment. They included several POLITICO stories and news alerts on the scandal -- including when President Obama called on June 13 for Weiner to step down. They included a note when former Clinton aide Anne Marie Slaughter posted a story urging Weiner not to resign.\nAbedin, a top aide to Clinton, continued to email her with regular news updates related to State Department matters in the days leading up to Weiner's resignation.\nFollow @politico <div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/politico"], "published": "2015-09-30T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:51:52.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
