(Courtesy Ronald Reagan Library) Comments \nFormer Ambassador Alvin P. Adams Jr., whose foreign service took him to Southeast Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and South America, died Saturday in Portland of an apparent heart attack. He was 73. \nAdams helped Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide escape into exile with the Venezuelan government during a military coup in 1991. \n\"He spent his life in danger in one place or another starting at the height of the Vietnam War and in Haiti during a military coup,\" cousin Timothy Phelps said Friday. Alvin P. Adams Jr. - April 2015 Courtesy Timothy Phelps \nHe moved to the Northwest in 2011, after retiring from a 31-year career , much of it with the U.S. Department of State. Nora Stark says she thought her cousin moved to Portland because he enjoyed the city's politically liberal environment. \n\"He had a wonderful sense of humor, and yet when he was in his historical element or political element, he was absolutely sound, focused and knew exactly what he was taking about,\" Stark said. \nAdams started his career in 1968 during the Vietnam War as a district senior adviser for the State Department. Friends and family said on Friday that the former ambassador was known for his wit and love of history. \n\"He likes his views but at the same time he was a good listener on what I had to say on various issues,\" said friend Hiroshi Furusawa, Consul General of Japan in Portland. \"As a human being, I thought he was very considerate. I was always impressed by his knowledge.\" \nHe was special assistant to Secretaries of State Al Haig during the Falklands war and Henry Kissinger during his shuttle diplomacy between Egypt and Israel, Phelps said. \nPresidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton appointed Adams to ambassadorships three times before the age of 50; first to Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, from 1983 to 1985. He later served in Haiti from 1989 to 1992 and in Peru from 1993 to 1996. He also worked as deputy director for counterterrorism in the late 1980s for the state department. \n\"He was a remarkable man who helped initiate elections and the democratic process in Haiti, then led U.S. efforts to assist the government of Peru in defeating the Shining Path terrorist organization and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement,\" said Kent Brokenshire, a deputy Haiti special coordinator for the state department who served with Adams in both countries. \nAdams arrived in Haiti at a time when the United States showed concern for human rights against the Caribbean government, according to Human Rights Watch . \n\"Adams and the Venezuelan ambassador waited with Aristide there for three hours, taunted all the while by hostile soldiers, until a Venezuelan plane arrived to take Aristide into exile,\" wrote Phelps, who is a journalist for the Los Angeles Times, in an email message. \"He was awarded the State Department's Citation with Award for Valor for his work in Haiti.\" \nAdams was born Aug. 29, 1942, in New York and graduated from Yale University in 1964. He earned a law degree from Vanderbilt University in 1967. His grandfather, Nathan L. Miller, was New York governor from 1920-22, and his father, Alvin P. Adams Sr ., was an aviation executive during the industry's early days. \n\"He had a very adventurous father in the airline industry when it was a risky thing to fly. It may be that he got some of that from his dad,\" Phelps said about Adams' love for foreign service. \nAdams is survived by a son, Lex Adams of Orange County, California; his brother, Nathan Adams of Enis, Montana; his sister, Edith Kiggen; and his niece, Elizabeth Kiggen, both of New York City. His marriage to Mai-Anh Adams ended in divorce. His son Tung Thanh Adams was killed in an explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa in 1989. \nFuneral arrangements are pending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:56:03.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
