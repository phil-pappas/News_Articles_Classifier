The group, led by Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, and Joseph I. Lieberman, the former senator from Connecticut, invited presidential candidates from both parties to speak at a daylong “Problem Solver Convention” in Manchester on Monday. Just showing up at the conference was deemed proof of being one of those so-called problem solvers, even if the speeches there did not always focus on big ideas. The event, on live video, drew eight presidential candidates from the field of more than 20 Democrats and Republicans. Founded on the idea that toxic political divisions are ruining the nation, officials with No Labels have long advocated focusing on fixing government instead of partisan politicking. Interactive Graphic: Who’s Winning the Presidential Campaign? “No Labels, that’s right — I’m a believer!” Mr. Trump declared as he took the stage. As he spoke, Mr. Trump tried to embody the motto written on a sign behind him: “Stop fighting, start fixing.” Instead of beginning with his usual stump speech, which has focused on building a wall along the border with Mexico to keep out immigrants, Mr. Trump devoted nearly 15 minutes to describing his acquisition in 1986 of the Wollman Rink, a once-decripit ice skating rink in Central Park that he transformed amid much hoopla. The granularity of reconstruction specifics was occasionally jarring. “Do you know what brine is? It’s water with salt in it,” Mr. Trump told the crowd at one point, straining to discuss some of his building projects in New York City. The rink “is the No. 1 in the world and it does great,” Mr. Trump said. At another point, he explained that getting the City Council and Mayor Edward I. Koch to agree to his overhaul of the rink reflected his ability to work with people on complicated issues. Mr. Trump, whose criticisms of President Obama — and questions about his citizenship — have helped fuel his political rise since 2011, seemed careful not to go into negative mode, at least initially. “I want to be nice to the president,” Mr. Trump insisted, before calling the nation’s unemployment rate a “disaster.” After his speech, he was peppered with questions. When one person asked if he worried that his “divisive” language on the campaign trail was corrosive to the system, he replied, “I know what’s divisive, I know what’s not divisive.” A young man asked about negative comments he had made in the past about South Korea. “Are you from South Korea?” Mr. Trump asked in response. The man said he was from Texas and, later, Colorado. Mr. Trump returned to his signature combativeness as time went on. He criticized candidates for taking money from “ super PACs ” and suggested the United States was being outsmarted by global leaders. And Mr. Trump, a first-time candidate who has been channeling some of the deep frustration within the Republican Party ’s base, ultimately seemed to decide that muting himself made no sense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:51:26.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
