Raghuram (top row centre) with the six farmers who attempted suicide and survived after complex surgeries on Wednesday. (Photo: DC) HYDERABAD: Six farmers from the state who had attempted suicide by consuming pesticide are recuperating at the Osmania General Hospital. Their windpipes were damaged by the poison and due to being put on the ventilator for a long period. The patients had been admitted in early September and they were put on ventilator support to be stabilised. However, prolonged use of ventilator led to a condition called tracheal stenosis wherein the airways narrowed and they had difficulty breathing, sleeping straight at night, were coughing up blood and suffered from severe shortness of breath. Patients get relief from NGO, firm: Giving details about the surgery and condition of the six TS farmers, OGH superintendent Dr C.G. Raghuram said, “The patients came in a very critical condition and had to be put on prolonged ventilator support. The endo tracheal tube, when inserted for a long time in the windpipe, compromises the blood flow to the walls of trachea and causes damage. Once the windpipe is narrowed it requires tracheal stents to keep it wide.” Dr G. Srinivas, professor and head of the cardiothoracic department, added, “Tracheal reconstruction surgery is not covered under Aarogyasri. Hence we were looking for private participation to help us procure the stents so that they got relief. With this condition of breathlessness their ability to work would be hampered.” The cost of stents worked out to `4 lakh and OGH senior doctors, along with the NGO Helping Hands Foundation, got a rural marketing company, M/s Insight Outreach Private, Limited to fund the cost via their corporate social responsibility programme. The doctors then planned a back-to-back model and operated on all the six patients on September 23. They have now completely recovered and are stable. The six patients — B Santosh, 28, from Amrutapur village in Nizamabad district, S. Krishna. 24, from Mahbubnagar district, G. Lalita, 28, from Chevella, Ranga Reddy district, B. Veerana, 20, from Khammam district, Savitiri, 32, P. Narasimha, 28, from Nacharam, Medak district and A. Narayana, 30, from Mahbubnagar district, had suffered financial losses, accumulated debts and social stigma. While financial losses are one of the major causes for suicide attempts, other triggers have been failed love affairs, fights between couples and also inability to meet children’s education expenses.
