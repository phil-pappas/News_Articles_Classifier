A slash on election billboards stating $345 =C&R is contrary to the Local Electoral Act and a breach of the principles under which the AECT election is conducted” said City Vision chair, Robert Gallagher \nIn August 2015 Trust beneficiaries (people on the power account in the AECT district) received a dividend of $345 from the Trust. The AECT dividend is a direct result of the Trust’s 75.4% shareholding in Vector. \n“I’ve written to Earl White, C&R Campaign Chair requesting the removal or modification of the slashes. I am disappointed but not surprised that C&R have responded refusing to take action and are ignoring the electoral officer's guidance on the matter”. \n“It is a serious issue to ignore a request from an electoral officer. It demonstrates the arrogance of the C&R current AECT trustees who are willing to ignore established election principles to maintain control of the Trust.” Says Mr Gallagher \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:09:53.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
