Also Wednesday, the Pennsylvania School Boards Association sued to ensure the money is sent to school districts, insisting that it's illegal to divert the cash to charter schools. \nThe dispute comes amid a four-month-old stalemate that's held up billions in state aid to public schools. \nGov. Tom Wolf's administration says state law requires the diversions since some school districts have cut off monthly payments to charter schools. A spokesman says the administration is still determining the appropriate amounts to divert. \nThe money comes from a tax on slot-machine gambling.
