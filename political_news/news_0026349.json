They’ve wanted badly to treat fans to a home playoff game, the first one at Wrigley Field since 2008.\nTonight’s the night.\n“Within the city itself, it’s been building the entire year,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said Monday before the Cubs hosted the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of their National League Division Series. “I live downtown, so I get to feel it daily, the response from the people, the fans, their support is incredible. So right now to be able to be in this position to be here in the first year with a young group of players and do as well as we’ve done to this point and bring a playoff game back to this cathedral for me I think is spectacular.”\nJake Arrieta (22-6, 1.77 ERA) will pitch for the Cubs against the Cardinals’ Michael Wacha (17-7, 3.38).\n“I know our guys are ready to do it. I think the whole city is ready for this,” Maddon said. “Our entire fan base because it really does extend. When we go to different cities it’s kind of phenomenal to watch the kind of support that we do receive. For all those different reasons, man, I am very excited about this moment, very grateful to be in this situation, but the fan base, the people of Chicago are pretty spectacular, and they do support us well. That’s an understatement.”\nAfter their 6-3 victory in Game 2 in St. Louis, which evened the best-of-five series at one game apiece, players talked excitedly about what the rollicking, boisterous crowds at and around Wrigley will be like Monday. The discussion continued during Sunday’s off day.\n“When the Cubs win a World Series I can’t even believe what it’s going to be like,” rookie third baseman Kris Bryant said.\nThe Cubs, who are 2-1 in the postseason including theri 4-0 victory at Pittsburgh in the NL wild-card game, are 10 victories away from making that happen.\nHere is the Cubs lineup for Monday’s game, which begins at 5:07 p.m.\nDexter Fowler CF\nJorge Soler RF\nKris Bryant 3B\nAnthony Rizzo 1B\nStarlin Castro 2B\nKyle Schwarber LF\nAddison Russell SS\nMiguel Montero C\nJake Arrieta P\nCardinals lineup:\nCarpenter 3B\nPiscotty 1B\nHolliday LF\nHeyward RF\nPeralta SS\nPham CF\nMolina C\nWong 2B\nWacha P", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:48:29.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
