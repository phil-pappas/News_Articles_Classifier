With the Nov. 3 election less than three weeks away, she’s going to start campaigning .\nKind of.\nAshley Wnek, in a recent email to The Dispatch , said “several circumstances have led me to begin campaigning.” Wnek said a few months ago that she had no intention of doing so.\nCity Hall Reporter Lucas Sullivan reports that Franklin County Republican Party officials were surprised at Wnek’s decision to begin campaigning, but they said she still has the party’s support.\nWnek, 31, is on the ballot against Democrat Shannon Hardin, who was appointed to council about a year ago. Hardin must run in a head-to-head race because he filled a term that did not expire until 2017.\nWrite-in candidate Joe Motil also is campaigning for the seat.\nWnek, a law clerk at a Columbus law firm, doesn’t plan to attend forums or debates at the moment, and she’s not fundraising.\n“You won’t see me in a TV commercial,” she said. “I am working to let people know they have an alternative to my opponent, who is currently the subject of an ethics investigation.”\nHardin is one of three council members under investigation by the Ohio Ethics Commission. The commission is looking at a trip the group took to the Big Ten championship game in December with lobbyist John Raphael.\n•    •    •\nJust like a home-remodeling project, the renovation of the historic Columbian Building to house the Fairfield County Municipal Court in downtown Lancaster is taking longer and costing more than originally anticipated.\nQuite a bit more, Fairfield County Reporter Mary Beth Lane tells us.\nThe cost was first estimated at $6.7 million, including $450,000 that the city paid to buy the vacant, neglected 19th-century brick building from a private owner.\nIt ballooned to $9.2 million by last year after officials decided to build a three-story addition to the rear of the building.\nNow the cost is estimated at about $10.2 million, court Administrator Jackie Long said. And the anticipated September occupancy date has been pushed to December.\nThe project has racked up about $1 million in additional expenses because of damage that construction crews found in the building. The issues include damaged floor joists and a wall that had to be rebuilt because the old mortar had turned to powder, Long said.\nThe court is moving from the second floor of City Hall at 104 E. Main St. to the Columbian at 138-140 W. Main St.\nThe clerk of courts, city prosecutor and administrative offices will occupy the building, as well as the probation department and courtrooms and chambers for the two current judges. Officials anticipate asking the state legislature for a third judge within the next two decades, so they added space for a third chamber and courtroom to the renovation.\nThe project is funded through a bond issue that will be repaid with court fees. Judges increased court fees by $10 per case to build up the court’s special-projects fund to pay for the project.\nThe court handles about 22,000 traffic and misdemeanor criminal cases a year.\n•    •    •\nAnd finally, some messy news from Delaware County Reporter Dean Narciso: In a nod to David Letterman’s pastime of dropping things from buildings, the city of Marysville is reviving its Great Pumpkin Drop.\nThe event was canceled last year because of an unexpected ladder-truck recall.\nBut from 1 to 5 p.m. on Nov. 1, the fire department will be dropping pumpkins (less than 40 pounds) from a 100-foot ladder at 16300 County Home Road.\nYes, just to watch them splat.\nYou can bring your own (thwarting splatters in your neighborhood), or purchase one, with proceeds to benefit Marysville Blessings in a Backpack, a nonprofit group that provides needy elementary-school children with reduced-price meals and a backpack of food to take home on weekends.\nlkurtzman@dispatch.com \n@LoriKurtzman \nhzachariah@dispatch.com \n@hollyzachariah", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:13:30.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
