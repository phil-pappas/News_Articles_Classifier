The new targets would see nearly all New Zealanders able to connect and share in the benefits and uses of high speed Internet connectivity. Due to the fast-changing nature of technology, the targets will need to be reviewed on a regular basis. \nThe Government has today announced new national targets for broadband connectivity of: \n• 99% of New Zealanders able to access broadband at peak speeds of at least 50 Mbps (up from 5 Mbps under RBI) \n• The remaining 1% able to access to 10 Mbps (up from dial up or non-existent speeds)InternetNZ Chief Executive Jordan Carter says it’s vital to ensure all New Zealanders are able to share in the economic and social potential of the Internet. \n\"InternetNZ believes in universal access to the Internet – no matter where they are. So we welcome this vision of nation-wide connectivity and reduced digital divides. \n“It is also positive that, given known technology today, the targets should be readily achievable for New Zealand. The flip side is that the targets must remain under regular review – if technology allows a faster achievement of the goal or a higher target, then our sights should be raised higher,” Carter says. \nWhile InternetNZ supports the proposed targets, there are other considerations that will affect how New Zealanders connect and the value that can be derived from this vision. \n\"To truly enable Internet access for all New Zealanders, we need equally ambitious targets to help with basic Internet skills, and to ensure fair and affordable Internet pricing,\" says Carter. \nInternetNZ is also mindful of the practicalities regarding how such targets will be achieved, funded and continually improved. \n\"50 Mbps is a great goal, but we see a Gigabit future for New Zealand – as is already being achieved in other parts of the world. \n\"InternetNZ is committed to working with the Government, industry and Internet users to see this wider set of ambitions achieved. The government’s vision, announced today, is a step in the right direction,\" says Carter. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:44:31.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
