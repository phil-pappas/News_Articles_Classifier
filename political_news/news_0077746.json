We're Notre Dame,\" Kizer said. \"Every game is going to be a big game in its own sense, and obviously this is the first time that I'll really be playing in front of 90,000-plus screaming fans from down South.\"\nWatson is accustomed to those crowds, bringing a 5-0 record at Memorial Stadium into the contest. The preseason pick for Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year and considered a Heisman Trophy contender when the season began, Watson has completed nearly 75 percent of his passes this year for 641 yards and seven touchdowns.\nThis game won't impact Clemson's chances to win the Atlantic Coast Conference title, win or lose. Still, Watson understands the bigger picture out there with Notre Dame.\n\"It's kind of just another steppingstone to what we're capable of, being one of those teams in the playoff,\" Watson said. \"Just embrace the moment and know your priorities and what you really have to focus on.\"\nAdvertisement Kizer got thrown into the lineup with the injury to Fighting Irish starter Malik Zaire, out for the year with a fractured ankle.\nKizer rallied Notre Dame to victory at Virginia on a touchdown pass to Will Fuller with only 12 seconds left. Kizer has continued his strong play since, completing 67.7 percent of his passes for 541 yards and five touchdowns this year.\nOverall, Kizer is guiding a Notre Dame offense that is playing at a breakneck pace.\nThe Irish have scored seven touchdowns of 50 yards or longer this year, the most in a season under coach Brian Kelly. Notre Dame also has rushed for 1,139 yards. The last time the Irish had more through four games was in 1992, when they had 1,264.\nClemson coach Dabo Swinney is duly impressed by Kizer's play, calling him \"an 'ice water in his veins' kind of guy.\"\nBoth quarterbacks will have an added adversary in the field conditions. The fast, clean track these two high-powered offenses expected at Memorial Stadium probably will be a slick field with several inches of rain forecast to fall on Clemson on Friday and Saturday. Hurricane Joaquin is lurking off the South Carolina coast, and the storm's uncertain track could mean an even wetter outlook. Clemson officials are consulting with the National Weather Service to monitor the storm.\nClemson officials met Friday morning and confirmed their ability to operate the game. They feel confident in the planned resources and personnel at Death Valley.\nThe school said in a news release that the field is in good playing condition and power to Memorial Stadium remains unaffected, despite reported outages in other campus areas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:24:51.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
