John King, who has been working as a deputy under secretary at the Education Department since January after several years as New York’s state education chief, earned President Barack Obama’s nod Friday to become the nation’s new top education policy maker. Education Secretary Arne Duncan has said he’ll step down in December.\nTeachers unions were quick to castigate Obama’s choice, the son of teachers who found refuge in schools during a youth marked by family tragedy.\n“No one doubts King’s commitment to children, but his tenure as New York state’s education commissioner created so much polarization in the state with parents and educators alike that even Gov. Andrew Cuomo is finally doing a mea culpa over the obsession with testing,” American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said. “We can only hope that King has learned a thing or two since his tenure in New York.”\nKing will face many of the same battles as Duncan, including on testing, teacher evaluations, a crackdown on for-profit schools, the Common Core, a government takeover of student loans, and teacher preparation. And it’s likely the plan of attack from this rising education star will be too similar to Duncan’s for some.\n\"It's an incredible agenda and I'm proud to carry it forward,” King said at an afternoon press conference alongside Duncan and Obama. “Every child in the U.S., every college student, every disconnected youth, every working parent who just wants a few more credits in order to improve their talent or position at their job deserves that opportunity that I had.”\nFormer Duncan adviser Peter Cunningham said King won’t retreat from the many fights he can expect to face, and he’ll follow Duncan’s modus operandi: “We can disagree, but that doesn't stop us from having a meaningful, productive conversation,” Cunningham said.\nNEA's political arm recommends Clinton endorsement By Kimberly Hefling\nAnd another former Duncan aide, Daren Briscoe, said King's selection to work at the Education Department at a time of conflict in New York was a vote of confidence.\n\"I'm reminded of what made Arne so special in John's even-keeled personality, in not getting caught up in the political fights,\" Briscoe said.\nKing will most certainly continue to push Duncan’s reforms, including higher academic standards and school choice, Cunningham said. At an event POLITICO Magazine hosted last week , King noted how much work the country has to do in the K-12 arena.\n“We've got some systems that are providing excellent opportunities where everyone is going on to college where students are succeeding there, and then we've got other schools that are failing, schools where you have a graduation rate under 50 percent,” he said. “So, I don't think we have the sense of urgency yet that we need about that, although we are making progress there.”\nKing also said the higher education business model needs to shift its priorities from simply enrolling students to making sure they complete a degree.\n“We've got to focus the conversation on are — not only are students starting college but are they getting through to the end, are they succeeding there, and then going on to success in the workforce,” he said.\nAnd King isn’t expected to be officially nominated to run the department, instead just working in that capacity as acting secretary.\nKing came to the Obama administration in January from New York. As education commissioner there, he ushered in the Common Core and new standardized tests, clashing with teachers unions, parents and other groups as a result. He faced criticism from nearly every direction on education reform initiatives including charter schools and teacher evaluations.\nCarl Korn, a spokesman for New York State United Teachers, said the union is urging its more than 600,000 members to call the White House and express their dissatisfaction with King’s appointment.\nIn spring 2013, NYSUT voted “no confidence” in King and called for his resignation.\n“He presided over the disastrous implementation of the Common Core in New York during an era that valued testing, testing and more testing instead of teaching and learning,” Korn said. “He failed to listen to students, parents and educators when they called on him to slow down and get it right … We hope he learns from his missteps in New York state.”\nAnd Michael Mulgrew, president of New York’s United Federation of Teachers, said “King’s obsession with high-stakes testing took education in the wrong direction, and that error was compounded by the state’s disastrous roll out of the Common Core.\"\nMulgrew added, however, “but as a teacher I always hope for improvement.”\nCuomo recently ordered a comprehensive review of the way the Common Core standards have been implemented.\nKing, who is of African American and Puerto Rican descent, is the son of two New York City public school educators. He frequently credits public education in New York with changing his life. His mother died when he was 8. Until his father's death when he was 12, King lived alone with his father, who had Alzheimer's disease. King had to do the laundry, cook and steal money from his father to buy food, he wrote in an essay in the Huffington Post.\nTeachers, he said, \"literally saved my life.\"\nEducation Secretary Duncan stepping down By Caitlin Emma , Allie Grasgreen Ciaramella and Kimberly Hefling\n\"If not for them,\" King wrote. \"I could not have survived this period in my life and I certainly would not be standing here today.\"\nHe was later kicked out of Phillips Academy Andover but went on to Harvard. After graduating, King became a teacher and, at 24, co-founded Roxbury Preparatory Charter School in Boston.\nThe school’s success with minority students from low-income families earned national attention. Its students at times earned higher test scores than their peers in some of Boston’s wealthiest suburbs. The federal Education Department chose the school as one of several case studies for a book on charter schools. King left after five years for Yale Law School, telling the Boston Globe that a law degree would give him access to policy conversations and opportunities that he didn’t have as school leader.\n\"People can be dismissive of educators,\" he said.\nBrett Peiser, the CEO of Uncommon Schools, said King is an avid reader, a student of history, loves sports and coaches his daughter’s softball team. He said King is down-to-earth, brilliant, strategic, and knows instruction well.\n“John learned from his experience in going to school that schools change kids’ lives,” Peiser said. “That is the story that he has always shared with me.”\nAllie Grasgreen Ciaramella contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.boston.com/news/education/k_12/mcas/articles/2004/06/27/closing_the_gap?pg=full", "http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=2aeb5a5ff3a2a04b6092e80d5032ca642c2c0121762930587620553f7749b452"], "published": "2015-10-02T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:48:09.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
