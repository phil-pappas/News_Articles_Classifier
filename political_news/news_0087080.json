Comment kmckiernan@s-t.com Posted Sep. 29, 2015 at 8:00 am Updated Sep 29, 2015 at 8:58 AM Joseph \"Jo Jo\" Fortes Education: New Bedford High School Occupation: MBTA contractor, Keolis Commuter Services Elected offices held: Four-term Ward 4 City Councilor, last elected in 2003 Quotable: “I’m second to none as far as constituent services,” said Fortes. “Whether it is sidewalks, street lights or issues of crime or snow removal. I’m a doer. I will match my record — any two years I served — to anyone. I did work.” NEW BEDFORD — On a recent Wednesday evening, Joseph “Jo Jo” Fortes grabbed a pint of Cape Verdean munchupa from the Central Kitchen and stepped out onto Wing Street. The former city councilor pointed at the Bay Village Housing Development where he grew up. The 59-year-old Pleasant Street resident has spent his life in Ward 4 neighborhoods in the inner city. “I’m in this because I care. My heart is in it,” Fortes said. “I’ve watched Ward 4 in the last eight years and the things that have taken place. I love this city. I want to make sure there is a good future here for my kids and grandkids and others in the city.\" Fortes is seeking election to the Ward 4 council seat, a position he held for four terms and was last was elected to in 2003. He is one of five candidates who will face off in the Oct. 6 preliminary race to make the November ballot, all of whom have either served as Ward 4 councilor, held another elected office or served in city government. Fortes touts himself as the candidate who knows Ward 4, the person who will bring residents’ concerns to the forefront and the one who will get things done. “I’m second to none as far as constituent services,” said Fortes. “Whether it is sidewalks, street lights or issues of crime or snow removal. I’m a doer. I will match my record — any two years I served — to anyone. I did work.” “Jo Jo has been a friend of mine for a long time,” said Bruce Morell, executive director of PACE. “What he did as city councilor is what I see in a ward councilor. It is someone who responds to issues residents of that ward present to him, such as potholes or getting crosswalks. He was always on top of it.” A former board president of PACE and member of Coastline Elderly, Fortes said he focuses on senior and veterans issues. Fortes also says the fishing industry is the “number one monetary piece of the city.” Fortes has had a controversial past while councilor. Between 1998 and 1999, he was accused twice by two different women of assault. Charges of abuse in September 1998 were later dropped. He was acquitted of a charge he assaulted the mother of one of his sons.
