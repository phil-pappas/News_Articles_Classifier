Bobby Jindal's attempt to defund Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, declaring in a court filing that the administration unlawfully canceled the organization's Medicaid contracts.\nU.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles, in a blistering opinion, issued the temporary restraining order late Sunday, which takes effect Monday (Oct. 19) and remains in place for at least two weeks. The decision sets up the possibility of a permanent restraining order, which would bar the Department of Health and Hospitals from stripping Planned Parenthood of funding over the long term.\nIn the ruling, deGravelles found that if the Jindal administration carries out defunding of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast's Medicaid services, 5,200 patients' health care will be unnecessarily disrupted, adding, \"not even DHH can ensure that PPGC's current patients will\" be able to find other providers. DHH had argued that other health care providers could absorb the patients of Planned Parenthood, which does not perform abortions in Louisiana.\nDeGravelles also found that the Jindal administration's latest reason for terminating Planned Parenthood's Medicaid contracts involving a Texas Medicaid fraud settlement \"contradicts DHH's own code.\" The state's administrative rules \"plainly and unambiguously\" exempt Medicaid providers from contract termination if they do not admit liability in the settlement, which is the case with Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, deGravelles wrote.\nThe ruling on a lawsuit first filed in August represents a significant victory for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which has held protests in front of the Governor's Mansion and accused Jindal of being willing to jettison women's health care in favor of pursuing his political goals. The ruling also makes it difficult for Jindal to claim on the presidential campaign trail -- as he has -- that he has defunded Planned Parenthood in Louisiana.\nDeGravelles also addressed the simmering controversy over a series of videos released by an anti-abortion group that has ignited a national debate over defunding Planned Parenthood nationally.\nAlthough deGravelles declined to rule on Planned Parenthood's contention that the Jindal administration was canceling the contracts based on those videos, he left open the possibility of ruling on whether organizations like Planned Parenthood, which are subject to political animosity, are entitled to equal protection under the Constitution.\n\"Based on the record before it, it appears likely that plaintiff (Planned Parenthood) will be able to prove that the attempted terminations against it are motivated and driven, at least in large part, by reasons unrelated to its competence and unique to it,\" deGravelles wrote. \"However, the Court finds it is not necessary and, therefore, it need not at this time rule on plaintiffs' equal protection argument.\"\nThe case deGravelles ruled on was argued twice in federal court: Once Sept. 2 and then again Oct. 16, after the administration withdrew its original termination notice and filed a new one -- the second time for cause. It also replaced DHH Counsel Stephen Russo with former Jindal administration executive counsel Jimmy Faircloth, who regularly represents the administration in major legal cases.\nFaircloth tried to persuade the court Friday (Oct. 16) to dismiss the case on mostly technical grounds.\nFaircloth said that because Planned Parenthood had not pursued an administrative appeal with the state, the court shouldn't intervene to settle a matter that could be decided at the state level. And because the Medicaid contract hadn't yet been canceled, the case wasn't ready to be tried in court.\nDeGravelles was not persuaded. While federal courts have held that they should not become entangled in abstract matters of law when a legal question involves hypotheticals, that was not the case with Planned Parenthood, deGravelles wrote.\n\"The agreements' termination has been threatened repeatedly since August 2015, and defendant (the Jindal administration) has now only swapped no reason for three,\" deGravelles wrote. \"Based on these circumstances and well-settled law, Plaintiffs' (Planned Parenthood and patients') threatened injury is clear.\"\nDeGravelles concluded by pointing out that Louisiana is in a situation similar to court cases challenging Medicaid defunding in Arkansas and Utah. Judges in both cases have ruled in Planned Parenthood's favor.\n\"This court finds it significant that defendant has yet to adequately address either case,\" deGravelles wrote.\nIn the end, deGravelles knocked down every major argument the Jindal administration made during both the Sept. 2 and Oct. 16 hearings.\nBut deGravelles went even further in his decision, raising the question of whether the Jindal administration is in violation of a state law known as the Medical Assistance Program Integrity Law. The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled earlier this year, deGravelles noted, that \"an agency exercising delegated authority is not free to pursue any and all ends\" under MAPIL. The Supreme Court said state agencies could only pursue termination if there were a reason approved by the Legislature.\n\"Based on the evidence it has so far presented and if no actual evidence of a MAPIL-worthy-misdeed is adduced, defendant has likely run afoul of this state's statutory law,\" deGravelles wrote.\nIn a statement, Planned Parenthood Louisiana state director Melissa Flournoy called the ruling \"a victory for the more than 5,200 women and men in Louisiana who rely on Planned Parenthood for care through Medicaid.\"\nMike Reed, a spokesman for the governor's office, issued the following statement: \"Planned Parenthood is engaging in classic misdirection regarding the millions they have repaid in Medicaid fraud and their own admissions in the baby parts trafficking videos. Instead of going through the same administrative review as any other Medicaid provider, they are running to the federal courts and asking for special treatment. We will appeal this decision and continue to fight to ensure Planned Parenthood no longer receives taxpayer funding.\"\n. . . . . . Kevin Litten is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.
