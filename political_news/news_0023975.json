He spoke hours after the Treasury Department announced that the U.S. would bump up against the legal debt ceiling by Nov. 3, and said failing to lift the debt ceiling would put the U.S. at risk of \"not being able to pay our bills.\"\n\"There's no reason for us to engage in that kind of irresponsible brinksmanship; and it's why Republican leaders in Congress need to accept the responsibility that they have to act without drama and delay to raise the debt limit,\" he said.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ An increase in the debt ceiling is a sore point for Republicans, but the last few times the U.S. has been in this situation, the GOP managed to authorize more borrowing \"without a lot of drama,\" he said.\n  Bush and Rubio squabble while Trump runs away with it After Bush announced his fundraising total, his campaign started a spat with Rubio over who did better.\nBy Byron York • 10/16/15 6:19 AM Without raising the debt ceiling, the government would be forced to spend only the money it takes in, and thus would likely have to cut back a range of federal programs.
