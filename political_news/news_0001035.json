Her goal has been to create a platform for the highly motivated network of female professionals to celebrate their achievements, help motivate the next generation of female leaders and inspire the community to reach its potential. Every year, she brings together a critical mass of engaged professional women of all ages to offer insights into career paths and an opportunity to engage and network.\n\"It is exciting to see Iranian -American women find success in all aspects of the US economy. In recognizing this individual success, I could only imagine how powerful of a voice we can have when unified,\" Khosravani says. \"Events such as the upcoming IAWF conference in New York not only allow us to highlight our achievements but will further help to expand and broaden our image.\"\nAmong those present at this year's New York conference are sisters Gisue and Mojgan of the NY-based Hariri & Hariri Architectural firm who are celebrated as one of the top 50 firms in the field of Interior Design and Architecture for 2015; New York fashion designer, Nellie Partow, a 2015 finalist for the prestigious International Woolmark Prize; as well as celebrated journalists, such as the Wall Street Journal's Farnaz Fassihi , Fortune Magazine's Susie Gharib , and one time NY Times bureau chief in Tehran Nazila Fathi.\n\"It is with great pride that we recognize the Iranian American women professionals.
