Where you don't have that clarity, where are you going to take that investment? You'll take it where it has got clarity.\"\nPromoted stories Asked about whether he feared the Scottish Government would be swayed by public opinion, rather than scientific studies it has commissioned, he added: \"They've made the statement that they're working with fact and science.\"\nOn the Scottish Government's timetable for further research before a decision is made, he said he believed there \"could be more pace\" and expressed frustration at the time taken to set out the process.\nMr Pickering added: \"They've said you can do seismic [testing] and core drilling, but actually that's not the path to testing commercial flow and production. Down south, we can see a clear line of science, regulatory support, planning support to advance it along the scientific and appraisal timeline.\n\"Ineos has got to think carefully about where it chooses to pursue early stage investment. [Scotland] could lose that first moment where you can choose to develop the knowhow and experience and equipment that can be taken out beyond Scotland. That once in a generation opportunity is lost.\"\nIn the conference hall, a series of delegates lined up to warn against the environmental and health impacts of fracking. Fergus Ewing, the energy minister, was not present at the event.\nEventually, a move to abandon the motion and force a stronger resolution in its place was defeated by 554 votes to 427.\nShare article Meanwhile, the leadership position was defeated over the issue of land reform, with delegates unhappy at the Scottish Government's proposals which will see tax exemptions for sporting estates scrapped and the creation of a new Scottish Land Commission. Several favoured more radical policies on transparency and buy-outs.\nAlmost 600 delegates voted to shelve the supportive motion and force a re-think, compared to 440 who opposed the move.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-17T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:43:24.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
