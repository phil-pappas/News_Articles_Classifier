New Democrat Matthew Dubé was elected in the Quebec riding of Beloeil-Chambly in the federal election of Oct. 19, 2015. (House of Commons ) \nThe group of four MPs in their twenties had hoped to prove that their elections in 2011 were not one-offs. \nThe \"accidental MPs,\" as they became known, were elected while still enrolled in university and active in campus politics or in the case of Dubé and Freeman with a degree recently in hand. Both obtained their degrees from McGill that same year. \nThe oldest of the group, Dubé, 27, won in the Quebec riding of Beloeil—Chambly by a very tight margin against Liberal candidate Karine Desjardins. But he returns to Ottawa without his three McGill colleagues. \n\"​Tough night but proud of my team. What a privilege,\" he said in a post on Twitter. \n@smsaideman Thanks! Tough night but proud of my team. What a privilege. — @MattDube 'No regrets' \nMylène Freeman, one of several female New Democrats to be defeated Monday night, did not spend too much time lamenting her loss. \nOn Tuesday, her new bio on Twitter said \"A free woman. Former NDP MP & Women's Critic. #strong #feminist #noregrets.\" \n\"Thank you for the support. I gave it my best and came very close. No regrets,\" she said on Tuesday in a post on Twitter. \n@neufast Thank you for the support. I gave it my best and came very close. No regrets. — @MyleneFreeman \nFreeman said she was \"incredibly humbled\" to have been able to work with such a strong group of female caucus colleagues such as Megan Leslie , who lost in the riding of Halifax. \nThe former opposition critic for the status of women did not waste any time criticizing her Liberal opponents. \n\"​It's shameful that, [with] so many ridings swept, the Liberals elected so few women. I am disappointed. But not surprised,\" she said in a post on Twitter. \nIt's shameful that, w so many ridings swept, the Liberals elected so few women. I am disappointed. But not surprised https://t.co/90Xs18Cfby — @MyleneFreeman \nLaurin Liu expressed her gratitude to those who voted for her in the riding of Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, saying it had been an honour to represent them in Ottawa. \nJ’ai été honorée de vous représenter à Ottawa.
