Steve Israel, was forced to sing \"Meet the Mets,\" the team's longtime fight song The Mets advanced to the World Series on Wednesday after defeating the Chicago Cubs Washington (CNN) A day after sitting through the 11-hour-long hearing over Hillary Clinton's role during the Benghazi attack, Rep. Adam Schiff has found something to sing about. The California Democrat, having lost a bet to New York Rep. Steve Israel when the New York Mets topped the Los Angeles Dodgers in last week's playoff series, was forced to sing \"Meet the Mets,\" the team's longtime fight song, on the House floor Friday. After struggling through a few bars, Schiff concluded by saying, \"Mr. Speaker, please tell me my time has expired.\" \"I don't want to give the impression I'm not happy for the Mets. I am, really. I say, thank God the Mets are going to the World Series, and not the Yankees,\" he added. Israel attempted to assuage whatever discomfort or awkwardness Schiff must have felt while warbling through the song.
