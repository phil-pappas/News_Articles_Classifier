She has since found out that it may not be safe for dogs for at least two years since they are so susceptible to 1080 poisoning that they can die from chewing on bones of animals that died that long ago. \nThis may be the first time that a complaint against DOC and Auckland Council has been laid with the police for violations of the Animal Welfare Act but considering the vigour with which they have been investigating the cases of poisoned animals in Hamilton Lulu's family are expecting a successful prosecution since in this case the culprits have even boasted of their exploits. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:47:11.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
