The White House announcement of its plan to help reduce the rise in deaths from drug-related overdoses is another important step to confront this significant public health crisis. Efforts include providing greater access to treatment for opioid dependence, training to properly prescribe opioid medications and increasing availability of naloxone.\nThis announcement aligns with initiatives, such as the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell's plan to revise rules around access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT). According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), there were 2.5 million people (aged 12 or older) who abused or were dependent on painkillers or heroin in 2014. 1\n\"Indivior supports the increased emphasis and growing momentum in recent weeks to help expand patient access to treatment,\" said Indivior Chief Executive Officer Shaun Thaxter . \"These policy initiatives proposed by the federal government are a major step forward in addressing the growing epidemic of opioid dependence and overdose in this country. Increasing access to medication-assisted treatment, (MAT), including buprenorphine, as well as empowering communities to put naloxone directly into the hands of the layperson, trained healthcare personnel or first responders to administer treatment at the scene of an overdose, is an important step, as every second counts. Indivior is committed to working together with stakeholders to fundamentally impact this public health crisis and help improve patient outcomes.\"\nAbout Indivior\nIndivior is a global specialty pharmaceutical company with a 20-year legacy in patient advocacy, health policy and evidence-based best practice models that have helped to advance modern addiction treatment.
