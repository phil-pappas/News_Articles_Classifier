The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee has found evidence of attempted intrusions into Clinton's server in 2013 and 2014, according to a letter sent by panel chairman Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and obtained by the Associated Press.\nThe intrusions were detected by software installed by a Florida-based computer security firm, SECNAP, the AP report said. However, there were at least three months in 2013 when the server may have lacked any threat-detection program, Johnson wrote, according to AP.\nThe last batch of Clinton's emails released by the State Department under a court order in a Freedom of Information Act suit showed that Clinton received at least five emails from hackers linked to Russia. If Clinton opened attachments in the emails, her account and server could have been vulnerable to hacking, although it is unclear if she did so.\nPOLITICO reported last week that there were likely many more so-called phishing messages sent to Clinton during her four years as secretary, but virtually all those messages appear to have been deemed \"personal\" by Clinton's attorneys and deleted, although the FBI is reportedly making progress recovering some or all of the messages from tech firms that worked on Clinton's server.\nThe attempted intrusions reported late Wednesday by AP were more direct attempts from abroad to gain unauthorized access to Clinton's server and did not rely on email messages. However, it is unclear whether they represented a concerted effort by one or more foreign intelligence services to access Clinton's data or if the efforts were part of the far more commonplace hacking on the internet.\nThe story could undermine another part of Clinton's public response to the email controversy. She has repeatedly said there's no indication that her server was hacked.\nAsked in a CNN interview last month whether attackers from Russia or China hacked into her private account, Clinton replied: \"There's no evidence of that.\"\nIn 2011, after Google revealed a wave of hacking attacks against accounts belonging to senior U.S. officials and human rights activists, Clinton's State Department warned employees to avoid using personal email accounts for official business. However, she continued to exclusively use a private account and server for her work.\nClinton has said the practice was permitted by State Department rules and is consistent with similar practices by past secretaries.\nIt's unclear whether Clinton's emails would have been more protected in the State Department's systems. Those systems are high-profile targets for foreign intelligence services and have been repeatedly breached in recent years by intruders believed to be from Russia.\nClinton's private email set-up, first created for her husband President Bill Clinton after he left office, was less well known and may have been a less obvious target. However, experts say sophisticated intelligence services monitoring the secretary of state's communications when she was abroad would have likely been able to pinpoint her server and use that information to attempt to access her system.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:40:35.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
