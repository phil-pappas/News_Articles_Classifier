Madison’s Common Council approved the Judge Doyle Square project around 3 a.m. Wednesday, and if all goes as planned construction could start in December. \nThe new building would have 250,000 square feet of office space for biotech company Exact Sciences. It would also have room for a 216-room hotel for Monona Terrace, 600 public parking spaces and areas for retail shops and private offices. \nThe council approved more than $46 million in public funding for the project, which is the largest subsidy in city history. \nRight before the approval, the mayor and some alders used the congestion that the development will bring to downtown as a selling point. \nCity leaders said if commuters don’t like the congestion, they should take a bus to get downtown. \n“Imagine the excitement of thousands of employees on an existing bus route,” Madison Mayor Paul Soglin said Tuesday night during the meeting. \nSoglin said right now he can’t guarantee if any additional buses will be added to handle those additional passengers, but he said he’d rather have too many people trying to ride the bus than people not coming through the downtown. \nSome alders who voted in favor of the plan joined in the mayor’s excitement over more downtown congestion. \n“Former mayor Dave used to talk about, ‘I want there to be traffic jams downtown.’ That’s good because the opposite is really bad,” Madison Alder Mark Clear said. \nThe city’s traffic study Alder Marsha Rummel referenced says the peak traffic times downtown will look like traffic the city is seeing for the World Dairy Expo this weekend. \n“The quality of life when you live downtown will impact thousands of people,” Rummel said. \n“Let’s push people into the buses,” Soglin said. \nBut bus-rider Stephanie Kroll doesn’t understand that logic. \n“There’s always a balance between growth and having more people around,” Kroll said. \nCity leaders said more people heading to downtown Madison is an exciting trickle-down impact of Judge Doyle Square, which will lead to a more profitable and vibrant downtown. \nCopyright 2015 by Channel 3000 .
