Timing varies based on your unique circumstances.\nBy Cathy Handy Oct. 23, 2015 | 9:30 a.m. EDT + More There is no exact timetable for how frequently each individual needs to visit the doctor . Some people think they need to go multiple times a year, even when they are healthy and feeling well. Some people think they can forgo seeing a doctor until they get really sick.\nThe right amount is probably somewhere in between. The right amount can also be different for different people. So just because your friend’s doctor told her to come back in six months, doesn't mean you also must return to your doctor in six months.\nHere are five things to consider when trying to figure out how frequently you should be seeing a doctor .\n1. When was the last time you went to a doctor? If you can't remember the last time, it's probably been too long. If you were going annually for a while and got a clean bill of health each time, you may be able to start spacing out the visits or skip one.\n2. Has anything changed since the last time you went to a doctor? Maybe you've always gotten a clean bill of health and don't really want to miss work to go to the doctor this year. But there is that one symptom that's been bothering you. That pain in your stomach you've been trying to ignore for months. Or the mole that's larger than when you first noticed it. If there's something that's been bugging you and just doesn't seem to be getting better, it's time to see your doctor. This is not the time to skip that pre-planned visit.\n3. When was the last time the doctor told you to follow up? Was it six months? Or was it two years? If you're not sure, you can always call the doctor’s office and ask. But there are variations on schedules for routine tests based on the results of your last test. For example, starting at age 21, it's recommended that women start getting Pap smears . A Pap smear is a cervical cancer screening test. Based on your age and the results of your previous tests, it's not always necessary to have one done every year. Your doctor may need to see you back sooner than a year or may let you go two or more years without it.\n4. Was there something you wanted to follow up on with the doctor? If your blood pressure was borderline high at the last visit, your doctor may have recommended ways to change your lifestyle to try and bring it back down to normal. Or maybe you were “pre-diabetic” at your last visit, or your weight was in the overweight category and you were going to try and lose a few pounds . If that's the case, it's good to follow up, even if you haven't met your goals for lifestyle change. Maybe the first set of recommendations didn't work for you, or maybe there are other professionals, like nutritionists, you would benefit from seeing. Your doctor can help you navigate these options in the name of improving your health.\n5. Has something in your family medical history changed? Knowing your family history is important; it can impact your risk of certain diseases and the suggested screening tests to undergo. For example, if a parent or other first-degree relative was diagnosed with colon cancer, it may change when you should start being screened for the disease.\nThe timing of how often you need to see a doctor can vary. The final question during every doctor’s visit should be when to come back. It's important to make a schedule but not to forget to pay attention to other things that are happening inside and around you that may change when you should go back.\nTAGS: health patients patient advice doctors cancer For Better", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg4h8%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=How%20Often%20Should%20You%20See%20the%20Doctor%3F%205%20Important%20Considerations&summary=There%27s%20no%20one-size-fits-all%20answer%2C%20but%20these%20guideposts%20can%20help%20you%20decide.%26nbsp%3B&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg4h8%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg4h8%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=How%20Often%20Should%20You%20See%20the%20Doctor%3F%205%20Important%20Considerations", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg4h8%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=How%20Often%20Should%20You%20See%20the%20Doctor%3F%205%20Important%20Considerations", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg4h8%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeg4h8%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:44:54.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
