This followed a petitionaddressed to the Director-General of the CID by three individuals: Dzifa Gonu, Stephen Kwabena Atuk and Fred Adomaku Williams. \nBut even before the police completes its probe, the MP for Menhyia South Dr. Mathew Opoku Prempeh has launched a scathing criticism of the police. \nHe told Joy News’ Evans Mensah that the case against his colleague is simply a political grand plan to annex his seat in the next year’s parliamentary election. \nHe accused the police of being selective in fighting corruption, and working “like an appendage of the NDC”. \nDr. Opoku Prempeh is questioning the locus of the three who petitioned the CID in the affairs of the ADB, asserting that the bank which is supposed to be the victim, has not reported any case to the police. \nDr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh \nHe wondered the kind of voice analysis done by the police to confirm Efutu MP's voice before proceeding to investigate his colleague. The whole issue “smells, walks and talks political interference,” he stressed. \nAccording to the MP, Afenyo-Markin has been a “thorn in the flesh” of many especially those in government. Some forces, he claimed, have decided to orchestrate the allegation to “smear him to lose his seat”. \nHe also alleged that the Efutu MP was harassed by top NDC executives with bribes to drop his landmark case against the Electoral Commission on the District level elections earlier this year. He ignored them and went ahead to secure victory at the Supreme Court. \nBut the National Organiser of the NDC, Kofi Adams has denied the party’s involvement in the allegation. \nKofi Adams \nThe NDC however “supports any fight by any Ghanaian against any act of corruption”, he told Joy News, reiterating description of President Mahama likening corruption to “mass murder”. \nThe position of Dr. Opoku Prempeh, he said, is contrary to what NPP flagbearer has been preaching. He said Nana Akufo-Addo’s support for whistle blowers to fight corruption shows the NPP “speak with one voice and do the other”. \nBut the Executive Director of the anti-corruption group, Ghana Integrity Initiative is not impressed by the political twist being put to the allegation. \nVitus Azeem said politicization of corruption makes it difficult to bring any investigations into the aged-old canker to a logical conclusion. \nIrrespective of where the allegation is coming from, it should be investigated, he said and asked that the matter is considered purely as an individual affair devoid of any politics. \nMeanwhile Joy News’ Manasseh Azuri Awuni who has been following the development said the audio tape that had someone sounding like Afenyo-Marking demanding money to play “gymnastic” with the ABD court case was recorded by an NPP parliamentary candidate in the Western Region. \nHe would however not name the person for now. \nBut Vitus Azeem believes alleged action of the candidate is a “feather in the cap\" of anti-corruption fighters that people are able to record these things and bring them to the public light”.
