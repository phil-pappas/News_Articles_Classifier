The group also urges a moratorium on future runway work.\nResidents east and west of the airport have been deluged with new jet noise ever since O’Hare dramatically changed its flight paths in October 2013. Last year O’Hare racked up the most jet noise complaints among the nation’s 10 busiest airports — by a landslide, a Chicago Sun-Times/Better Government Association investigation found.\nThe switch in flight paths is part of an ongoing O’Hare shift from dependence on mostly diagonal runways aimed at suburbs north and south of airport to what the city says is a more efficient network of mostly parallel east-west runways.\nMulcrone also pointed to a new software tool outlined Friday by Federal Aviation Administration officials that helps air traffic controllers avoid traffic safety issues when a certain diagonal runway — 14R/32L — is used at O’Hare. She questioned why the diagonal had to be decommissioned in 2020 if its safety concerns had now been addressed.\nHowever, FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro said the new tool merely allows the FAA to “add a small number of flights in a safe way.” City aviation officials insist the diagonal, if kept, would create more safety problems with another runway and runway extension planned on the north end of the airfield by 2021 and would interfere with a planned western access route into O’Hare.\nA cargo plane is shown taking off from O’Hare’s new runway 10C-28C in October 2013. | Brian O’Mahoney/For Sun-Times Media", "external_links": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/NewOhareRunway-1024x567.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/NewOhareRunway.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:55:51.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
