He was a leading member of ISIS's so-called CyberCaliphate, which has carried out mostly nuisance hacks on military and other government websites in the U.S., France and other countries.\nMalaysian authorities agreed to extradite the hacker, a Kosovo native who was living in Malaysia, to the U.S. where he is expected to face U.S. cybercrime charges.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:46:00.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
