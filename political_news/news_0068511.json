The one downside is burn rate. Clinton spent just under $25.8 million, almost as much as her nearest Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders raised during the quarter. Nevertheless, her campaign's reported cash on hand is up.\nThe Clinton campaign has touted its frugality, but $8.5 million of its total spending went to salaries and associated taxes. She spent $3.4 million on television advertising, $2.6 million on online ads and $2.5 million for digital marketing. The campaign has also shelled out over $1 million for polls.\nWhile Clinton's numbers are undeniably impressive, Sanders isn't far behind her. He raised $26.2 million, spent $11.3 million and finished the quarter with $27.1 million in cash on hand. Sanders has relied primarily on small donations and reportedly fewer than 300 of his contributors have given the maximum amount under the law.\n  Bush and Rubio squabble while Trump runs away with it After Bush announced his fundraising total, his campaign started a spat with Rubio over who did better.\nBy Byron York • 10/16/15 6:19 AM Top Story RNC chair: Republicans are 'cooked' if defeated in 2016 The Republican Party has become a \"a midterm party\" that struggles with the presidential elections.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/16/15 12:01 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:32:47.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
