The utility companies were clearly surprised when the Public Service Commission rejected their merger proposal in August, and they were right to be: Their original proposal promised significant benefits for D.C. residents and businesses, and every other regulatory body in the country that had reviewed the merger had approved it.\nThe merger has its detractors. But the fact is, they are a very small — though very vocal — minority. Average D.C. residents stand only to gain in terms of more reliable electric service, millions of dollars for direct customer benefits and a utility with the financial backing to make sustainable investments in our communities and local economy. If the merger does not occur, these benefits disappear.\nArrington Dixon , Washington\nThe writer is a former chairman of the D.C. Council.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:33:20.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
