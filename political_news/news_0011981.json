As the rains continued over the weekend, they also claimed a political victim: the region's newly elected governor.\nHany el-Missiry’s resignation, which comes less than a year after he took charge of Egypt's second-largest city, was announced Sunday by a government spokesman amid widespread criticism over the city’s response to the deluge.\n“We are drowning in negligence,” read the front-page headline of the Al-Youm Al-Sabaa daily newspaper. “The government drowns in Alexandria,” read the banner headline at Al-Shorouk, another daily.\nAlexandria’s frail infrastructure, particularly its drainage systems, likely aggravated the flooding and resulted in the deaths of five people who were electrocuted by a fallen power cable, according to local media. The two-day, 10-inch total was five times the amount of rain the city normally experiences in all of October.\nAside from ageing infrastructure, others pointed to climate change as a major culprit. El-Missiry himself called the flooding an \"environmental catastrophe\" shortly before resigning on Sunday.\nSuch flooding could become the norm in Alexandria, the World Bank has warned . It put Alexandria among the five cities across the world most at risk of flooding by 2050 as a result of climate change. The other cities the World Bank lists include Barranquilla, Colombia; Naples, Italy; Sapporo, Japan; and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic .\nLow-lying Alexandria is also vulnerable to increased salinization, or saltwater intrusions on agricultural lands and freshwater resources, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nThe city’s beaches and waterfront — both major tourism draws and vital parts of Alexandria's conomy — will be heavily affected by flooding because most of the hotels, camps and youth hostels are located close to the shoreline, the IPCC said.\nAlexandria’s beaches would be lost with a half-meter (20-inch) rise in sea level, the IPCC has warned, and the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change expects that half-meter rise on Egypt’s coastline by the end of the century. Just a quarter-meter rise in sea level would displace 60 percent of Alexandria’s population of 4 million, and a half-meter rise would force out millions more in the fertile Nile Delta, which produces half of Egypt’s crops and is vulnerable to saltwater intrusion as sea levels rise, according to the IPCC.\nDespite these climate-related challenges, Egypt has yet to officially announce its climate plan for the U.N. climate conference set to be held in Paris in December. World leaders will gather in the French capital to hammer out a global treaty aimed at averting the worst effects of climate change — including flooding and sea level rises already affecting Alexandria and other low-lying coastal areas .\nEgypt in July formed the National Council on Climate Change , led by the Ministry of Environment, to draft and update its strategy for climate change and sustainable development. However, few concrete actions for reducing the emissions that lead to global-warming, or for transitioning to renewable energy sources, have been officially announced.\nEgypt’s Environment Minister Khaled Fahmy, during informal September climate talks in New York City during the 70th session of the U.N. General Assembly, stressed the importance of addressing a warming climate.\n“Climate change is among the top issues to be discussed during the upcoming sideline meetings, in preparation for the upcoming climate change summit in Paris this December,” Fahmy told reporters in New York .\nWith wire services and additional reporting by Richard Angwin.", "external_links": ["http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/08/19/coastal-cities-at-highest-risk-floods", "http://egyptianstreets.com/2015/07/17/egypt-to-form-national-climate-change-council/", "https://unfccc.int/files/adaptation/application/pdf/nwa_1.2_development_planning_and_climate_change_in_egypt.pdf", "http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/09/25/climate-change-among-top-issues-to-be-discussed-during-un-weekfahmy/"], "published": "2015-10-26T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:02:26.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
