While the NDA comprises of small players such as Rashtriya Lok Samta Party ( RLSP ), Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM), Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) , led by the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) from the front, the Mahagathbandhan consists of the Janata Dal (United) ( JD(U) , the Rashtriya Janata Dal ( RJD ) and the Congress. \nBut on the ground, the battle was limited to two giants, who have become the face of the respective alliances–Narendra Modi representing the NDA and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who has been touted as the face of a developing Bihar for the last decade. \nQuoting figures provided by the EC, a total of electorates, including 72,37,253 men, 63,17,602 women and 405 of third gender, are eligible to exercise their right to vote. \nIn the naxal affected areas, polling came to an end at 3 pm. The polling registered at more than 56%, while Sikandra (SC) recorded 55%, Jamui 59.5%, Jhajha 55.1% and 58% in Chakai area. \nAlso a drone has been used for the first time in the elections. It has been put into use by the Central Reserve Police Force for aerial surveillance of the troubled Jamui area. \nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a rally in Bhabua on 12 October. Though the JD(U) and the RJD met Election Commission officials on 11 October seeking a ban on the live telecast on the PM’s rallies when the elections are underway, but the EC gave a go-ahead to the rally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:38:11.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
