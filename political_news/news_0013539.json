Some parents could be as much as $165 better off per week as a result of this change. \n\"It was a pleasure to talk through these supports with teen parents and providers today, and to discuss how we can improve outcomes for hard to reach teen parents and their children.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:27:06.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
