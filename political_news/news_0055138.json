Again. Indeed, the opening statements of Reps. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman and ranking member of the committee, respectively, both focused on intra-committee politics. Gowdy tried to argue why, although there have been seven other investigations into Benghazi, his is still necessary. Cummings called for Congress to disband the committee.\"Madam Secretary, not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your email,\" Gowdy said. \"We signed up to investigate and therefore honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us.\"\"It is time now for the Republicans to end this taxpayer-funded fishing expedition,\" Cummings said. \"We need to come together and shift from politics to policy. That's what the American people want, shifting from politics to policy.\" Clinton was the only one who actually spent her entire time discussing the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. And yet, only the democrats actually allowed Clinton to review what the procedures were and how they could be improved. Only the democrats noted the Congress responsibility in Benghazi for allowing contract employees to be purchased at the bare minimum cost and defunding security for embassies. It was a loss for the teabaggers; Koch brothers failed again.
