The Watergate Hotel , scheduled to launch late fall, next week throws a cocktail party in honor of Michael Santoro , who will be the executive chef for the upscale hotel, overseeing all culinary components. Santoro was chef de cuisine at Park Hyatt’s Blue Duck Tavern until 2011, when he moved to open restaurants in Philadelphia. Next Thursday, Nancy Conrad , widow of astronaut Pete Conrad, will open the doors of her glamorous Watergate apartment for a \"welcome back to Washington\" fete for 50 to 60 invited guests, who will have a chance to meet Santoro and sample some of his food.\nThe Watergate Hotel has been staffing up. Management lured another Park Hyatt staffer earlier this year when Michael Deltette was brought on as director of catering and events. Deltette is a master planner of over-the-top Washington weddings and private parties, and it was a huge coup for the hotel to lock him down. Word is Deltette has already lined up multiple large-scale events for his new property, which has a busy calendar for spring and summer; an outdoor wedding ceremony space on the rooftop overlooking the Potomac has been especially popular, according to a hotel insider.\nA request for comment from a Trump International Hotels representative regarding the status of the Washington property’s vacant restaurant space was not returned.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:26:34.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
