The Florida Minute segments will be hosted by Ed Dean, SSN senior editor, and Kevin Derby, SSN senior political reporter. Released twice daily (9 a.m. and 2 p.m.), Florida Minute will feature up-to-minute news to keep Floridians “in the know” throughout their day. Each 60-second news break will cover important statewide politics and public issues such as Common Core and education, medical marijuana, immigration, All Aboard Florida, taxes, the budget and elections.\n“Everybody focuses on national issues,” Dean said. “But the most important politics are state and local. The major issues—taxes, education, unions, environmental issues—are happening in our backyard. Not everything happens in D.C. A lot of it takes place in Tallahassee and on the local level.”\nAt launch, Florida Minute will be carried on the iHeartRadio Network and statewide in Orlando, Daytona, Titusville, Cocoa Beach, Melbourne, Palm Bay, Vero Beach and Fort Pierce.\n“We are excited to expand our brand and footprint to bring our fresh political coverage to radio listeners,” said SSN Executive Editor Nancy Smith. “With Florida Minute, our audience will receive relevant, statewide news that matters.”\nFor more information, please call Megan Lambert at (850) 297-2810 or visit http://www.sunshinestatenews.com .\nAbout Sunshine State News\nSunshine State News is the premier political news organization in Florida.
