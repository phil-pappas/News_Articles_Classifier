Comment Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 11:15 PM By Alex KuffnerJournal Staff Writer Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 11:15 PM PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Rhode Islanders accustomed to paying more for power when the weather cools will experience the opposite this January, when utility National Grid expects the electric bill for the typical residential customer to drop by as much as 8 percent. That may represent some relief for consumers, but the rate change that was filed this week with the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission only reflects, in part, a small decrease in generation costs in New England and is by no means a sign that the region has found an overriding solution to the price spikes that have occurred in recent winters. It is instead largely the result of a rejiggering of rate cycles by Rhode Island regulators to better reflect the underlying wholesale electric costs for the state — and the region as a whole — as consumers pay more in the winter months because of increased demand for natural gas, the main fuel for both electric power and heating. Indeed, National Grid officials emphasized that a decrease like this is likely a one-off and that most of the conditions that have led to the roller coaster ride of pricing — namely, constraints on the system of pipelines that supply gas to the region — are still firmly in place. “National Grid realizes that while this modest price reduction can be seen as good news, it may be the exception to the winter pricing rule,” said Timothy F. Horan, president of National Grid in Rhode Island. “Our region will continue to see price volatility as long as natural gas pipeline constraints during the winter months drive up the cost of electricity for that time of year.” Under National Grid’s proposal, the standard offer rate for residential users would drop from 10.4 cents a kilowatt hour to 8.9 cents, a 14.4-percent decrease. The cost of power makes up about half the Rhode Island electric bill. The other half covers the cost of delivering that power. Because those delivery costs are not changing, the net effect on the typical bill is a 7.9-percent drop. (That may change slightly based on other costs.) In dollars and cents, the rate change translates to a bill decrease for the customer that uses 500 kilowatt hours a month of $7.83, from $99.15 to $91.32. The change in rates comes as National Grid, as directed by the PUC, transitions to a new billing cycle. Under the current structure, National Grid’s two billing periods are January through June and July through December. Those periods will change to October through March and April through September. The new billing cycle will start next October, which means the next billing period will continue from January through September. That nine-month period includes the warmest summer months, when heating needs and gas use plummet and, as a result, wholesale electric prices also tend to subside. That is part of the explanation for why the proposed standard offer rate for the overall period is low. Page 2 of 2 - “Including pricing from warmer months, helps to offset the higher electricity supply prices that are typical of the colder winter months,” according to National Grid. Conversely, if the higher prices of colder months are included in any given rate period, the overall rate is generally higher. And that’s what happened this year after the PUC decided to spread out the costs of last winter’s large price spike over the entire 12 months. Instead of being hit with a 26-percent increase in the price of power for a six-month period, ratepayers absorbed a 14.3-percent increase over the full year. So current electric rates are higher than they would otherwise be, which also helps explain the expected drop in January. Why did regulators amend the pricing periods? Alan Nault, rate analyst for the PUC, said the three-member commission made the change at a meeting last July so that consumers would get a better sense of the differences in rates from the winter to the summer. The commissioners also had the winter rate period start in October to give users plenty of time if they want to switch to another electric supplier. But won’t the change increase the big swings between rates in the colder months and those in the summer months? For example, Massachusetts, which has a similar schedule, saw a 37-percent increase last winter, a 27-percent drop in May and will see a 21-percent increase starting in November. “There may be a little bit more volatility, but it goes toward giving customers a price signal,” said Nault. He also made another point in relation to the new rates proposed for January. Futures prices have eased since last winter, he said, and that has also contributed to the drop. In the first three months of this year, National Grid paid 18 cents a kilowatt hour, 17 cents and 10 cents. For the same period next year, the prices are expected to be 14 cents, 14 cents and 9 cents, said Nault. Michael LaFlamme, vice president of regulation and pricing for National Grid, acknowledged that prices appear to be easing going into this winter, but, he said, they are still high. Looking forward, LaFlamme warned consumers not to expect another reduction the next time National Grid reassesses its rates this time next year. “The pricing reduction is a one-time phenomenon only,” he said. “The unfortunate reality here is I think we’re going to be looking at a substantial increase in October.” -akuffner@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:50:14.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
