John Kasich won the support of former New Hampshire Sen. Gordon Humphrey on Friday, adding to an already strong group of supporters from the Granite State.\nHumphrey, who left the Senate in 1990, had already voiced his admiration for Kasich earlier in the summer. But the formal endorsement helps Kasich at a time that he has been slipping in New Hampshire polls.\n\"I'm extending more than just my endorsement. I'm extending my trust,\" Humphrey said. \"I think that's the key word here: I trust John Kasich.\"\nThe Kasich campaign has placed their hopes on doing well in New Hampshire, but recently began pushing out to Iowa in the wake of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's sudden drop from the campaign last month.\nFormer New Hampshire Sen. John Sununu has played a key role as one of Kasich's top advisers, helping line up key supporters in New Hampshire. Kasich picked up veteran New Hampshire Republican operative Tom Rath in August and organizer Ruth Griffin last month.\nRELATED: John Kasich resorts to hugs in New Hampshire\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151002110307-john-kasich-gordon-humphrey-composite-medium-plus-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151002110307-john-kasich-gordon-humphrey-composite-small-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151002110307-john-kasich-gordon-humphrey-composite-full-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151002110307-john-kasich-gordon-humphrey-composite-super-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151002110307-john-kasich-gordon-humphrey-composite-small-11.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151002110307-john-kasich-gordon-humphrey-composite-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151002110307-john-kasich-gordon-humphrey-composite-large-169.jpg", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:49:39.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
