He was favored by just 2.4 percent of Republicans in late September, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nPaul ranked fifth in fund-raising among the Republican candidates for the previous quarter, when his campaign committee and three allied Super PACs raised a combined $13 million. That was far behind top Republican fund-raiser Jeb Bush, whose campaign and Super PAC brought in a combined $114.6 million through June.\nSuper PACs, which can accept unlimited contributions from individuals and corporations but cannot coordinate with the campaign, do not have to report on their fund-raising again until the end of January.\nOne of Paul's Super PACs made headlines this summer when two of its principals were charged with hiding payments to an Iowa state senator in exchange for his endorsement of Paul's father, Ron, during the 2012 presidential election.\n(Reporting by Emily Stephenson and Grant Smith; Editing by Sandra Maler and James Dalgleish )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:10:05.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
