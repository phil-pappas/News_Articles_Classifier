(AP Photo/Jacques Brinon)\nAssociated Press Oct. 5, 2015 | 7:46 a.m. EDT + More By LORI HINNANT, Associated Press\nPARIS (AP) â€” Union activists protesting proposed layoffs at Air France stormed the headquarters during a meeting about the job cuts Monday, zeroing in on two managers who had their shirts torn from their bodies, scaled a fence and fled under police protection.\nAn Associated Press photographer saw about a hundred activists rush the building after breaking through a gate. Shortly afterward two human resources managers fled, one bare-chested and the other with his shirt and suit jacked shredded.\nAlexandre de Juniac, the CEO of Air France-KLM, had announced Friday the company would have to cut jobs after failing to reach an agreement with pilots. French media, citing the unions, on Monday reported a proposal to slash 2,900 jobs.\nDe Juniac said the company was being squeezed by low-cost airlines in Europe and Gulf carriers for long-haul flights. Monday's meeting was intended to detail the cuts, which he told Europe 1 radio would be \"significant.\"\nAmong those at Monday's protest was Yves Porte, an activist who represents cargo workers.\n\"At a certain moment, the Gulf companies, who have low fuel prices and who receive government subsidies, compete with us. It's impossible, we are not on a level playing field,\" he said.\nAir France said it would file a complaint for aggravated assault.\nAlthough Monday's scuffle was unusually violent, labor relations in France are commonly testy, with unions sometimes even resorting to \"boss-napping\" to make a point.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
