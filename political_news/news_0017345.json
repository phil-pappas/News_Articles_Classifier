Media Galleries Walker suspends campaign for president \nInstead, the former Arkansas governor said, liberals are delusional and lack humor. \nHuckabee was tweeting throughout Tuesday's Democratic debate, and raised eyebrows with a joke he made about Bernie Sanders' plans to increase government spending. \n\"I trust @BernieSanders with my tax dollars like I trust a North Korean chef with my labrador! #DemDebate,\" he tweeted. \nBy midday Wednesday, the post had been retweeted more than 7,000 times. \nBut the tweet was widely criticized on social media, with some calling the joke racist. \n\"Mike Huckabee Got Pretty Racist While Live-Tweeting The Dem Debate,\" said Black Lives Matter activist Johnetta \"Netta\" Elzie. \nFamily Guy writer Damien Fahey tweeted, \"Can you believe Mike Huckabee's racist tweet? Who does he think he is? The Republican front runner?\" \nThe Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund also slammed the remark. \n\"Was Huckabee thinking about 25th anniv of Jessica Hagedorn's novel Dogeaters? Nope, that was a racist tweet, plain and simple,\" the group tweeted. \nIn an email, Huckabee's campaign said liberals are focused on minor issues and not facts. \n\"Poor liberals, no sense of humor and no sense of reality,\" his campaign said in an email. \"Leave it to liberals to ignore injustices and atrocities of a totalitarian nation on human beings and put more importance on a nations diet which includes grass clippings and canines.
