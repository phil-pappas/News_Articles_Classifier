Still, he has come under increased criticism from GOP rivals such as Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for missing hearings and Senate votes while making political appearances and raising money for his campaign.\nPlanned Parenthood is a popular target for social conservatives because of the abortion services it provides. But the clamor to end federal funding has become louder among Republicans since the release of an undercover video that includes images of body parts from aborted fetuses.\nRubio missed a procedural vote to curtail debate on the funding, and skipped the final vote later that week on financing government expenditures, which included Planned Parenthood.\nWithout naming Rubio, Cruz is using the September Senate action on Planned Parenthood, to build up his own support among the Republican Party's evangelical base, which he declared Monday was vital to his campaign. However, Rubio was the lone senator and top tier presidential candidate not present.\nThe exit of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker from the race has freed his supporters to consider Cruz. And Walker was working to appeal to Iowa's religious conservatives.\n\"I think if we're going to win in 2016, the central question is how do you bring back to the polls, the millions of conservatives who are staying home,\" Cruz told more than 50 people crowded into a small meeting room at a Pizza Ranch restaurant in Rockwell City.\n\"I'm in the best position, based on a record of fighting for conservative principles, over and over and over again, to mobilize and energize and inspire those conservatives to come out,\" he added.\nCruz's Iowa campaign director Bryan English is a former minister, and has begun an effort to recruit at least one clerical chairman from each of Iowa's 99 counties. English said Monday the campaign is about halfway to its goal. Ministers are powerful validators in the Republican caucuses, given their regular contact with Iowa's religious conservatives.\nCruz was on the first leg of a three-day trip through Iowa, and was in the conservative northwest part of the state Monday. Iowa holds the leadoff 2016 presidential caucuses in fewer than four months.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:19:37.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
