Anti-abortion activists rally on the steps of the Texas Capitol in Austin, Texas, to defund Planned Parenthood.\nBy Susan Milligan Oct. 19, 2015 | 6:11 p.m. EDT + More Amid a lack of action in Congress, foes of Planned Parenthood are taking their fight to the states, hoping to starve the family planning services provider into financial ruin and forcing it to shut down clinics.\nTexas on Monday became the sixth state to attempt to ban Medicaid funds from being used to reimburse reproductive health care at the embattled group's clinics. Planned Parenthood has been under fire since an anti-abortion group publicized furtive videos it alleges are evidence the health services provider illegally sells fetal tissue for profit – a charge Planned Parenthood denies.\nBut with congressional Republicans unable to impose a national policy defunding Planned Parenthood , governors are taking up the fight and using the controversy to deprive the group of Medicaid patients. In a letter to Planned Parenthood's Texas affiliates, state health officials said the clinics were \"liable, directly or by affiliation, for a series of serious Medicaid program violations\" and were \"no longer capable of performing medical services in a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical manner.\"\nRELATED\nThe Never-Ending Planned Parenthood, Abortion Fight The Texas order came the same day a federal judge in Louisiana temporarily blocked efforts by Gov. Bobby Jindal , a Republican presidential candidate, to cut off funds to Planned Parenthood clinics in the Bayou State. Courts have already shut down efforts to deny Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood in Indiana and Arizona, and the family planning provider has filed lawsuits to halt funding cutoffs in Alabama , Arkansas and Utah.\nPlanned Parenthood is banned by federal law from using government money to subsidize nearly all abortions, which the organization says comprise 3 percent of its services at 700-plus facilities nationwide. The group has been under attack for many years, notes Elizabeth Nash, a state policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights and research organization that supports abortion access. But the videos, which disturbed even some pro-abortion rights lawmakers, have given foes a new argument, and a new legal avenue.\n\"It's frustrating to a lot of taxpayers,\" says Emily Horne, a legislative associate for anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life. \"They feel they're subsidizing an industry they morally disagree with.\" The federal government indeed has more say over the use of Medicaid funds, Horne notes, but since Washington \"is pretty gridlocked right now,\" foes of Planned Parenthood and abortion are looking to state governments to get their way.\nFederal case law has upheld a woman's right to an abortion, but has also given states the right to limit it . Controls in place and enacted by states include mandated waiting periods, physician involvement, and counseling, as well as bans on the procedure after fetal viability and provisions allowing institutions and health care practitioners to refuse to participate in abortions.\n[ READ: Defunding Planned Parenthood: A Moral Issue, not a Legal One ]\nAside from seeking to ban Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood, state officials have tried to cut off other funding – including for abstinence counseling – from the group, Nash notes. Texas abandoned a proposal to expand family planning services to people making 250 percent of the poverty level, Nash says, after state officials learned they could not legally cut Planned Parenthood out of the program.\nDawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the Texas action \"a national scandal,\" based on a reading of the videos that she called \"completely false.\n\"It is completely outrageous that Texas officials are using these thoroughly discredited, fraudulent videos to cut women off from preventive health care, including cancer screenings, HIV testing, and birth control,\" Laguens said in a statement.\nRELATED\nPlanned Parenthood Head Cecile Richards Hit for High Salary on Capitol Hill Jindal plans to appeal the Louisiana ruling, which forces the state to continue to cover Medicaid patients at Planned Parenthood clinics for 14 more days while the overall case proceeds. \"Instead of going through the same administrative review as any other Medicaid provider, they are running to the federal courts and asking for special treatment,\" Jindal spokesman Mike Reed says in an email, accusing Planned Parenthood of \"baby parts trafficking.\"\nBut states do not have as much leeway on Medicaid reimbursements as they do on abortion itself, says Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University. Under rules enforced by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"there have to be reasonable standards\" for health providers, she says. \"They can't pick and choose.\"\nA state can no more exclude a provider because it uses other funds to do abortions than it can deny a medical center coverage for a child's broken leg because the facility also does cosmetic surgery not covered by Medicaid, Rosenbaum explains.\nNash says she is confident the courts will rule in Planned Parenthood's favor, and the Obama administration – through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – has clearly warned states they will be in violation of federal law if they do not pay for Medicaid patients at Planned Parenthood.\nBut the next administration, Nash notes, might not be so aggressive.\nTAGS: abortion Medicaid Texas Louisiana Jindal, Bobby", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecqy8%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Planned%20Parenthood%20Faces%20Funding%20Battle%20in%20the%20States", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecqy8%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecqy8%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Planned%20Parenthood%20Faces%20Funding%20Battle%20in%20the%20States", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecqy8%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecqy8%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecqy8%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Planned%20Parenthood%20Faces%20Funding%20Battle%20in%20the%20States&summary=With%20a%20federal%20funding%20ban%20stymied%20in%20Congress%2C%20governors%20are%20taking%20up%20the%20cause.&source=U.%20S.%20News"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:12:18.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
