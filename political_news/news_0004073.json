The Act, led by the White House, is a new commitment to climate action and aims to rally business, government, academic, technical and scientific communities to tackle climate change in the US and on a global scale.\nMars' pledge includes commitments to achieve zero waste to landfill across all its sites by 2015 and eliminate 100% of GHG emissions from across its global operations by 2040.\nThe pledge is the latest in a series of public commitments from Mars ahead of the COP21 Paris climate negotiations this December. It follows the publication of an open letter last month, in collaboration with Ceres and ten leading Food & Beverage companies, which called on world leaders to meaningfully address the reality of climate change and to reach sound agreement that can effect real change.\nSaid Barry Parkin , Mars' Chief Sustainability Officer : \"Tackling climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing our global community. It is simply not an option to stand back and do nothing. We are proud to join the many other businesses pledging their support to the American Business Act on Climate today. At Mars, we believe that our growth is not only linked to, but dependent on, the protection of the world that we all call home.\"\nMars' pledge in full:\nMars, Incorporated has established a set of ambitious, science-based goals designed to drive our global operations toward being Sustainable in a Generation (SIG). Under these SIG goals, and as part of our broader sustainability programs, Mars pledges to:\nReduce our dependence on fossil fuels and eliminate 100% of GHG emissions from our operations by 2040. We are on track to reduce our 2015 GHG emissions by 25% (from a 2007 baseline); Pursue renewable energy projects around the world that are modeled after the 118-turbine, 200mw wind farm we brought online in 2015 and which now provides the equivalent of 12% of our global energy requirements, 100% of our U.S. power needs, and has eliminated 24% of our global GHG; Achieve zero waste to landfill across all of our facilities globally by the end of 2015; Build all of our new sites globally to the LEED Gold Standard; Continue to build on our current deforestation policy, which covers the key raw materials in our supply chain (including palm oil, beef, pulp, paper and soy), and source only from producers and suppliers who agree to our strict sourcing standards; Use our voice, our expertise and our position as a leading global company to identify and advance innovative carbon reduction measures within the agriculture and food sectors, and continue to encourage governments to set clear, achievable, measurable and enforceable science-based targets for carbon emissions reductions.
