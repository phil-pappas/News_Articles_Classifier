(AP) - A Wisconsin state Senate committee has passed bills doing away with Wisconsin’s nonpartisan elections board and overhauling the campaign finance law. \nThursday’s votes come a day after the Assembly passed both measures. The bills must clear both houses in identical form before being sent to Gov. Scott Walker. \nBut there are disagreements between Senate and Assembly Republicans on both proposals. Some Senate Republicans don’t want to completely do away with having judges on the Government Accountability Board. The bill passed by the Assembly replaces the judges with partisan appointees. \nRepublican legislative leaders are also discussing changes to the campaign finance bill. As passed by the Assembly it would double contribution limits and make clear candidates can coordinate with issue advocacy groups. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:24:37.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
