(AP) - The Wisconsin Department of Justice is reviewing a complaint filed by nine Republican lawmakers alleging that the state elections board routinely violated the open meetings law. \nThe lawmakers sent Attorney General Brad Schimel a letter Wednesday alleging that testimony by Government Accountability Board Chairman Gerald Nichol “raised serious questions” about whether the law was violated. \nThe lawmakers say the board may have had a “walking quorum.” That happens when small numbers of board members have discussions in sufficient numbers to reach a quorum, without everyone being together at the same time. \nGAB spokesman Reid Magney says the board carefully follows the open meetings law, and the communication described by Nichol was designed to avoid a “walking quorum” from occurring. \nDOJ spokeswoman Anne Schwartz says the letter is under review. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:19:40.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
