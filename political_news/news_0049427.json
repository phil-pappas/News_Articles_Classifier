He was director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins from 1984 to 2013. \nBaltimore police said they've searched several databases of incident reports at Popeyes restaurants as far back as 1987 in response to news media requests. They have found none that mention Carson. Reports from earlier years cannot be searched without a report number, Wayne Brooks, a legal affairs assistant, said in a written statement. \nBrooks said a database of arrests from 1967 to 2001 cannot be productively searched without the name of the person arrested. \n\"Hopefully, this explanation is satisfactory for our friends in the media and shows that BPD has done a diligent search for reports of any incident involving Dr. Carson,\" Brooks wrote. \nAsked to clarify the timing of the incident, Carson spokesman Doug Watts said the incident happened \"30-plus years ago.\" \nCarson drew criticism last week for calling for potential victims of mass shootings to rush the gunman. After the attack at a college campus in Roseburg, Oregon, on Oct. 1, when nine people were gunned down, Carson said he would \"not just stand there and let him shoot me. I would say, 'Hey guys, everybody attack him. He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'\" Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:03:05.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
