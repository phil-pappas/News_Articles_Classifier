That was the landmark deal in which tobacco companies agreed to pay billions of dollars to states to reimburse them for the health care costs associated with cigarette smoking. \nUnder the new settlement, New York State will receive slightly more than half of the settlement’s proceeds, or $281.5 million. New York City gets $146.7 million. Locally, Erie County is in line for $12 million from the deal that releases the stalled past-due payments in a legal fight that dates from 2003. \nTobacco companies that were a part of the original 1998 agreement, or ones that subsequently signed on to it, have argued that their payments to New York needed to be adjusted downward because of the years of booming cigarette sales by Native American retailers. Those Native American retailers did not participate in the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement and have not been subject to New York taxation. \nCigarette-makers have said that the state’s policy of not collecting excise taxes on those sales have eaten into their taxable tobacco sales and that their payments from the 1998 agreement should recognize that trend. \nThe 29-page settlement by the state and participants in the 1998 agreement calls for tobacco companies to be given a credit against what they owe New York – at the rate of 60 cents for every 20 cigarettes that New York’s Native American retailers sold tax-free. The sides agreed on a number of such sales – 150 million packs – that is worth a discount for the major tobacco companies of $90 million. \nGoing forward, the tobacco companies also will get a discount in their otherwise obligated payments to New York to account for the Native American tobacco sales. The settlement announced Tuesday provides for a credit of between 47 and 70 cents per pack of Native American cigarettes sold; the exact credit will depend on volume estimates of tax-free sales by tribal retailers. State officials estimate that it will be worth a credit of $90 million annually for the next several years, though they anticipate that the number will eventually decline. \nPhilip Morris, in a statement, said 22 states have now settled disputes that have arisen from the 1998 agreement. The company will receive a credit, or discount, totaling $126 million against the payment owed to New York in 2016, said Denise F. Keane, executive vice president and general counsel of the company. She noted that the settlement includes “a streamlined method” for factoring in tax-free cigarettes by New York’s tribal retailers. \n“Like the other settlements we reached with the other states, we believe this agreement makes sense,” she said. \nAttorney General Eric T. Schneiderman highlighted the $550 million flow of payments that will now be made in resolving the decade-old dispute. “Big Tobacco must pay for the damage it has done and continues to inflict on communities across New York State,” Schneiderman said in announcing the settlement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:16:27.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
