The Council of State, following a hearing held before its plenary session on October 2 nd , is expected to issue its final ruling regarding the decisions of the Ministry of Energy at some point in the near future. However, until the final ruling is issued the injunction relief granted by the Council of State stands.\nPaul N. Wright , Chief Executive Officer of Eldorado , commented, \"The injunction relief granted by the Council of State once again demonstrates the integrity and legality of our permits in Halkidiki, Northern Greece . We will resume our mining and construction activities in Halkidiki and bring our employees and contractors back to work, effective immediately. Furthermore, we will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with the Ministry of Energy with a view to addressing any concerns the Ministry might have. Mining can make an important contribution to the economic recovery of Greece and we wish to work together with the Ministry of Energy in order to generate job opportunities for the Greek people, pay taxes to the Greek Government, and support economic growth through best available environmental, engineering, health, safety, and community engagement practices. This approach, which Eldorado has successfully adopted over the last two decades in various other jurisdictions, will benefit all stakeholders.\"\nAbout Eldorado Gold\nEldorado is a leading low cost gold producer with mining, development and exploration operations in Turkey , China , Greece , Romania and Brazil.
