Williams Related Articles \nFLOWERY BRANCH - A complaint from Flowery Branch police officers has prompted city council members to consider a new ordinance to regulate outdoor drop boxes for clothing and other items. Officers recently told the Flowery Branch Planning Department that they have noticed increased criminal activity around the free-standing boxes. Not only that, but there's also trash piled around some of the structures, making for a number of eyesores around the city. Community Development Director John McHenry brought the issue before City Council earlier this month, telling council members there was no language in the Flowery Branch City Code regulating drop boxes. Thursday night, McHenry will present an amendment to the City Code that prohibits drop boxes that are stand-alone structures. Drop boxes \"associated with the principal use\" of a business will be allowed, according to the agenda for the October 15th meeting. The paperwork pointed out the recycling boxes at Publix and the book boxes at the library as examples of acceptable drop boxes. Flowery Branch City Council will hold first reading on the ordinance proposal at its regular meeting Thursday at 6 p.m. at Flowery Branch City Hall on Main Street.
