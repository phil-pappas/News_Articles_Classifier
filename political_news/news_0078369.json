Thomas provided information on screening and risk factors while Weatherly spoke about reducing risk through food choices.\nThe American Cancer Society says women should begin breast self-exams in their 20s. Women in their 20s and 30s should have a breast exam performed by a doctor or nurse every three years and women in their 40s should begin annual mammograms as well as the breast exam performed by a doctor or nurse.\n“We all know one [breast] is bigger than the other,” Thomas said. “When that one starts to get even bigger, or it switches to the other one, it's time to go for an exam.”\nThere are certain genes associated with cancer and women with a family history of cancer have the option of genetic screening, Thomas added.\n“People who sit for six hours or more everyday are at an increased risk for cancer,” Weatherly said. “If you can, set a reminder on your calendar for every hour to get up and move.”\nWeatherly said following the nutrition guidelines at choosemyplate.gov can also help reduce the risk of developing cancer.\nBrunton provided nutrition information of a more general variety, showing how diet can reduce the risk for multiple health concerns, focusing specifically on heart disease and type II diabetes.\n“Heart disease affects more women than men,” Brunton said. “Men will often have multiple heart attacks, but women are more likely to die from a first heart attack.”\nIn addition to the presentations, representatives from the American Cancer Society were there to provide information about ovarian, colon and other forms of cancer.", "external_links": ["http://www.afspc.af.mil/shared/media/photodb/web/2015/10/151006-F-AA111-001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:52:05.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
