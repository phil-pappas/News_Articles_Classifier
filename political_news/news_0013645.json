The U.S. and others have called on Beijing to halt those projects, saying they are destabilizing an increasingly militarized region.\nFan said concerns that the island construction could affect freedom of navigation were unfounded.\n\"In fact, those construction projects are mainly carried out for civil purposes,\" Fan told the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing. \"As we have promised, the projects will not affect freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. Instead, they will enable us to provide better public services to aid navigation and production in the South China Sea.\"\nChina's assurances have failed to gain much traction abroad, and speaking shortly after Fan, Admiral Gary Roughead, the former U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, said the rapid expansion of the islands and a lack of clarity from Beijing \"heightens suspicions and presents the potential for miscalculations.\"\nWhile Beijing's assurances are welcomed, confidence measures and increased transparency are needed to assuage China's neighbors of its peaceful intent, Roughead said.\nFan cited the recent launch of operations by two new lighthouses on Chinese island holdings as evidence of good intentions and said Beijing was committed to resolving disputes peacefully.\n\"We will never recklessly resort to the use of force, even on issues bearing upon sovereignty, and have done our utmost to avoid unexpected conflicts, said the general, a vice chairman of the powerful commission controlling the military that is headed by President Xi Jinping.\nFan also said China would accelerate the establishment of an 8,000-member stand-by force for U.N. peacekeeping missions promised by Xi at the United Nations last month, as well as a commitment to train 2,000 foreign peacekeepers over the next five years.\nChina will also pursue expanded military cooperation with the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian States, whose defense ministers it hosted at a forum in Beijing on Friday.\nThat includes exploring the possibility of establishing hotlines and exchanging liaison officers between their militaries, Fan said.\nThe ASEAN meeting and Xiangshan Forum are part of an effort by China's military to burnish its reputation in a region wary of Beijing's territorial ambitions. Four of the ASEAN countries have claims to seas and islands in the South China Sea that clash with Beijing's own.\nUnnamed Pentagon officials said last week that the U.S. Navy may soon receive approval to sail a ship inside the 12-nautical mile (21-kilometer) territorial limit surrounding China's man-made islands, reported the Navy Times, which is closely affiliated with the U.S. Navy.\nASEAN member Philippines on Wednesday gave strong backing for such a move.\nSailing within the boundary would mark the first time the U.S. has directly challenged China's territorial claims since 2012 and reinforce Washington's assertion that land reclamation does not add sovereign territory.\nChina has also sparred with Vietnam, another ASEAN member, over ownership of the Paracel island group, leading to a confrontation last year when Beijing moved a massive oil drilling platform into contested waters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:07:04.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
