Clinton is seeking to close a gun show loophole and tighten background checks at gun shows, according to details released by the campaign overnight. She has also proposed making it easier for victims of gun violence to successfully sue gun manufacturers. Republican front-runner Donald Trump is also expected to talk at a \"Today\" town hall in the coming weeks, but a date has not been announced yet. Clinton's gun control rollout comes as she heads to New Hampshire for a pair of town halls Monday. Clinton has lagged behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in polls in New Hampshire for more than a month. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:14:19.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
