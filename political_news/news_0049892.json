Among companies that do administer cybersecurity training, 15 percent still rely on paper-based training manuals.\nThe survey and corresponding whitepaper, Cyber Secure: A Look at Employee Cybersecurity Habits in the Workplace , examines technology use, security habits and level of cybersecurity awareness of workers.\nAlong with the survey, CompTIA commissioned a social experiment to observe first-hand cybersecurity habits.\nIn the experiment, 200 unbranded USB flash drives were left in high-traffic, public locations in Chicago , Cleveland , San Francisco and Washington, D.C. In about one in five instances, the flash drives were picked up and plugged into a device. Users then proceeded to engage in several potentially risky behaviors: opening text files, clicking on unfamiliar web links or sending messages to a listed email address.\n\"These actions may seem innocuous, but each has the potential to open the door to the very real threat of becoming the victim of a hacker or a cybercriminal,\" Thibodeaux noted.\nContributing to the potential cyber threat, the survey found 94 percent of full-time employees regularly connect their laptop or mobile devices to public Wi-Fi networks; and of those, 69 percent handle work-related data while doing so.\nEmployees also practice poor password protection, as 38 percent of employees have repurposed work passwords for personal purposes.\nFurther, 36 percent of employees use their work email address for personal accounts, while 38 percent use work passwords for personal accounts. This generates more points of exposure for organizations, and can be difficult to address without better training to spur behavioral changes.\nAdditional highlights from the survey include:\n63 percent of employees use their work mobile device for personal activities. 27 percent of Millennials have had their personal identifiable information hacked within the past two years compared to 19 percent of all employees. 41 percent of employees do not know what two-factor authentication is. 37 percent of employees only change their work passwords annually or sporadically. Age also factors into cybersecurity awareness; Baby Boomers, Gen X and Millennials each present unique security challenges and risks to organizations. Forty-two percent of Millennials have had a work device infected with a virus in the past two years, compared to 32 percent for all employees. Forty percent of Millennials are likely to pick up a USB stick found in public, compared to 22 percent of Gen X and nine percent of Baby Boomers.\n\"With the wave of new workers coming in, organizations need to take extra precautions and make sure they have effective training in place,\" said Kelly Ricker , senior vice president, events and education, CompTIA. \"Companies cannot treat cybersecurity training as a one-and-done activity. It needs to be an ongoing initiative that stretches to all employees across the organization.\"\nThe Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) is a non-profit trade association serving as the voice of the information technology industry.
