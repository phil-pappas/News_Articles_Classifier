(Andre Chung/For The Washington Post) October 22 at 5:54 PM The Oct. 19 front-page article “ For prisoners, child-support debt can be crushing ” portrayed a misguided policy proposal.\nI administered the child support enforcement programs in New Jersey from 1979 to 1987 and in Virginia from 1987 to 1992. In 1989, we looked at incarcerated noncustodial parents and their ability and obligation to support their children. We believed all parents should provide support for their children. It was clear that an inmate in a state prison in Virginia could pay a minimal amount in support. The amount was set at $65 per month. The state Department of Corrections agreed that most inmates could earn $65 per month in various work activities in prison. This policy kept parents and children connected.\nWhen created in 1975 , the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement was focused on two fundamental areas: establishment of and enforcement of child support and paternity. While, like many federal programs, it has been hampered by mission creep, it should remain focused on requiring parents to support their children even at minimal levels.\nHarry W.
