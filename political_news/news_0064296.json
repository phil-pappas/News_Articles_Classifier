He was sentenced to death for the 1996 killing of Cathy Bounds, who was shot five times in the back of her head.\nFults has been trying for 10 years to get a court to consider evidence that racial bias deprived him of a fair trial.\nFults' lawyers obtained a signed statement from juror Thomas Buffington in which Buffington twice used the racial slur when referring to Fults. Buffington died last year.\nThe case is Fults v. Chatman, 14-9740.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:46:58.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
