Abedin, the vice chairwoman of Clinton's presidential campaign and a former top aide at the State Department, went behind closed doors for a transcribed interview -- a major difference from what Clinton herself is set to face next week in a public hearing scheduled for Thursday. Before the hearing started, a committee aide said Abedin will be questioned about the events leading up to, during and after the September 11, 2012 attacks on U.S. facilities in Libya -- as well as \"executive branch activities and efforts to comply with congressional inquiries into them.\" 22 photos: Photos: Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi 22 photos: Photos: Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi Attack on U.S. mission in Benghazi – Attackers set the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on fire on September 11, 2012. The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens, and three other U.S. nationals were killed during the attack. The Obama administration initially thought the attack was carried out by an angry mob responding to a video, made in the United States, that mocked Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. But the storming of the mission was later determined to have been a terrorist attack.

A Clinton campaign spokesman released a statement, Read More \"Huma has been nothing but entirely cooperative with the Committee's requests, yet it remains unclear why the committee is focused on her, given her lack of knowledge about the events surrounding Benghazi,\" Nick Merrill said in a written statement. \"The Committee¹s focus on Huma (as opposed to numerous intelligence and defense community officials still outstanding) is additional evidence that the actual attack in Benghazi, and its lessons about how we might better protect diplomats serving in dangerous places, are the last things on the committee's mind.\" The appearances come after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, credited the committee with dragging down Clinton's poll numbers in her bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination -- a line that fired up Democratic criticism of the panel. Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the Benghazi committee chairman, has insisted the panel's work isn't driven by politics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:59:11.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
