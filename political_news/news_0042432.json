Venkaiah Naidu (Photo: PTI /file) Nellore: Amid demands from opposition YSR Congress and other parties for special status for Andhra Pradesh as promised by the earlier UPA government, Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday said the status alone wouldn't guarantee economic development.\n\"All problems will not be solved with the special status. Eleven states in the country have been given the special status and they now say they are poor. Special status is one of the issues for Andhra Pradesh. But everything won't be solved with that. Along with that, the Centre intends to help the state more than that,\" he said at an event in his native Nellore district.\nThe NDA government headed by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi is making efforts to speed up growth and create wealth in the country, he said.\nThe then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had promised special status to Seemandhra (the new Andhra Pradesh) during a discussion on AP Reorganisation Act in the Parliament.\nThe opposition parties in the state are now trying to corner the ruling TDP-BJP combine for Centre's failure to grant the special status.\nCongress conducted a campaign where police complaints were filed against the Union Ministers from AP including Venkaiah Naidu and also against the Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu for \"deceiving\" people, and mass SMSes were sent to these leaders.\nYSR Congress leader Y S Jaganmohan Reddy has announced an indefinite fast on the issue from October 7.\nThe Centre has directed the NITI Ayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya to prepare a roadmap on the benefits to be given to Andhra Pradesh.\nStates: Andhra Pradesh AP Special status Venkaiah Naidu Andhra Pradesh Also Read Minorities force their way into disputed site Andhra Pradesh says no sharing Krishnapatnam power with Telangana Andhra Pradesh government plans 8-circuit temple tour Corporate honchos in Andhra Pradesh take political plunge, join poll fray", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/venkaiah%20naidu_0_1_0_0_2_2_0_0_0_1_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151003/nation-politics/article/special-status-andhra-pradesh-no-cure-all-venkaiah-naidu", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/venkaiah%20naidu_0_1_0_0_2_2_0_0_0_1_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-04T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:52:31.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
