Highlights of the fundraiser, also via Politico : Sanders on the Trans-Pacific Partnership: \"That agreement is not now, nor has it ever been, the 'gold standard of trade agreements.' I did not support it yesterday. I do not support it today. And I will not support it tomorrow.\" Sanders on gay rights, specifically DOMA: \"In 1996, I faced another fork in the road. A very, very difficult political situation. It was called the Defense of Marriage Act. DOMA. And let us all remember that gay and lesbian rights were not popular then. ... That was not a politically easy vote. Now today, some are trying to rewrite history by saying that they voted for one anti-gay law to stop something worse. That is not the case. There was a small minority opposed to discriminating against our gay brothers and sisters and I am proud that I was one of those members.\" Sanders on not being electable: \"By the way, just to remember, about eight years ago—all of the political experts talked about how another Democratic candidate for president just could not win. He was unelectable. Remember that guy? Oh, it is President Obama.\" Clinton hits back: \"Sometimes when a woman speaks out people think it’s shouting.\" And scores an endorsement from Obama's 2008 campaign manager David Plouffe: \"To be honest, during the most intense days of the 2008 primary, I would never have imagined writing this. And I doubt Team Clinton felt any differently about me. … She’s the right person to protect President Obama’s legacy on health care and so much else.\" Sen.
