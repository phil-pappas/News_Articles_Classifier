POLL TRACKER | Follow the latest numbers \n\"We are well aware of the challenge of perceptions in politics and of the challenges the Liberal party has had to address in the past,\" Trudeau said. \n\"That's why we took immediate action to say that this action was unacceptable, inappropriate and Mr. Gagnier fully assumes the responsibility for his actions and stepped down.\" \nThe Liberal leader also said that if his party forms government after the Oct. 19 vote, it would set a higher ethical standard. \nIt was revealed Wednesday that Gagnier had sent a detailed letter to five TransCanadaCorp . officials behind the Energy East pipeline, outlining how they could best lobby a government — including a Liberal government — to have the pipeline approved. \nTrudeau's campaign initially stood behind Gagnier, saying he did not break any laws or ethical standards, and went as far as to blame the Conservative campaign for stirring up a controversy where none existed. \nBy afternoon, however, Gagnier resigned from the campaign, saying he didn't want to be a distraction. \n\"I deeply regret that the campaign has been affected by these negative, personal attacks,\" his statement read. \"I have always conducted my business openly and in full accordance with the rules. In the best interests of the party, I have taken this decision. I continue to support Justin Trudeau and hope for a Liberal government on Oct. 19.\" Dan Gagnier had been serving as the Liberal Party's national campaign co-chair, but voluntarily resigned after it was revealed he sent a letter to TransCanada Corp. officials, explaining how to best lobby a government. (liberal.ca) \nThis morning during a campaign stop in Montreal, however, Trudeau said Gagnier's letter was \"inappropriate\" and that the Liberals remain committed to the highest ethical standards possible. As a result, the Trudeau campaign decided to support Gagnier's decision to step down as a national co-chair. \n\"Mr. Gagnier has a long history of working with governments and has always behaved in a responsible way,\" Trudeau said. \n\"He acted in an inappropriate way a few days ago and when we found out about it, we sat down with him and he chose to do the responsible thing and step down from our campaign. It's a way of demonstrating the fact that we take ethical standards and responsibilities extremely seriously.\" Mobile users, follow the live blog here \nGagnier will remain away from his team \"for the long-term future,\" Trudeau said. \nTrudeau also said the Harper government has always used the excuse that \"no rules were broken\" to justify ethically indefensible behaviour. \nFormer Liberal prime minister Jean Chétrien, who was out campaigning with a Quebec Liberal candidate Thursday afternoon, said since Gagnier resigned the discussion should move on to issues about the future of the country. \n\"He sent an email to some clients and he resigned. Was it wrong? I don't want to debate that because he resigned. Let's talk about the future. He's not there anymore. Next?\" Chrétien said to the crowd. Jean Chrétien on Dan Gagnier: 'He resigned. Next.' 0:52 \nBut during a campaign event Thursday in Trois-Rivières, Que., Conservative Leader Stephen Harper said Gagnier's actions smacked of a Jean Chrétien-era scandal that helped bring Harper to power a decade ago. \n\"I believe the culture of the Liberal party that gave us the sponsorship scandal has not changed,\" Harper said. 'They are all about helping themselves' \nDuring a campaign stop in Quebec, NDP Leader Tom Mulcair also pulled no punches when discussing the Liberals' recent problems. \nHe said Gagnier's letter and later resignation are evidence that \"although they tried to put on a fresh face, this is the same old Liberal Party, the same old gang and the same old tactics and strategies.\" \n\"You can't trust the Liberals. It's the same old Liberal Party,\" he said. \n\"They are all about helping themselves ... It's an extraordinary opportunity for everyone in Canada, including those here in Quebec, that this is the same old Liberal Party of the sponsorship scandal,\" Mulcair said to a crowd of supporters. He added that Canadians finally have an opportunity to elect a party that has not been rocked by scandal.
