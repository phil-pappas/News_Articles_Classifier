(Chris Carlson?AP) Donald Trump does not want to suffer through another longer-than-usual Republican debate.\nNegotiations are currently underway for the third Republican debate, which will be hosted by CNBC on Oct. 28 at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Trump, the Republican front-runner, said in several tweets on Thursday afternoon that the Republican National Committee should not agree to \"the ridiculous debate terms\" the network has laid out. Trump wrote that CNBC is pushing the party around \"by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials.\"\n[ Why are record numbers of people watching the debates? ]\nBrian W. Steel, a spokesman for CNBC, said the network discussed the format of the debate, which will not allow opening statements, with the participating campaigns on Wednesday.\n\"Our goal is to host the most substantive debate possible,\" Steel said in a written statement. \"Our practice in the past has been to forego opening statements to allow more time to address the critical issues that matter most to the American people. We started a dialogue yesterday with all of the campaigns involved and we will certainly take the candidates’ views on the format into consideration as we finalize the debate structure.\"\nTrump has endlessly complained that the second Republican debate, on Sept. 16 in California, was far too long at three hours, and he has accused the host of that debate, CNN, of needlessly lengthening the debate to make more money off advertising, which was selling at a much higher rate than usual. He has also complained about the moderators of the first two debates, engaging in a nasty, weeks-long spat with Fox News Channel's Megyn Kelly and accusing CNN's moderators of asking too many questions that prompted his rivals to attack him.\nThe @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2015 \n\n. @CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2015 \n\nWhy is the @GOP being asked to do a debate that is so much longer than the just-aired and very boring #DemDebate ?\n— Donald J.
