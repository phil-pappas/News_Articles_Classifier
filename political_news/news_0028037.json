By ASHLEY PARKER and AMY CHOZICK New York Times October 7, 2015 — 5:24pm Charlie Neibergall Donald Trump spoke at a campaign stop Wednesday in Iowa. Outlandish pranks that once earned Trump plenty of media attention are no longer doing the trick as people start to lose interest. Purchase: Order Reprint When Donald Trump responded in July to criticism from one of his Republican rivals, Sen. Lindsey Graham, by publicly releasing the South Carolina lawmaker’s cellphone number, the public and the press could not get enough of the jaw-dropping stunt. But on Monday, when Trump sent a case of Trump brand bottled water to Sen. Marco Rubio’s campaign office — poking fun at the Florida senator’s sweaty debate performance and penchant for chugging water — the prank fell notably flat. While the cellphone gag earned 34,000 mentions in print, broadcast and social media that day alone, the Rubio water bottle gambit generated just 7,500 mentions during the same period, according to Zignal Labs, a San Francisco-based analytics company that tracks media. “A good old Trump stunt just doesn’t generate the media attention that it used to — even on social media,” said Anthony York, an analyst at Zignal Labs. Although the New York real estate developer still leads the Republican field in national polls, Trump’s ability to command both voter and news media attention simply by being his outlandish, bombastic self is starting to wane. The decline in attention for Trump seems particularly pronounced in the conservative news media outlets that carry influence over many Republican primary voters. Although many of the mainstream outlets favored by the Republican establishment — most notably the editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal — have always greeted Trump’s candidacy with a critical, if not disdainful eye, that discomfort has spread to the news media that speak to the populist base of the Republican Party, whose anger at Washington has helped fuel Trump’s rise. Fox News opinion commentators no longer go on breathlessly about Trump’s antics, and conservative talk-radio programs have moved on to fawn over Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. “It’s kind of a like a season of TV shows — eventually people burn out on them,” said Erick Erickson, a conservative commentator who runs RedState.com. “We’ve had a season of Trump and the plot hasn’t changed, there’s no new twist, and people are starting to move on to other TV shows.” After rescinding an invitation to Trump from an August candidate forum following the candidate’s attack on Megyn Kelly of Fox News, Erickson said he received the most hate mail and calls of his career. But, he added, after Trump’s shaky performance in the Sept. 16 Republican debate, many of those readers and listeners tell him they are returning to the fold, spurred, in part, by the sense that Trump is not quite the substantive candidate they had originally thought. “What all the pro-Trump people don’t understand is that conservatives for the past 20 years have been preprogrammed to go beat Hillary Clinton, and if they perceive him as an obstacle to doing that, they’re going to move on,” he said. The conservative news media has always been somewhat conflicted over Trump, whose tax policies and positions on social issues do not entirely align with their causes. But for conservative commentators like Ann Coulter, who, like Trump, is focused almost entirely on stopping illegal immigration, the issue is not that Trump is losing the support of the conservative news media. It is that he never had unified support in this hugely influential space in the first place. “The anti-Trump GOP media outlets have gone from blind sputtering hatred to angry contempt and now seem to have settled on impotent rage,” Coulter said. Outlets like CNN also still rely on Trump to drive ratings, although he is less of a draw than he had been in months after he announced his candidacy. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Trump highlighted his position at the top of the field and showed no signs of toning down his bombast. “I’m not going anywhere,” Trump said. “I’m leading every poll. I’m going to win and I’m going to make our country great again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:07:37.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
