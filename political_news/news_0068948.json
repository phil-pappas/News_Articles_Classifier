Scanlan and his business partner, Diederik Rijsemus, began working on Naadam four years ago after traveling to Mongolia, where they met a family of herders in the Gobi Desert. After they learned that the goats were utilized for their cashmere—a high-quality white variety prized for its long, thin fibers grown to withstand the harsh environment—the idea of buying the raw material and producing clothing, which would support the local supply chain, made the prospect of investment appealing to Scanlan and Rijsemus. For Naadam’s design, they brought on Hadas Saar, a veteran of Elie Tahari and Vera Wang, who took a functional but novel approach to Naadam’s men’s and women’s collections by incorporating other sustainably sourced materials, such as denim from co-ops in India and cotton from Kenya. A focus on essential pieces such as cardigans and ponchos made to wear in varying climates goes back to the cashmere’s source, as does part of the profits. “We’re finding a way to get better margins doing things the right way and helping people,” Scanlan says. “With that type of strategy, we can do it around the world.” naadamcashmere.com\nMore in WSJ.
