Future sessions should involve the review of best-practice policies, a public comment session, and guest speakers. \n\nSpeaks said members of the committee, which met at the Columbus Police Division’s academy, come from across the community. \n\nThe members include: Bo Chilton, who works for IMPACT Community Action; Kyle Erdeljac, with the Fraternal Order of Police; local business owner Gale Hill; Margot Kaminski, an Ohio State University law professor; Karla Rothan, with Stonewall Columbus; Abdikhayr Soofe, a member of the Community Relations Commission; Robert Stewart, assistant director with the Columbus Department of Public Safety; Columbus Police Cmdr. Robert Strausbaugh; and C. Dexter Wise III, a pastor with the Faith Ministries Church. \n\nOther Ohio police departments, such as Cleveland, Sunbury and the University of Cincinnati, already use body cameras. The state legislature is expected to vote on a bill in the coming months that would make body cameras mandatory for all police departments in Ohio. \n\nThe cameras can be costly. Columbus’ own studies say it will cost $7 million to $10 million for the city to buy the cameras and to store and maintain the data captured by the cameras. The city also could pay a third-party vendor to store the footage. \n\nCity Council President Andrew J. Ginther said last month that the committee likely would make its recommendations by the end of year, but Mayor Michael B. Coleman later said it will take the committee four to six months. \n\nColumbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs has said that body cameras are worth considering, but that her existing budget cannot support paying for them. She said there are other things her division needs, such as improvements to decaying substations and officer training.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:28:35.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
