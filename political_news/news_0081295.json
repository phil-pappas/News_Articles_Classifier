(Photo: PTI/File) Hyderabad: Most Opposition MLAs, barring those of the MIM and a few others, were suspended from the Telangana Legislative Assembly on Monday for the remainder of the Monsoon Session for disrupting the House and insisting on a debate on farmers’ issues.\nThirty Opposition MLAs belonging to the Congress, TDP, BJP, CPI, CPM and the YSR Congress were suspended after they rushed to the podium holding placards and shouting slogans demanding that the government waive crop loans through a one-time settlement instead of in instalments as was being done at present.\nOpposition leader K. Jana Reddy was not suspended but he stayed away from the House in protest. TDP floor leader Errabelli Dayakar Rao was also not suspended as he was not in the House. TD MLA R. Krishnaiah was also spared as he was in his seat. Opposition MLAs raised the issue soon after the House met for the day. They said waiver of loans at one go would help in putting an end to the ongoing suicides by farmers.\nSpeaker S. Madhusudanachary, who took up Question Hour, rejected the demand, saying that the House had already discussed farmers’ issues for two days last week. He appealed to the Opposition members to resume their seats, but they did not relent.\nChief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who intervened at this stage, said the government had already made it clear that it would make sincere efforts for waiving the loans in one go.\nStates: Telangana Telangana assembly Monsoon Session Question Hour South Also Read Osmania General Hospital alumni seeks proof Apex court to consider Abdul Nasser Maudany’s petition today Jairam Ramesh to release Congress manifesto for Telangana on April 12 No Naac grades for Telangana universities until new rule", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/telangana%20assembly_0_0_2_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/telangana%20assembly_0_0_2_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151006/nation-current-affairs/article/telangana-empties-assembly-all-opposition", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-06T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:13:55.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
