Details of that bill will be released on Thursday, Oct. 15, committee aides said.\n\"Next week, the committee will move forward with the policy and authorization provisions of a bill to improve America's surface transportation infrastructure, reform programs, refocus those programs on national priorities, provide more flexibility and certainty for state and local partners and welcome innovation,\" Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa., said in a statement.\nThe mark-up will come just eight days before the current highway authorization is set to expire, which may not be enough time for the House to consider the bill and for lawmakers to work out a deal with the Senate. The Senate has already passed its own version of a long-term highway measure.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Violence in Israel a story of Israeli retaliation for the press Many news reports on the actions of Israeli security forces downplay the violent acts of the Palestinians.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/14/15 9:00 AM Shuster's legislation designates where the government should spend highway funding, but it does not come up with ways to pay for those projects. The House Ways and Means Committee is responsible for working out the funding details and has not yet completed the task.\nBecause current highway funding authorization runs out on Oct. 30, Congress may have to pass another short-term patch to keep road surface projects up and running.\nIn July, the Senate passed a bill authorizing transportation funding for six years. The Senate bill pays for the first three years by stepping up tax code enforcement and selling off a significant portion of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\nThe Senate bill also includes a provision that would revive the expired Export-Import Bank, which many House conservatives oppose.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Media, voters split on who won the Dem debate Clinton deflected her email controversy questions, but Sanders got the biggest applause line of the night.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/14/15 11:43 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:08:52.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
