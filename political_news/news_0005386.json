Bob McDonnell in Richmond, Va. (Daily Press) Associated Press Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell files appeal with U.S. Supreme Court. \nFormer Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review his public corruption convictions, arguing that he never took any official action to benefit a wealthy businessman who showered him and his family with more than $165,000 in gifts and loans. \nIn a petition filed Tuesday, McDonnell's lawyers say he only provided \"routine political courtesies\" to former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams, who was seeking - but never received - state university research for his company's anti-inflammatory dietary supplement. \n\"This is the first time in our history that a public official has been convicted of corruption despite never agreeing to put a thumb on the scales of any government decision,\" McDonnell's lawyers wrote in the 36-page filing. \nThey said McDonnell was convicted based on a \"radically expansive definition\" of what constitutes an official action under federal bribery law. Allowing the convictions to stand, the lawyers argued, \"gives prosecutors a basis to investigate and indict essentially any official they choose. That is a dangerous power, inconsistent with our Nation's commitment to resolving political disputes through the political process rather than by putting opponents in prison.\" \nMcDonnell's lawyers also argue that the trial judge did not adequately question potential jurors about whether they had already formed an opinion based upon \"a barrage of inflammatory and misleading media coverage.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:33:07.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
