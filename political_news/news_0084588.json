Growth in the Eurozone is improving, but not as fast as would be expected given the low prices, the ECB liquidity boost and the low euro value, OECD reported on September 16. OECD urged EU policy makers to change Union’s fiscal policy and form a more growth-oriented policy.\nOECD published the Economic and Interim Economic Outlook projecting that Eurozone will grow at a 1.6 percent rate in 2015 and a 1.9 percent pace in 2016. However, growth prospects differ widely among the major Eurozone economies. Germany is forecast to grow by 1.6 percent in 2015 and 2 percent in 2016, France by 1 percent in 2015 and 1.4 percent in 2016, while Italy will see a 0.7 percent rate in 2015 and 1.3 percent in 2016.\n“The pace of recovery in the euro area is disappointing, given the favourable factors from which they are benefitting. This calls for the continuation of accommodative monetary and more growth-oriented fiscal policies, which must work together to add momentum to the expansion and create spillover effects into labour markets, business investment and trade,” Mann said.\nAccommodative monetary\nThe President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, already said in September that the ECB stands ready to expand its €1.1 trillion quantitative easing programme if there are signs that growth in Eurozone, may be threatened by a slowdown in emerging markets.\nOn 8 September, Karen Ward, an economist at HSBC told Telegraph that “in recent months the slowdown in activity has intensified in emerging markets that are important for eurozone growth, such as China and Russia.” As a result, he stressed that Eurozone exports will decline affecting Eurozone’s recovery.\nGrowth-oriented fiscal policy\nA change in Eurozone’s fiscal policy is not expected and the unsustainable above ten percent unemployment rate will most probably remain. Unemployment rate in the Eurozone decreased to 10.90 percent in July from 11.10 percent in June of 2015. Overall, according to Trading Economics, unemployment rate in the Eurozone averaged 9.76 percent from 1995 until 2015, reaching an all-time high of 12.10 percent in April of 2013 and a record low of 7.20 percent in March of 2008.\nIn addition, as austerity policies which promote internal devaluation dominate the Eurozone, wage growth in the monetary union slowed in the final three months of 2014, and Wall Street Journal reported that if this trend gain momentum in 2015 then deflation will become a reality, as retailers will be forced to lower prices because consumers simply can’t afford to buy the products they need.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.oecd.org/economy/economicoutlook.htm"], "published": "2015-09-17T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:03:07.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
