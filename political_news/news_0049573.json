A 911 call made by their tearful 12-year-old daughter who was in the car describes them trying to get away from her violent father and him falling off the car as they were driving off.\n\"Get off my mother! He's choking my mom! Get off!\" the girl screams at her dad before she and her 9-year-old sister get in the car with their mother and try to leave.\nPickerington Local School District, the suburban Columbus system where Angela Luke teaches, reinstated her after its superintendent, Valerie Browning-Thompson, listened to a recording of the 911 call on Wednesday, according to district spokesman David Ball.\n\"It's compelling enough that it allowed the superintendent to make a decision that she thought was the right decision for Mrs. Luke and the district,\" Ball said.\nThe county grand jury could still indict Angela Luke, but officials on Thursday had no more information about that possibility. Messages seeking comment were left with the county sheriff and her attorney.\nThe 17-minute call reflects the girl's panic as she screams at her father and implores the dispatcher to send someone to the house. She said Daniel Luke had been drinking.\n\"Go fast, Mommy, go fast,\" she tells her mother. Then she screams, \"Oh, my God, he's dead. He was hanging onto the car, and he fell off. My father's dead! He was holding onto the window and he fell right off. He's bleeding really bad.\"\nA neighbor who comes out tells the dispatcher that Daniel Luke was bleeding badly from the ear.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show the child who made the 911 call was 12, not 10.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:14:56.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
