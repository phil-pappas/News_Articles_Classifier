Between June and August this year, some 796 people were reported to the Channel programme for possible intervention.\nMore than 300 people aged under 18 were among those referred to the programme.\nNew legal measures have been implemented which require public bodies - including schools and councils - to stop people from being radicalised.\nThere were 349 referrals in July, when the law came into force. The figure represented an increase on the previous month, when there were 327 referrals.\nPlay video \"Feb: Pupils Challenge Extremism\" Video: Feb: Pupils Challenge Extremism The number fell to 120 in August when schools were broken up for the summer, according to the data provided by the National Police Chiefs' Council.\nThe statistics reveal that authorities are identifying a growing number of potential extremists.\nThere were more referrals to the Channel programme between June and August than for the whole of 2012/13, when the scheme was rolled out in England and Wales.\nThe Channel programme aims to counter all forms of terrorism, including far-right extremism.\nHaras Rafiq, managing director at security think tank Quilliam, said: \"The lure of extremism has increased over the last year both from an Islamist and far-right perspective.\"\nPlay video \"Feb: Boris On 'Jihadi Nonsense'\" Video: Feb: Boris On 'Jihadi Nonsense' \"There is a symbiotic relationship between the two.
