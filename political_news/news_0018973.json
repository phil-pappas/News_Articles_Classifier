But they also won't do great. \"You know, I think people are going to turn it on for a couple of minutes and then fall asleep,\" Trump said in a telephone interview with \"Fox and Friends.\" \"I don't want to say this in a braggadocious way, but a person at CNN and a couple of other people said, 'We have to put Donald Trump in this debate. We're going to die with it.'\"\nThe curiosity factor will help, Trump said, but added that he thought \"a lot of people will turn off after a little while.\" As a point of comparison, the first two GOP debates in which Trump took center stage drew 24 million and 23 million for Fox News and CNN, respectively.\nAs far as the five candidates appearing on stage at the Wynn Las Vegas, co-host Brian Kilmeade asked Trump if he would be nervous in Hillary Clinton's shoes.\n\"Well I think she's nervous about her whole future. She's got a lot of problems, you know, beyond the debate. I think she's got a lot of problems,\" he said, before adding that, \"I think that she will, you know, probably do fine.\"\nClinton \"hasn’t been a great debater in the past, but I think she just has to hold,\" he remarked, adding, \"I can’t imagine Bernie Sanders will beat her.\"\n\"I can’t imagine she’s going to be allowed to run based on the email scandal, but she probably will because the Democrats are going to take care of her,\" he went on to say.\nAs far as Vice President Joe Biden, who has not accepted CNN's invitation to debate, \"his numbers aren't that good,\" Trump remarked, noting that it might be because people are not sure if he will actually jump into the race.\n\"I think if anything, he may not do it. Although he’s going around all over the place shaking everybody’s hand. Every time I look on television he’s at a different event, so that would indicate he is doing it. But when I look at the poll numbers, I don’t see him doing very well right now, even though it’s early,\" he said.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:57:09.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
