Most of the latter was supposedly owed to Canada Post, which has made no known move to collect.\nThe court case has languished ever since, with no attempt by the NDP or the board of internal economy to move it along. There was a brief attempt to negotiate a settlement which went nowhere.\nThe board will be reconstituted after the election and the new membership could decide to let the matter drop. However, both the Liberals and Conservatives have argued it's a matter of principle to ensure that taxpayer-funded resources are used to help MPs carry out their parliamentary duties, not to advance their political parties.\nRelated Stories NDP MPs denied expense claims until disputed funds paid back: Duncan Mulcair, Trudeau spar over NDP's satellite offices", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:50:24.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
