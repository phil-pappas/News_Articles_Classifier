A spokeswoman declined further comment.\nUAW, which represents around 40,000 FCA factory workers at 23 U.S. plants, said in a post on its website that its bargaining committee had \"secured significant gains.\"\nLocal union leaders will vote on the proposed deal this Friday at a meeting in Detroit. If the council of union leaders approves the deal, UAW will release details and the ratification process will begin, a spokesman said.\nThis is the second agreement FCA and the union have reached. Last week, UAW members overwhelmingly rejected a previous tentative agreement, saying it didn't go far enough in restoring benefits workers lost in previous contracts.\nThat deal included pay raises, the potential for increased profit sharing and a $3,000 signing bonus. But members have called for an end to the current two-tier pay structure, more specific guarantees of new vehicles for U.S. factories and a return of cost-of-living pay raises.\nFCA workers haven't gone on strike since 2007. Such a move would have been expensive for FCA. A weeklong strike could cost the company as much as $1.7 billion in revenue and $35 million in net income, according to Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Tom Krisher contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
