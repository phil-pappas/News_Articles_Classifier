More London plays up the pomp for Xi’s visit \nFacebook’s parent company has told investors that potential tax changes in the EU and elsewhere could lead to a “significant increase” in its tax obligations. In addition, it told investors that “certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Facebook”. \nCompanies such as Facebook are likely to be affected by an international overhaul of tax rules , aimed at cracking down on avoidance by multinationals, announced by G20 governments last week. It might also be affected by the ‘diverted profits tax ’ of Mr Osborne, the British chancellor, although it is not among the handful of US multinationals have already announced that they may hit by the new tax. \nThe levy, introduced in April, charges a 25 per cent tax on profits that are shifted out of Britain as a result of the avoidance of a UK taxable presence or transacting with overseas affiliates that “lack economic substance”. \nTax experts said it was too soon to assess the new tax’s impact as companies do not have to notify Revenue & Customs that they may be liable to it until six months after the end of their financial year. But there is an expectation that some companies will restructure so they are not caught by the new levy, which is expected to raise £1.4bn during the next five years. \nFacebook said it was “compliant with UK tax law and, in fact, all countries where we have employees and offices, adding “we take our tax obligations seriously”. The parent company, which had a relatively high tax rate of over 40 per cent, paid $96m in foreign taxes despite reporting a foreign pre-tax loss of $8m in 2014. \nFacebook UK reported tax of £4,327 on a £28.5m loss, which had more than doubled from the £11.6m in 2013. It was chalked up after making payouts under a share-based incentive scheme of £35.4m. The share-based pay was not tax deductible and the reason for the low corporate tax bill was that £5.6m of tax losses were brought forward from the previous year. \nFacebook UK merely provides sales, marketing and engineering support to another company, Facebook Ireland, which books the revenue from advertising sales in the UK and elsewhere. It pays a royalty for “the right and licence to utilise the Facebook platform” to a subsidiary indirectly owned by two Cayman Islands companies. \nAlex Cobham, director of research for the Tax Justice Network, said that “it is simply not credible that Facebook is unprofitable in one of its more mature and active markets such as the UK. Examples like this simply serve as a reminder as to why urgent action is needed to improve tax rules and ensure that profits are declared where value is generated.” \nMr Cobham said it was not yet clear whether the proposed international crackdown on “base erosion and profit shifting” [BEPS] would be enough to deal with tax planning by digital companies. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development decided against recommending specific measures for digital companies but said the topic would remain under view. \nHe said: “In 2013, a major driver of the entire BEPS project was the spate of digital companies revealed in the media paying little or no tax in major economies. But after two years of talks the OECD countries still have not come to an agreement about how to deal with these companies. The options currently under consideration by the OECD have some potential, but action is required.” \nThe OECD has said it is aware that certain multinationals threatened by the BEPS crackdown are restructuring their operations. Amazon, the e-commerce company, has already done so.
