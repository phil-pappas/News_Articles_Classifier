Now, his campaign strategists say they will start to put a new emphasis on placing the candidate in smaller, more intimate settings, especially in early states like Iowa. The goal will be less about creating excitement around the campaign -- his advisers they feel they've largely achieved that -- and is now more about convincing voters the Vermont self-described \"democratic socialist\" can win the nomination and the White House. \"At the beginning we had to do something to create that excitement, we started from nothing,\" said Sanders adviser Tad Devine. \"Now that we've gotten this going, we're going to move towards a period of persuasion. We've got something to work with now. Now we go and persuade voters.\" This weekend, Sanders will take a two-day swing through Iowa, attending house parties, a barbeque and holding two town hall meetings. But no large rally. Read More Even his television appearances and fundraisers will be more intimate. Sanders will tape an appearance on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" Wednesday night in Los Angeles, part of the overall strategy for the campaign to introduce Sanders to a broader spectrum of voters -- and perhaps show off his dancing skills.

The appearances will build on the momentum of Sanders' debate fundraising success. The campaign raised roughly $2 million since Tuesday night's debate, according to Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, with an average contribution of $30.

When Sanders was just teasing a run he regularly spoke to audience of 100-200 people in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere. The format allowed him deliver his stump speech and take questions from the audience. But as the fascination around his campaign grew, aides hoped to tap into that spring of excitement and throw massive events across the country. The trade-off: Sanders rarely took questions from voters or the media. The large rallies will continue, campaign strategists note, saying that they will continue doing what they see working for them. Beverly Hills fundraisers Sanders will attend two fundraisers in the Los Angeles area Wednesday night. The first is in Beverly Hills, at the boutique hotel The Avalon. It's described by the campaign as a \"mini-rally\" with 1,300 people expected. Ticket prices were kept low, the campaign says -- at $25-- to encourage a more open event and has already raised $50,000. The second is a high-dollar fundraiser of the type more associated with the Clinton campaign. The event at the home of long-time Democratic donors Syd and Linda Leibovitch has a higher price point: tickets start at $250 per person and go up the maximum $2,700 for a pre-event reception and has already raised more than $110,000 with about 250 people expected.
