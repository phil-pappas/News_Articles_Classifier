They're dying because the air has already been poisoned by the aviation industry. \n\"They've promised us after every inquiry, no further expansion. They are liars. They have consistently lied to us. \n\"They now tell us if they get a third runway, there'll be no increase in noise and no increase in pollution. They're liars. They lie every time to us.\" \nTory London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith and his Labour rival Sadiq Khan were also among those to address the rally after the Airports Commission recommended building a third Heathrow runway. \nHeathrow was chosen by the commission as the best way to increase airport capacity for London and the South East because it was predicted it would add Â£147 billion in economic growth and 70,000 jobs by 2050. \nPrime Minister David Cameron is due to announce a decision on expansion by the end of the year.
