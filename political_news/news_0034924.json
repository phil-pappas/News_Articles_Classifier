Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Niles Wednesday renewed calls to improve oversight of the tax-funded, privately operated schools. \n\nRyan introduced the Charter School Accountability Act in the House mirroring a bill previously introduced by Brown in the Senate that the lawmakers say will increase transparency and accountability of charter schools nationwide. \n\n“The 123,000 Ohio students attending charter schools, and their parents, should never have to worry if they are getting the education they are owed. We must learn from the Ohio Department of Education’s mistakes and ensure charter school programs around the country make student success their top priority,” Ryan said. \n\nThe state agency has been under fire since revelations this summer that its former school-choice chief rigged evaluations of charter-school sponsors to inflate their grades. More recently, critics have questioned David Hansen’s inclusion of faulty data in a federal grant application which won Ohio $71 million to help open more charter schools in the state. \n\nBrown said many Ohio charter schools are “thriving,” but many fail to educate children and waste tax dollars. \n\n“The lack of oversight has allowed waste, fraud and abuse to fester,” he said. \n\nBrown said the legislation — portions of which were added to another bill already approved by the Senate — also seeks to strengthen oversight of federal funds to prevent fraud and abuse. \n\nThe bill would require: independent financial audits and public disclosures about finances, performance agreements between schools and their sponsors, student enrollment and other information; states to have the authority to suspend or shut down poor-performing or mismanaged schools; and conflict-of-interest policies for employees and school officers. \n\nRyan noted that House Bill 2 recently passed by Ohio lawmakers implement some of the provisions but he and Brown’s proposal would extend them nationwide. \n\nccandisky@dispatch.com \n\n@ccandisky", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:59:51.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
