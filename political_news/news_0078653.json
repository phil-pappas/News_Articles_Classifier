Clinton told NBC's \"Today\" that if she were president, she would have \"done everything\" in her power to shut down such a partisan investigation. \nClinton was secretary of state during the 2012 attacks. \nShe stopped short of calling for disbanding the Benghazi panel, as some Democrats have urged. \nThink your friends should see this?
