In recent months, the movement—which began with protests in response to the August 2014 killing of black teenager Michael Brown but has since grown to political organizing nationwide—has become increasingly influential in shaping the Democratic Party's stance on racial and criminal justice. In August, the DNC passed a resolution declaring its support for the movement. Bernie Sanders introduced a criminal justice platform days after activists from the Black Lives Matter network, which was founded after the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, interrupted him at a rally in Seattle over the summer. And members of the police-reform group Campaign Zero, which is also affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement, introduced a well-received criminal justice policy agenda. Liberals have this insane obsession with controlling every debate, conversation, movement, and issue. If the movement starts becoming too radical, or too hot, they must neuter it before it gets anymore \"dangerous\". They are nothing more than tools of the Elite, to keep the oppressed pacified and in a state of subservience. I find it funny that just two years ago, racism and police brutality didn't even exist in the minds of most White liberals. That Black people were \"race-baiting\" (whatever the fuck this means) whenever they talked about the structural inequality inherent within the American system. Now that it is politically convenient for them to do so, they, all of a sudden, are now talking about police brutality. Not only are they talking about it, but they have completely taken over the discussion. It's like nothing actually exists until White liberals say it exists. It's militancy, and what little potential it had to become a movement for social change, are gone. What was once a grassroots movement, has now become a mere \"hot-button issue\".
