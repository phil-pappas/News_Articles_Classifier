Both gentlemen will be receiving the award in the presence of friends, NZDF representatives and distinguished officials. \nFor their eminent merit in service to the nation, French President François Hollande has officially appointed them as Knight of the national Order of the Legion of Honour: \nFlight Lieutenant Mr Ronald Mayhill Born in Auckland, Mr Ronald Mayhill enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force in August 1942. He left for Canada in February to undergo training as an Air Bomber. Mr Mayhill travelled to the United Kingdom seven months later and completed training at No 4 Advanced Flying Unit and No 11 Operational Training Unit. He was posted to 75 Squadron, RAF Bomber Command. Incredibly, his first day of active duty was D-Day. On the 31st of August 1944, Mr Mayhill was significantly wounded during his 26th operational sortie when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire. Despite being temporarily blinded in one eye, Flying Officer Mayhill insisted on the captain making a further bombing run. The target was successfully attacked. For his outstanding devotion to duty and courage, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. \nWarrant Officer Mr Basil Williams Also born in Auckland, Mr Basil Williams enlisted in the Royal New Zealand Air Force in May 1941. Having commenced training as aircrew, he embarked for Canada in November of 1941 and trained as an Air Gunner. Mr Williams completed his training in the United Kingdom and began operational service in February of 1943. He flew with 51, 431 and 432 Squadrons, RAF Bomber Command. Just seven months later, on the 23rd of September, 1943, his aircraft was shot down. Mr Williams was taken to a German Prisoner of War Camp, from which he was liberated at the end of the war. \nFounded by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, the Legion of Honour seeks to reward both military and civilian distinguished services rendered to the nation. The awarding of this medal falls under a campaign of recognition undertaken by France to officially distinguish the veterans who fought in the Second World War as well as the civilians who worked in the shadows to facilitate the liberation. \nSince the launching of the campaign in 2014, 15 New Zealanders have been officially decorated, including resistance heroine Mrs Pippa Doyle and Dambusters pilot Mr Les Munro. \nThe Embassy of France would like to thank the New Zealand Defence Force for their integral role in the identification of New Zealand veterans to be awarded the Legion of Honour. \nFrench naval ship “Prairial” From Saturday 24 October to Monday 23 November, the French Patrol ship “Prairial” and its 92 sailors will be conducting four routine calls around New Zealand as it travelled here to take part in the 2015 Southern Katipo Exercise led by the New Zealand Defence Force. \nAuckland October 24th to 28th Wellington October 30th to November 3rd Nelson November 14th to 17th Napier November 20th to 23rd \nThe missions of the boat include:- Patrol", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:48:10.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
