Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington. \nThey referred to comments made recently by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California , and another House Republican, Richard Hanna, R-New York, in which they both suggested in media interviews that the Benghazi Committee has been used to damage Clinton's presidential campaign. \nIn addition, the Democrats said public reports have shown that the Benghazi panel has spent more than the budget of the House Intelligence Committee. They added that the National Republican Congressional Committee has solicited donations related to the Benghazi panel's efforts.\n\"It is clear from these candid comments and public reports that the Select Committee on Benghazi has retreated from the pursuit of the facts and instead is operating a political opposition machine against Secretary Clinton,\" they said. \"Therefore, the continued use of taxpayer funds is wholly inappropriate.\"\nTheir demand to pay taxpayers back comes a day before Clinton is set to testify before the committee and a few days after Democrats on the panel released a report concluding that their interviews have discredited GOP claims about the 2012 attacks.\nDemocratic members of the committee are now weighing whether they should quit after Clinton testifies. Key Democrats have also called on Republicans to disband the panel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:45:40.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
