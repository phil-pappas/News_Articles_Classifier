California hospitals that reported C-section rates to the voluntary annual survey this year had an average Cesarean rate of 25.7 percent â€“ failing to meet Leapfrog's standard rate (23.9 percent).\nStriking variation was apparent even within individual California communities. For example:\nOne out of five Sacramento hospitals met the standard One out of three San Jose hospitals met the standard Two out of four San Diego hospitals met the standard All four San Francisco hospitals that reported a rate met the standard, while all six Los Angeles hospitals that reported a rate did not meet the standard These findings came from Leapfrog's annual hospital survey, for which 157 California hospitals reported a C-section rate. Endorsed by The Joint Commission, National Quality Forum (NQF), and CMS, the Nulliparous Term Singleton Vertex Cesarean Section Rate (NTSV C-Section), counts first-time pregnancies (nulliparous) that have reached the 37 th week or later mark (term) and consist of one fetus (singleton) in the head-down position (vertex). Leapfrog's panel of experts recommended an initial target rate of 23.9 percent, derived from Healthy People 2020 , a national initiative designed to make significant improvements to people's health by year 2020.\nTo view the complete C-section data, along with a variety of links to educational resources, please visit http://www.leapfroggroup.org/c-section .
