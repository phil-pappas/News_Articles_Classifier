A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the incident publicly, said there was no indication of hostile fire. \nThere are about 1,000 coalition forces in eastern Afghanistan, including U.S. and Polish forces, as well as about 40,000 Afghan troops, according to NATO. \nThe U.S. has about 9,800 troops in Afghanistan, although the numbers are expected to go down a bit by the end of the year.
