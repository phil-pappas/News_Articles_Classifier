Comment Follow @Mooneyprojo Posted Oct. 18, 2015 @ 12:01 am When artist Norman Rockwell searched for a symbol of free speech to paint during World War II, he settled on the image of a man standing at a town meeting as his neighbors listened respectfully. In Rhode Island, 41 fire districts in 15 towns and a section of Warwick still operate under that form of pure democracy. But if Rockwell were looking today to use one as an efficient model of self-governance, his work could end up resembling a Jackson Pollock: chaos on canvas. Granted broad powers by the legislature to tax their residents and borrow at will, some fire districts have evolved, critics say, into fiefdoms run by firefighters or their allies who over time have promoted their own interests at the costly expense of those they serve. And apathy among voters in these districts has allowed much of it to happen, they say., The districts operate without oversight and, in some, overspending and mismanagement are chronic problems. In Coventry, two of the four fire districts are awash in debt. Their residents scream at district leaders over what to do next, and town leaders refuse to intervene, fearing the added costs it could mean to other taxpayers in town. In Lincoln, state police are investigating the possible misappropriation of money in the now-shuttered Lonsdale Fire District. The district's governing board hired a new treasurer in January to straighten out the books. After a month on the job he resigned -- without comment. Weeks later the entire board resigned, too. In Cumberland, the former tax collector of the Cumberland Fire District was charged with embezzling more than $83,000 last year. Since then, community leaders have accomplished what some thought impossible: merging four fire districts -- each with its own labor contract -- into one. But debate now rages about whether the consolidation will save money. Promoters say it will and that the merger ensures, if nothing else, better public scrutiny of finances and decision-making. Certainly, many fire districts in the state are well run. They have operated smoothly for decades, providing affordable fire and rescue services. Some employ full-time firefighters, others use volunteers. But this year for the first time, a new law requires all fire districts in the state to submit financial audits. State revenue officials say that until those audits are complete, they won't have a clear picture of which districts are healthy and which are financially distressed. Fire districts were once all-volunteer organizations that protected the local mill village or beach community and hosted the occasional potluck. Many are still responsible for street lighting and water lines, too. But in recent decades many districts have evolved into modern fire departments with full-time firefighters who receive top wages and benefits and ride in fire trucks costing up to $700,000 apiece. In short, the cost of some districts has swelled beyond the financial means of the districts' taxpayers, says T. Joseph Almond, town administrator in Lincoln and recent past president of the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns. \"Fire districts never, ever, ever were intended nor should have been allowed to become full-time fire departments,\" Almond says. The way some of Lincoln's six fire districts have spent money \"borderlines on insanity,\" he says. Yet because town officials have no authority over the districts -- each is run by an autonomous governing board -- they can only watch and cringe. For example, says Almond, the town of Lincoln, with 21,000 residents, has three districts that have their own expensive ladder trucks, each manned by a complement of ladder-company firefighters. Meanwhile, the neighboring city of Pawtucket, with triple the population and many more tall buildings, has only two. Almond says districts leaders often express a provincial attitude: \"'Well it's our district; we have to cover our district as first responders.'\" But, he says, \"the district next door has a ladder truck, too. And it's a half-mile away!\" Lincoln would be better served by a municipal fire department that eliminated those kinds of expensive duplications, Almond says. But merging districts or rolling them into one municipal department isn't easy, he says. Residents living in one healthy fire district resist inheriting the added liabilities (more firefighter salaries, pensions and health-care costs) from one in distress. Just trying to get some figures to study the idea in Lincoln has been challenging, Almond says. Consider the Lonsdale fire district. It has four employees and an annual budget of $626,000, of which about 85 percent goes to salaries and benefits. For almost two years, the district's board refused to release financial records to the town, said Almond. \"We knew their finances were an issue,\" he said. \"We didn't know the depth of it.\" Republican state Rep. Patricia Morgan, R-Coventry has criticized the actions of unionized firefighters for much of the spending problems facing the two troubled fire districts in Coventry, the Central Coventry Fire District and the Coventry Fire District. \"I think we're having problems with fire districts because there is no taxpayer protections built into their charters,\" she says. \"So if a board composed of firefighters or their friends get themselves elected, there is nothing to constrain them, no tax caps, no debt limits. There is nothing to say they can't sign a contract that is overly generous in terms of the population they serve.\" Morgan says fire district charters should be revised to include caps on how much a district can raise in taxes and borrow each year and a budget provision requiring district voters to ratify expensive purchases. And the quorums for the annual budget meetings need to be larger, too, she says. In Coventry, a quorum of only 30 people has allowed firefighters and their \"friendlies to go wild\" with the budget, she says. \"They are negotiating with their brothers. What do you think is going to happen?\" But district voters are also responsible for paying attention, says Maureen Moakley, a political science professor at the University of Rhode Island. \"Direct democracy sounds good on the surface, but people have to participate,\" Moakley says. District voters elect the governing board, which runs the daily operations. But often, too few residents bother to participate in district elections or show up for annual district budget meetings. Consequently, the few people with vested interests who do vote -- namely the firefighters or their families -- take charge and determine how millions of dollars will be spent. \"People don't pay attention. They don't participate in elections,\" says Moakley. \"What happens is the interests are served of those who are in power.\" In 2013, a year after the Central Coventry Fire District went into receivership, the state Division of Municipal Finance requested financial data from all the state's fire districts. The results were compiled into what revenue officials say is the most comprehensive examination of the state's fire districts in 50 years. According to that survey, released in March 2014, fire districts operate in 15 towns and in the Buttonwoods section of the city of Warwick. (The other communities use municipal or volunteer fire departments, or like Bristol, a hybrid form.) Some are fire districts in name only. For instance, the Bonnet Shores Fire District in Narragansett provides beach and recreational services and road maintenance for the neighborhood. Fire districts in Portsmouth and Tiverton are largely water-service districts. The Union Fire District in South Kingstown serves the greatest number of people (30,000) followed by Central Coventry (25,000) and the Westerly Fire District (20,000). Two of the smallest districts, also in Westerly, the Quonochontaug Central Beach District and the Shady Harbor District, each have a couple of hundred residents. After the financial crises of the central and main Coventry districts became known, the General Assembly last year amended the Fiscal Stability Act to allow the state to step in to save fire districts threatened by the burgeoning costs of paying firefighter benefits and growing debt. But as revenue officials learned last month, the amendment never addressed residents' authority to decide taxation issues. After spending about $1.2 million in an attempt to reorganize the Central Coventry Fire District through bankruptcy, officials withdrew the plan because it depended on tax hikes, which voters have repeatedly refused to appove. Residents in both districts say they want profound change in their departments, using the option of volunteers and a private ambulance service. In light of what happened in the Central Coventry Fire District, the state has resisted intervening in the financial mess next door in the Coventry Fire District. There, residents voted to dissolve the district only to learn that they don't have that authority; only the General Assembly, which created each district, does. Governor Raimondo says Coventry town officials should step up and help since public safety is one of their responsibilities. \"It's not in the best interest of Rhode Island taxpayers\" for the state to step in, spokeswoman Marie Aberger said in a statement. Aberger said some communities, such as Cumberland and East Greenwich, have recently consolidated fire districts. \"The Governor believes this is an opportunity for local leaders in Coventry -- and across the state -- to look at best practices for streamlining services, enhancing accountability, and delivering better value to taxpayers.\" Bruce Lemois is the proud chairman of the new seven-member board of the Cumberland Fire District, created last November in the merger of four independent districts. Those district boards allowed their budgets to spin out of control, Lemois says, with a combined average increase of 4.5 percent each year for the last seven years. None had been audited in 40 years. But this year with the new district, the tax rate is down, from $2.28 to $2.14, he says, and all the fire stations are open and providing 24-hour service. (The town has its own rescue service.) \"We're in a very, very good financial position,\" Lemois insists. He has heard the critics, including former gubernatorial candidate Ken Block, who say the new district board blundered by preserving an expensive contract with its firefighters. \"People are coming after us and telling us we're wrong, but we're not,\" says Lemois. \"They think we could just blow up the contract, but we couldn't.\" State law says that if a union exists, management must bargain with it. \"It was very, very amicable because we all decided [that] in order to get this done, you better work together or you end up with another Coventry situation,\" in which firefighters went unpaid for a time and faced possible layoffs. For the time being, as the transition settles in, keeping a fire district in Cumberland make sense, Lemois says, because the costs remain separate from the municipal tax bill and people can see how it is operating. The board members are also now elected by the entire town. And board meetings are held in Town Hall instead of a fire house to avoid \"intimidation.\" \"People now are watching carefully and I like it,\" says Lemois. \"It keeps everyone in line. And the only way to keep control is for taxpayers to stay involved in it.\" Lt. Governor Dan McKee says he has been meeting with officials from Coventry and Lincoln in recent weeks about redesigning their fire services. He expects legislation in the coming session. The legislation \"will most likely build more flexibility into these [district] charters so that district leaders can dissolve their own insolvent districts if the people want it. And town leaders can make some decisions, too.\" Legislation could also allow districts to privatize their ambulance services -- a major point of contention with the firefighters' union in Coventry. \"But there is no one easy model,\" says McKee. \"My feeling is everything should be on the table here. We need to figure out how to bring the most efficient models to our cities and towns so people can afford to live in our state.\" --tmooney@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:28:03.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
