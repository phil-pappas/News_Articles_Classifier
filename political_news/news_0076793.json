For me, Britain's national security and our people's security comes first.\"\n'Horrific sentence' Mr al-Nimr was accused of taking part in anti-government protests in the eastern part of the country in 2011, involving the country's Shia Muslim minority, and was arrested the following year.\nImage copyright Twitter Image caption Ali Mohammed Baqir al-Nimr's case has been raised by supporters on social media State media later reported he had been found guilty of a long list of crimes including sedition, breaking allegiance to the king, rioting, using petrol bombs against security patrols, robbing a pharmacy and more. He could be beheaded and his body displayed in public.\nLast month, Mr Corbyn urged the prime minister to raise the case \"directly\" with his Saudi counterparts and \"request that they commute the unjust and horrific sentence... which violates any number of international laws\".\nMr Corbyn also raised questions about a Ministry of Justice bid to provide services to Saudi prisons.\nMr Cameron said: \"We have raised this as a government. The foreign secretary has raised this, our embassy has raised this, we raise this in the proper way.\n\"I will look to see if there is an opportunity for me to raise it as well. We oppose the death penalty anywhere and everywhere and we make that clear in all of our international contacts.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8D54/production/_85708163_alnimr2.png", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E769/production/_85814295_afp_alnimr.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T02:03:44.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
