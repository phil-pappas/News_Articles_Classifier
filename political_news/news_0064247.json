Gov. Jerry Brown discuss the state's wildfire situation at the Governor's Office of Emergency Services news conference in Rancho Cordova, Calif. Gov. Brown signed legislation, Monday, Oct. 5, 2015, allowing terminally ill people in the nation's most populous state to take their lives, saying the emotionally charged bill forced him to consider \"what I would want in the face of my own death.\" Brown, a lifelong Catholic and former Jesuit seminarian, said he acted after discussing the issue with many people, including a Catholic bishop and two of his doctors.
