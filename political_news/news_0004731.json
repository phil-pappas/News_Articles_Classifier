Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., speaks during the Republican National Convention at the Tampa Bay Times Forum on August 28, 2012 in Tampa, Florida. Mark Wilson, Getty Images More + \nHouse Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Friday announced the eight Republicans who will sit on a special committee to investigate \"the grisly practices of big abortion providers,\" according to a statement from his office. \n\"Recent videos exposing the abortion-for-baby parts business have shocked the nation, and demanded action,\" Boehner said in a statement. Planned Parenthood's Cecile Richards testifies before Congress \nThe speaker notes that multiple House committees have already investigated and grilled leaders from Planned Parenthood, the women's health care and abortion provider, over a series of controversial and misleading videos aimed at taking down the organization. However, Boehner said, \"We still don't have the full truth.\" \nThe new committee \"will have the resources and the subpoena power to get to the bottom of these horrific practices, and build on our work to protect the sanctity of all human life,\" Boehner said. A group of Republican lawmakers will try again to pass legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, a day after the group's president faced a barrag... \nRep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, who has been a leader in the House GOP on abortion issues, will be at the helm of the committee. It also includes three other women (there are just 23 Republican women in the House): Reps. Diane Black of Tennessee (a licensed registered nurse), Vicki Hartzler of Missouri and Mia Love of Utah. The panel also includes two medical doctors, Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland (who was an anesthesiologist) and Larry Buschon of Indiana (who was a cardiothoracic surgeon). The final two members are Reps. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania and Sean Duffy of Wisconsin. All are members of the House Energy Committee. \nThe increased scrutiny facing Planned Parenthood followed the release of a series of edited videos that seemed to suggest that Planned Parenthood was breaking the law by facilitating fetal tissue research. Planned Parenthood maintained that it never made a profit this way -- and thus did not break the law. However, to erase any doubts about its motives, Planned Parenthood subsequently announced it would stop taking reimbursements for the transfer of fetal tissue. The group has also said it welcomes a renewed debate over the practice of fetal tissue research. \nPlanned Parenthood President Cecile Richards appeared before a congressional committee last month and insisted she was proud of the \"limited\" role the organization has had in facilitating fetal tissue research. In a written statement to the committee, she pointed out that just 1 percent of Planned Parenthood's nearly 700 clinics obtain fetal tissue for researchers seeking disease cures. She said that work is a \"minuscule\" part of her organization's services, which include testing for sexually transmitted infections and the provision of contraception and abortions. \nThis article was corrected to note that Rep. Diane Black, not Rep. Marsha Blackburn, is a licensed registered nurse. Â© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
