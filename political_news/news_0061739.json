Factional Rivalries Threaten Guinea-Bissau’s Post-Coup Progress Francisco Galamas Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015 \nLast week, in a bid to end a months-long political crisis, Guinea-Bissau’s president, Jose Mario Vaz, swore in a new government after initial talks collapsed with Prime Minister Carlos Correia over the formation of a Cabinet. Correia is the third prime minister to hold the post since August, as intraparty rivalries have left Guinea-Bissau without a functioning government for months, risking international aid to a country trying to recover from its latest military coup in 2012.

Dja resigned, and the PAIGC, which still backed Pereira, appointed one of the party’s vice presidents, 82-year-old Correia, as the new prime minister . But after Vaz swore Correia in, the institutional relationship between the new prime minister and the president quickly deteriorated over talks to form a new government, as Vaz initially rejected the Cabinet proposed by Correia because it included nearly all of the same members of Pereira’s government. The new government, nominated on Oct. 13 a day after Vaz named it by decree, is unlikely to be declared unconstitutional as it has the support of the ruling faction of the PAIGC. ... ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:31:09.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
