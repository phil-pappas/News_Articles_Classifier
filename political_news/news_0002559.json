It will address the role of podcars and automated transit networks as they pertain to mobility, energy, cityscape, and livability. An audience of 150-200 is expected, including city planners, transit planners, consultants, architects, engineers, investors, developers, elected officials, and university students. Podcar City is organized by the Institute for Sustainable Transportation (IST) of Sweden and the International Institute of Sustainable Transportation (INIST) of California .

Visit www.podcarcity.org/siliconvalley\n\"Podcars are similar to the driverless trains we see at airports and other facilities around the world,\" said Christer Lindstrom of INIST. \"But these are built as smaller cars for about six passengers. Initial systems are expected to fill the need for short trips or for connections between transit modes. We expect the technology to eventually evolve into larger systems. Elevated tracks will allow them to operate without impacting street traffic.\"\nThe conference will open on Wednesday, November 4 , at 10 a.m. , with a student design charrette at San Jose State University's Spartan Superway Design Center, 128 E. St. John St., San Jose. Students will present their team designs at 4 p.m.\nThursday registration begins at 9 a.m. at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts, 500 Castro St., Mountain View . The program begins an hour later with speakers including Aurora Lindstrom , IST Sweden; Vince Valdes , US Department of Transportation; Matthew Lesh , Noblis; and Ingmar Andreasson , PhD, Royal Institute of Technology's Centre for Traffic Research.\nOther speakers representing government, business, and professional organizations will come from across the US, China , France , Australia , Sweden , Italy , the UK, Poland , Mexico , and the Netherlands .\nPlenary sessions include: City, MPO, and State Perspectives; and Systems in Operations.
