Funding will allow the organization to significantly increase its investment in research efforts and continue to invest in groundbreaking research and clinical care that can improve patient outcomes.\nThe $200 million goal aligns with another commitment set by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network; double pancreatic cancer survival by 2020 .\nTo kick off the $200 million effort, a transformational gift of $15 million was made to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network in memory of Skip Viragh , who died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 62. Viragh was considered one of the nation's most influential mutual fund investment authorities. His legacy illustrates a consistent commitment to philanthropy in medical research and other charities focusing on human causes.\n\"We see these same qualities – among the ones we most admired in Skip – in the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network,\" said members of the Viragh family. \"We're honored to have the opportunity to make this investment, and we hope that it inspires others to join us and support the organization's critical work so that one day, other families can be spared a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.\"\n\"Raising $200 million by 2020 is ambitious, but it's critical to accelerating progress. We are so grateful to the Viragh family for their generous contribution and continued support of our organization and commitment to substantially improving the lives of pancreatic cancer patients,\" said Julie Fleshman , president and CEO of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. \"Donors can give confidently, knowing their gift is changing the course of history for pancreatic cancer.\"\nThe $200 million goal will, over the next five years, allow the organization to significantly increase its investment in research efforts, fueling the organization's efforts to develop early detection tools and better treatments options for patients. It will also support year-round government advocacy efforts on Capitol Hill and ensure federal funding for pancreatic cancer research is a national priority.\nAdditionally, increased funding for patient services will help improve the lives of people battling pancreatic cancer today, as well as those who are diagnosed in the future. More patients will know their options, and possibly have the opportunity to enroll in clinical trials that best match their needs, thanks to the vital patient services the organization offers, including Patient Central , a comprehensive service for patients and their families.\nAdditional funding also means the organization can expand the reach of its personalized medicine service, which provides eligible pancreatic cancer patients and their oncologists with information about the biology of their tumor. Further, information that is gathered through this service can help shape future clinical trials that drive progress for patients. As a result of all of this activity, even greater attention will be focused on the disease across the country and around the world, and more people will have the opportunity to Wage Hope and help rewrite the future of pancreatic cancer.\nTo learn more about the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, visit www.pancan.org .\nAbout the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network\nThe Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is the national organization creating hope in a comprehensive way through research, patient support, community outreach and advocacy for a cure.
