If we simply refuse to extend the budget by one penny for three to four years, you got a balanced budget. Just like that. So this is not pie in the sky, very difficult thing to accomplish. Having said that, one of the bugaboos that has kept us from reducing government in the past is sacred cows. What I would do is first of all, allow the government to shrink by attrition. Don't replace the people who are retiring, thousands of them each year. And No. 2: Take every departmental head, or sub-department head and tell them, \"I want a 3 to 4 percent reduction.\" Now anybody who tells me there's not 3 to 4 percent fat in virtually everything that we do is fibbing to themselves. \nBen Carson was also strong on a gold-based monetary system, and he was criticized in the media as not being a serious candidate for his conservative stance on fiscal matters. \nTruthinmedia.org reported that Washington Post writer Matt O’Brien said, \"The retired neurosurgeon is not a 'candidate of serious policy ,' criticized the concept of a gold dollar standard, and defended the Federal Reserve’s manipulation of interest rates.\" \nThe main stream media continues to show its lack of understanding of the economy and its bias of anyone with whom they disagree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:51:59.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
