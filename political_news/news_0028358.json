(Photo: AP) Harare : Shoaib Malik’s brilliant fightback was foiled by bad light as Zimbabwe beat Pakistan by five runs by the Duckworth-Lewis method in a drama-filled second one-day international at Harare Sports Club on Saturday.\nMalik was left stranded on 96 not out having hauled Pakistan from 76 for 6 to 256 for 8 chasing 277 for victory when the umpires took the players off the field with two overs remaining.\nThe game had earlier been delayed by a brief rain shower, but the decision left the 33-year-old batsman furious as he was denied the opportunity to carry his team across the line.\nThe result left the three-match series level ahead of Monday’s tour finale, and although Zimbabwe were breathing a sigh of relief after nearly letting the game slip, their victory represented a remarkable turnaround.\nUnder pressure after being rolled for 128 in an embarrassing defeat on Thursday, the home batsmen showed their capabilities in posting 276 for six, with Chamu Chibhabha anchoring the innings with a composed 90 and Elton Chigumbura adding the flourish with his brisk 67.\nAfter winning the toss and electing to bowl, Pakistan were left to wonder whether they had underestimated their opponents in leaving out star performer Imad Wasim in order to give a debut to spinner Bilal Asif, who went wicketless.\nBrief scores : Zimbabwe 276/6 in 50 overs (C. Chibhabha 90, B. Chari 39, E. Chigumbura 67, Sikandar Raza 32, Wahab Riaz 4/63) bt Pakistan 256/8 in 48 overs (Shoaib Malik 98 not out, Aamer Yamin 62, T. Panyangara 2/44). Zimbabwe won by 5 runs according to the D/L method.\n sports Cricket Zimbabve Pakistan Shoaib Malik Also Read Will cherish my 20 minutes in ISL final for life: Mohammed Rafique IPL 7 SRH vs KKR: Knights shine bright Samson and Karn Sharma in India one-day squad WC 2015 IND vs AUS: Things to watch out for during the high-voltage semifinal", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151004/sports-cricket/article/zimbabwe-beat-pakistan-level-series", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/679c31bf6e46c72c830f6a706700836f.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/679c31bf6e46c72c830f6a706700836f.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-04T11:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:03:21.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
