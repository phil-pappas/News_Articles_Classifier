The controversial consigliere of Clinton’s first presidential run now oversees the Stagwell Group, a private equity firm with $250 million in assets that on Thursday announced it had made its first purchase , the consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker.\nBut Penn, who also served as Bill Clinton’s longtime pollster, has not given up his passion for polling presidential elections -- or testing the waters for Hillary.\nHe is teaching a graduate course at George Washington University, “Interpreting and Strategizing with Polls,” where he currently has his students crafting polls and memos addressing the question of how Clinton should position herself in what so far is shaping up to be an outsider’s election.\nStudents in Penn’s class, which a POLITICO reporter attended last week, are in the midst of formulating a poll “to determine the state of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and to determine the effectiveness of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign messages and how it affects the general voter.”\nWith his class, Penn is testing a few hypotheses -- first, that the country is not only ready but willing to elect a president who emphasizes women’s rights. It's a premise that runs counter to how he ran Clinton’s 2008 race, where he pushed for presenting her as a strong leader and downplaying any focus on gender.\nThe class is also polling the idea that despite the current state of the race -- where polls show perceived outsiders like Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders surging -- voters still want a leader with experience.\n\"You want to play into the fact that's she's not an outsider,\" Penn advised.\nStanding at the head of the class, he scrolled through two more hypotheses lit up on an overhead projector in front of the room: “Hillary’s greatest weakness is lack of compassion and reliability, she has less warmth, but has competency and experience,” he read off the screen, and “though the email scandal has damaged trustworthiness, her perceived ability to do the job remains in tact.”\nStanding in front of a slide projector, Penn asked the class to predict what the poll -- which will be fielded to 2,000 respondents and funded by the university -- will show. “Do you think it’s going to come out that Hillary Clinton is an outsider, or an insider? Or that her experience makes her a strong leader, or is a weakness? What’s your prediction?” he asked.\n“Of course she’s an insider,” an eager student called out without raising his hand.\n\" They’re pretty unlikely to see her as an outsider, I’d agree with that...What’s the major factor that this poll also alludes to that could be important?” he asked. “It begins with a T -- trust. Trust could be the big driver.”\nThe class is also conducting a poll on the Republican field.\nPenn so far has refrained from weighing in on the 2016 race. He left Clinton’s last run as a persona non-grata in her orbit — he was berated by other staffers for his lack of interpersonal skills and for causing scandal when it turned out he had met with a separate client, the Colombian ambassador, to promote a free-trade agreement while Clinton was denouncing the deal on the trail.\nBut Penn has maintained the trust of the Clintons, who still value his advice and have a decades-long relationship with him -- a contrast to Clinton's current pollster Joel Benenson, who came to the campaign from President Obama’s orbit.\nPenn has even popped up in Clinton’s released emails, dispensing advice she appears to listen to and pass on to aides. “Overlook the source,” Clinton wrote in one instance, forwarding an email from Penn to her aides in 2009, in which he encouraged her to give a speech on Afghanistan policy, “but idea that I should do a topper on timely events and make case is probably right.”\nDuring the two-hour class Monday night, Penn spoke at length about running Bill Clinton’s 1996 reelection campaign, and played some of the advertisements he made during that race. But for the most part he steered clear of talking about the mistakes made with Hillary Clinton in 2008.\nHe did, however, say he developed one important theory from working on her campaign.\n“A lot of people would react to Hillary: people would say, 'if only she were more likable, I’d vote for her,'” he recalled. “Others would say, 'I’d really like to learn more about her health care plan.' The ones interested in her being more likable were better educated. Those interested in the health care plan were more middle class voters.”\nClinton is again struggling with questions of likability, and has sought to soften her image with appearances on “Saturday Night Live,” “The Tonight Show,” and even an interview with actress Lena Dunham.\n“I always thought you should have both [personality and substance], but that in today’s world most voters are actually more substance-oriented than a lot of people think,” Penn said. “They really care about the issues that they live through.”\nIn the class, the strategist said the question that needs to be answered about Clinton is how to run as an insider in what is shaping up to be an outsider’s race.\n“How does Hillary deal with being an insider in an outsider time?” Penn said. “You can take what people want out of it. Is what people are really looking for just common sense leadership and they’re expressing it as outsider? Maybe it’s a false dimension.”\n“There’s no one answer to any of these questions,” he added. “The approach to answering that is putting hypotheses on the board.”\nBut he offered one potential solution to workshop with the class: “What they really want is strong, common sense leadership. So you could run on that. You redefine what being an insider or an outsider means. I’d try to come up with at least three potential answers, then I’d poll the answers, and then refine it again. You have to think of this as a process of problem solving with a little help from the public telling you how they might respond.”\nClinton’s campaign also appears to have identified her insider status as a problem. In recent weeks, she has been trying to address it with a new line on the campaign trail: “Who could be more of an outsider than a woman president?”\nPenn said he couldn’t comment on the effectiveness of the line to address the problem without polling it first to see how it plays.\nIn a brief interview after his class, Penn said that he is relieved to be watching this Clinton race from the sidelines, though he admitted there is some nostalgia for being in the center of the mix. “It’s definitely some of each,” he conceded.\nHis motivation for teaching a course, he said, was to widen the profession. “I was always interested in polling since I was 13,” he said. “It’s been a great profession, and there are too few people who ever wind up doing that. When I told my mother I was switching from law to polling, I don’t think she understood it for a few years. The same people I grew up with are the people still doing it. I want to encourage another generation to get interested.”\nPenn’s students were curious if an independent could beat establishment candidates like Clinton or Bush. “You see this tremendous trend for outsiders,” he admitted. “Those are the conditions where the improbability can happen. We’ve never had a decade of people saying the country is on the wrong track.”\nBut he said every candidate, not just Clinton, would have a set of problems that they need to poll and solve. “Depending on who you are,” he said, “there’s always a roadblock.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:49:54.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
