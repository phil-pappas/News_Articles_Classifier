Instead all that he speech contained is null and void as such they are standing on the beliefs which got them the labour mandate to lead the party. 1. No credibility now - giving that speech makes them a laughing stock (I agree to an extent, Corbyn was voted in on a clear mandate and should have stuck to his principles rather than letting the party \"debate\" or \"dodge\" the contentious issues like welfare, tuition fees & trident) 2. The settled will of the UK voted in a Tory Govt with the manifesto pledge to cut Welfare by Â£12billion ( Weasel words, 24% share of the total electorate is nowhere near the settled will or a clear mandate allied to the slim majority the government have under PR. You also seem to be arguing that there should be no opposition in Government, are you arguing for a one party state?) 3. Coburn snubs the Queen \"too busy/previous engagement\" to meet her and be enshrined into the Privy council -- turns out with photographic evidence he went walking in Scotland Now imagine your at home you wife says inlaws are coming round tomorrow night you say sorry I'll not be able to make it have another engagement (then pictures in boozer). Think you'd get a lot of grief for that. Now scale that up to meeting the Queen joining the uber elite privy council which has existed for 800odd years. Your a joke man you do not represent the public who voted for labour you represent a tiny % of a Labour Party. (Cameron ducked out on 2 separate occasions until he met Brenda so it's nothing new, anyway it's an outmoded relic from days gone by and should be phased out IMO) Either he goes OR MPs will leave the party lots of By Elections and move to Lib Dems instead. Labour finished as the main opposition. (Time will tell, a lot of the electorate feel disenfranchised at the moment and aren't enamored with the two shades of blue on offer) See above", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:55:57.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
