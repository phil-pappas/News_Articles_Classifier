(Uncredited/AP) By David Ignatius Opinion writer October 8 at 9:03 PM Follow @ignatiuspost Afavorite Arab proverb goes something like this: A shepherd asks the prophet: Should I let my camels loose and trust in God? No, answers the prophet. Tie down your camels and trust in God.\nThe Obama administration has been operating with a loose strategy in Syria and Iraq. Washington said that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must go, but missed its opportunity to make him leave. The United States bet on the ability of a mainly Shiite security force in Iraq to regain territory from the Islamic State, even when Sunnis there told Washington it wouldn’t work.\nDavid Ignatius writes a twice-a-week foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog. View Archive Facebook RSS The loose camels have now wandered off. Russian President Vladimir Putin revealed the strategic disarray — the contradictions and unrealistic expectations in U.S. policy — when he intervened militarily in Syria last month. The question now is how the administration can tie down its policy to a more realistic set of objectives going forward.\nLet’s make several starting assumptions: First, Putin, Assad and their friends in Iran cannot impose a military solution in Syria. Their alliance will deepen the Sunni world’s jihad against them, and will probably increase the terrorist and refugee threat to Europe. They can’t “win.” Second, everyone wants to contain (and eventually, crush) the Islamic State. It’s the one goal that unites Russia, the United States, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Even Turkey and Qatar, which played footsie too long with the jihadists, realize the extremist group must be defeated.\nWhat should the Obama administration do, in its remaining 16 months, to frame a strategy that could continue into the next administration and perhaps beyond?\nThe United States must first gather better intelligence about this battle space. We have been surprised too many times. We “underestimated” the Islamic State before it seized Mosul in June 2014 , according to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
