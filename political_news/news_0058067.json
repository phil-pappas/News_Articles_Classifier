Capel Celyn disappeared and 70 residents lost their homes in order to provide drinking water for Liverpool. The lake officially opened on 21 October 1965. Former residents of Capel Celyn, who were children at the time of the flooding, were among the crowd who attended the march. Plaid Cymru's Dafydd Wigley, who was also present, said the flooding of the valley was a defining moment in Welsh history.
