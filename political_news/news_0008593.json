The Senate redistricting session is scheduled to start Monday and end Nov. 6. \nFlorida House lawyers asked the court Thursday to move the oral arguments back because they’ll be busy analyzing the different iterations of Senate maps proposed by lawmakers and won’t have enough time to prepare for the congressional case. \nIn that case, Florida’s 27 congressional districts were thrown out by the Florida Supreme Court in July because of partisan gerrymandering on the part of Republican legislative leaders. That decision ordered the Legislature to redraw the maps but still retained jurisdiction for the courts. \nAfter the House and Senate failed to reach an agreement on new district configurations during an August special session, a Leon Circuit Court judge ruled in favor of maps drawn by the plaintiffs in the case, left-leaning groups Common Cause and the League of Women Voters. \nThat decision will be under review during the oral arguments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:44:52.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
