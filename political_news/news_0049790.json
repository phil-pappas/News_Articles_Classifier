Scott Walker and Donald Trump participate in the first prime-time presidential debate hosted by FOX News and Facebook at the Quicken Loans Arena August 6, 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio. The top-ten GOP candidates were selected to participate in the debate based on their rank in an average of the five most recent national political polls.

A new poll has found the luxury realtor is emerging as the GOP candidate not only by preferences, but expectations. \nABC News explains, the results of the ABC News/Washington Post Polls indicate Trump has achieved a \"remarkable feat for a \"non-politician\" who already surprised the GOP with his staying power and support. Yahoo Finance says the new results suggest \"Donald Trump's presidential campaign arc is now more closely mirroring that of a traditional front-runner, rather than that of an insurgent fad.

(Photo : ABC News/Washington Post Polls) \nAccording to the Expectations for 2016 poll, 42 percent of right-wing voters find Donald Trump as their candidate most likely to win GOP nomination, with Ben Carson trailing in second at 15 percent. Donald Trump also leads with an overwhelming 43 percent to Ben Carson's 16 percent as the candidate with the best chance to win the general election. Jeb Bush comes in with a vote of 12 percent and 13 percent respectively. In both polls, he is far ahead of the other top 5 candidates who include Carson, Bush, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, and Carly Fiorina.

He also tops the \"best at immigration' and 'best chance' rating. However he falls short to Carson on two very important attributes. Carson prevails with a 33 percent most honest rating and 24 percent at \"best personality\" rating. Trump received a 21 and 19 percent rating respectively, which still leads among Bush, Cruz, Rubio, and Fiorina. \nFindings by the New York Times in 2012 indicated candidates \"who voters think will win is actually a much better indicator of the eventual winner of an election than gauging who has the most voter support. \nHowever Yahoo Finance is quick to remind readers \"Analysts have cited historical precedents that show that unconventional presidential candidates like Trump, who lacks the backing of the party establishment and experience running in national political contests, struggle to win even if they experience a groundswell of support in the early stages of the nomination process.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:56:40.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
