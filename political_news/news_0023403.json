The Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice (RCRC), a pro-abortion rights coalition of leaders from different faiths, gathered at and blessed the Preterm abortion clinic, which has operated in Cleveland since 1974, last Thursday as part of its mission to show women that some religious people do support a woman's right to choose, despite how vocal the opposition from wings of more conservative faiths is.\"We want to show the clinic staff and the women who obtain their services and the community that there are people of faith who do believe that abortion is sometimes necessary and that it should be done in a safe, dignified way without shame,\" Rev. Laura Young, a United Methodist minister who serves as the executive director of the RCRC Ohio affiliate, said. \"The religious right has really hijacked the conversation on this issue, and we need to let women know that there are people of faith who are in favor of safe and legal abortion.\" . . . Judge not that yea be judged. I guess the Christian god must be a heck of a lot more powerful than the born again evangelical god. The clergy and followers of the Christian religion let god make all those decisions about a woman and an abortion while the born agains weak ass god lets the people make all those decisions about a woman and her right to an abortion in the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:43:51.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
