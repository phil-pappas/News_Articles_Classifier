Two, records of them are (ostensibly) open to public scrutiny. But neither is really the case in Mississippi. First, it is widely held among politicians that spending campaign donations on personal things in Mississippi is “legal.” This is based primarily on a 1978 state attorney general’s opinion. But nowhere in that opinion does it state that such spending of campaign funds is legal. It does substantiate the fact that there is no specific law prohibiting it. But it also appears to give warnings about doing so. Clarion Ledger Posted October 19, 2015 - 6:41 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
