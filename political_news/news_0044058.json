There will be goody bags for the first 100 brides, a catwalk show, photo booth and exhibitors offering help and suggestions at the event on 18 October from 11am to 4pm. Visitors can also have the chance to tour County Hall's own ceremony rooms and see a mock ceremony taking place. There will be two opportunities to win a free ceremony either at County Hall or Pythouse Park in Tisbury subject to terms and conditions. Stuart Wheeler, cabinet member for arts and heritage said: 'Planning your wedding is one of the most important things you do.
