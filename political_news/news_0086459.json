With the USS Simpson decommissioned, the USS Constitution is the only commissioned ship in the Navy to have sunk an enemy vessel in action.

Location: nunya Posts: 2,781 It means that ship to ship combat is a thing of the past. The USS Constitution is listed on the US Navy roster as commissioned inactive. The US Navy has not had a ship to ship gun/missile fight in years. The USS Simpson took out a Iranian gun boat with its missiles back in 1988 Location: MD Posts: 528 Quote: Originally Posted by imaginethat What does this mean?

All those ships, every US ship that sunk an enemy in combat, except the Constitution, has been decommissioned, taken off the navy list. The Constitution was never decommissioned. It still has a navy crew. Other ships that have been decommissioned are museum ships, like the Constitution's sister ship, the USS Constellation.

Location: massachusetts Posts: 4,272 Since WWII, two ships have been sunk by submarines, not by US submarines, but by all the submarines in the world. In the last 50 years, a couple of dozen aircraft have been shot down by other aircraft. We spend a fortune on things that don't get used. The Constitution was a crack frigate, in her engagement with HMS Java, twice the British ship gained the advantage, and maneuvered to where Java could cross the T, bring her broadside to bear against the Constitution's stern. In both instances the Constitution backed her sails, essentially hit the brakes, a maneuver the Royal Navy considered impossible for a ship that size. And in both instances the Java passed ahead of the Constitution, with her crew manning the guns on the wrong side, and Constitution was able to deliver a broadside to Java's stern both times. So devastating was this defeat to the Royal Navy, that His Majesty's ships were ordered not to engage vessels of the US Navy on equal terms.
