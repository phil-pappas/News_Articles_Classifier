Check back for updates. \nAs part of the budget process, the Legislature made a point of asserting its oversight of spending at the new amphitheater. \nThe Legislature put half of the amphitheater's proposed $1.9 million budget in a contingency account, to be released as 2016 progresses. \nThe Legislature also unanimously passed a resolution that requires Mahoney's staff to report on the amphitheater's finances at least three times a year. \nLegislature Chairman Ryan McMahon, R-Syracuse, said it is unlikely the Legislature would deny any funding. But said the move ensures regular updates as Mahoney hires companies to manage and promote the new concert venue. \nLegislator Kevin Holmquist, R-Manlius, said it is the most important thing the Legislature will do next year. \n\"The role that we'll play will set the tone,\" he said. \nThe Legislature also added to Mahoney's proposed budget: $100,000 to manage the overpopulation of deer and spread of Lyme disease in neighborhoods that apply for funding. McMahon has already started a task force to study whether to bait and cull the deer in his own neighborhood, the Greater Winkworth area. He said the response could be different in each neighborhood. \n$500,000 for demolition of properties taken for redevelopment by the Greater Syracuse Land Bank. $300,000 to expand the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, which provides free books to enrolled children under 5 years old. \nContact Michelle Breidenbach anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-3186", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:01:44.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
