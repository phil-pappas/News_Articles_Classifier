Neither TransCanada, which still needs clearance from President Obama, nor Dakota Access, which seems to be a strictly domestic project, is interfering in the other’s proceeding before the state commission. But they have three key points in common. Each has found a way to navigate through South Dakota without touching tribal property. Each therefore didn’t feel a need to negotiate with tribal governments in South Dakota despite coming through what was still tribal country two centuries ago. In turn, each has common opponents in some of those same tribal governments. \nSitting through many parts of the two TransCanada permit hearings during the past decade, first for the Keystone pipeline that now runs down the James River valley of South Dakota, and then for the still-proposed Keystone XL that would cross through western South Dakota from Montana into central Nebraska, I didn’t see much in the way of organized opposition. \nCurt Hohn, executive director for the WEB rural water system based at Aberdeen, led the fight against the Keystone. Paul Blackburn, representing Dakota Rural Action, presented the only opposition to TransCanada’s XL permit and didn’t offer any witnesses at the PUC hearing. Tribal governments didn’t seem to engage at the time. But a lot has changed in the five years since the commission’s initial XL decision. \nObama upon his election as president in 2008 inherited the XL issue. The anti-carbon supporters who helped him win the Democratic nomination over Hillary Clinton and then defeat Republican John McCain eventually received their rewards in two ways. The Obama administration used the EPA’s air-quality regulations to force the electricity industry to begin closing coal-powered generation plants. And, despite pressure from labor unions that would provide the manpower for construction, the Obama administration delayed year after year on issuing a final decision on whether to allow TransCanada to pierce the U.S. border with the XL project. Amid those delays, the anti-XL forces rallied nationwide, with the Bold Nebraska organization rising as the focal point for their effort. \nBold Nebraska initially entered the South Dakota permitting fight on XL when the project came up for certification. South Dakota has a loosely written law that says a permit holder must certify to the PUC that the project can still meet the permit conditions if the project hasn’t commenced within four years of the permit’s issuance. That four-year certification requirement is why TransCanada needed to come back in front of the PUC during the past year. Meanwhile Republicans in Congress, including the delegation from South Dakota, rallied to the side of approving XL. Republican majorities passed legislation to give the XL project a national green light, but President Obama refused to go along and instead vetoed the legislation. When TransCanada had to return to South Dakota for its permit certification, South Dakota became a ring for the sides to square off again. \nThis time, tribal governments joined the fight against XL. The Rosebud Sioux, Yankton Sioux, Cheyenne River Sioux and Standing Rock Sioux tribal governments intervened in the XL certification docket. Relations became so bad that TransCanada employees were banned from the Cheyenne River Reservation; the XL pipeline’s proposed route would go around the southwestern-most corner of the reservation. The lawyers and representatives for the tribal governments and their allied organizations cross-examined TransCanada’s witnesses with hard questions. The pipeline route goes through the heart of what was once known as the Great Sioux Reservation set in the 1868 treaty. The subsequent decimation of that land mass into smaller individual reservations opened western Dakota Territory to white settlement, agriculture, gold mining and commerce. The 1889 establishment by Congress of South Dakota and North Dakota cemented, seemingly forever, the split geographically and culturally between the societies of the vanquished tribal people and the triumphant U.S. military-supported white immigrants. \nThus the XL certification hearing before the PUC became an opportunity for the vanquished to exact some revenge. The tribal alliance that formed to fight the XL in turn took the fight next to the Dakota Access pipeline. But the level of participation by interveners in the Dakota Access permit hearing isn’t the same. The Cheyenne River Sioux and Standing Rock Sioux are on the wrong side of the Missouri River — the pipeline would enter South Dakota through Campbell County east of the Missouri and continue on a 45-degree angle across the James River and Big Sioux River valleys down to the Sioux Falls area and then into Iowa — and only the Yankton Sioux Tribe, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and Dakota Rural Action / Indigenous Environmental Network are presenting the core of the opposition. That hasn’t stopped their lawyers from hard cross-examination of the Dakota Access witnesses during the first two days of the permit hearing this week. But the tribal governments’ lawyers haven’t found a way yet to crack the fact that the proposed route doesn’t cross any tribal-owned land. Dakota Access chose to never deal with the Yankton Sioux Tribe, for instance, and worked only with federal and state agencies, leaving those agencies to deal on a government–to-government basis with the tribal governments when necessary along the four-state route. At times questions have come up at the hearings regarding aboriginal lands. Those haven’t seemed to score any points with the commission. And there have been many instances of opponents’ lawyers and representatives trying to trip up Dakota Access witnesses, using questions in a quest to play gotcha and to undercut their professional credibility. \nWhat’s missing in the Dakota Access hearing and wasn’t overly evident in the XL certification hearing are opposition witnesses who definitively show failings in the facts and the science of the companies’ applications. The last-hours attempt by the main opponents at the Dakota Access hearing to get the proceeding placed on hold while an environmental impact statement could be prepared ran smack into the state law giving the commission one year to reach decisions on permit applications. The one-year limit is a must in state law; the commission’s ability to order an EIS is an option in state law. The must won. But it raised another point: The commission in the future likely needs to formally consider the EIS question at some point early in the one-year process for each application, and the commission perhaps needs to ask the Legislature to amend the one-year limit to exclude the time necessary for the EIS work. The commission also struggled at times in the XL certification proceedings to set dates and deadlines because so many parties became involved. That hasn’t repeated itself in the Dakota Access proceedings to this point, but there are fewer interveners too. \nThe commission will issue its XL decision probably by year end. The Dakota Access decision is due no later than Dec. 15. So far at the Dakota Access hearing, commissioner Gary Hanson — a past mayor of Sioux Falls — seems strongly interested in shifting the pipeline’s route outside its planned corridor edging through the Sioux Falls and Harrisburg and Tea communities. Commission chairman Chris Nelson seems interested in protection for people’s property and livelihoods in case of a spill or other emergency. The third commissioner, Kristie Fiegen, recused herself over a family conflict of interest. State Treasurer Rich Sattgast is sitting for her on the Dakota Access docket. \nOne other constraint that’s become evident is the commission’s general refusal to discuss outside of a public meeting any matters involving a docket. The commission’s procedural decisions have tended to appear reactive regarding the complicated dockets of the pipeline permits. There might never be a need again — how many more oil pipelines are yet to come through South Dakota? — but the commission could consider formally establishing a checklist of considerations that would be applied early in a docket. Some of that obviously already happens, such as the public meetings held throughout the areas of the Dakota Access pipeline’s proposed route. And there doesn’t seem to be a way to avoid people turning a docket into a forum for their own agendas and to pressure for negotiations, such as on land easements. \nAnother point that’s been raised in the pipeline hearings is the state law (49-41B-1) that seems to require a project benefit South Dakota’s energy supply, specifically “so that the energy requirements of the people of the state are fulfilled.” Opponents of Dakota Access, for example, are asking how shipping oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to southern Illinois helps South Dakota. A similar question arose about the XL project. The general answer has been that supplying oil leads to more gasoline, diesel and other petroleum-based fuels that South Dakotans use, but not necessarily from the molecules that travel through the pipelines. \nThe commissioners have some of the busiest technical demands on their time in state government, in each case affecting consumers and businesses. They do well but they sometimes don’t get a chance to breathe and think and discuss how they can respond to an increasingly complicated regulatory world. They are once again in the thick of it on Dakota Access. Nor is the commission’s word necessarily final. The commission’s decisions can be appealed to the state courts, where these matters can be re-fought again.
