As part of the celebration, the Empire State Building will be lit up in yellow tonight for the ninth consecutive year.\n\" Lights On Afterschool events give students a chance to showcase the skills they learn and talents they develop at their afterschool programs, and to send the message that millions more children and youth need quality afterschool and summer learning programs,\" said Afterschool Alliance Executive Director Jodi Grant . \"These events spotlight the fun, educational, hands-on activities that quality afterschool programs offer and the ways these programs keep kids safe, inspire them to learn and help working families. But there aren't nearly enough afterschool programs to meet the need. We need more support from government at all levels, philanthropy, business, higher education and other sectors if we are to make afterschool programs available to all students.\"\nAmong the Lights On Afterschool events set for today:\nSanta Clara, California : The Santa Clara County After School Collaborative is holding its ninth annual Lights On Afterschool \"Breakfast of Champions.\" It honors outstanding principals, teachers, administrators, volunteers, and businesses and city officials who have made important contributions to the field.
