Why throw away more money on a half-mile tram running up largely unimproved Southwest 53 rd Avenue to PCC Sylvania? \nOthers, if not exactly embracing the idea, said it should at least be considered as one way to accommodate some of the tens of thousands of new residents expected to move to the Portland area in decades to come. \nWe're guessing there is much more conversation left in this topic. But before we launch a fresh round of comments, here's a sampling of what readers had to say. \nKarldude appeared to be anything but a fan of the idea: \nThe whole service to PCC issue is a stumbling, bungling scramble to gin up some justification for the light rail expansion. With it no longer going to OHSU there's not as much BS as they would like. \nThus the phony pretense that PCC represents a BIG demand for HCT to downtown. \n...when it ain't. \nStephen A Weiss agreed: \nPortland needs to consider spending money for the benefit of all travelers who flow through the Portland Metro Area and not just some \"special\" constituency. \nTrams, \"Light Rail\" and Trolleys only serve small constituencies over very limited geography while money invested in redesigning and improving the streets and highways that traverse the city of Portland which is an ever-growing and totally hostile and unnecessary bottleneck for visitors to Portland and intrastate as well as interstate commercial and private motor vehicle traffic. \nThe smug and self-centered population of planners and politicians in Portland and Multnomah County are akin to the drivers of Oregon who appoint themselves as self-righteous traffic monitors by dawdling along on the highways of the state. \nThose same smug, self-centered planners and politicians striving with myopic vision to make Portland the darling and most-desired destination for all of the people of North, Central and South America are achieving exactly the opposite. \nI suggest canning everyone elected, appointed or employed who promote these ideas and then elect, appoint or employ people who have far better vision and are realists so Portland can become something other than a laughing stock for the Western \nBguirk had a very different take: \nHas anyone thought of closing Sylvania and opening something more centrally located? Rather than trying to build the infrastructure to the campus why not bring the campus to the infrastructure. \nFingerwagger touched on the light rail versus bus rapid transit aspect of the discussion: \nSo nice to see BRT in the discussion finally. SO much cheaper, and SO much more efficient than light rail! \nDuckramone passed along some interesting thoughts on commuting in general: \nI guess I have to wonder how this would work without roadway/freeway expansion. \nOur roads are already so choked with cars during the day (particularly 6:30 AM to 9AM and then again 2:30 - 7PM) that without somewhere for the buses to move rapidly, it will still take 3-10 times as long as light rail. If you remove a lane from Barbur or I-5 or 217 or 26, etc. for BRT during rush hour that must makes the traffic problem twice as bad. \nThere are many people who can use BRT and light rail who choose not to (which is their right, of course), but there are a lot of non-traditional jobs though where you don't come in at 8AM, work in an office and go home at 5PM. Lots of people need their cars for their job, lots of people go to different locations on different days. I used to use light rail and buses from Beaverton to OHSU because it worked well and I had predictable transportation needs. My job now requires a car because of the unpredictability of location, hours, etc. (which can change at a moment's notice) and I think I am far from alone in that. Not trying to make excuses but it always concerns me a bit when we think we can retrofit something already stretched well beyond capacity which may limit \"normal use\" capacity even more. We need to build roads or else this problem will continue for a long while. \nFor Daylighter , the core issue goes far beyond mere transportation: \nThe solution is simple. Too many people are moving to Portland and increase congestion beyond the ability and cost to accommodate. Identify the carrying capacity of Portland and don't allow more people to live in Portland until others either move or die. Identify a \"capacity limit population\" and don't exceed. \nThis method won't require extension of public transportation or expansion of streets. Limit freeway traffic and allow a specified number of vehicles to travel within a designated time period by appointment only. Anyone violating this restriction would be subjected to high fines have their car impounded for six months. \nPenalize people financially for having children. Where these may seem extreme solutions there needs to be a drastic effort to reduce population growth. \nBabcock proposed an alternative to the Southwest Corridor planning effort: \nThis route is turning goofy quickly. \n1. Tualatin - no stops in Tualatin so that population doesn't get served. \n2. No OHSU tunnel to serve Portland's largest employer - we might build a goofy escalator on the side of the hill instead that I'm sure will make the hillside look great. \n3. Reduced lanes on Barbur - which will surely improve I-5 traffic \n4. PCC - by not serving it directly, how likely will students be to transfer to buses? How is that working out at Mt Hood Community College. And I'm sure the aerial tram will be welcomed by the neighborhood. \n5. Little to no opportunity for redevelopment along half the route - the Lair Hill neighborhood is historic and you can't just bulldoze the houses there to turn into apartments. \nStop the madness. Just extend the Red Line down the side of 217 and replace WES. Lot cheaper and you'll serve a much larger population on the westside. \nPounder , by contrast, is keeping an open mind: \nMuch of the cost overrun with the OHSU tram is on OHSU for throwing in a parking garage where the base of the tram structure belonged. If you built a tram at PCC, I'm guessing it would cost much less. \nHowever, it's one thing to transport a portion of a hospital with a few thousand employees up a hill. At PCC, it doesn't seem practical. \nOK, your turn. Is an aerial tram just the thing to round out the Southwest Corridor? Or would it amount to a costly boondoggle that would benefit just a few? Toss your comments this way and let's keep the conversation going. \n-- Dana Tims", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:58:45.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
