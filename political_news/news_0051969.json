Pelosi, a Democrat, lost her seat to the Republican majority in the 2010 midterms. John Boehner took the gavel.

However, the GOP lost its majority in the House of Representatives, leaving Democrat Nancy Pelosi to become speaker.

O'Neill was the longest continuously serving House speaker of any party in U.S. history. Hide Caption 7 of 7 Those changes, he said, include decentralizing power -- letting rank-and-file members have more say over who is assigned to which committees, regardless of the political will of GOP leaders, and which bills advance to the House floor.\n\"I think the next speaker has to be committed to that. I think Paul would be. I know Daniel Webster is,\" Jordan said.\nRep. Raul Labrador, an Idaho Republican who is among the House's most conservative members, said that Ryan is \"a friend. He's been very good to me the last five years that I've been in Congress.\"\nBut he offered a similar take to Jordan -- that to earn the group's support, Ryan would have to commit to changes in the approach of House leadership.\n\"Until somebody's a declared candidate, we're not going to move to a new candidate. Now, if new candidates declare themselves, then we're going to ask them to come talk to the House Freedom Caucus. Because it's not about the who, it's the what,\" he said.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120811111258-paul-ryan-6-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg",
