Be clear on who has responsibility for what. Your landlord is responsible for dealing with most repairs in your home, including problems with the roof, walls, windows, central heating and drains. They must keep the water, gas and electricity equipment safe. As a tenant you will often have responsibility for minor repairs and maintenance, which can include small jobs like replacing lightbulbs. \n2. Tell your landlord if you have a problem with pests or vermin. They should deal with problems that were already there when you first moved in. If you caused the problem, by not clearing away leftover food or rubbish, you will probably have to sort it out yourself. See www.shelter.org.uk/advice for more help. \n3. You can help prevent problems with mould by heating your home and keeping it properly aired. If it is a constant problem, tell your landlord. Major repairs, such as leaking pipes or rising damp, are your landlord’s responsibility. If they will not help, you can call Shelter’s free helpline on 0808 800 4444 to speak to an adviser. \n4. Faulty electrics are very dangerous so report any concerns to your landlord straight away. Your landlord should make sure the electrics are safe. If they do not do this, you can complain to the environmental health team at your local council.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:42:44.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
