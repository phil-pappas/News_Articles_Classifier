But the messages made public by the State Department also show the more personal side of Clinton as she struggles with technology, warns of Sarah Palin's wrath, and develops talking points for Ellen DeGeneres. Here are a few of the must-read emails from those pages that shed more light on the emails passing through Clinton's inbox during her State tenure:\nFighting with the White House operator\nWhen California Rep. Diane Watson was said to be retiring in February 2010, Clinton vented to aide Huma Abedin about wanting to call Watson, but being distracted by a separate fiasco.\nClinton, State aides discussed publicizing use of home email addresses By Kyle Cheney\n\"I'd like to call her. But right now I'm fighting w the WH operator who doesn't believe I am who I say and wants my direct office line even tho I'm not there and I just have him my home # and the State Dept # and I told him I had no idea what my direct office # was since I didn't call myself and I just hung up and am calling thru Ops like a proper and properly dependent Secretary of State--no independent dialing allowed,\" Clinton wrote.\n'a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin'\nClinton appeared less than pleased with the State Department's decision to phase out the terms \"mother\" and \"father\" in favor of \"parent one\" and \"parent two\" in early 2011.\n\"Who made the decision that State will not use the terms \"mother and father\" and instead substitute \"parent one and two\"? I'm not defending that decision, which I disagree w and knew nothing about, in front of this Congress. I could live w letting people in nontraditional families choose another descriptor so long as we retained the presumption of mother and father. We need to address this today or we will be facing a huge Fox-generated media storm led by Palin et al,\" she wrote.\n'the weirdest exchange ever'\nIn an October 2011 chain with longtime friend Betsy Ebeling, Clinton recounted \"the weirdest exchange\" ever that her husband had on a receiving line the previous day.\n\"Did Bill tell you that on the receiving line of his second speech yesterday, he had the weirdest exchange ever when a woman loudly announced that her father 'circumcised Bin Laden!' What a claim to fame. Love to all,\" she wrote.\n'Hey its huma'\nHillary Clinton wasn't always the one sending emails from her personal account.\nHuma Abedin sent the following email from the secretary's personal address in November 2011, when she said the secretary \"can't talk right now.\"\nHillary would 'never' run, top aide says in email By Nick Gass\n\"Hey its huma[.] She can't talk right now[.] She will call when she gets in car. What flight u on? Can u email me on other email?\" Abedin wrote to Jake Sullivan in response to a previous question from the secretary about when he would be able to speak with her.\nKerry had Clinton's private email\nThen-Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry corresponded with Clinton on her private address in May 2011, recounting a dinner with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Amb. Karl Eikenberry.\nClinton then passed along the email to Sullivan, asking him if he could verify that Kerry was accurately characterizing the Afghan president's intentions.\nTalking points with Ellen\nMills sent along a list of talking points in October that Clinton should push in case she ran into Ellen DeGeneres in Los Angeles, whom State's Office of the Global AIDS U.S. Coordinator wanted to help promote Clinton's upcoming HIV/AIDS speech. DeGeneres served as OGAC's special envoy for HIV and AIDS awareness later that year.\nThe talking points included:\n\"• I'm very excited about the possibility of your using your incredible platform to help us raise awareness about eliminating HIV/AIDS.\n• I'm giving a speech in two weeks where I'm going to call upon the world to join the U.S. in creating an AIDS Free Generation. • Thanks to the science, we are truly on the cusp of making this happen. And if you could help us raise awareness about this historic opportunity, it would be terrific.\"\nBlackBerry 'problems'\nIn December 2010, Clinton wrote to Sullivan in another email chain, asking if he had received a specific message. Sullivan wrote back that he had not, leading Clinton to write Abedin, informing her that she was still having \"problems\" with emails on her BlackBerry.\n\"III have to find out,\" Abedin said, though it is unclear to what she is referring because of redactions. \"We fixed it both ways,\" she wrote, in making sure that systemwide, \"anyone with a clintonemail.com [address]\" would be able to get through the spam filter and to individual computers.\n'I really admire what HRC is doing on all this'\nIn the aftermath of the release of thousands of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks, deputy secretary Bill Burns wrote to Sullivan that he \"really admire[d]\" what Clinton \"is doing on all this.\"\nEmails show Clinton kept apprised of developments in Weiner scandal \"It's not easy, and she's bearing the brunt of it,\" he wrote, adding that the Defense Department is \"still in denial over their lapses, and their tendency to lowball damage in public is really unhelpful.\"\nSullivan forwarded the praise to Clinton.\nMust be the Chinese\nIn another episode of confusion over email addresses, Mills assistant Nora Toiv emailed Abedin and Clinton with her Gmail address information.\n\"That's all I have--pis send me your state address. Thx.\" Clinton responded.\n\"You've always emailed me on my State email which is toivnf@state.gov,\" Toiv answered.\n\"Even weirder--I just checked and I do have your state but not your gmail--so how did that happen,\" the secretary pondered. \"Must be the Chinese!\"\nEmail security concerns\nAt one point in June 2011, Clinton wrote that it might be a good idea to publicize the fact that high-level State Department officials are using personal email accounts to conduct official business.\n\"I think this makes good sense,\" the secretary wrote in response to a proposal from adviser Anne-Marie Slaughter, who said that someone should \"make a statement\" or \"write an op-ed\" to make that point.\nMills weighed in, saying that former employees would be better to do the publicizing than current ones and that it might be a bad idea to \"telegraph how much folks do or don't do off state mail b/c it may encourage others who are out there.\"\n\"I take this point —Jake also has concerns. Perhaps a better approach is to make the point more quietly to legislators through H,\" Slaughter responded.\nHELP -- air travel woes\nClinton in July 2011 called on Abedin for emergency air travel assistance, as she was trapped on the tarmac with at least an hour delay.\n\"I am so unhappy since again no one said a word but as soon as we pulled away from gate we were told we'd wait for 20 minutes and now just told it will be at least an hour but the good news is that they can't keep us out here longer than 3 hours!\" Clinton wrote in an email with the subject line \"HELP.\" \"So, I want to go to plan B--pls do all you can to get us flying and if that doesn't work, I want to drive so have asked Service and DS to try to work that out.\"\nAbedin responded three minutes later at 2:42 p.m., saying, \"...we are equally frustrated watching your flight tracker here. will see if we can call ny and can tell us anything different, and we heard they are also making plans to drive if necesssary. So Sorry!\"\n<div", "external_links": ["https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-08630-138/DOC_0C05777802/C05777802.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-03318-366/DOC_0C05777111/C05777111.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-08631-167/DOC_0C05785474/C05785474.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-08632-176/DOC_0C05783530/C05783530.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-08630-141/DOC_0C05777023/C05777023.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-08632-170/DOC_0C05780317/C05780317.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-08632-180/DOC_0C05781310/C05781310.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-08633-194/DOC_0C05782981/C05782981.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-03318-366/DOC_0C05773853/C05773853.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-08633-194/DOC_0C05782959/C05782959.pdf", "https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_SeptemberWeb/O-2015-03318-366/DOC_0C05776551/C05776551.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-30T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:39:07.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
