(AP) â€” A four-month slide in the price of gasoline may be ending.\nAnalyst Trilby Lundberg reports Sunday that the average U.S. cost of regular gas is $2.34 a gallon, down just half a cent in the past two weeks.\nLundberg says prices have fallen 52 cents in the past 17 weeks but the latest cut is the smallest so far.\nShe says a moderate hike in the cost of crude oil has nudged up wholesale prices and so retailers have stopped cutting their street prices.\nLundberg says consumers could start to see higher gas prices if crude prices continue to jump.\nIn the lower 48 states, the highest average price of regular gasoline was $2.96 per gallon in Los Angeles. The lowest was $1.92 in Charleston, South Carolina.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:09:46.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
