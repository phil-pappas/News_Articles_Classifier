Strickland declared victory a few minutes later.\nComplete but unofficial returns showed Strickland took 42 percent of the vote to Wharton's 22 percent. Harold Collins captured 18 percent and Mike Williams had 16 percent. Six other candidates stood at less than 1 percent each. There is no runoff in the mayor's race.\nStrickland was the only white contender among the four major candidates.\nIt was a rare victory for a challenger against an incumbent — the most recent was Willie Herenton 's historic 1991 win over Dick Hackett — and the first time a council member will move into the city's top job since 1972.\n\"Today the people of Memphis spoke loudly and clearly. You want a new direction for this city,\" Strickland told a crowd at the Memphis Botanic Garden. \"Today, the people of Memphis — you — said we want change.\"\nWharton conceded to Strickland in an upbeat concession speech to supporters.\n\"This is Memphis, Tennessee, known for its graciousness and its hospitality. And I've tried to epitomize that throughout all my public service and nothing is going to change,\" Wharton said. \"That's just the way I roll.''\nWatching Wharton's speech on a borrowed cell phone, Strickland was asked by an aide how he felt. \"Good,\" he simply said.\nIn his victory speech a few moments later to deafening cheers, Strickland said he would be the mayor for all Memphis — including the people who didn't vote for him. He said he would spend the next four years trying to win them over as well.\nThe crowd included well-known names from Memphis: Convention & Visitors Bureau chief Kevin Kane , County Commissioner Steve Basar , and friend and fellow City Council member Alan Crone . And joining him in the back, shortly before Wharton made the call, was County Mayor Mark Luttrell .\nStrickland called Wharton \"an outstanding ambassador for the city of Memphis\" and thanked him for his service.\nFor Wharton, toward the end of the evening, none of it — the 510 colorful balloons, the skewered chicken and crab cakes, the overpowering live band, or even the cash bar — could lift the watch party's spirits or candidate Wharton to a victory Thursday night.\nUltimately, Wharton descended from his Holiday Inn-University of Memphis hotel room to deliver an upbeat, undaunted concession speech.\n\"It's been a good run,'' the smiling 71-year-old said as 15 of his family members stood behind him on the stage.\nCommodities broker Charles McVean praised Wharton for a key meeting in which Wharton persuaded top Union Pacific Railroad executives to share their railroad bridge for the Big River Crossing bike/pedestrian path over the Mississippi River. \"He was a great, great salesman for the city of Memphis,'' said McVean, the crossing's biggest supporter. \"He's a class act.''\nThe sex scandal that ousted Housing and Community Development Division director Robert Lipscomb hurt Wharton, as well as the controversy that erupted when an $880,000 police body camera contract was given to the public relations firm of Wharton campaign manager Deidre Malone , said David Cocke , former four-time county Democratic Party chairman.\n\"There were several events in this campaign, whether they were his responsibility or not, but they did impact the campaign,'' Cocke said.\n\"I don't think he was involved at all ... in the contract..., but the perception was bad,'' said Cocke.\nThursday night's election results were slowed by a computer glitch at the Election Commission that held up results for hours.\n\"It has to do with a communication issue between two systems,\" Election Commission chairman Robert Meyers said. \"We have had issues in the past. This is a stain on our reputation and we've tried hard to avoid that.\"\nCollins, also a member of the City Council, entered his post election party shortly after 10 p.m. and after Wharton had conceded. \"I have sent a message to — we believe — Mayor-elect Jim Strickland congratulating him on a well-run campaign,\" Collins told supporters. \"So, we need to make sure we congratulate our mayor-elect Jim and wish him well.\"\nCollins, urging support for Strickland, told the people in the crowd that they needed to ensure that \"African-American businesses and women-owned businesses get their share of the pie.\"\nFrom his campaign watch party at Macstell's banquet hall on Winchester, Williams refused to concede, but later said if the numbers are correct, he pledges to return as president of the Memphis Police Association and \"be a watchdog\" for the city.\nEarlier in the night, he said he had \"already won\" because \"we've aroused the social consciousness of the people and that's what we really wanted.\"\nSteve Mulroy , former county commissioner, said Strickland’s win was a “mandate for change” that would cross social and racial lines.\n“I think everyone was expecting a Strickland victory,” he said. “No one was expecting a Strickland blowout.”\nStaff reporters Clay Bailey, Thomas Bailey Jr., Jody Callahan, Jennifer Pignolet, Ryan Poe and David Royer contributed to this story.\n ", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*134/1009_malo_election_mayor1.JPG", "http://media.jrn.com/images/471718.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*133/471718.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/991179.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/964348.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/informemphis", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*135/991179.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/887312.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*133/964348.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ilUtBYmp85o", "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/spacer.gif", "http://www.twitter.com/informemphis", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*143/887312.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:39:28.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
