The defense will counter by accusing the government of using shady turncoat gangsters with faded memories or incentives to lie.\nAsaro, 80, who has a history of convictions for lesser mob-related crimes, was arrested again after his cousin, Gaspare Valenti, came forward with new information about the heist and agreed to wear a wire to try to coax admissions out of the reputed longtime member of the Bonanno crime family. Prosecutors haven't revealed why their key witnesses turned on Asaro, though it's believed he may have held a grudge after being cheated out of a cut of Asaro's $750,000 take from the heist, said Jerry Capeci, a Mafia expert who writes the ganglandnews.com web column.\n\"There were 750,000 reasons for this guy to cooperate,\" Capeci said.\nValenti, a Bonanno associate who has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, is expected to take the witness stand to testify about Asaro's alleged role in the Lufthansa heist and a gruesome murder of a suspected mob turncoat. Other witnesses will include former Bonanno boss Joseph Massino, the highest-ranking mobster to ever break the mob's oath of omerta by becoming a government witness.\nAsaro was a Bonanno soldier, with the Mafia slogan \"death before dishonor\" tattooed on his forearm, in late 1978 when hooded gunmen looted a vault in the Lufthansa's cargo terminal and stole about $5 million in untraceable U.S. currency that was being returned to the United States from Germany, along with about $1 million in jewelry.\nThe theft was orchestrated by James \"Jimmy the Gent\" Burke — a late Lucchese crime family associate portrayed by Robert De Niro in \"Goodfellas\" — with the blessing of Asaro, whose crime family considered the airport its turf, court papers said. Afterward, higher ranking conspirators were expected to receive $750,000, \"but most did not live to receive their share, either because they were killed or it was never given to them,\" the papers said.\nIn one of the recordings made by the cooperating cousin, Asaro complained in a profanity-laced rant, \"We never got our right money, what we were supposed to get. ... Jimmy kept everything.\"\nBut prosecutors claim Asaro indeed get his money, and blew most of it at the racetrack because of a gambling problem, prosecutors said. As evidence of that, another cooperator \"is expected to testify that, following the Heist, he saw the defendant regularly at a local track betting larger amounts than usual and extending extortionate loans,\" the government said in court papers. Asaro gave Massino, his boss in a Bonanno crew, an attache case filled with gold and jewelry from the heist as a tribute, the papers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:32:03.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
