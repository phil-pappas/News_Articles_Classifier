No marijuana will be on hand at the Southwest Cannabis Conference and Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, which starts Oct. 26, a person connected to the expo told The Arizona Republic on Wednesday. \nInstead, the expo will feature related products, seminars and job fair. It is designed for industry experts. \nMontgomery's warning came during a news conference in which he gave a presentation about drug abuse. \nLetter writer Patrice Reis observes: \"There is rampant rhetoric and misinformation regarding marijuana use.\" (Photo: Jeff Chiu, AP) \n\"Just a polite warning to folks traveling here that recreational marijuana is not legal here in Arizona, so folks who are traveling from out of state and may be engaged in business transactions at the Phoenix Convention Center, you could be violating state and federal laws when it comes to trafficking in marijuana, and I can't confirm or deny whether or not local and federal law enforcement may be on hand in an undercover capacity,\" he said. \"So welcome to Phoenix, enjoy your stay. But be careful.\" \nArizonans legalized marijuana during the 2010 election for medicinal purposes only. Supporters of legalizing it for recreational use are gathering signatures to try to put the issue before voters in 2016. \nUnder the proposed Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, adults 21 and older could possess up to 1 ounce of marijuana and grow up to six plants in their homes without obtaining licenses, as long as the plants were in a secure area. The initiative also would create a distribution system similar to Coloradoâ€™s, where licensed businesses produce and sell marijuana, and pay a 15 percent tax on retail sales to be allocated to education and public health. \nOn Friday, expo staffers sent 23 tickets to the expo to Montgomery, and invited him to attend. Montgomery told The Republic he had not yet seen the tickets, but would not attend the event. \n\"I'll politely decline to avoid becoming a fact-finding witness,\" he said. \nFollow the reporter on Twitter @yvonnewingett and reach her at 602-444-4712 or yvonne.wingett@arizonarepublic.com Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1LBZfWB Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:44:33.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
