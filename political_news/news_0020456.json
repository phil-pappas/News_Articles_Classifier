That's why there are six-and-a-half million people displaced.\" \nHe added: \"What should our reaction be to this carnage in this country? We need to be the voice of clarity, of sanity and of humanity. Promoted stories \n\"We have to have the clarity to put forward the vision that adding a few more ageing Tornado sorties will have no military consequences whatsoever but it will add to human suffering. \n\"We have to have the clarity to say we have a Prime Minister who is still smarting from being turned over in military action two years ago when he wanted to target Assad and is itching to reverse a Commons vote on military action.\" \nHe said to cheers from the conference floor: \"There should be no more futile military interventions by the UK. \n\"No more Afghanistans with no exit strategies, no more Libyas where we spent 13 times as much bombing as we did reconstructing that country and no more illegal wars such as the one in Iraq. \n\"Above all, the path we should tread is that of humanity. Let us argue for a policy which focuses on the needs of the Syrian people, which takes on the tough role of being a major sponsor for peace and diplomacy, not just another protagonist in war and carnage.\" Share article \nHe was backed by Scottish External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop, who insisted the UK had been \"seduced\" into military action \"far too often\". \nShe stated: \"We must take the hard road, the slow road, the road of the United Nations must be the route forward.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:41:10.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
