Patrick Meehan, would prohibit the president from lifting sanctions until the victims' claims are paid.\nMeehan says opponents put \"Iran's terror machine\" before American victims of Iranian terror.\nDemocrats say the GOP is using the bill to stop implementation of the deal.", "external_links": ["http://www.ap.org/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:02:13.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
