These are amounts where the governor requested a certain amount of funding. We provided that amount or even a bigger amount,\" Rep. Stephen Bloom said.Bloom, who represents Cumberland County, said the money is just sitting in the treasury and not being used.Gov. Tom Wolf has not signed a budget into law, citing the proposals presented to him by the Republican-controlled General Assembly do not address significant issues, including pension and education funding reforms.
