Meanwhile, one of the wounded, 18-year-old Anastasia Boylan, shared her tale of survival in the moments before surgery.\nAccording to CNN , which interviewed Boylan's parents, the 18-year-old was shot in the back by a bullet that traveled down her spine. She was lying on the floor bleeding, when the gunman said to her, \"Hey you, blonde woman.\"\n Boyland played dead, her parents told CNN, and survived.\nShe told her parents about the horrifying deal before going into surgery to repair her spine.\nAnastasia Boylan 18yo, shot in #OregonShooting .

President Obama on Thursday delivered a 13-minute speech filled with emotion and frustration over the nation's collective responses to these tragedies, saying it's become routine and that the U.S. is now numb to these horrors.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are not enough,\" he said. \"It's not enough. It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel. And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America next week or a couple months from now.\"\nIn the hours after the tragedy in Oregon, hundreds of people in the small community of Roseburg held a candlelight vigil at a park on Thursday night.\n\"In our sorrow, we will remember and honor those lost here today,\" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said at the vigil. \"And in this way, they will live forever in our hearts.\"\nFollow Michael on Twitter.", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/02/us/oregon-shooting-umpqua-community-college.html", "http://t.co/QGOOgTzszm", "http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/10/hundreds_gather_for_candleligh.html", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/OregonShooting?src=hash", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/02/us/oregon-umpqua-community-college-shooting/", "https://twitter.com/msebastian", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/us/chris-harper-mercer-umpqua-community-college-shooting.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news", "https://twitter.com/KyungLahCNN/status/649806131695501320"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:00:29.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
