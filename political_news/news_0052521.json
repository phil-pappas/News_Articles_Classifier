Promoted stories \nEveryone in local government is working hard to ensure frontline services are protected in the best way possible while also balancing the books. \nHere in West Oxfordshire I know that the district council is working closely with Cotswold District Council , Forest of Dean District and Cheltenham Borough Councils to share services to ensure they get a good deal for taxpayers. \nThe four councils already share human resources, finance and payroll services. \nThis week they are going one step further and will be approving plans for £1.25m of savings through joint IT departments. This will ensure that things like free car parking, low council tax and investment in super-fast broadband all remain intact. \nWest Oxfordshire District Council has also launched its 2020 Vision which will extend shared services with neighbouring councils. \nAlthough there will be structural changes as to how the councils operate, the 2020 programme is being designed so residents will not see any changes to their council and the services it runs. This can only be done through continuing to spend taxpayers’ money wisely. \nThere are many services across Oxfordshire which, over the past few years, have had their budgets cut or been closed. I strongly believe no councillor or politician enters into politics to close down services and cut budgets. \nHowever, councillors and politicians have a duty to protect the vulnerable, the sick and the elderly. \nI have spoken to many people over the years about services which have had to close and it’s never easy to explain why a service so important to them has closed its doors. The reality all too often is that, there is no money left. \nThat wasn’t just a note which the last Labour government left when leaving office, it’s the reality of the current economic climate and the challenge this Conservative government faces. \nDelivering a balanced budget should be at the heart of what local councils do when making decisions about reducing waste, making efficiency savings and cutting unsustainable spending. \nThe county council has saved £204m since 2010 and is planning to save a further £88m by 2018. \nThat means making more difficult decisions on services across Oxfordshire. \nAs we found out this week, in a worst-case scenario the county council is anticipating having to find an additional £50m of savings. \nIt is clear that this will not be easy but the council must stand firm in assisting the Government’s aim of eliminating Britain’s deficit. \nHere in Oxfordshire I believe that as long as we have Conservative councillors and Conservative MPs working with a Conservative government, the efficiency savings, investments and improvements to services will continue. \nThe key issue for the Government and local councils now is to work together to guarantee that while they reduce spending, frontline services are protected and Oxfordshire’s residents continue to live safely and happily in their homes. Share article \nI would encourage everyone to get involved in the county council consultations process. \nTogether we will ensure Oxfordshire continues to be a great place to live, work and do business.
