The project is to conclude on December 31, 2016, and aims to offer political support, financial incentives, and technical assistance for the development of a national training program for local elected representatives, and establish appropriate institutional arrangements for delivering the program. On Wednesday, Secretary General of the Parliament Secretariat B.Boldbaatar, who serves as National Director of the project, attended a national training program themed “Citizens’ Representatives Khural: Representatives’ Leadership” organized in Sainshand, the center of Dornogovi Province. At the event, B.Boldbaatar introduced four outputs that will contribute to achievement of the project’s goals: having a national training program for local elected representatives developed and institutionalized; improved downward accountability of elected representatives through promoting citizen participation in decision making; increased oversight capacity of local meetings; and lessons integrated into legal and policy framework for local self-governance. Project organizers say that they have achieved significant progress on stated outputs, including the completion of a nationwide training for newly elected local representatives and the commencement of a nationwide women’s leadership training. They pointed out that 2015 will be a decisive year for the project, prior to the imminent national elections of 2016. \nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16466   8  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:38:49.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
