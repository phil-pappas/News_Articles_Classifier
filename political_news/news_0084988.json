Well, I guess I'm throwing that rule out the window! Hang on to your hats, this is going to hurt ... one of us.) \nDear Republican Party, \nI am embarrassed to be counted among you. \nWhat the hell is wrong with you people? \nGlobal warming is not a hoax. Get a clue and open a window. Denying it only hurts our earth and all those who live on it (not to mention it makes all Republicans look like idiots). \nI am sickened by your bigoted intolerance of gay and lesbian people marrying. It's not all about you. It's about humanity and doing the right thing. And stop blaming God for every narrow-minded thought you cannot suppress. God, my friends, is about love, acceptance and forgiveness. Sharing, caring, and moving forward with non-judgment is the name of the game of life. Perhaps you should live it and stop telling others how to. \nWhy do Republicans have an obsession with standing in the way of a woman's right to choose? I have never believed that men should make laws that govern women's choice and bodies. When you grow a vagina, we'll talk. Until then ... it's called freedom of choice, also known as the American way. \nWhat are you thinking when you talk about deporting millions of immigrants? YES, we need stronger borders. We need a government that stands by its states and helps protect its people from renegade immigrants that cross our borders with drugs, guns and violence. But don't lump these people in with the millions that are here seeking a better life. Even a third grader will tell you how moronic that is. I am a child of an immigrant. Most people I know are. \nInstead of threatening to \"round them up\" (smacks of Nazism) let us use our intellect and resources to find a way to legalize the immigrants who are here, so they can contribute to the tax base, vote legally and have a stake in what happens here. Ditch the \"I'm here so close the gate\" mentality. America was built as a melting pot. It's time to initiate a far more efficient system to accept immigrants into this great country or ours. Pass laws that encourage and welcome immigrants, require them to assimilate to our country, speak the language and embrace its freedoms. If they don't like it, they can leave. It's about choice. \nAnd, for the love of all that is holy, get a foreign policy. The American people want a strong military; one that is at the ready to defeat any foe, but warmongering doesn't fall in to that category. Those \"boots on the ground\" are someone's sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters. Deploy with great care and utter urgency. War is a losing battle for all sides but there are times when a fight must be fought. Anyone who doesn't think so should view the footage of our troops liberating the Nazi camps. \nGOP, please stop pandering to the wealthy and offering unprecedented tax cuts to them while you are threatening to cut school lunches, social security, and defunding teachers and fire fighters. If you need to make cuts, start with your inflated salaries, perks and elitists insurance policies. Stop acting like you are above the law. \nIt's sickening. All of it. Lincoln, T. Roosevelt, and Eisenhower are rolling over in their graves watching how you are systematically desecrating the GOP. \nI will go on record and share that I have not always been the biggest fan of President Obama. I believe in my heart that a lot of the policies he has implemented have demeaned this country's status, strength and respectability throughout the globe. How anyone can read the statistics about the Iran deal and still condone it is beyond my understanding. That alone could vaporize the world in the days ahead. \nHowever, he IS our elected president. Stop being such babies, holding your breath, shutting down the government, and manipulating the masses, so you can win. Governing is not a game. Get on with the business of it. \nI have voted Republican for the majority of my adult life. So many of us are sick and tired of the extremists that are running under the banner of the Tea Party. If it walks like a bigoted racist duck and talks like a bigoted racist duck, chances are pretty good it's a bigoted racist duck. \nI'm out! \nAn apologizing former Republican (newly registered Independent) Earlier on Huff/Post50:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:44:18.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
