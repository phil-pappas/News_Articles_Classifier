David Lassman | dlassman@syracuse.com (David Lassman | dlassman@syracuse.com) Comments \nSYRACUSE, N.Y. - A judge has kicked 20 candidates off the ballot in Onondaga County who tried to run on a new party line that emerged from last year's race for NY governor. \nOnondaga County Republican Chairman Tom Dadey sued the Onondaga County Board of Elections, saying the candidates should be booted because the rules for the new Women's Equality Party are invalid. \nJudge Norman Seiter Jr. sided with Dadey. \nThe rules are invalid, the judge ruled, because three separate entities filed conflicting rules for the new party and none has a clear majority of support from the candidates who won the line in statewide races in 2014. \nThere are about a dozen lawsuits across the state and judges have had different opinions. The Onondaga County case will be appealed, but for now, elections commissioners are treating the candidates as if they are no longer on the ballot, Onondaga County Elections Commissioner Dustin Czarny said. \nSyracuse City Auditor Marty Masterpole, whose campaign hired an attorney to fight the lawsuit, said he hopes the case will be successful on appeal. But he worries a decision could come after the paper ballots are printed. \nMost of the candidates endorsed by the new party will also appear on the Democratic Party line. Only one candidate, Stuart Rotblat, who was running for Camillus town board, was not on any other party line and will not be on the ballot. \nSyracuse Common Councilor Kathleen Joy is secretary of the Women's Equality Party. It was founded by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in last year's election. \nThe new party won an official ballot line for 2015 because Cuomo won more than 50,000 votes on the line in 2014. \nThe following candidates lost the line in Onondaga County: Pamela Hunter, NYS Assembly Chad Ryan, Syracuse Common Council Steven Thompson, Syracuse Common Council Jake Barrett, Syracuse Common Council Susan Boyle, Syracuse Common Council Marty Masterpole, Syracuse City Auditor James Romeo, Onondaga County comptroller Ed Szczesniak, Onondaga County Legislature Kevin Tees, Onondaga County Legislature Linda Ervin, Onondaga County Legislature Lorene Dadey, Onondaga County Legislature Patrick Foster, Onondaga County Legislature Peggy Chase, Onondaga County Legislature Susan Scheuerman, Onondaga County Legislature Katherine Sojewicz, Syracuse school board Lynn Jennings, Cicero town board Gary Williams, Cicero town board Richard Griffo, Camillus town board Stuart Rotblat, Camillus town board Sam Young, DeWitt town board \nContact Michelle Breidenbach anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-3186", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:20:55.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
