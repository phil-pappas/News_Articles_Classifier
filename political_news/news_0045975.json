N.L., on Saturday, October 3, 2015. | Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press reddit ADVERTISEMENT \nMONTREAL — It sounds like an agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership is close — and when it's done, Conservative Leader Stephen Harper says he intends to disclose the details of what he's billing as the largest trade deal in history. \nHarper says while the talks taking place in Atlanta have not yet wrapped up, he is receiving regular updates on what he calls \"significant progress.\" \nHe says while the TPP could create thousands of new jobs in Canada and provide access to 800 million new customers, the government will only conclude a deal that is in the country's best interests. \nHarper also says it is the government's \"intent to make it public,\" although he adds the final authority on the deal rests with the Parliament of Canada. \nThe Conservative leader is now on his way to an event in the Newfoundland and Labrador riding of Avalon — his first foray of the campaign into a province that has never shown him much electoral warmth. \nNew Democrat Leader Tom Mulcair has a much more sedate day with an event in the community of Upton in the eastern townships of Quebec. The community is in the riding of Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, one of many that went to the New Democrats in the 2011 orange wave. \nHowever, recent polls have suggested New Democrat support is softening in Quebec. \nBloc Quebecois Leader Gilles Duceppe attends a rally in Montreal while Green party Leader Elizabeth May is taking part in a rally in Vancouver. \nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau is off the campaign trail. \nHowever, on Sunday he'll attend what the party has billed as the biggest rally of the campaign, at a hall in Brampton, Ont., that seats up to 5,000 people. \nLike Us On Facebook More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:25:27.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
