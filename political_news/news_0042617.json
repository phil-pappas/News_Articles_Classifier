Regulators want more leadership from automakers on driverless car safety. A man reads as he rides in a Volvo self-driving car.\nBy Tom Risen Oct. 8, 2015 | 3:54 p.m. EDT + More The head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Thursday said he welcomes commitments by manufacturers of self-driving cars to accept liability for accidents involving their technology, adding that such statements will ease the way for eventual commercial distribution of the vehicles.\nNHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind made the remarks during an event in Washington, D.C., in which Volvo became the latest automaker to pledge to be held accountable if its self-driving car system causes an accident . CBS' \"60 Minutes\" reported Sunday that Mercedes and Google, both of which are testing autonomous cars, made similar commitments if their technology is at fault – increasing the likelihood that other car companies will take steps to stand behind their products.\nRELATED\nWould You Buy a Google or Tesla Driverless Car? Rosekind, a proponent of the technology, praised the move and said the Department of Transportation is eager to implement “lives-saving technologies” like driverless cars.\n“Having leadership from the industry stepping up and saying, ‘We will accept responsibility in those areas,’ helps clarity on these issues,” he said.\nComputerized driving systems are being eyed in part as a way to help prevent accidents that caused approximately 32,700 vehicle crash deaths during 2013 – 94 percent of which were determined to be the fault of the driver rather than attributed to vehicle issues or environmental conditions, according to NHTSA statistics.\nVolvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson said he thinks driverless cars will save lives, adding that he issued his pledge because he also believes consumers will only buy them if they know an automaker stands behind the quality of the computer system.\n“If you are not ready to make such a statement then you shouldn’t try to develop an autonomous drive system,” he said.\nBut in addition to supporting commitments to accept liability, Rosekind called on manufacturers to do more to guarantee cybersecurity protections are built into cars to prevent hackers from remotely taking control of a Wi-Fi connected vehicle .\n[ READ: Snowden: NSA Is Copying UK Phone Hacking Program ]\n“Regulation and enforcement alone will not be sufficient to address these risks,” Rosekind said, calling for industry to develop best practices and coordinate with government on cybersecurity threats.\nThe Grow America Act in Congress – a transportation funding bill supported by the Obama administration – seeks to make hacking a vehicle a criminal offense.\nMaintaining the privacy of motorists is also an issue. Cars already make use of GPS location trackers to navigate traffic, so Rosekind and Samuelsson each said there is a greater urgency to ensure privacy protections for self-driving cars that would likely rely heavily on geolocation data.\nRELATED\nCan Hackers Really Target Your Smart Car? “I typically put privacy and cybersecurity in the same sentence,” Rosekind said. “There are already things being done in the mobile space that are going to end up being transferred pretty quickly to the automotive space to ensure that people know their privacy is being protected.”\nThe car industry and U.S. lawmakers expect regulations will not be created to broadly allow autonomous driving on U.S. roads before at least the end of the decade. States, including California and Florida, have passed legislation allowing limited access to roads for driverless cars.\nGoogle is among the companies testing its autonomous cars on California roads, and reports that, in over 2 million miles of driving, those vehicles have gotten into 16 accidents – none of which resulted in injuries and 12 of which involved being rear-ended by other vehicles.\nBrian Soublet, deputy director of California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, says his agency has been tasked with creating safety regulations for self-driving cars in that state, but that the agency's background is in testing people – not machines.\nRather than asking what regulations will look like, those companies should be more active in sharing data about the computerized cars to help the agency adjust to its new role, Soublet said.\nAnd while government and automakers are eager to make use of driverless technology, Rosekind said precautions are necessary because “in many ways the car hasn’t changed as much in the last half century as it is about to change in the next few years.”\nTAGS: cybersecurity technology cars National Highway Traffic Safety Administration", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0fj9%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/us/selfdrivingcar/files/reports/report-0815.pdf", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0fj9%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0fj9%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=NHTSA%2C%20Volvo%20Seek%20Cybersecurity%2C%20Privacy%20for%20Driverless%20Cars", "https://www.transportation.gov/grow-america", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0fj9%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=NHTSA%2C%20Volvo%20Seek%20Cybersecurity%2C%20Privacy%20for%20Driverless%20Cars&summary=Regulators%20want%20more%20leadership%20from%20automakers%20on%20driverless%20car%20safety.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0fj9%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=NHTSA%2C%20Volvo%20Seek%20Cybersecurity%2C%20Privacy%20for%20Driverless%20Cars", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/self-driving-cars-google-mercedes-benz-60-minutes/", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0fj9%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:36:47.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
