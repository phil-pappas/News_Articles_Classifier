The Dilemma of a Somers Sailor Lost in the West Pacific Vietnam is the spot; We are doomed to serve our time In a sea that God forgot. Upon the haze grey quarterdeck Up where the men wear blue; We freeze, we sweat, we shiver Continuing work that we must do. Why must we be out here It is more than we can stand; We're just a bunch of convicts But defenders of the land. Living here with our memories Wanting to see our gals; Hoping that while we are away They aren't marrying our pals. For we are men of the Navy Earning our monthly pay; Guarding people who have millions For two and a half a day. Few people know we are living Few people really give a damn; Although we are forgotten We belong to Uncle Sam. But when we get to Heaven Saint Peter will surely yell; Fall out you men of the Somers You have served your time in Hell.
