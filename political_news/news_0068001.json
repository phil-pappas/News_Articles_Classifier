Not having it.\nBy Rachel Brody Oct. 23, 2015 | 1:00 p.m. EDT + More Hillary Clinton's testimony on Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi spanned more than eight hours of questioning – and partisan bickering. Committee Republicans grilled the former secretary of state, the committee's highest-profile witness, on the 2012 attacks in Libya, which left four Americans dead, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens. But Democrats on the committee spent much of the time chastising GOP members for what they considered a baseless investigation, meant to attack Clinton, the Democratic 2016 front-runner, politically.\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Benghazi ]\nDespite brief moments of \"legitimate inquiries,\" writes Margaret Carlson at Bloomberg View, the hearings eventually \"devolved into the partisan exercise that many had predicted.\" She says the committee initially touched on some real, unanswered questions, like the role Clinton played in ousting Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi and the country's ensuing tumble into chaos. But that line of questioning didn't last, starting with a particularly testy spat between committee Chairman Republican Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the committee's ranking Democrat, she writes. \"The afternoon's questions were almost all unabashedly political,\" writes Carlson, and focused on Clinton's private email use while in office, a revelation by the committee and a weak spot in her candidacy. \"Many on the committee,\" she writes, \"seemed intent upon landing the blow that would get them all the credit for wounding the witness.\"\nPrecisely, writes Simon Maloy at Salon; that's why the committee exists, he argues. \"Gowdy took the lead role in proving correct each one of his Republican colleagues who said the committee was focused on damaging Hillary Clinton's presidential chances,\" he writes. (Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and New York Rep. Richard Hanna suggested earlier this month that the committee was meant to target Clinton.) Despite knowing the link was flimsy and altogether false, writes Maloy, the chairman used Clinton's many emails on Libya with longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal and her zero emails with Stevens to \"give the impression that Blumenthal was in the loop while the ambassador was not.\"\n[ SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Hillary Clinton ]\nBut such obvious political jabs won't cost Republicans a thing, writes Maloy; Republican voters already believe in \"some sort of evil Benghazi cover-up\" on the part of Clinton and President Barack Obama. \"The Benghazi committee will grind on,\" he writes, \"performing much the same role it always has.\"\nBut Caleb Howe at Red State argues the committee wasn't simply a partisan squabble; it revealed a key finding – one that shows Republicans weren't the only ones crafting their own fiction. Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, he says, presented new evidence that Clinton knew early on the Benghazi attack was a planned terrorist attack, despite telling the American public it was spontaneous, a response to a YouTube video mocking Muslims.\n[ READ: It's Gowdy Doody Time ]\nClinton, he writes, \"very clearly told the Egyptian prime minister that 'We know' that it was a planned attack.\" And when confronted with the evidence, he argues, \"she hedged, repeatedly lawyering her answer, stating that she felt that the video definitely contributed to the general attack-readiness of the people.\" Cummings and Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, also jumped on the video bandwagon, he argues. \"People say to Republicans, why all the hearings?\" writes Howe. One answer, he says, is \"look at what they are saying. Here today, now, in 2015. After all of what's gone before, we're still Susan Rice on September 12, 2012, blaming a video. Blaming racism. Blaming America.\"\nTAGS: Clinton, Hillary", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh513%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Hillary%20Clinton%20Faces%20GOP%20Grilling%20on%20Benghazi%2C%20Pundits%20React", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh513%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Hillary%20Clinton%20Faces%20GOP%20Grilling%20on%20Benghazi%2C%20Pundits%20React", "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/23/the_benghazi_bust_trey_gowdy_and_his_gop_colleagues_embarrassed_themselves/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh513%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Hillary%20Clinton%20Faces%20GOP%20Grilling%20on%20Benghazi%2C%20Pundits%20React&summary=What%20everyone%27s%20saying%20about%20Hillary%20Clinton%27s%20testimony%20before%20the%20House%20Benghazi%20committee.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh513%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh513%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/10/14/3712578/richard-hanna-benghazi-clinton/", "http://www.redstate.com/2015/10/23/back-past-dems-still-blame-video-benghazi/", "http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-10-23/benghazi-committee-briefly-keeps-partisanship-at-bay", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh513%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:21:34.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
