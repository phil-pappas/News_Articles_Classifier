Some time is needed to fully evaluate the impacts of the agreement on our industry, but DFC's initial assessment is that in order to secure this trade agreement for Canada , the sum of access granted in the dairy industry projects to be 3.25% of Canada's 2016 milk production. The milk displaced by this agreement will never be produced in Canada , and will result in perpetual lost revenue for our farmers, and for the Canadian economy.\n\"We obviously would have preferred that no additional market access be conceded in the dairy sector,\" said DFC President, Wally Smith . \"However, we recognize that our government fought hard against other countries' demands, and have lessened the burden by announcing mitigation measures and what seems to be a fair compensation package, to minimize the impact on Canadian dairy farmers and make up for cutting growth in the domestic market. We have come a long way from the threat of eliminating supply management. The government has clearly understood the importance of supply management dairy farms in rural Canada and the economic activities they generate.\"\nSmith continued: \"We intend to continue to diligently work to preserve a strong and sustainable Canadian dairy industry. Ensuring fair and predictable revenue for farmers has been at the heart of my mandate. Like my fellow dairy farmers, I am disappointed that additional access was granted in this deal. However, we remain as always, proud Canadian entrepreneurs and pillars in our communities, who are dedicated to producing high quality milk.\"\nA recent Environics survey shows that Canadians want Canadian milk, from Canadian farms, and Canadian dairy farmers will continue to provide it. We thank Canadians for their support and invite them to continue choosing dairy products made of 100% Canadian Milk.\nDFC would also like to thank all dairy farmers from across the country, provincial governments, and Canadians who participated in the Canadian Milk Matters campaign, sending over 210,000 letters of support to our Canadian elected leaders.\nAbout DFC\nDairy Farmers of Canada (DFC) strives to create favourable conditions for the Canadian dairy industry, today and in the future. DFC works to maintain policies that foster the viability of Canadian dairy farms and to promote quality Canadian dairy products made from 100% Canadian milk as part of a healthy balanced diet.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C5920&Transmission_Id=201510051040CANADANWWEB______C5920&DateId=20151005"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:58:04.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
