The legislation would not require them to put the money in a separate bank account or a lawyer's trust. \nThe trust obligation would end when the retentions were paid out in full or were used to fix defective work, and the law change included penalties if the funds were wrongly used. \nLabour and Greens said the change was overdue, and that the Government should have acted before a big company failed. \nThe legislation originally did not include the provision for retention payments. But after a number of submitters raised it during the select committee process, an amendment was later added by Dr Smith. \nLabour MP Clayton Cosgrove said the amendment amounted to a U-turn by the Government because former Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson had not expressed an interest in improving sub-contractors' rights after Mainzeal's failure. \nGreen Party MP Julie Anne Genter described the law change as a win for builders. \n\"I'm really pleased to see the Government has finally listened to the building industry â€¦ because for a long time it didn't look likely.\" \nThe measure was part of the Construction Contracts Amendment Bill, which was backed unanimously in Parliament this afternoon. \nThe bill would also clarify that people involved in both commercial and residential contracts could get equal access to dispute resolution services. It was previously unclear how the services in the Construction Contracts Act applied to residential contracts. \nThe scope of the Act would also be widened to include construction services such as architects and surveyors. \n- By Isaac Davison of the New Zealand Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:22:59.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
