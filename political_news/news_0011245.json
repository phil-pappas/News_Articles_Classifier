He speaks directly to the camera.\nThe scene shifts to an actress in a business setting. A graphic overlay says marijuana legalization would create 30,000 jobs and establish 1,100 small businesses. The final scene is another actress on a city street. A graphic overlay says, “Billions in tax revenue for local safety services.”\nScript: “I’m Nick Lachey. Ohio is my home. I care very deeply about the people here, which is why I’m very proud to be part of the movement that’s going to create jobs, reinvigorate our economy and improve the safety of our cities.”\nActress 1: “It’ll give me a chance to open a business or a job to pay off my college loans.”\nActress 2: “And legalizing marijuana will provide tax revenue for local safety services. Let’s do what the politicians haven’t done. For marijuana legalization, vote no on 2 and yes on 3.”\nAnalysis: Nick Lachey’s heyday was as a member of a popular boy band and, briefly, as a reality-TV star and Jessica Simpson’s husband. Now, Lachey is a businessman and investor in the ResponsibleOhio for-profit marijuana ballot proposal (and has a different wife). But Lachey is an invisible man on the Ohio voter rolls; he’s not registered to vote in Ohio, even though he says in the ad, “Ohio is my home.”\nThe hardest thing to prove is Lachey’s comment that legalizing marijuana would “invigorate the economy.”\nThe ad says legalizing marijuana would create 30,000 jobs and establish 1,100 small businesses. A task force created by Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters (who supports legalization) estimated that 35,000 jobs would be created in the marijuana industry in Ohio. The amendment would permit 1,159 marijuana shops to be opened. The state has not verified job-creation estimates.\nClaims that legalizing marijuana would make communities safer and provide “billions” for local safety services are debatable. Although legalization would end marijuana arrests and prosecution, Colorado’s experience indicates that the black market would continue.\nThe most-optimistic tax-revenue estimates indicate that it would take years to generate “ billions for public safety.” The state Office of Budget and Management estimated that a maximum of $300 million a year would go to local governments, but not all that would be earmarked for public safety.\nThe more rosy ResponsibleOhio estimate was $564 million per year, but again, money would go to roads, bridges and other projects in addition to public safety.\n— Alan Johnson \najohnson@dispatch.com \n@ohioaj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:38:15.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
