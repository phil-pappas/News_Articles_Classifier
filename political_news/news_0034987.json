Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nThe Coalition has gone from being perennially behind under Tony Abbott to being commandingly ahead under Turnbull.\nAdvertisement This gives him the blessing of enormous public goodwill â€“ and the curse of impossible expectations.\nHe is the most popular new prime minister of the past two decades, based on his debut rating in the Fairfax-Ipsos poll. His net approval rating is higher than those of John Howard, Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott.\nOn a test of 10 positive leader attributes, most Australians rate Turnbull as possessing all of them. On the basis of their poll debuts, Turnbull is regarded as more competent than Howard, more open to ideas than Gillard and a stronger leader than Abbott. And he is rated as better in every way than Labor leader Bill Shorten.\nBut the numbers that will most transfix the party machine officials will be the primary vote figures, where Labor has slumped to a dire 30 per cent, down 6 per cent in a month. This is 3 points lower than at the last election. If this persists into next year, Labor will start to consider drastic measures.\nThe Coalition, by contrast, has a primary vote of 45 per cent, about on par with the 46 that carried it to a big win in 2013.\nOf the leaders of the last two decades, the one who came closest to Turnbull's stratospheric popularity is Rudd. Where Turnbull starts out with net approval of 51 per cent, Rudd started with 47.\nAnd here lies an object lesson for our novice Prime Minister. Despite his initial star power, Rudd was gone in two years. Why?\nOne, he broke a core promise to the people in walking away from climate change. Two, he mistreated his colleagues.\nThe lesson for Turnbull is to keep the faith with the people and to bring his colleagues along. Yet the people's faith is so enormous that disappointment is inevitable.\nAs long-time Greek prime minister Constantine Karamanlis said: \"We are given to the cult of personality; when things go badly we look to some messiah to save us. If, by chance, we think we have found one, it will not be long before we destroy him.\"\nWelcome to your ministry, Malcolm.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/more-love-in-the-air-at-parliament-since-malcolm-turnbull-elected-prime-minister-20151018-gkbybx.html", "http://e.infogr.am/_/Os3LwVEdkj2BnuNhfnbN?src=embed", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax", "http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-national-news/congested-level-crossings-not-on-labors-removal-list-6958636.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/dog-days-for-labor-as-coalition-surges-under-malcolm-turnbull-20151018-gkbx59.html"], "published": "2015-10-19T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:59:06.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
