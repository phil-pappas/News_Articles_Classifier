But it was always means to the end, you see? My real dream was to run Congress,\" the Atlanta rapper says in the comedy video. \"That's why I'm officially announcing my candidacy for speaker of the House.\" \nHis put his presidential aspirations aside when he realized he was too young for the role -- he's 29, six years shy of the minimum to run -- and decided that speaker of the House was a better spot because \"anyone can be speaker.\" \nIn the video, he lays out reasons for why he wants the job: The speaker of the House has \"super powers\" and that he or she is third in line for the presidency. \nHis plans if he wins include implementing \"cool things\" like marijuana legalization, women's rights and gun control, and blocking \"stupid\" things such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, voter ID laws and a wall between the United States and Mexico. \n\"You don't want 'Paul Ryan: Mall Cop' as speaker of the House,\" he said, referencing Ryan's actual potential bid for the spot and a movie starring Kevin James. \n\"But weed is legal in D.C. as long as you smoke in your house, and I'm definitely going to smoke in my House of ... Representatives,\" he says, ending the video with a laugh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:38:57.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
