There is no attempt to reform the police. The only thing she is doing is justifying the cut in funding. The police will need major reform and not so much in the near future as some time ago. The police cannot go on being the catch-all, having a requirement to patrol and to deal with crime, to respond to all burglaries yet still investigate them. To deal with traffic matters, yet only respond to essential crimes. To cut out the fat, yet do the work of other departments that they cannot do.Reform please. That's what it needs and when I was a police officer, that's what everyone wanted. On here we have weekly pleas from serving officers saying that they cannot deal with the mentally ill, those that require social services 'out of hours', and more and more. They obviously want change but it will mean effort from the government and particularly the Home Office, so no chance of that.May is after only one thing, and that is Cameron's job. She was recently slapped down at the party conference and that must have hurt. But let's make this clear: she has not reformed the police, she has not tried to reform the police, it is not her intent to reform the police. The only think I can think of as a positive in her case is that she's not as bad as Blunkett was. But give her a bit more time. I think she's a natural for the top spot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:42:31.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
