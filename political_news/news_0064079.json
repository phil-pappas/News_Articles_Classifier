This requires huge amounts of unnecessary establishment funding in addition to funding for children that don’t even attend. \nIn Whangarei, Maungatapere School Principal Judy Eagles says that in the public sector, schools lose funding if students don’t come to school for 20 days.” \n“So where’s the equity in that?” \nShe says extra funding siphoned off for charter schools could create more programmes and provide extra support in her school for teachers and students with special needs. \n“What’s particularly galling is there is just not enough resourcing to deal with the increasingly high needs of children coming into our schools, or for much-needed building upgrades,” says Lynda Stuart. \nAuckland's Fairburn School Principal Frances Nelson says the bar for receiving extra support is getting higher while at the same time there has been a big increase in the number of children starting school with major learning difficulties. \n“This includes children starting school with conditions such as autism that have not been picked up earlier. Five years ago, we could have got funding for many students that we can no longer get funding for.\" \nBetween them, New Zealand's nine publicly-funded charter schools are guaranteed funding for at least 860 students but enrolment figures have shown they have fewer than 700. \nends NZEI Te Riu Roa \nNew Zealand Educational Institute \nNZEI Te Riu Roa members work in every community in New Zealand, leading and advocating for quality public education.
