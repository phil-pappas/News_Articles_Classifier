Voting in Egypt's 13 other provinces will be on Nov. 22-23.\nMany analysts and observers expect a low turnout and a chamber that will support the policies of soldier-turned-President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi rather than challenge him.\nThe vote, for which some 300,000 police and soldiers are deployed to ensure its security, comes at a time when el-Sissi is struggling to revive an ailing economy and crush an Islamic insurgency while silencing domestic opposition.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb219%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Voting%20for%20a%20new%20parliament%20begins%20in%20Egypt", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb219%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Voting%20for%20a%20new%20parliament%20begins%20in%20Egypt&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb219%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Voting%20for%20a%20new%20parliament%20begins%20in%20Egypt", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb219%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb219%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb219%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:35:10.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
