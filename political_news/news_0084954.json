We don't just need to pray for people, we need to act. We need to build a movement.\"\nAfter reflecting on the Oregon shooting, Clinton turned to the politics of gun control.\n\"It is infuriating. Every time there is another massacre, Republicans and the NRA, 'now is not the time to talk about guns.' Yes it is,\" Clinton said. \"But more than talk, it is time to act. But Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families. It is wrong and we need to make every politician who sides with them to look into the eyes of parents whose children have been murdered and explain why they listen to the gun lobbyists instead.\"\nClinton regularly includes gun control in her stump speech, pledging to Democratic audiences that she will make sensible gun control measures a priority in her administration.\nClinton also cast anti-gun control activists as \"single-minded voters.\"\n\"People on the other side who are heartsick, heartbroken, disgusted [about the shootings] care about a lot of other issues,\" Clinton said. \"We are not single-minded voters. But each of us has to care about this issue.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:43:24.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
