Bobby Jindal is trying to inject life into his campaign for president by hitting two birds with one tweet.\nThe Republican, who is languishing near the bottom of the pack in polling, stepped up his attacks on front-runner Donald Trump on Friday -- and this time, he included Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in his line of fire.\n. @TedCruz why won't you stand up to @RealDonaldTrump on single payer healthcare? That's not conservative leadership. https://t.co/v0syXaSAf7\nâ€” Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) October 2, 2015 \"@TedCruz why won't you stand up to @RealDonaldTrump on single payer healthcare? That's not conservative leadership,\" Jindal tweeted, with a link to a post on his website.\nIn the post, Jindal accuses Trump of supporting government-run health care for all, seizing on \"60 Minutes\" comments from Trump that he would \"take care of everybody\" and \"the government's gonna pay for it.\"\nJindal labeled it \"TrumpCare.\"\nThe post takes fellow candidate Cruz to task for not repudiating Trump. Cruz has largely avoided insulting Trump, and Trump has returned the favor.\n\"Even conservative senators like Ted Cruz are complicit,\" Jindal wrote. \"He has distinguished himself by praising Trump's positions and clinging to his events, in the hope of picking up his votes when he eventually fades.\"\nCruz's campaign declined to comment.\nIn the \"60 Minutes\" interview , Trump said he would replace Obamacare with a much better system.\n\"I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not,\" Trump said. \"I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. ... The government's gonna pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://www.bobbyjindal.com/jindal-donald-trump-doesnt-get-it-health-care-is-the-gops-alamo/", "https://t.co/v0syXaSAf7", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-60-minutes-scott-pelley/", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://twitter.com/BobbyJindal/status/649993909838327809", "https://twitter.com/tedcruz", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:25:04.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
