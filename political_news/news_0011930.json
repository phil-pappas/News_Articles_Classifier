John Kasich is describing himself as an independent-mind reformer who can unite the country and help make life better for the American people. \nKasich, a former nine-term congressman who helped to balance the federal budget in the late 1990s as chairman of the House Budget Committee, spoke Wednesday to about 200 people at St. Ambrose University. He decried other presidential candidates who engage in \"yelling and screaming\" while pontificating about their views, although he declined to point any fingers at his competitors in the crowded field of Republicans. \n“We need to stop listening to all the whining and complaining and bombast and figure out who is going to get the problems fixed,” he said. \nMORE CAUCUS COVERAGE ON THE GO: Download Iowa Caucuses iPhone, Android app | Candidate tracker | Full Iowa Caucus coverage \nKasich pointed to his overwhelming re-election victory as governor in 2014 as evidence of his popularity and he predicted he can win Ohio’s critical electoral votes in the 2016 presidential election. He carried 86 of Ohio’s 88 counties in his last gubernatorial campaign. \nHe said people voted for him in Ohio because they felt he was listening to them and because he fixed the state’s finances and helped to create jobs while caring for all the state's residents, including the poor. He vowed to do the same in Washington, D.C. \n“I know how to fix that town. I know how to balance budgets. I know how to rebuild the military. … I know how to get people together,” Kasich said. \nKasich said he’s always been a reformer, pointing to his efforts to rewrite Ohio’s state budget while he was a legislator in his 20s and his push to reform Pentagon spending as a congressman. \nBut he also said bipartisanship is necessary in Washington, adding that President Barack Obama was wrong in passing the Affordable Care Act without Republican support. \n“If you had a marriage where nobody gave, you wouldn’t be married. Life doesn’t work that way,” he said. Buy Photo Ohio Gov. John Kasich sits inside the cab of a John Deere on Tuesday, Aug. 19, 2015, at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa.
