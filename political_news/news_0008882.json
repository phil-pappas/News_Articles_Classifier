Oct. 9, 2015. \nCourt ruling protects flag’s true meaning \nWithout bothering to consult or conduct polls on the matter, let’s all just go out on a limb and agree that flag desecraters are a minority, probably a minuscule one - most likely a smaller minority percentage-wise than the lone Democrat on the nine-member Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. \nThat highest of Texas criminal law courts, peopled by conservatives who on a personal level probably would like to bury a fist in the face of a flag desecrater, decided last week that Texas’ ban on flag desecration is an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. \nThe court upheld a more important, higher principle protected by the First Amendment and symbolized by the flag. Flag desecration, being rare and unpopular, is precisely the kind of exercise of free speech that the truest, red-white-and-bluest believers in the flag’s meaning should be quickest to defend. Those who rolled their eyes at the decision need to understand that it was not an endorsement of flag desecration. \nThe 1989 law struck down by the court was our Legislature’s attempt at a backdoor circumvention of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down an earlier flag protection law. The years it spent on the books untested because it was seldom if ever enforced proves our earlier point about the rarity of flag desecration. \nIn 2012, a 20-year-old man insulted by a racist store clerk in the small town of Lovelady took down the flag on the storefront and tossed it into the street. He was jailed for more than a month because he couldn’t afford bail, and faced up to a year of incarceration and a $4,000 fine. \nProsecutors asserted that the incident was a random expression of anger that did not constitute speech. Like the 1989 statute itself, the prosecutors’ argument was a weak attempt to lawyer their way past smarter lawyers. Judge Sharon Keller responded on behalf of the 6-3 majority that “throwing down a flag could easily be protected expression.” \nIf the defendant’s actions were to be prosecuted as a crime, why not try vandalism based on the flag having been someone else’s property mishandled without the owner’s permission? The defendant had a right to express himself by throwing down a flag - but not that flag, which wasn’t his to throw. \nBut there already have been too many attempts at legal creativity in defense of the flag and at the expense of free speech. Let’s hope the 2017 Legislature will resist the urge to wrap itself in the flag and take another time-wasting crack at outlawing flag desecrations. We can’t imagine anything more un-Texan than trying to outlaw the right of a rare individual to insult everyone else. \n___ \nHouston Chronicle. Oct. 11, 2015. \nHERO works: Voters need to approve the ordinance that uplifts all Houstonians \nAll’s fair in love and local politics, we presume, although a campaign of fear-mongering and false claims against Houston’s equal rights ordinance is unworthy of this city. HERO, Proposition 1 on the November ballot, ought to stand or fall on its own merits, not on outright lies that anti-gay activists and other opponents have been pushing for weeks - with recent assistance from former Astros star Lance Berkman, who did himself no favors with his ill-advised anti-HERO TV ad. Houstonians deserve better. \nAs we’ve written before, and as opponents are well aware, the city’s equal rights ordinance is not about making it lawful for hordes of transgender women to assault little girls in public rest rooms. Opponents also are well aware that indecent exposure, harassment and assault in rest rooms is already illegal. The equal rights ordinance doesn’t change that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:29:55.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
