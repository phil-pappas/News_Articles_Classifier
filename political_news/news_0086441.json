The agency hopes this information will shed light on a recent spate of infections involving antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\" linked to the scopes.\nThe FDA issued the instructions to Olympus American, Fuji Medical Systems and Hoya Corp.\nThe FDA came under fire earlier this year after outbreaks at two Los Angeles hospitals were linked to the duodenoscopes. The specialized fiber-optic scopes are threaded down the throat and stomach to diagnose and treat conditions in the digestive tract.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
