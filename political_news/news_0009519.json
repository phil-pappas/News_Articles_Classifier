I know its not an easy task but it is achievable. \n“If you study the pattern of votes in the region, you realise that since 2004, the NPP’s votes have been decreasing while our keep surging up so with hard work, unity and focus, we can achieve the 50/50 we have set for ourselves,” he concluded to wild applause from the umbrella family. \nGhana will go to the polls in December 2016 to elect members of parliament and a president. Mr Mahama has stiff competition in the NPP’s flagbearer Nana Akufo-Addo. It will be the second time the two candidates will be facing-off in a national elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:43:12.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
