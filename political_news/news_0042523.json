And so my hope would be that he will be in conversation with those North American leaders. That can only support our position in the global discussion,” said Wynne. \nThe Liberal premier was also hopeful that world leaders will reach a global climate change deal at the United Nations summit in Paris this December. And she’s confident that Trudeau, who has invited the premiers and his fellow federal leaders to join him at the Paris conference , will strengthen Canada’s position in fight against global climate change. \n“I think that our voice can be a very strong one, given our geographic size and given the fact that we’re pulling in the same direction now across the country,” said Wynne. \nTrudeau has also promised to hold a first ministers' meeting with the premiers within 90 days of the Paris meeting, where they are expected to discuss federal and provincial approaches to climate change. For instance, he has said he will work with the provinces and territories to set a national carbon price.\nWynne said she is looking forward to more federal leadership on the climate change front, but she also called on Trudeau to support provincial programs that encourage the reduction of greenhouse gases. \n“For example, in Ontario, we’ll be looking to the federal government to help with investments to help people to live up to their commitments around reduction, whether it’s home-retrofit programs, that kind of thing.” \nThe Ontario premier is “happy for the people of Canada,” saying she thinks Canadians now have a prime minister who understands the importance of working with the provinces, not only on climate change but also other issues, including infrastructure. \nTrudeau made headlines during the election campaign when he promised to run three years of federal deficits in order to invest in crumbling infrastructure across the country. Wynne said that Ontario will need to focus on improvements to roads, bridges and transit, while other provinces might have different requirements, such as rail and flood prevention. \nOntario also stands ready to help Trudeau reach one of his most ambitious election promises – to accept 25,000 Syrian refugees by the end of this year. Wynne recently pledged $10.5 million to help more Syrian refugees settle in Ontario. \n“We are very eager to work to get as many refugees as possible. One of the problems we’ve had is that there has been a lot of administrative slowdown in actually moving people into the country. So I hope now we’ll see some of those blockages removed.”\nRelated Stories Can Justin Trudeau deliver on his refugee promise by end of year?
