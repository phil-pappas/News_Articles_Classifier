Wade Supreme Court decision which found that women had a right to privacy. \n\"Let's think about how inconsistent this is,\" Bailey said. \"For example, bald eagles and their eggs are protected by both state and federal laws. In fact, violators face penalties up to $25,000 or fines and prison -- between one and five years.\" \n\"In fact, if you break a bald eagle egg, you can get five years in prison,\" he continued. \"And yet, you can abort a human fetus and get governmental approval? Does that make sense?\" \nBailey seemed unable to wrap his head around the concept: \"A person can be fined $20,000 or get five years in prison for breaking a bald eagle egg, and yet, nothing is done if we abort a fetus!\" \n\"What's of more value? A bald eagle that doesn't have a soul or a human being that has a soul and that will one day live somewhere forever?\" Bailey asked. \nThe Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act passed in 1940 makes it illegal for humans to harm a bald eagle or its eggs. However, there are no known examples of female bald eagles being imprisoned or fined for choosing to destroy their own eggs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:19:02.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
