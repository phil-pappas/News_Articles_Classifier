Tim Scott, R-S.C., to protect America’s small and mid-size businesses from potential health care premium increases under the Affordable Care Act. The Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees (PACE) Act passed the House and Senate last week. Shaheen said Thursday during a press conference call that she was “excited to see that the president last night signed the bill.” The definition of the state-based small group markets was scheduled to change under the ACA from employers with up to 50 employees to include employers with up to 100 employees on Jan. 1, 2016. This change would require many small and mid-sized businesses to be subject to different rating rules and requirements, with the potential of increasing the health insurance premiums for small businesses, their employees and their families. “This change is important for New Hampshire, for South Carolina and other states across the country,” Shaheen said. “It allows the states to determine small group size.” She added that Granite Staters want to see Democrats and Republicans working together for the good of New Hampshire and the country. “I appreciate Sen. Scott’s work on the Republican side to get this passed as I worked on the Democratic side,” Shaheen said. “It received unanimous consent through both houses and this can be a bipartisan model to be used again in the future.” With the PACE Act signed into law, states will have the flexibility to determine whether to keep small group market sizes the same or to update them. Shaheen said New Hampshire has implemented the up to 50 employees option in the small group market for the ACA. “It’s working for New Hampshire,” she said. “This legislation makes a helpful change to the law for small and mid-size businesses by limiting potential premium increases and letting the states determine what’s best for their market.” Projections were that the small group market would raise premiums up to 8 percent if there were premium increases for small groups defined as 100 or more. “If those larger groups had younger, healthier employees, they may choose to opt out of the market,” Shaheen said. “But, the budget office has determined there will be no drop off of those covered under the Affordable Care Act,” she said. “We may see savings as high as 18 percent in some places with this law.” The PACE Act is backed by a coalition representing small and mid-sized businesses, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Retail Federation, National Restaurant Association, National Federation of Independent Business, and has bipartisan support from state regulators and health policy experts. “I’m very pleased that, in this instance, Congress rose above the partisan squabbling to make this improvement to the health care reform bill and I hope it’s a good omen for further cooperation,” Shaheen said.
