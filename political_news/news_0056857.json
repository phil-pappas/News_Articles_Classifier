The Pilgram Group, which owns and operates the New York Subs and Wings restaurant, has invited local veteran Daniel Matos and contest winner Brian Jacobs of DB Collective to watch the Dolphins take on the Texans from the Group's luxury suite at Sun Life Stadium in Miami, Florida .\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151019/278447\n\"The Pilgram Group is committed to giving back, so we are excited for the opportunity to offer this experience to one of my fellow veterans,\" said Miguel Pilgram , CEO of the Pilgram Group. \"As Veterans Day approaches, we are reminded of all the sacrifices veterans have made, and, as a group, we couldn't let this day pass without finding a way to recognize someone who served and sacrificed for us.\"\nLocal veteran, Daniel Matos , was nominated for this special recognition by Sandra Veszi Einhorn , Executive Director of Rebuilding Together Broward , a local non-profit that provides assistance to the elderly and disabled, especially those living in poverty and veterans.\n\"We were honored to select a veteran to partake in this special experience,\" said Einhorn. \"Nominating Mr. Matos was an easy decision because his love for football is notorious - he spends most of his free time coaching little league football, and he made a tremendous sacrifice in serving his country but continues to find ways to serve his community.\"\nMatos is a U.S. Navy Veteran and Purple Heart recipient who served from 1971 to 1974 and was honorably discharged. During his service, Matos was affected by Agent Orange, and the disease now affects his ability to live a full and productive life.\nThe Pilgram Group will also provide complimentary suite tickets to the October 25 th football game to the New York Subs and Wings restaurant staff and the winner of the New York Subs & Wings Jersey design contest, Brian Jacobs of DB Collective. Jacobs created the winning design for the football jersey the group will be wearing to the game.\nAbout the Pilgram Group\nThe Pilgram Group is a Coral-Springs -based management, investment and renovation company committed to creating stronger communities.
