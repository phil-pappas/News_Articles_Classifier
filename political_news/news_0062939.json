Cliff Bentz , who represents House District 60 and is from Ontario. Bentz said he will join Sen. Ted Ferrioli of John Day, Malheur County judge Dan Joyce and Malheur County commissioners Larry Wilson and Don Hodge at the meeting. \nThe event will take place Thursday, Oct. 29, from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., Mountain Daylight Time, at the high school gymnasium in Adrian, 305 Owyhee Road. Most of Malheur County is on mountain time, though the upper reaches of the Owyhee River in Oregon are on Pacific time. \nAccording to Bentz, as noted in the news release, the meeting is partly in response to a proposal by the Oregon Natural Desert Association of Bend and Keen Footwear of Portland leading a proposal for 2.5 million acres of the Owyhee Canyonlands to be protected as a national monument. Keen conducted a cross-country tour this summer to raise support for declaration of five national monuments. \nOwyhee County residents had previously looked at the proposal and said perhaps 1 million acres would be suitable for protection . The difference in acreage is largely the inclusion of vast areas of uplands, instead of just the canyons, in the environmentalists' proposal. \nThis process only affects the Oregon portion of the Owyhee country, not the upper forks of the river and its tributaries in Idaho or Nevada. Idaho resolved most of its Owyhee land issues with legislation passed in 2009 . \nBentz said that local citizens have formed Citizens in Opposition to the Owyhee Canyonlands Monument Committee as a counterpoint to the protection proposed by the Bend-based environmental group. The committee's website is opposetheocm.com . \nBoth sides have established online petitions regarding federal protection the Owyhee. The Malheur County petition is at change.org and the environmentalists' petition is at wildowyhee.org . \nIn his news release, Bentz said the \"meeting will serve as an open forum for attendees to share their thoughts on the proposed establishment of an Owyhee Canyonlands designation, be it a national monument, national conservation area or wilderness area.''
