Rick Scott said that the state Legislature will tackle the issue during its next regular session. (Photo: Getty) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants to create a massive $250 million fund that he can use to lure companies to the Sunshine State. \nScott says the \"Florida Enterprise Fund\" would allow Florida to compete against other states trying to land manufacturers and other companies. He announced the proposal Thursday during a meeting of the state's economic development agency. \nBut Scott's push comes while the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature has grown skeptical over the need to spend more on business incentives. \nA Senate panel this week grilled the head of Enterprise Florida over the issue. Scott asked the Florida Legislature for $85 million this year to use for business incentives, but legislators set aside about half that amount. \nScott is also proposing that legislative leaders have a final say over any business projects in excess of $1 million.
