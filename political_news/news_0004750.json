(That’s the total number of miles all passengers traveled on these systems over that year.) WMATA logged more than 1.5 billion passenger miles in 2013 for heavy rail. Los Angeles’s bus rapid transit (which emulates the service characteristics of light rail) adds 57 million passenger miles and 9 million passengers.\nMetrorail is substantially larger than the combined light- and heavy-rail and bus rapid transit systems in Los Angeles. But that has nothing to do with whether Los Angeles has “barely a system.” That logic would be akin to saying that the District has “barely a population” when compared with any larger city.\nWilliam B.
