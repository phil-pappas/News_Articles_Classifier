The opposition day motion called for a reversal of the policy but MPs voted against it by 317 to 295.\nThe tax credit cuts would see three million low-paid families losing more than £1,000 a year.\nDespite Labour losing the vote - which had no force in law - the debate saw a number of Tory MPs attack the changes.\nTax Credits Explained: All You Need To Know \nPlay video \"PM Defends Tax Credit Cuts\" Video: PM Defends Tax Credit Cuts Conservative MP for South Cambridgeshire member Heidi Allen used her maiden Commons speech to warn the cuts were \"too hard and too fast\" and that \"something must give\".\n\"The Prime Minister has asked us that everything we do must pass the family test. Cutting tax credits before wages rise does not achieve that,\" said the MP.\n\"Showing children that their parents would be better off not working at all does not achieve that.\n\"Sending a message to the poorest and most vulnerable in our society that we do not care does not achieve that either.\"\nPlymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer called on the Chancellor to do \"something, anything\" to sooth the \"harshest\" effects of the policy.\nSenior Tories David Davis and Zac Goldsmith have also put their names to a cross-party backbench motion for further debate on the changes, due on October 29.\nBaroness Meacher has dropped a plan to table a motion in the House of Lords that could have killed off Mr Osborne's cuts after coming under pressure from the Government.\nThe crossbench peer was warned of a constitutional crisis if the upper chamber defeated the Chancellor's plans, which lead to a push to weaken the powers of the Lords.\nShadow treasury minister Seema Malhotra said the Conservatives were in \"disarray\" and had not \"told the truth\" about the plans.\nStella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, said people would end up further in debt because of the cuts.\nThe changes will half the amount people can earn before their working tax credits start to reduce, from £6,420 to £3,850.\nThey will also mean families can only claim child tax credits for a maximum of two children.\nThe Government says they are vital to reduce the welfare bill and cut the deficit.\nIt argues they will be mitigated by other changes, such as increases in the personal tax allowance and the new National Living Wage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:24:40.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
