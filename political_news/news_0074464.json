Dan Patrick , a onetime critic of sorts whose backing gives the U.S. senator his biggest boost yet back home. \nCalling it \"an important morning in the Republican presidential campaign,\" Cruz convened Patrick and two other statewide officials at his campaign headquarters here to announce their support as well as that of a half-dozen major donors to former Gov. Rick Perry . \n\"We're seeing conservatives unite behind this campaign,\" Cruz declared. \"We're seeing Texans unite behind this campaign.\" \nPatrick, who will serve as the Texas chairman of Cruz's campaign, hailed the senator as the only candidate who can truly energize the GOP base in not only the primary, but also the general election. \n\"Our party has been asleep for more than eight years come election time against the Democrats,\" the lieutenant governor said. Cruz, not known for understatement, returned the praise, saying Patrick would \"crawl through broken glass with a knife between his teeth\" to fight for conservative values. \nThe show of home-state advantage, which also included Railroad Commissioners David Porter and Ryan Sitton , gave Cruz fresh fodder to brag about his inroads here: He has the backing of more than third of Republicans in the Texas Legislature, he has been endorsed by about a quarter of the GOP members of the congressional delegation and he has raised more money from Texas than any other candidate. He now has the support of six financial backers of Perry — perhaps most notably Dallas billionaire Darwin Deason, who had given $5 million to a pro-Perry super PAC before the former governor dropped out of the 2016 race last month. \nIt was also the latest display of how the political currents in the Texas GOP have shifted, at least in Cruz's telling. Asked about the idea of the state being \"Bush country,\" Cruz offered his usual praise for the family but suggested their political brand may be out of date with the GOP failing to win the White House for two elections now. \n\"Texans recognize circumstances have changed. Seven years of Barack Obama in Washington ... means we need something different, No. 1, to win and, No. 2, to actually turn things around once we do it,\" Cruz told reporters, some of whom had made the trip to his campaign headquarters from a nearby summit of top donors to GOP foe Jeb Bush. \nCruz also took the opportunity to highlight Texas' outsized influence in the 2016 nominating process, with its earlier-than-usual primary on March 1. While stressing he is taking nothing for granted, Cruz said his campaign believes \"Super Tuesday is going to be a very, very good day,\" especially when it comes to delegate-rich Texas, the \"crown jewel\" of several Southern states voting that day. Patrick, in turn, promised to make sure Cruz \"has the biggest haul of delegates possible on March 1.\" \nCruz and Patrick were not always as chummy. In the bitter 2012 election that sent Cruz to Washington, D.C., Patrick ultimately supported then-Lt. Gov David Dewhurst and at times tangled with Cruz over Dewhurst's conservative credentials. \nGo here to read the full article from The Texas Tribune.  //kvue.tv/1N2O2zl TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:38.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
