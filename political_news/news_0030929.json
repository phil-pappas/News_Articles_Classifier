Parents of children at a Bavarian grade school were told to cover up their grade school girls so they won’t tempt the Muslim refugees in the gymnasium next door.\nNow this. As part of a school project, German children will be required to cook and clean for refugees. Some parents are outraged.\nOnly some? The migrants have been urinating on the floor and on the women in these refugee centers. Will the children have to clean that too?\nGerman schoolchildren act as servants for “refugees”: putting fresh linen on their beds, tidying up their clothes, preparing food Diversity Macht Frei, October 12, 2015\nA letter to the parents said their children will be going to “refugee” accommodations and will be making beds, sorting clothes, and “ help in the kitchen ” among other things.\nA letter written by the Schleswig-Holstein Ministry of Education and Vocational Training, says “ pupils will spend a day in a transit accommodation and help for example, fix up as beds as well as help in the collection of donations. “\nThis is part of the School’s “ week of projects to help refugees. ”\nA mother posted an extract from a letter that her friend’s son had got from his school. It describes the activities of a project week, including going to help out in an asylum centre. This provoked a flurry of indignation and disbelief, but a local newspaper has confirmed the story.\nThe Kiel Ministry of Education confirmed the letter was authentic. Already this week, as described above, the schoolchildren from a school in Lübeck had put fresh linen on the beds, sorted out clothing and helped out in the kitchen in an accommodation centre for refugees passing through. This took place in the context of a project week intended to prepare the eighth-graders [age about 13-14] for practical work experience. (source)\nOriginal article is in German.
