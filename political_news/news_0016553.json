She has a certain way of doing things and when you start going against that there are no penalties or fines, there's only consequences when you go against natural law,\" Morales said.\nOne Minute Sustainable Development Goals\nDelegates at the conference have formed a 10-point plan to send to the Paris conference, which aims to represent different interests, and those who fear their viewpoints will be ignored.\nAmong the points included in the plan is a demand for industrialised countries to divert military spending to fight the effect of climate change.\nThe plan also calls for the establishment of an international tribunal to prosecute those who commit crimes against nature.\nMorales has called for a unified voice to emerge from among the conference delegates.\nAl Jazeera's Daniel Schweimler reporting from Cochabamba, said many of those attending will be desperate to be heard in Paris, but there was little inclination to listen to them.\n\"What they're saying is that they live with the daily consequences of climate change and while they don't have all the answers, they're suggesting some solutions they say should be considered,\" he said.\nThe Paris conference on climate change will bring together 196 states, including the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases and those most effected by changing weather conditions and rising sea levels.\nOrganisers hope the event will mark a turning point in the transition towards low-carbon economies.\nSource: Al Jazeera", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:09:07.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
