He was 62.\nMeyers played on two Bruins national title teams, as a reserve in 1973 and as the star player in ’75.\nAfter that ’75 season, the 6-foot-8 Meyers was named a consensus All-American and became the second pick in the NBA draft. He was taken by the Lakers. David Thompson from North Carolina State was the first pick.\nNineteen days after the NBA draft, Meyers was part of perhaps the biggest trade in league history. He was sent by the Lakers, along with Junior Bridgeman, Brian Winters and Elmore Smith, to the Milwaukee Bucks for Walt Wesley and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nMeyers, who was born in San Diego in 1953, was one of 11 children of Bob and Pat Meyers. Bob was a basketball star at Marquette University in Milwaukee in the mid-1940s, but eventually settled his family in Southern California. […]\nMeyers was also known as a private person, who shocked the sports world in 1980 — five years into a productive and lucrative pro career with the Bucks — by announcing that he was leaving the NBA to spend more time with his family.\n“Remember, David played for an unbelievable teacher at UCLA,” Meyers Drysdale said, referring to Wooden. “He was taught more about life than about basketball.”\nMeyers returned to California, and after a stint in sales for Motorola received his teaching certificate and taught elementary school — mostly fourth and sixth grade — for more than 30 years. He began teaching in Yorba Linda and later taught in Temecula.\nDave Meyers was one year ahead of me at Sonora High School, La Habra, California. He lead our basketball team to CIF championship in 1971. He was always a gentle soul and will be sorely missed.", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-dave-meyers-20151010-story.html", "http://proteinwisdom.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-tweet-button/tweetn.png", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fproteinwisdom.com%2F%3Fp%3D57775&#038;text=RIP%20Dave%20Meyers%20%5BDarleen%20Click%5D&#038;related=&#038;lang=en&#038;count=horizontal&#038;counturl=http%3A%2F%2Fproteinwisdom.com%2F%3Fp%3D57775", "http://proteinwisdom.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/meyers-sportsillustrated.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:39:50.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
