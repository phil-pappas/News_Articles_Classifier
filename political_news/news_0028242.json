Peters Photo Larry David, left, as Senator Bernie Sanders and Kate McKinnon as Hillary Rodham Clinton during a Saturday Night Live sketch. Credit Dana Edelson/NBC Senator Bernie Sanders seemed quite pleased with the send-up he received on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live” this weekend, suggesting in an interview Sunday morning that maybe Larry David, who impersonated him, should sub for him on the campaign trail. Mr. David was a dead ringer for Mr. Sanders, nailing the candidate’s distinctive stage presence: his clipped Brooklyn cadence, his arm flailing, his sometimes endearing grumpiness. “We’re doomed!” Mr. David said, launching into one of the Vermont senator’s signature rants against Wall Street banks. “And why do they chain all their pens to the desks?” he continued. “Who’s trying to steal a pen from a bank? Makes no sense.” He went on: “I own one pair of underwear. That’s it. Some of these billionaires, they own three, four pairs!” If Mr. David’s impersonation seemed uncannily spot-on, there’s probably a good reason for that. Both men were raised in Brooklyn around the same time. Mr. Sanders was born in 1941, Mr. David in 1947. Mr. Sanders was not the only candidate to get the “S.N.L.” treatment. Kate McKinnon reprised her impersonation of Hillary Rodham Clinton. “I think you’re really going to like the Hillary Clinton that my team and I have created for this debate,” Ms. McKinnon said, spoofing the candidate as a tightly wound megalomaniac. “She’s warm but strong. Flawed but perfect.” Turning to Mr. David as Mr. Sanders, she said: “It must be fun to cuss and scream in public. I have to do mine into tiny little jars.” On ABC’s “This Week,” the real Mr. Sanders, sounding a lot like Mr. David, insisted that the rich would need to pay a higher tax rate. And he cussed a little. “We’ll come up with that rate, but it’ll be a damn lot higher than it is right now,” he said. Fri.
