(Mursel Coban/AP) By David Ignatius Opinion writer October 15 at 8:41 PM Follow @ignatiuspost A Syrian Kurdish militia that was initially seen by U.S. commanders as a sideshow has emerged as the strongest U.S.-backed force against the Islamic State — forcing a hasty reevaluation of U.S. strategy after the collapse of a $500 million plan for training and equipping Syrian rebels.\nU.S. military commanders are now recommending a “ Syria first ” strategy that relies on the Kurdish fighters and a smaller Arab force to move gradually toward the Islamic State’s capital of Raqqa, just 25 miles south of the Kurds’ forward positions. The decisive battle for Raqqa could come in the spring. The stalemated campaign in Iraq and other parts of Syria probably would be left for later.\nDavid Ignatius writes a twice-a-week foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog.

The main force of about 25,000 fighters is called the People’s Protection Units , or YPG, from its Kurdish initials. This group has formed an alliance with about 5,000 Arab tribal fighters from Raqqa and Hasakah, in northeast Syria. The umbrella command has just been dubbed the Syrian Democratic Forces , or SDF.\nRussia’s military intervention complicates the budding U.S. partnership with the Kurds and their Arab allies. Russian operatives were reportedly seen in Hasakah in the past few days, discussing a possible military alliance with the Kurds. Russian boldness in talking to the United States’ favorite fighters is another sign that Moscow is bidding for overall leadership of the anti-extremist fight — without any strong U.S. pushback.\nAnother complication to the Kurdish strategy is Turkey, which fears U.S. aid will embolden the YPG’s allies in the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which Turkey regards as a terrorist group.
