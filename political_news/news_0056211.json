Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have agreed to a deal to repair and improve the nation’s largest transit system. If these two quarrelsome politicians stick to their promises, millions of commuters who now endure delays and breakdowns, especially those who ride the city’s antiquated subways, will be the ultimate winners. Under the agreement, the state will provide $8.3 billion while the city will contribute $2.5 billion toward the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s five-year $29 billion capital plan — the biggest in the authority’s history. The city’s contribution is a sharp increase over an earlier pledge of only $657 million. The state contribution is always much larger because the governor has far more control over the system. Although the M.T.A. serves the suburbs and provides bus service in the city, it is the subway system that desperately needs help. Commuters, especially those who ride the subway, have long complained of stalled trains, packed trains and no trains at all (usually on weekends). As a result, more than half of the $29 billion capital budget — about $15.5 billion — is promised for the subways, where the annual number of rides now reaches 1.8 billion. Part of the money will be used to design and build the next stage of the Second Avenue subway to relieve overcrowding on trains along Manhattan’s East Side. Also on the list are an estimated 940 new subway cars to replace 50-year-old cars that often stall or run without air-conditioning in the summer. Other priorities include upgraded safety and communications systems, at least 1,800 new buses and new elevators to replace those that haven’t worked for years. Recent mayors have routinely shorted the system. A report for the New York Public Interest Research Group in January by the city’s Independent Budget Office showed that city funding ran about $100 million a year by the end of Michael Bloomberg’s time in office as he turned his attention to private funding for extending the No. 7 line to Manhattan’s Far West Side. Mr. de Blasio’s $2.5 billion commitment comes with important conditions. The agreement includes a promise by the state not to divert funds from the M.T.A. to the general budget or use the city contribution elsewhere in the M.T.A.’s vast system. It is still not clear how Mr. Cuomo and the State Legislature will provide the state’s share. Mr. Cuomo has said the money will come from the state’s general fund, which means that upstate legislators may try to get an equal contribution for bridges and roads. To fund transportation needs, the governor and the Legislature should entertain other options, like an increased gasoline tax or tolls on toll-free bridges into Manhattan. In announcing the deal, Mr. Cuomo rightly called the M.T.A. the “lifeblood of New York.” Now he and Mr. de Blasio need to continue working together to modernize this system and make it work for millions of New Yorkers.   13, 2015, on page A24   A Deal to Fix the Subways.
