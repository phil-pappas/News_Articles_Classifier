This survey of over 100,000 High There! users, done in conjunction with the Coalition for Responsible Cannabis Production (the \" Coalition\"), focuses on consumer protection, and comes on the heels of an announcement of a partnership with District of Columbia Attorney General Karl A. Racine focused on reducing the incidence of the use of synthetic drugs and more effectively prosecuting those producing and distributing it.\nThe survey reveals that clean products, plants and overall safety are top priorities for cannabis consumers, with over 55% of respondents saying that the quality of marijuana and pesticide free marijuana were the most important issues to them. However, the most concerning statistic revealed that over 34% of individuals did not know the legality or dangers synthetic marijuana.\n\"Our first survey on consumer preferences within the cannabis community is indeed a revealing and significant one,\" says Todd Mitchem , co-founder and CEO of High There! and executive member of the Coalition. \"Not only did this survey uncover how important clean growing practices and technology are to the consumer, but this survey also revealed the need for education about the dangers of synthetic marijuana. I am proud that it was this information helped inform Attorney General Racine, The District of Columbia , and the Coalition set a course for a national standard for safety. As a technology company we have a responsibility to give our users a voice and now we have.\"\n\"A major goal of the Coalition is to educate the public about the fraud of synthetic drugs being anything like marijuana,\" says Fred Nihaus, spokesperson of the Coalition for Responsible Cannabis Production. \"This survey proves that there is still much work to be done. Responsible users of legal cannabis need to know that synthetic drugs are not safe. We stand with Attorney General Racine on this initiative because the Coalition, made up of responsible producers of legal cannabis, want to support responsible cannabis production standards and protocols in order to eliminate unscrupulous and illegal drug dealers.\"\nIn addition to giving consumers a voice to lawmakers through surveys, High There! will continue its work with the Coalition, whose mission is to develop industry production standards and protocols which ensure public health and safety, promote consumer protection and support law enforcement efforts relating to overseeing the industry in a consistent manner. Mitchem and High There! just wrapped up a private meeting with key D.C. lawmakers, other coalition members and Attorney General Racine in Washington. The purpose of this meeting was to educate all in attendance on standards being created to better protect consumers and keep them safe.\n releases/survey-shows-that-30-of-consumers-dont-know-the-dangers-of-synthetic-marijuana-300152536.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=SF17255&Transmission_Id=201510011000PR_NEWS_USPR_____SF17255&DateId=20151001", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/survey-shows-that-30-of-consumers-dont-know-the-dangers-of-synthetic-marijuana-300152536.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:46:04.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
