Several dozen other people had been invited by the Nunciature in Washington, D.C., to greet the pope as he prepared to leave for New York City, and they met the pope briefly, due to the \"pope's characteristic kindness and availability,\" wrote Fr. Federico Lombardi, director of the Holy See Press Office.\nDavis is the elected clerk of Rowan County, Ky., who became a controversial figure when she was briefly jailed for her refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\nWhen Davis' lawyers announced late Tuesday that she had met with Pope Francis, and that he had hugged her, gave her two pairs of rosaries, and told her to \"stay strong,\" it touched off a heated controversy. Up until now, the Vatican would only confirm that the two had met briefly. The Vatican's Friday statement said that it hoped the additional points it contained would \"contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired.\"\n  Job growth disappoints at 142,000 in September, unemployment rate 5.1 percent Following August's disappointing 173k mark, economists had expected a rebound to 203k new payroll jobs.\nBy Joseph Lawler â€¢ 10/02/15 8:31 AM Top  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:33:38.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
