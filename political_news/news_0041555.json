Due to an injury suffered while on deployment in Afghanistan , Boardman had a titanium plate implanted on his spine and found it difficult and painful to do much more than sit on the couch.\nThis injury, coupled with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), left Boardman withdrawn from life, using his injury as an excuse to remain inactive. He found himself weighing 325 pounds and in the worst shape of his life. It wasn't until Boardman became involved with the Physical Health and Wellness (PH&W) program at Wounded Warrior Project ® (WWP) that he decided not to be defined by his injuries.\nThrough WWP, Boardman provided a gym membership and personal trainer at Lifetime Fitness, a move that he credits with changing his life. \"Wounded Warrior Project set me up with a personal trainer at Lifetime Fitness, who worked with my physical therapist at the VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) to develop a workout plan that strengthened my back and helped me overcome my limitations,\" says Boardman.\nIn the 13 months since beginning the program, Boardman has lost over 100 pounds and feels better than he has in years. When asked if he has any words of encouragement for his fellow veterans who are dealing with obesity, Boardman says, \"No matter what your limitations are, you can overcome them. Get out there and live your life. There are people who can help you.\"\nThe WWP PH&W program is designed to reduce stress, combat depression, and promote an overall healthy and active lifestyle by encouraging participation in fun, educational health and wellness activities.\nAbout Wounded Warrior Project\nThe mission of Wounded Warrior Project ® (WWP) is to honor and empower Wounded Warriors. WWP's purpose is to raise awareness and to enlist the public's aid for the needs of injured service members, to help injured servicemen and women aid and assist each other, and to provide unique, direct programs and services to meet their needs.
