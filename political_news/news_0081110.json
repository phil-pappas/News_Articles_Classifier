The brig is under consideration as a site for housing terrorist prisoners from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Brad Nettles/Staff, File × HANAHAN - U.S. Sen. Tim Scott will tour the terrorist prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in the coming days for an in-person look at the lockup the Obama administration wants to close and send up to 50 of the inmates to the U.S. mainland, possibly including the Navy brig in Charleston. For security purposes, Scott was vague on when the flight is leaving but said it would include other senators and depart from Joint Base Andrews, outside of Washington, D.C. He referred to the visit as a fact-finding tour that would particularly look at the cost of replicating the security in the U.S. that’s currently is in existence in Cuba. “Not just in dollars and cents,” said Scott, R-S.C., but in overall national security. President Barack Obama, acting on a campaign pledge, in recent months has heightened his efforts to close the terrorist holding site and move the 50 or so detainees deemed too dangerous to repatriate to sites on the U.S. mainland. The Pentagon has recently done site suitability visits to prisons in Kansas, Illinois, Colorado and to the Navy Consolidated Brig in Hanahan. Scott opposes any transfer to the U.S. but especially to the brig, saying the community is too vulnerable and that duplicating security to hold terror suspects would be costly. The brig is currently labeled medium security, holding military offenders for sentences of 10 years or less. At a cost of $2.8 million per prisoner per year, Guantanamo is the most expensive prison in the world. The costliest prison in the U.S., Colorado’s federal “Supermax,” runs a taxpayer tab of $78,000 per prisoner per year, according to published reports. Maintaining the prison at Guantanamo has cost the American taxpayer $4.8 billion since it opened in 2002, and an average of $493 million every year for the last five years, says the American Civil Liberties Union. In 2013, taxpayers spent $454 million on detention operations at Guantanamo Bay or about $3.9 million per detainee, the ACLU says at its website. Recent population figures say the number of detainees at Gitmo is down to 116. Of those, some 51 have already been cleared for transfer. But about half of the remaining detainees have been deemed too dangerous to release, which has led to the Pentagon’s search for a secure prison to house them on U.S. soil. Scott said he expected to have close access to where the prisoners are kept in Gitmo, called Camp America. “No place is going to be off limits, from my understanding,” he said. He identified New Hampshire Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte, as also going on the trip. Reach Schuyler Kropf at 937-5551.
