Its release would be hugely distressing to relatives and loved ones. \n\"Ministry staff know confidentiality is paramount when dealing with clients’ data and while this particular breach involved coded data, it follows a number of other high profile leaks of information from other Government departments, including ACC, WINZ and IRD. \n\"Any breach of this magnitude is unacceptable, full stop. \n\"The Ministry must now not only assure New Zealanders its systems are robust, but if any patients’ released details make them identifiable, families should be contacted and offered an apology,\" Annette King says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:16:20.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
