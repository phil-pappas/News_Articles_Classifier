The abstract landscape communicates the uniqueness of our land, light and position and the fern is considered an iconic symbol of New Zealand, used in many different contexts and is a strong part of our heritage and history. \nThis is an important time in New Zealand’s history – it’s the very first time Kiwis have had an opportunity to think which flag best represents them now, and in the future, as individuals and as a nation that is progressive, inclusive and connected to its environment,” said Professor Burrows. \nProfessor Burrows reminded that the first referendum this year between 20 November and 11 December was about considering the possibilities, rather than a final decision on change. \n“This referendum is to rank the alternative flags only, so the most preferred option can be established. It won’t be until the second referendum in March next year when we all make a final decision between keeping the flag or changing it, so there will be plenty of time for us to think about it,” he said. \nThe five flags are available at no cost to communities who have the ability to fly them in close proximity to each other; that is, all five flags flown on five separate flag poles that can Page 2 of 3 \nbe seen from one location. Examples of this would be flying on a street, building or public accessway of some kind, to ensure the public see the all the alternatives equally. \nTo request a set of flags, email info@flag.govt.nz, with a contact name and details (including telephone number and email address). \nExpressions of interest should include photos of the flag poles on which the flags will fly and information on the location of the poles in relation to each other. e.g. a map or sketch showing the location of each flag pole. The flags are 1.8m x 0.9m in size (and one is a different ratio) and suitable for outdoor use. A courier pack will be supplied so the flags can be returned after the referendum. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:40:33.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
