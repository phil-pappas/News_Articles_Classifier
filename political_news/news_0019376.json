(Ryan Remiorz/Canadian Press) \nCBCNews.ca is carrying the NDP's rally live from Vancouver at 4 p.m. ET. \nThe events in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal (following one in Edmonton Friday night) will also serve to rally party activists who will be critical to the party's get-out-the-vote operation — the most expensive and \"impressive,\" in the party's history, according top insiders. \nThere's a frustrated but relentless optimism in the NDP campaign, rooted in pride in the party's organization and hope in its ground strength among voters in districts key to its success. Analysis: Mulcair, Trudeau have their differences, but agree on Harper \nThe core belief among key organizers is that the national polls don't reflect the truth on the ground. Quebec, insiders say, is still very strong, especially among francophone voters. \nIn other regions, polling analysis does not account for discrepancies in strength between ridings, one NDP campaigner explained. A seemingly low number reported in Ontario looks much brighter when it's understood there are some ridings in which the NDP is polling 40 per cent and will likely win seats. '[The Conservatives] threw a dead cat on the table.' — NDP insider \nBut the optimism is also rooted in the feeling much of what has happened to NDP support over the final four weeks of the campaign was beyond the party's control. \n\"We were running away with it,\" one insider told CBC News. And then along came the niqab. The source said it's clear to him that Conservative campaigners felt the NDP was running too hot, and needed to have its support struck down. \nSuccess for the Conservatives in many ridings relies on modest support for the NDP, blocking support from the Liberal party. NDP Leader Tom Mulcair signs autographs during Friday's rally in Edmonton. (Hannah Thibedeau/CBC) \nAnd the NDP's early strength was concerning for Conservatives. \n\"I don't know if they [the Conservatives] knew it was coming,\" one source said of the Federal Court of Appeal's ruling on the niqab. But when it arrived, \"they ran with it.\" \n\"They decided we need to be killed,\" the NDP insider said, and \"they threw a dead cat on the table.\" \nThat dead cat struck the NDP hard. \nThe party found itself on the outside of public opinion in Quebec, where the NDP relies on support from a coalition of Bloc and other largely francophone supporters. \nThat fact resulted in a 15-point drop in the public opinion polls in two weeks in Quebec, and a five-point drop in Ontario, as well, NDP analysis suggests. Mulcair responds to Conservative newspaper endorsements 0:40 Biased toward Trudeau? \nBut the real trouble for the NDP was not the niqab (support has bounced back in Quebec), it was the narrative of failure and loss that accompanied the niqab-driven decline. Some in the NDP camp believe the media has overplayed pictures and footage of Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, seen here with his son Hadrien on Oct. 12. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press) \nThere's also a belief in some corners of the NDP campaign team that the media was biased toward more alluring pictures and video of the younger Justin Trudeau (and his young and handsome family) over pictures of grandfatherly Tom Mulcair. \nThe visual narrative is important in a campaign and it's crucial for a party to tell a strong visual story to engage photographers and videographers. \nThat's why the party is focusing on holding large rallies on this final weekend of the campaign, to tell the story of public support and strength. \nTom Mulcair and Rachel Notley in Edmonton #elxn42 pic.twitter.com/8zJ6g5h1is — @HannahThibedeau \nBut the party is also working to convert the support it has into seats by using more paid organizers than ever before and focusing a larger share of its campaign budget on supporting that ground game. \nBy comparison, the NDP believes the Liberal efforts have been focused on the air war — advertisements and the leader's tour — a tactic that has won it broad support in this campaign that may be difficult to harness into seats. \nBut the NDP are wary the Liberal support could grow even further. If that happens, the Liberal strength would be realized with larger numbers of MPs elected to the House of Commons. \nA collapse in Conservative support is largely beneficial to the NDP, say insiders, with better chances for the party to pick up seats in British Columbia, southwestern Ontario and possibly in Saskatchewan — but not in Atlantic Canada, where the Liberals would be the beneficiaries. Buoyed NDP hopes \nThe question of how to counter Trudeau's apparent popularity has gone largely unanswered until this week. Mulcair: PM should meet House \"very rapidly\" 0:51 \nThe story of Dan Gagnier's advice on lobbying from inside the Liberal campaign and his subsequent resignation has buoyed NDP hopes and given the party a hammer with which to smash at Trudeau's so-far clean image. \nIt was almost with glee Thursday and Friday the party went after Trudeau, comparing the Gagnier story to the worst Liberal excesses during the sponsorship scandal. \nExpect that to continue straight through until Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:35:39.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
