Among those having Power Purchase Agreements, Adani Power, NTPC and WBPDCL participated in the e-auction and picked up coal,\" sources in know of the development told dna.\nThese companies, having long-term or medium-term PPA, had to bid above a base price, which was at a premium of 20% over notified price.\nFor the rest, with short term or without PPA, a floor price of 40% above notified price was fixed.\n\"The reserve price of coal for power plants having long or medium-term PPA would be CIL notified price plus 20%. For other plants, having short-term PPAs or without PPAs, CIL notified price for Power Sector plus 40% would be applicable,\" the notification for the floor price said.\nThis steep premium to notified price is being seen as the key reason why half of the coal on offer remained unsold.\n\"Globally, coal prices have remained depressed for long and are also expected to fall further. At this time, charging such high premium over notified price was unreasonable. This we believe is one way of boosting Coal India's profits,\" said one coal trader.\nThe identities of the buyers who do not have supply pacts with Coal India are not known, but their response was poor.\n\"For the non-PPA consumers, coal mostly from the Western Coalfields got picked up probably by those who are located close to the specific mines,\" sources said.\nCoal minister in August announced a plan to open a dedicated window, called 'Special e-auction for 2015' to the power sector, under which a 10 million tonne of coal would be sold during the remaining part of the year.\n\"The special scheme is aimed to make an earmarked quantity of coal available for supply through e-auction to the power plants which are stressed or in short supply of coal. All power plants already commissioned or being commissioned in 2015-16, are eligible to apply for the special e-auction window for the quantity to the extent of shortfall between its normative requirement and the availability of coal from all sources,\" the notification had said.\nWith only 2.4 million getting sold in the first phase, the government would try to push the rest of the quantity during the rest of the year.\nWith the conclusion of the first phase of the auction for the power sector, the government would now come up with another round of auction, this time for the non-power consumers including captive power plants (CPPs) for which 4 million tonne have been allocated, sources said.\n\"A new scheme called 'Exclusive e-auction scheme for non-power consumers (including CPPs)' has been evolved. It aims to provide coal to the end-use plants currently having tapering linkages and those now drawing coal under MoU route at the existing level on MoU best effort basis up to September 30,\" the announcement of the scheme said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:54:36.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
