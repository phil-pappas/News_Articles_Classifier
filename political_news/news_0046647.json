By Katie Schoolov District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis speaks to the media on Aug. 20, 2013, about a lottery scam. \nMembers will meet with President Barack Obama on Thursday to discuss the issues. \n\"Today I stand with my law enforcement counterparts from across the country in calling for criminal justice reform,\" Dumanis said. \"This new coalition will focus attention and momentum on appropriate alternatives to incarceration that will continue public safety and on alternatives that can be made in a thoughtful way and that will include resources for treatment.\" \nThe group includes the police chiefs of the nation's largest cities such as William Bratton of New York, Charlie Beck of Los Angeles and Garry McCarthy of Chicago, as well as prosecutors from around the country, including Dumanis; Benjamin David, the district attorney for New Hanover and Pender County, North Carolina; as well as Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. \nAccording to the group, the incarceration rate in the United States has reached a crisis point and over-relying on incarceration does not help bring down crime. In fact, incarcerating non-violent offenders for low-level crimes such as drug offenses can take time and vital resources away from preventing serious and violent crimes. \nThe Law Enforcement Leaders group said more than 50 percent of prison and jail inmates have a diagnosed mental illness , and 65 percent of prisoners meet medical criteria for substance abuse and addiction. Many of those need treatment, not arrest and jail time, the group said. \nReducing incarceration will improve public safety because people who need treatment for drug and alcohol problems or mental health issues will be more likely to improve and reintegrate into society if they receive consistent care, something relatively few jails or prisons offer, according to the group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:04:10.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
