Fairfax Media has confirmed Jamie Briggs was facing a demotion to the backbench after last month's bruising leadership spill and subsequent reshuffle.\nBut his immediate ministerial career was saved by Bruce Billson's unexpected decision to turn down a ministerial position because it would have meant being dumped from cabinet.\nMr Briggs was appointed Cities Minister in the reshuffle but Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull first offered the portfolio to Victorian MP Bruce Billson. Mr Billson declined to accept what would have been a demotion from cabinet to sit in the outer ministry and so turned the position down. Mr Turnbull then offered the job to Mr Briggs who accepted.\nJamie Briggs was saved by Bruce Billson's decision to turn down a ministerial position.

Mr Briggs was a staffer in the former Howard government. He entered Parliament in 2008 in the Mayo byelection, which was caused by the retirement of former foreign minister Alexander Downer.\nMr Briggs has in the past been touted as a potential prime minister as have his Victorian colleagues Kelly O'Dwyer, who entered Parliament a year later, and Josh Frydenberg who arrived in Canberra in 2010. But the Victorian pair leapfrogged Mr Briggs by entering cabinet in last month's reshuffle.\nJamie Briggs denies his injury was the result of any tangle with the table. Photo: Andrew Meares\nThe day after the leadership spill, Mr Briggs was photographed injured and being pushed around Parliament House in a wheelchair by his South Australian colleague Dr. Andrew Southcott.\nHe denies he sustained his injury at Tony Abbott's spill night party in the prime ministerial suite where a marble table was shattered after someone danced on top it. Mr Briggs initially said he hurt his leg running but has also suggested he hurt it during events on spill night. He said he had already \"limped back\" to his own office before the table was broken. Mr Abbott has agreed to pay for the costs after Labor highlighted the damage at Senate estimates.\nFollow Latika Bourke on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Latika-M-Bourke-132583706779458/"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:34:59.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
