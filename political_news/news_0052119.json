It's up to states to protect endangered animals and the buying and selling of illegal animal products within the United States, according to supporters of Initiative 1401, which goes to voters next month. \nI-1401 would make it a felony to sell items like elephant ivory, unless it's 100 or more years old and 15% or less of the illegal material. \n\"It's necessary to make sure we here in Washington state make a difference in shutting down the market for these illegally trafficked products,\" said Jennifer Hillman with The Humane Society of the United States, and an I-1401 supporter. \nThe U.S. is the second largest market for illegal animal products. Importing or exporting those items is already a federal crime. \n\"It's going to give us another layer of protection from the federal layer,\" continued Hillman. \"It's going to give Washington voters a chance to say, 'I made a difference in protecting endangered species.'\" \nCritics believe I-1401 will do little to impact the black market of illegal animal product trade, mainly focused in China and Africa. Instead, they contend, it will hurt existing legal traders. \n\"It makes an activity I've engaged in for 40 years a crime,\" said John Regan, owner of the Centralia Antique Market, who is also involved in the campaign against I-1401. \n\"To say that we're sending a message to the world that we're tough on ivory, where in fact there isn't a market to sell that ivory, doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to me,\" he added. \nRegan said the market for illegal or legal animal products like ivory is small in the United States. \nOn the other hand, Hillman and the I-1401 campaign point to statistics from U.S. Fish and Wildlife, indicating 50 seizures of illegal ivory at Washington ports over the last five years. \nHowever, federal officials said Thursday those confiscations only involved 12 people and there were no prosecutions. \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife added it has made 45 total seizures in fiscal year 2015, and all but eight were attributed to incorrect paperwork or permit errors. The other eight, the office said, were undeclared items. \n\"The problem is in Africa,\" said Regan. \"Is ivory coming into the Port of Tacoma or the ports around Seattle? Have we seen any demonstration there's a problem? I haven't seen any.\" \n\"We're making a difference in the marketplace,\" countered Hillman. \"That's what keeps these animals from being killed, when we take them out of the marketplace.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:57:46.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
