All times local.\n___\n11:40 a.m.\nThe Russian defense ministry says Russian jets have made 25 sorties on Islamic State group positions in Syria in the past 24 hours.\nThe defense ministry said in a statement Monday the airstrikes on Sunday and overnight hit nine facilities reportedly belonging to the Islamic State group, destroying a command center, ammunition depots and artillery. All are located in the north and the northwest of the country.\nRussia says the airstrikes that began Wednesday are targeting the Islamic State group and al-Qaida's Syrian affiliates, but at least some of the strikes appear to have hit Western-backed rebel factions. The Russian attacks have largely focused on the northwestern and central provinces — the gateways to the heartland of President Bashar Assad's power in the capital and on the Mediterranean coast.\n___\n11:25 a.m.\nThe head of the U.N. refugee agency says a \"positive relationship between the Western and the Muslim worlds\" is essential to overcome refugee crises like those facing Europe.\nAntonio Guterres, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, says there is an urgent need to fight fear of Islam and reduce the lure of extremist ideologies.\nHe told his agency's executive committee on Monday that financing has fallen short to handle \"mega-crises\" like those in Iraq and Syria and other crises in South Sudan, Burundi, Yemen and Libya.\nHe said \"the humanitarian system is financially broke\" and 33 U.N. appeals for assistance for 82 million people are 42-percent funded.\n.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
