Tweets with videos and more below. Photo by Brandon Marshall This weekend, your Denver Broncos have a bye — meaning there's nothing that can happen to worsen their 6-0 record, which reached its present level after an improbable win over the Cleveland Browns on October 18.\nBut that hasn't stopped the complaining about quarterback Peyton Manning, who's thrown more interceptions than touchdown passes this season and is among the lowest-ranked QBs in the league — something that would be more of a problem without the Broncos' incredible defense.\nThis dissatisfaction has been circulating on Twitter under the hashtag #BenchManning — yet not everyone using it agrees that it's time for Peyton to ride the pine.\nBelow, we've collected twenty memorable tweets — the first ten from fans who truly think it's time to sit Peyton in favor of largely untested (but much younger) backup Brock Osweiler, while the second ten represent folks who see that strategy as the height of stupidity.\nCheck out the entire collection below.\nPro #BenchManning: Number 10\nIts been an incredible, Hall of Fame career, but @Broncos , it's time to #BenchManning pic.twitter.com/9R0ChbhW5Q\n— Ian Lacey (@Ian_DEADicated) October 19, 2015 Pro #BenchManning: Number 9\nHow could Brock do any worse then that old washed up over paid Peyton Manning?
