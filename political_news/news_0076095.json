But we put together a Benghazi special committee. A select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known that any of that had happened had we not fought to make that happen,\" McCarthy said.\nDemocrats jumped on the comments Wednesday -- Rep. Elijah Cummings, the committee's top Democrat, called them a \"stunning concession\" -- but Republicans also faulted their majority leader.\n\"I might have said it differently,\" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, told CNN . \"Any ancillary political activity that comes out of it is, in fact, not the goal of the committee and is not what the committee is seeking to do.\"\nRepublican Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan said, \"I totally disagree with those comments.\"\nCNN reached out to McCarthy's office for further comment but did not immediately receive a response.\nThe House Benghazi Committee was formed in May 2014 and since has become one of the longest-running investigative committees in House history. Although it at first focused on the terrorist attack, the committee has somewhat changed its focus since discovering that Clinton exclusively used a private email server during her time at State.\nClinton will testify before the committee on October 22.\nClinton's favorablity numbers have fallen since the Benghazi committee has been organized. A CNN poll released in August found Clinton's favorability underwater, with 44% of people viewing her favorably and 53% viewing her unfavorably.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:55:35.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
