Quote: Putin in Ukraine: Sucked Into a Black Hole He Cannot Escape What Russia hoped would be a small, victorious war has turned into the \"geostrategic disaster of a new cold war,\" writes Volodymyr Horbulin, a respected foreign policy analyst currently advising Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. In an article in Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, Horbulin argues that the main participants in the war have exhausted themselves. The Donbass has become a black hole from which Russia, its creator, cannot escape. Hybrid war succeeded in Crimea, but it failed in the Donbass. Ukraine's economic blockade of the occupied territories has strained Russia financially. Separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk are incompetent, forcing Moscow to augment its military advisers with administrators. Returning Russian \"volunteers\" are a problem for Moscow, which has already asked rebels to create a border force to prevent former fighters from coming home to make trouble. The Kremlin says that sanctions aren't hurting, but cheap credit is gone, the ruble has plunged, and these ills will only get worse, Horbulin predicts. Russia's trade has shrunk by one-third in recent months. Capital flight in 2014 totaled $150 billion. This is why Russia desperately wants to end Western sanctions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:11:28.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
