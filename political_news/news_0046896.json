Darrian Traynor by Lucille Keen The former national secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howes, who is now a partner at KPMG, denies he had anything to do with or knew about a deal that saw the union receive $75,000 for not enforcing penalty rates for casual workers, even though he signed the agreement.\nThe AWU's Victorian division allegedly did a deal with Cleanevent in 2010, which meant the cleaner's largely casual workforce missed out on a large increase in penalty rates .\nMr Howes oversaw the whole union but the Victorian division was run by Cesar Melham, a protege of Mr Howes' predecessor, Bill Shorten, who is now Labor leader. Mr Melham is a Labor MP.\n\"As national secretary, it was not my role to personally analyse the terms of industrial agreements to check their adequacy,\" Mr Howes said in a witness statement to the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption.\n\"I was dependent on the report to highlight any relevant issues. The signature on the behalf of the union is mine but I do not recall the circumstances in which I signed the MOU.\"\nThe union received $25,000 a year, for three years under a memorandum of understanding because the deal saved the company an estimated $2 million a year and member names were supplied to artificially inflate union membership numbers, according to evidence to the royal commission.\nMr Howes became national secretary of the union when Mr Shorten was elected to Federal Parliament in 2007.\nMr Howes resigned from the AWU last year and now works at KPMG in Sydney.\n \"Neither before nor at the time of signing the MOU, was I aware that the AWU Victorian branch had negotiated a side agreement with Cleanevent to receive payments from Cleanevent,\" Mr Howes said.\n\"I remained unaware of it until it was exposed publicly during the May/June 2015 royal commission hearings into Cleanevent.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:08:14.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
