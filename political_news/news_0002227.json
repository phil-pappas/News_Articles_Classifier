The officer, James Frascatore , mistakenly believed Blake was a \"suspect in an identity-theft case,\" according to the NY Post, then he tackled the retired tennis pro and arrested him. The Civilian Complaint Review Board made a recent ruling in the case that the officer used \"excessive force in arresting Blake on September 9 th outside the Grand Hyatt on East 42 nd Street.\" A panel recommended that the officer involved, Frascatore, be \"disciplined.\" However, according to the article in the NY Post, the ruling by the Civilian Complaint Review Board does not necessarily mean the officer is guilty, it only means that the allegations Blake made of \"excessive force\" were justified. Now, the CCRB is in negotiations with the officer's lawyers in hopes of a plea agreement, however, if there is no such agreement, the case will go to a \"departmental trial.\"\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140714/126845\nAlthough these cases are unfortunate, and sometimes severe, Legal-Bay has been an advocate for victims of police brutality, police abuse, wrongful imprisonment, Taser injuries, and cases of Civil Rights violations involving racial discrimination, and as public awareness on these cases has been growing, there has been a rise in applications in police brutality cases.\nChris Janish , CEO of Legal-Bay, commented on the recent news in the James Blake case, \"We have seen quite a bit of New York City police brutality settlements of late, most notably the Eric Garner â€“ 'I can't breathe case,' and it looks like the James Blake case will be another high profile celebrity settlement coming down soon. Fortunately in this case, no one was seriously injured, however it shows the need for proper protocol so that incidents like this do not result in serious injury or death by police misconduct.\"\nLegal-Bay, a law cash advance company, is not only a public advocate for victims of police brutality and wrongful imprisonment, but the company has also assisted victims of sexual assault/harassment, and prison injury cases as well.
