He has threatened to veto funding to pay our servicemen and women’s salaries unless Congress agrees to release the terrorists at Guantanamo Bay! Despicable.\nThink about that… Soldiers’ families will stop getting their paychecks because Obama doesn’t like a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that stops him from closing the Guantanamo Bay prison and bringing the terrorists onto US soil or sending them back to the Middle East.\nAnd Obama says that Republicans are the ones holding the country hostage?!\nDon’t let Obama shut down the military and cut off military pay! Demand that Congress hold the line and ban Guantanamo releases!\nBoth chambers of Congress passed the NDAA. The bill contains a ton of great provisions.\nHere’s one of the excellent provisions: Instead of paying millions of dollars to keep WWII pistols in storage, this year’s NDAA will allow qualified citizens to buy these relics straight from the Civilian Marksmanship Program!\nIf the bill is signed into law, up to 100,000 1911 pistols will go up for sale to private civilians! Here at Conservative Daily, we think this is great and can't wait.\nBut more importantly, the NDAA puts a complete stop to Obama’s plan to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp and release terrorists back onto the battlefield.\nYears ago, Congress passed a law that required the President to notify them in advance of any GITMO prison transfers. Guess what: he didn’t.\nJust last year, President Obama traded 5 of the worst Taliban fighters in return for Bowe Bergdahl, a deserter. Obama didn’t notify Congress. He broke the law.\nNow, these fighters are back in the Middle East coordinating attacks and waiting for their chance to get back onto the battlefield.\nWhat this legislation does is simple: it bans GITMO transfers to the United States and bans transfers to countries in the Middle East with lax security.\nYemen is in the middle of a civil war. Obama doesn’t like that he’s not allowed to release these terrorists into Yemen anymore. Tough luck.\nThe President has promised to veto the NDAA legislation unless Congress gives him free reign to do whatever he wants with imprisoned terrorists. He wants to bring them to Colorado and throw them into regular prisons. The rest would be sent to third world countries where escape would be all but guaranteed.\nIs that what you want?\nEnough is enough! Tell Congress to hold its ground and defund Obama’s suicidal plan to bring Guantanamo Bay terrorists onto US soil!\nI don’t think anything could be more telling of how little the President cares for our military.\nHe is threatening to veto this and cut off their paychecks all because he wants to transfer and release the worst-of-the-worst from Guantanamo Bay. Backwards priorities, huh?\nIt isn’t often that we get to say Congress did its job, but this is one of those situations. We have sent well over a Million faxes to Congress DEMANDING that stop Obama’s suicidal Guantanamo Bay plans. That is exactly what they have done.\nNow, with the President’s veto over their heads, there is going to be tremendous pressure for Congress to cave on this. We already know that the President values the rights of Afghan rapists over American servicemen. Now he has once again proven how little he cares about our military.\nYou got Congress to take it this far. The finish line is in sight. Don’t give up now!\nTell Congress no surrender! Don’t let the GOP cave and authorize Obama’s suicidal Guantanamo Bay release policy!\nSincerely,\nJoe Otto\nConservative Daily", "external_links": ["http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/budget/2015/09/30/president-obama-veto-defense-policy-bill/73095624/", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/advocacytoaction.com/303_51faccf3-0fc9-4a50-8a1d-926eaf234630.jpg", "http://www.conservative-daily.com//feed/https://app.advocacytoaction.com/campaign.aspx?id=1498&#038;utm_source=blog&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_campaign=1498", "http://store.truthgear.net/collections/flags/products/us-flag-poly-cotton-3x5"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:35:20.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
