While tech has become more important to politicians, politics has become more important to tech. \n\"Initially the digital folks were kinda the people in the back room; we didn't necessarily have a seat at the table, but it's really changed more and more,\" explained Michael Hill of Summit Strategy, which has offices in Seattle and Washington D.C. \nHill says presidential races \"push the envelope for what can be done digitally,\" using Howard Dean's 2004 campaign and President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign as examples. \nInnovations and trends have trickled downstream, becoming the norm for any competitive campaign. \n\"It doesn't replace that personal contact, but it really is the next best thing,\" Hill said of a robust online and social media strategy. \nWhile campaigns have become increasingly reliant on tech, Washington's tech universe recognizes the importance of being plugged into politics. \n\"We have an obligation and quite frankly a right to actively participate in everything from city council to state legislative elections and in the form of policy that helps this community grow and prosper,\" said Michael Schutzler of the Washington Technology Industry Association. \nThe WTIA , in existence for over 30 years, has watched just a handful of tech giants, such as Microsoft and Aldus, grow into a total of 8,500 tech companies statewide. \nWhile the organization has long been involved in policy, there's a new effort to have a greater voice in politics, ahead of the upcoming Seattle City Council elections. All nine seats are up for grabs, as Seattle moves to representation through geographical districts and two at large seats. \n\"There's a discourse going on in the public domain that sounds really anti-tech,\" said Schutzler who told KING 5 he wants council members to be tech knowledgeable and aware of the economic impact and job creation spawned from the industry. \nWhile WTIA considers itself apolitical, it is in the process of evaluating candidates, so board members can educate their voter base on the candidates' positions and interest in the tech industry. \n\"Having a tech knowledgeable city council is probably the most important, so we can have an open and productive discussion about the pros and cons on everything from traffic to public transit to education,\" Schutzler said. \nWhile the tech base represents tens of thousands of potential voters, will they vote? \n\"It's not fair to characterize the tech industry as being uninvolved. It's more fair to characterize the tech industry as obsessed with launching their products or building their companies,\" said Schutzler. \n\"We find that there are democrats and there are republicans and there are super activist folks that come in and then there are people who are more apathetic, but that distribution doesn't look any different than it does in the general public,\" he explained. \nSchutzler even stepped up his own engagement ahead of this upcoming election by canvassing on behalf of two candidates he supports. \n\"I think there's an opportunity for everyone in the tech industry to do more than just vote, actually participating and supporting the candidates that they believe really would make a big impact.\" Read or Share this story: http://www.king5.com/story/news/politics/city/2015/10/12/local-tech-industry-wants-great-voice-in-city-politics/73847868/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:51:24.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
