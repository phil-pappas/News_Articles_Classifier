In Sanskrit, the word Rama means “charming”, and Lord Ram, in addition to being charming, was a symbol of dharm, sacrifice and honesty. He was a warrior with the traits of a true sanyasi. Ram Navami is celebrated to mark the birth anniversary of Lord Ram who is regarded as the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Ramachandra was born to King Dashrath and his Queen Kaushalya at Ayodhya on the ninth day (navami) of the month of chaitra shuddh. In the Ramayan, this blessed occasion is described as follows: “Queen Kaushalya gave birth to a son... with all the divine attributes like lotus-red eyes, lengthy arms, rose lips, voice like drumbeat, and who took birth to delight the Ikshwaku dynasty, who is adored by all the worlds, and who is the greatly blessed epitome of Vishnu, namely Ram.”\nThough the reasons for the incarnation of Vishnu in a human form as Ram are many, the most popular reason relates it to the destruction of evil. Ram Navami is marked by celebrations. Havans, akhand paths, rath-yatras, bhajans and readings of the Ramacharitamanas are organised. In many temples, idols of Lord Ram and Goddess Sita are placed in a cradle and rocked by the devotees. In south India, this day is celebrated as Sitarama kalyanam or the anniversary of Ram’s wedding to Sita. Many Hindus observe a strict fast throughout the nine days of Navaratri, believing it to bring them salvation and happiness. A special diet is taken during this time comprising fruits, roots and potatoes, while garlic, ginger and onion are avoided. Due to a change in season, this diet is considered healthy for the body and it enriches the person spiritually.\nKulbir Kaur teaches sociology at Shyama Prasad Mukherji College, Delhi University\n commentary OPED Ram Navami Mystic mantra Also Read Lack of global response Groom young talent Political games by UP government?
