Let’s not waste it,” said Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.). “A continuing resolution is not a good governing strategy, but was made necessary by the blanket filibuster of all the appropriations bills. This refusal to consider spending measures has deprived all Senators of an opportunity to debate the stewardship of taxpayers’ dollars. Our committee is ready for these bills to be called up so that Senators are able to give voice to the priorities and values of the people who elected them.” This year marks the first since 2009 that all 12 annual appropriations bills have been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, with most of them receiving broad bipartisan support... ...Wicker echoed Cochran’s thoughts, saying the extension was needed because Senate Democrats, despite their previous support, have blocked efforts to bring individual appropriations bills to the Senate floor for consideration. “Earlier this year, Congress passed a tough budget resolution that set strict caps on government spending,” said Wicker. “The proposal that passed the Senate today adheres to those limits.
