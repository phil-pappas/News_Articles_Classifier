Photo: Andrew Meares\nThe Coalition's most prominent advocate of gay marriage, Queensland backbencher Warren Entsch, wants the current Parliament to introduce and pass legislation which would legalise gay marriage but only be triggered by public approval in a plebiscite . Mr Entsch has discussed his idea, which includes mandating a plebiscite within 100 days of the next federal election, with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is considering the proposal.\nAdvertisement \"I have said to him that I think we need to be looking at progressing this issue,\" Mr Entsch told the ABC .\n\"Generally a plebiscite was not generally binding. In this case, it would be binding and that would become law.\"\nUnder the leadership of former prime minister Tony Abbott, the Liberal Party decided in a marathon party room meeting to retain the traditional definition of marriage until the next election and hold a plebiscite after that, possibly in 2017.\nSenator Abetz was dumped from his cabinet position and role as leader of the government in the Senate following Mr Turnbull's ascension to the prime ministership.\nIn an interview with the ABC on Thursday, Senator Abetz said pre-empting the result of the plebiscite was an attempt to override the party room's decision to maintain the Coalition's support for traditional marriage until the next election.\n\"It seems a bit of a thought bubble and an ambush to boot,\" he said.\n\"To try to force MPs to vote for legislation contrary to that is against that which the party room so overwhelmingly decided.\n\"Secondly I believe we'd get into uncharted waters and very complicated situations if we try to bind the next Parliament by a vote of this Parliament.\"\nSenator Abetz said Mr Entsch had put Mr Turnbull, who supports gay marriage, in a \"very difficult situation\" by proposing the idea.\n\"It is not the actions, if I might say, that will help unity...which will help to heal some of the wounds of that which has happened over recent weeks,\" he said.\nQueensland Liberal National senator Matt Canavan also expressed concerns about the idea of a current Parliament dictating a future one.\n\"I think it has some merit however I have concerns about how one Parliament could bind a future Parliament,\" he told Fairfax Media.\n\"I will respect the view of the Australian people whatever that view may be in the plebiscite but I don't pretend I can impose that view on a future elected member of Parliament.\"\nAnd Liberal backbencher Bob Baldwin, who was also dumped from the frontbench, lambasted the idea.\nPassing legislation on SSM before a plebiscite is just ridiculous. The idea of a plebiscite is to know exactly your electorates opinion\n— Bob Baldwin MP (@bobbaldwinmp) October 22, 2015 Labor backbencher Nick Champion said the dispute was evidence that a \"Liberal civil war\" had begun.\n@latikambourke @smh the liberal civil war has begun....\n— Nick Champion MP (@NickChampionMP) October 21, 2015 Follow Latika Bourke on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/smh", "https://www.facebook.com/Latika-M-Bourke-132583706779458/", "https://twitter.com/NickChampionMP/status/656939620530151424", "https://twitter.com/bobbaldwinmp/status/656999528512360448", "https://twitter.com/latikambourke", "http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2015/s4336468.htm"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:10:51.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
