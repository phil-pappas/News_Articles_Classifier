The announcement did not specify which email account of Brennan's it had gotten ahold of, but the news came just days after a Twitter user purporting to be a teenage hacker made headlines by claiming to have breached the personal accounts of both Brennan and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. The chief evidence the hacker produced was Brennan’s AOL contact list , much of which seems to date to 2008 and 2009, given numerous addresses connected with the Obama administration’s presidential transition team.\n\"ANNOUNCE: We have obtained the contents of CIA Chief John Brennan's email account and will be releasing it shortly,\" WikiLeaks' Twitter account tweeted today.\nThe FBI and Secret Service are both investigating the alleged hacks. The CIA has acknowledged only that it is aware of the reported hacking of Brennan's AOL account and reported it to authorities.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/656864290033504256", "https://pastee.org/m9nwa", "https://www.politicopro.com/cybersecurity/whiteboard/2015/10/pro-cyber-perera-aol-hacking-062245"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:45:48.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
