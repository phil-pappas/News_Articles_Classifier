And Cooper at times appeared receptive to defense arguments of prosecutorial overreach. \nKhattala, captured by U.S. special forces in Libya in a nighttime raid in June 2104 and then questioned for days aboard a Navy vessel, appeared in court for the most significant hearing in the case in months. Wearing a green prison suit, he listened silently to the proceedings through earphones as an interpreter translated the arguments. \nThe September 2012 attacks at the compound in Libya killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, raising questions in Congress and at the State Department about diplomatic security at the post. Hillary Rodham Clinton , who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, was secretary of state at the time of the attacks and is expected to appear next week before a House select committee investigating the violence. The panel on Friday questioned one of her longtime aides. \nAn 18-count indictment charges Khattala with crimes including murder of an internationally protected person, providing material support to terrorists and destroying U.S. property while causing death. He has pleaded not guilty, and prosecutors said Friday that they expected a decision within months on whether the Justice Department would pursue the death penalty. \nDefense lawyers laid out multiple challenges to the indictment. \nMary Petras, one of Khatalla's attorneys, urged Cooper to dismiss the two counts accusing her client of providing support to terrorist groups. Though that statute is a favored prosecution tool, particularly in its cases against U.S. followers of the Islamic State, Petras said the charges in this case are vague about exactly who is a terrorist and what sort of action could be labeled terrorism. That makes the charge unconstitutional, she said. \n\"Essentially what the government is saying to the court is, 'Leave it to us. We know when to use the statute',\" Petras said. \nDefense lawyers also urged Cooper to dismiss other counts, such as carrying and firing a firearm during a crime of violence, that were brought under laws they said were specifically intended by Congress to cover domestic crimes, not ones that occur overseas. \n\"The court should not stretch the ... presumption that they don't apply to make them apply here,\" said defense lawyer Jeffrey Robinson. \nThough Cooper did not reveal how he would rule, he posed several questions to prosecutors — including how the government thought it should draw the line on extending its reach into foreign countries — that suggested that the argument resonated with him. \n____ \nFollow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:59:59.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
