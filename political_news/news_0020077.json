Many of Trump's most notable gaffes are highlighted: from his questioning of John McCain's status as a war hero to his inability to name prominent terrorists .\nThe clip also points out that Trump -- who is shown in the clip claiming that \"there's nobody bigger or better at the military than I am\" -- received deferments to avoid military service during the Vietnam War. There's also a snippet of a 2007 interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer in which he says Hillary Clinton \"would do a good job\" negotiating a nuclear deal with Iran.\nMeanwhile, the video is interspersed with politicians and pundits discussing gaps in Trump's knowledge of foreign affairs.\nRead More The video ends with two Trump Quote: s -- \"I will be so good at the military, your head will spin\" and \"Let me tell you, I'm a really smart guy\" -- before concluding with a title card that simply says, \"Stumped.\"\nSaturday's post was the latest salvo in the Bush-Trump rivalry that has often been marked by bitter and personal exchanges between the two prominent Republican presidential candidates. On Friday, Trump suggested Bush's brother, former President George W. Bush, shared in the blame for the 9/11 terrorist attacks because they occurred during his presidency.\nBush angrily responded, calling the remark \"pathetic.\"\nTrump ducked questions about the comments when pressed by CNN Friday night, but later attacked Bush on Twitter.\n\"No @JebBush, you're pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brother's term when the World Trade Center was attacked and came down,\" Trump tweeted.\n\".@JebBush, like it or not, our country needs more energy and spirit than you can provide! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain,\" Trump added.\n. @JebBush , like it or not, our country needs more energy and spirit than you can provide! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2015 Bush's video Saturday was also evocative of clips Trump has deployed to rip other presidential candidates. The real estate mogul slammed Bernie Sanders' ability to stand up to global threats in a video released this week that was also set to the soundtrack of circus music.\nAnd he bashed Bush -- as well as his brother and father, former President George H.W. Bush -- in a social media video attack as well, saying in August that \"Enough is Enough- no more Bushes!\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/655194304479109120", "https://t.co/lLr1SF1jwp", "https://twitter.com/JebBush", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump", "https://instagram.com/p/80rWSdGhT0/?taken-by=realdonaldtrump", "https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/655475568507400192", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MakeAmericaGreatAgain?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:55:53.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
