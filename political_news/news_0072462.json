Gay former D.C. resident Ronnie Runion, 28, who landed in the Rockingham County-Harrisonburg, Va., Jail in April for a series of probation violation charges, says he continues to have nightmares in his cell following the “situation” that happened to him on Aug. 13. In a letter to a friend and former roommate in D.C., which Runion wrote on Aug. 14, he reports that a fellow inmate came to his cell and offered him items from the jail commissary in exchange for sex. “He is much bigger than me,” Runion wrote. “I kindly said no. He then backed me against the wall and threatened me, saying he would kill me if I didn’t consent. He then overpowered me and raped me.” Added Runion, “I don’t want to go into very much detail. It’s very hard to talk about.” But two weeks ago Runion said he wanted to talk about what has happened since the Aug. 13 incident in two phone conversations with a Washington Blade reporter. He said he reported the incident to jail guards after another inmate sensed something was wrong and asked the guards to come to Runion’s cell. He said the guards arranged for him to be taken to a nearby hospital, where an examination showing rectal bleeding among other injuries confirmed that a sexual assault occurred. The trauma surrounding the assault itself was heightened, he said, when a nurse informed him he needed to undergo a 28-day regimen of anti-viral medication to ensure that he doesn’t contract HIV. The suspect identified as the alleged perpetrator in the case is HIV positive, Runion said he was told. Runion said he has tested negative and must undergo HIV tests periodically over the next year before he can be certain the powerful anti-viral medication worked. With that as a backdrop, Runion said the stress he experienced over the assault was once again heighted when he learned that the inmate implicated in the case was returned to the general prison population after a short period of isolation and that authorities had yet to prosecute him on a sexual assault charge. Runion said he has made it clear to jail authorities that he wants to press charges against the alleged rapist. Although jail officials have assured him that the alleged perpetrator is assigned to a separate location in the jail on another floor, Runion said he continues to fear for his safety. “The guy said he would kill me if I snitched,” Runion said. “It’s very upsetting. I’ve seen a counsel twice. They investigated. It seems like they are covering it up. It was suggested by the lieutenant here that I was to blame for this.” When asked to elaborate on why a jail lieutenant suggested he might be to blame, Runion said, “He didn’t plain out say that I was to blame but he beat around the bush — because of rule violations and my sexual preference and several things.” He said that “when it comes down to it my safety was not a priority here. So they can say all they want but I’m really upset that this guy is not charged yet.” Rockingham County Sheriff Bryan Hutcheson, who is in charge of the jail, told the Blade in an email on Tuesday that the incident reported by Runion remains under investigation. “I can confirm that our Criminal Investigations Division currently has an open criminal investigation into the incident you mentioned,” Hutcheson said, referring to a Blade inquiry about the incident. “Once that investigation is complete, we will present all findings to the Commonwealth Attorney for a full review,” he said. “That is all that I can say at this time.” Christopher Bean, the Rockingham County Deputy Commonwealth Attorney, told the Blade on Monday that his office had yet to be contacted about Runion’s sexual assault report. If and when contacted by jail authorities his office would take immediate steps to prosecute the case if the evidence supports a sexual assault charge, Bean said. Runion’s friends say he has struggled over a substance abuse problem and bipolar disorder which they say have been linked to several bouts with the criminal justice system in Virginia over the past 10 years. He currently faces a charge of grand larceny for allegedly failing to return a rental car. One of the friends, who asked not to be identified, said budget cuts in the Virginia state prison system prevented Runion from being placed in a mental health facility, as ordered by a judge, rather than in jail in connection with a separate case last year. Alexandra Ringe, a spokesperson for the ACLU’s National Prison Project in D.C., said ACLU attorneys have encountered similar cases where prison authorities take longer than appears to be justified in responding to cases where inmates are subjected to abuse, including rape. “Unfortunately, as you’re starting to see, any kind of turning the wheels of justice are slow on the outside and even slower and even harder and often just amount to nothing on the inside,” she said in referring to prisons across the country. Recently implemented rules for the Prison Rape Elimination Act, which Congress passed in 2003, require local, state and federal prison officials to follow strict guidelines in responding to incidents of prison rape. An official with the U.S. Justice Department division that oversees enforcement of the law, known as PREA, couldn’t immediately be reached to determine whether a delay in the prosecution of the case reported by Runion could be a PREA violation. “It’s been over a month,” Runion told the Blade in discussing the time since he reported the assault. “I think they think I’m going to forget about it, but I’m not. I think about this every night,” he said. “It bothers me. I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes and I feel like I’m being restrained. That’s what I told the counselor and he said it’s normal” for someone who experienced a sexual assault, said Runion. “I said no, it’s not normal. I don’t usually feel like that,” he said. “My nerves are very jumpy. And everybody is treating it as if nothing has happened.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:43:29.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
