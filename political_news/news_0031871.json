Nana Addo battled the arrogant tag in his previous attempts to lead the country, as his critics suggested he was not humble enough to be elected president. \nCommenting in an exclusive interview on the Citi Breakfast Show on Monday, Nana Addo said he is only an honest person who tries to be who he is. \n“I just have to be myself; you’ve met me and I don’t think I come across to you as an arrogant person. I believe that the best thing that public figures can be; is to be honest and be themselves. Yes; it’s a big propaganda that was used against me but I don’t think they have succeeded,” he noted. \nAccording to him, “the way Ghanaians have responded to me; I don’t think that’s the impression out there. The impression that I get is that; people recognize someone who is genuinely interested in doing something about the conditions of his country and who has devoted his life to that. So that’s the way I approach it; I am myself and those who come into contact with me and listen to me make up their mind; and I am hoping that it lives a positive impact”. \nNana Addo, who has ended his nationwide tour dubbed ‘Rise and Build’, told the host of the Citi Breakfast Show Bernard Avle that he is physically fit and ready for the massive campaign ahead of 2016, to bring Ghanaians the change they are yearning for.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:23:53.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
