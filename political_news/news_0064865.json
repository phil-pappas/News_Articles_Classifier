NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged that the lifting of the stay on dance bars was a result of \"collusion between ruling BJP-Shiv Sena leaders and dance bar owners.\" \"People from the Dance Bars Association met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and also Yuva Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray to put forth their demand,\" Malik said.\nCongress spokesperson Anant Gadgil said \"the state government failed to fight the case in the Supreme Court in the right manner.\" \"The manner in which the case should have been represented in SC, wasn't done. This may have been done deliberately,\" Gadgil said.\n\"The government could have used a team of strong lawyers,\" the Congress MLC said.\nAsked what should the government do to ensure the dance bar ban continues, Gadgil said, \"The government will have to bring in a fresh legislation in the winter session next month to ensure the ban continues.\"\nAnother Congress leader said the government failed to convince the apex court about the \"malpractices like prostitution which go on in the garb of dance bars.\" However, those concerned (bar owners) effectively put forth the other side, that of thousands of bar girls and other people involved in dance bar business losing their livelihood, due to the ban, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:05:15.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
