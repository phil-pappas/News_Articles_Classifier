'The new Directive will reduce these costs while opening up the market to new operators which will be subject to the same regulatory and supervisory framework as other credit or payment institutions. The new rules will further improve consumer protection in cases of alleged fraud.' According to Tajani, the main beneficiaries of the Directive will be consumers who will benefit from reduced costs, more choice and increased legal certainty. 'Moreover, thanks to the amendments introduced by the European Parliament, consumers will receive free information on transactions and will be granted an unconditional refund right in case of fraud or unauthorised payments', concluded Tajani. distributed by This content was issued by EPP Group on the 2015-10-08 and was initially posted on www.eppgroup.eu.
