It's Friday, Oct. 23, and this is what we're watching: Hillary Rodham Clinton took a victory lap just hours after finishing her marathon Benghazi testimony Clinton's appearance before the House committee was notable for her poise, constrasted by the panel's partisan bickering Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee ends his bid for the Democratic nomination for president Back in California, Clinton is collecting five of every six Hollywood dollars Donald Trump is in Jeb Bush's backyard of Miami for a rally Hillary Clinton: 'It's been quite a week' (Jacquelyn Martin / AP) \nJust a dozen or so hours after leaving a Capitol hearing room, Hillary Rodham Clinton strode onto a ballroom stage to a welcome at a Democratic function that seemed something of a victory lap. \n\"It's been quite a week, hasn't it?\" Clinton said of a period in which two Democratic rivals left the race, another declined to join it and she endured marathon congressional testimony, leaving unscathed. \n\"I'm just grateful I recovered my voice, which I lost a little bit.\" \nThings are indeed good in Hillaryland after a summer of struggles, with the former secretary of State seemingly solidifying her position at the top of the Democratic field. \nShe was the last of four candidates who spoke at the Democratic National Committee's Women's Leadership Forum event Friday. But the first, Lincoln Chafee, used his appearance to announce the end of his campaign. Clinton praised the man who could have been the fifth candidate, Vice President Joe Biden, saying she was sure he would \"be right there with us on the front lines.\" \nClinton's remarks reiterated her support for policies that would ease student loan debt, narrow a gap in pay between men and women and provide paid family leave. And she placed renewed emphasis on protecting abortion rights, raising Republicans' consideration of another special congressional committee that would investigate Planned Parenthood. \n\"After my experience yesterday, I am just amazed that they are even talking about [it],\" she said. \"I think we all know by now that's just code for a partisan witch hunt.\" \nAnd as she works to rally the party behind her, she noted there was \"a long campaign still ahead of us,\" and predicted that Republicans would be \"hurling insults\" and \"pointing fingers to try to blame people\" for America's challenges. \n\"You can listen to their debates for hours â€” and unfortunately some of us have to,\" she said. \"You won't hear a single solution to any of the problems we're facing here at home or around the world.\" 7:55 A.M.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:42:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
