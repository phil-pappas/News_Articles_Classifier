However we know that improving the food environment is essential for reducing obesity in children” says Associate Professor Taylor. \n“While there are some useful actions in the recently announced package, it could be argued that many of the nutrition strategies lack teeth. \n“The government has been working with industry for many years around food marketing to children – but this is only ever at a voluntary level – where is the evidence that this has made a difference?” \nShe sees it as necessary to implement stricter control measures to prevent the continuing advertising of junk food to children, widely accepted as a pivotal component of improving the food environment. \nHowever, Associate Professor Taylor applauds healthy eating policies being implemented in DHB’s, such as not allowing sugary drinks to be sold on hospital premises, but believes such policy could have limited reach for children. \n“Such policies will be far more effective in the school system – where children spend a lot of their time.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:05:18.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
