The survey polled 1,274 people nationwide from Monday to Saturday. About 85 per cent want it to be easy to understand, 82 per cent of respondents want a charter that is concise and comprehensive, and 77 per cent hope it is hard to revoke. Another 72 per cent want it to be in line with the Thai way of life, 66 per cent hope it is acceptable to the international community, 65 per cent would like it to prevent a parliamentary dictatorship and 60 per cent want it written from scratch. About 84 per cent believe the CDC led by Meechai Ruchupan will help solve the country's problems, 70 per cent believe a public referendum will provide public participation in the charter drafting process and 63 per cent believe the CDC will draft a charter that benefits the country. Another 60 per cent said the CDC would write a better charter that was democratically accepted by the world community and 58 per cent said the CDC would complete the job within the allotted 180 days. Asked what their biggest concern was regarding the drafting process, 81 per cent of respondents fear the CDC members will quarrel over difference of opinion, 75 per cent are worried the charter draft will be rejected and 71 per cent fear that some content may favour particular groups. Another 62 per cent are worried the CDC is working under pressure imposed by the junta and society and 54 per cent fear the charter may not solve the country's problems. Meanwhile, Democrat Party deputy leader Satit Pitutecha urged Meechai to ensure the charter had organic laws that prevent political office-holders from having to buy support to get elected. He also said the charter should ensure that people demanding benefits from political office-holders was a thing of the past without restricting politicians from carrying out their duty as the public's representatives in Parliament. He said the charter must allow the public to serve as a checks-and-balances mechanism on politicians and ensure corrupt politicians were dealt with harshly. 693 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:41:57.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
