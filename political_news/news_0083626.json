If you doubt this, just ask some women.\nWith news arriving this week that Playboy will abandon its signature nude pictorials, it has come to pass that men who read the magazine will actually be reading it for the articles. Are we all happy now?\nAs one who did read Playboy for the articles -- who can forget that one about (what was it now?) and that other one I once read -- I will be glad to have some company. I am not so sure about the rest of you.\nOf course, I will admit that I occasionally peeked at the centerfold, because if a lady takes her clothes off it just seems bad manners not to notice, especially if she is there in the studio at risk of catching a cold.\nIf you do not approve of this change, you can blame progress, such as it is. According to The New York Times, this redesign is the result of changing times that can bring explicit material to any adolescent drooler with just one computer click. Playboy, which has been losing readership, needs to reposition itself in the market.\nHugh Hefner, Playboy's founder and still drooler-in-chief, is reported to have signed off on this revolutionary change, which just goes to show that even an old goat will eventually seek a more shaded area of the pasture, even if it takes him 89 years of living to find it.\nAlthough the latest news restricts itself to the fact that nudity is being draped by the forces of marketing correctness, which is very like political correctness except people don't try to run for president on the issue, it is easy to imagine that more dramatic changes may be in the offing.\nMaybe the name of the magazine will eventually have to change, too -- to something like Literatiboy, Bookclubboy, Criticboy or Pretentiousboy, although admittedly none of these suggestions has the same ring to it.\nPlayboy will still carry pictures of women in provocative poses, but it seems they will be no more than PG-13 in nature. It's not the sort of thing that teenage boys would seek out, as they once shamefully did, as part of their development to full adult droolhood.\nDifficult as it is to imagine today, Playboy was once the graduate manual for male adolescents. The training wheels were provided by National Geographic and its topless indigenous persons. To this day, some older refined gentlemen still get hot under the ascot at the slightest mention of the Upper Zambezi River or the highlands of New Guinea.\nNone of this is something to be proud of, but it does raise the question of what is to be done with Playboy's famous centerfold, once the prime focus of so many readers' hopeless dreams. Apparently no decision has been made, although a Playmate of the Month will still be chosen.\nMy suggestion, in keeping with the new buttoned-up tone, is to have an Amish Pal of the Month. If that doesn't appeal, how about a special feature on the Nuns of San Juan Capistrano? Or perhaps, in the interests of diversity, one of those fetching Middle Eastern lasses could be selected for Burqa Girl of the Month.\nSensitive readers may have detected here a certain unseemly nostalgia for the old days, which must be acknowledged were not necessarily the good old days. They were times when sexual stereotypes and exploitation of women were rife.\nBut Playboy's nudity over the years has been relatively quaint compared with the outright filth served up today by its competitors in print and online. However, I confess I have not seen the magazine lately. I just haven't been attracted by the articles.\nAnd I must admit to a possible conflict of interest. A son of good friends works in Los Angeles for Playboy. I understand he often goes to the photo shoots and arranges the models, and even if he does not I want to believe he does, because we are so proud of him.\nOther kids went to Harvard and Yale and became doctors and lawyers, but this lad hangs out with the scantily dressed or not dressed at all. It's a profession that his vocational guidance counselor never mentioned in high school.\nAs with the magazine, I just hope that no nudes is good nudes for him.\nAbout The Writer\nReg Henry is a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette columnist.
