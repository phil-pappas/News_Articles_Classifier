(AP) — The political careers of several members of Congress — including a Republican seeking to become the next U.S. House speaker — could come to an abrupt halt under a sweeping overhaul of Florida's electoral map.\nFlorida Circuit Judge Terry Lewis on Friday recommended new boundaries for the state's 27 congressional districts, some of which would make it nearly impossible for U.S. Rep. Dan Webster to win re-election from his current central Florida district. Webster is one of the hard-line conservatives who pushed John Boehner to resign as speaker and then turned on Boehner's No. 2, Kevin McCarthy.\nThe Florida Supreme Court will have the final say on a new congressional map. But Lewis' recommendations are expected to be seriously considered.\nWebster says he's waiting for the \"process to play out.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
