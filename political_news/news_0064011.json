The SNP said they \"simply exacerbate the further alienation of Scotland from the UK Parliament\".\nLabour said they risked creating \"two tiers\" of MPs at Westminster.\nThe issue of Scottish MPs voting on English-only laws has intensified with more powers being devolved to the Scottish Parliament after last year's independence referendum.\nImage copyright PA Ministers say their solution will address the long-standing anomaly - known as the West Lothian Question - by which Scottish MPs can vote on issues such as health and education affecting only England - or England and Wales - but the House of Commons has no say on similar matters relating to Scotland, where such policies are devolved.\nUnder the reforms, an additional parliamentary stage, called a grand committee, would allow English, or English and Welsh, MPs to scrutinise bills without the involvement of Scottish MPs.\n'Politicising Speaker' These MPs would also be able to veto the legislation before all MPs from across the United Kingdom voted in the bill's final readings.\nIt would be for the Speaker to decide which bills, or parts of bills, applied just in England, or England and Wales.\nMinisters had to amend their plans - first unveiled in July - after criticism from opposition MPs, including over the time allowed for scrutiny, and a vote on them was delayed .\nThe revised proposals , containing minor changes concerning Budget measures, will now go before the Commons.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/77710000/jpg/_77710716_77710711.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33462204", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6BC1/production/_86258572_gettyimages-455542246.jpg", "https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-votes-for-english-laws-proposed-changes#history"], "published": "2015-10-22T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:07:19.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
