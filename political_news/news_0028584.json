Srisuwan Janya, the association's secretary-general, said Wissanu might have acted with a conflict of interest in appointing Air Vice Marshal Chalermpol Krea-ngam and Dusit Krea-ngam, his brothers, as NRSA members. He said the appointment of the two could be deemed to violate Article 13(2) of the Ombudsman Act and PM's directives on political office-holders' ethics. He said the prime minister had appointed 77 police and military officers - up to 38 per cent of places in the Steering Assembly. The NRSA should have more diversity of professionals and not people from the same families. He said that if the Ombudsman's Office found that his petition has grounds, it should forward the complaint to the National Anti-Corruption Commission. 452 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:56:28.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
