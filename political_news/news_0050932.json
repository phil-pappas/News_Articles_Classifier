Daily PDF Joe Biden Supporter Predicts Hollywood Will Rally Around Hillary Clinton Joe Biden by Tina Daunt 10/21/2015 3:41pm PDT With Biden announcing Wednesday that he will not seek the presidency, industry supporter Jay Sures told THR that Bernie Sanders is \"a little too far to the left\" for undecided Hollywood Dems. \nOne of Vice President Joe Biden's most vocal Hollywood supporters told The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday that he expects Democratic Hollywood to rally strongly around Hillary Clinton now that Biden has opted not to join the race . \nUTA agent Jay Sures, who had been among those hoping for a Biden candidacy, said Vermont senator Bernie Sanders — a self-described Democratic socialist — is \"a little too far to the left\" for major entertainment industry donors. \n“He has good ideas,” Sures said. \"But the substantial political decision makers in Hollywood who were undecided will now throw their weight behind Hillary — including myself.\" \nAlthough Sures said he was disappointed that Biden decided not to run, he understood his decision. \"It was a long road for him, obviously a complicated road for him,\" Sures said. \"I just don't think it had it in him for a long, drawn out 12-month campaign. I think at the end of the day, people are going to get behind Hillary.\" \nSures added that he \"truly believed Biden would have been a great president.\" \n\"I don’t regret my support for him,\" Sures said. \"It came from the highest and most respected point of view. At the end of the day, of course I’m going to support Hillary because if you look at these Republicans, they’re crazy. How can anybody in their right mind in Hollywood vote for somebody that doesn't believe in substantial gun control, that isn't for a woman's right to choose or on the right side of marriage equality?\" \nSures also predicted Biden will continue to play an important role in American politics. \"I have a feeling he'll be called on many, many times in the future by whoever the next president is for his advice and point of view,\" Sures said. \"He’s one of the smartest guys out there and really understands the business of politics.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:31:30.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
