The party has no one to provide direction. It refuses to learn. \n\"It has made wrong choices while appointing opposition leaders in both Houses of Parliament. It has made wrong choices about how to deal with the challenges in the Assembly elections. In fact, there is nothing right which the party has done or is doing. It saddens me that the Nehru&#63Indira legacy has reached a cul-de-sac,\" he said. \nHe goes on to add that \"Since Soniaji still is the unchallenged leader of the party, it should be her responsibility to reinvent the party. Blaming Rahul in a way is shifting the blame from the Congress president to someone who has yet to display his leadership skills. \n\"History is threatening to repeat itself. It is a matter of time before Soniaji's and Rahul's leadership is challenged from within the party. I will be observing closely how they stand up to this looming challenge, because Sonia is not Indira and Rahul is not Sanjay,\" the Congress leader said. \nOn Sonia, the former Nehru-Gandhi family loyalist said she will go down in history as the longest serving Congress president \"even if not the most distinguished\". \n  Related Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:57:58.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
