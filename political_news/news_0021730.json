VERNON -- Members of the Jefferson County Board are gathering for a special meeting Monday night to see if they can agree on a solution to the courthouse's sewer woes. \nWhen News 3's Evie Allen took a look at the situation last Tuesday, she found porta-potties in the courthouse's parking lot . She reports there were lots of jokes about coming to the courthouse to do business --- but not having a place to DO your business. \nThere's only one public bathroom available after a plumbing crew caused a pipe to burst. \nAll kidding aside, fixing the pipe is going to be costly. Estimates are that county leaders will have to find about $90,000 for the project. \nBoard members will meet for their special session at 6 p.m. Monday in Courtroom A on the second floor of the courthouse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:07:29.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
