And it is half the $300 million amount that the Koch Brothers network, a group of wealthy mega donors founded by the billionaire industrialists, will pour into the 2016 campaign.\n(Reporting By Jennifer Ablan and Michelle Conlin ; Editing by Christian Plumb )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:04:12.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
