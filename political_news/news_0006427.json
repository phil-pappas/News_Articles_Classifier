Wade.\nThose on both sides of the abortion debate predict all three will be passed and signed into law, possibly by the end of the year.\n“The goal is to end abortion,” said Michael Gonidakis, Ohio Right to Life president.\n“We know we can’t ban abortion at moment of conception right now. So we’re trying to appeal to Ohioans with protections for special-needs children, a ban on late-term abortions and (de-funding) Planned Parenthood.”\nIn recent years, Gov. John Kasich has signed a number of anti-abortion bills into law, including a requirement that women undergo an ultrasound before having an abortion and limits on abortion clinics’ ability to get transfer agreements with public hospitals.\nAs restrictions have grown, both the number of abortions performed in Ohio and the number of abortion clinics have sunk to record lows.\nThe Ohio Department of Health’s abortion report for 2014 showed an 8.7 percent drop in procedures from the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of abortion clinics has dwindled to nine, including three appealing state orders to close for violating new and stricter operating guidelines.\nAbortion-rights supporters argue that the trend signals hardship for women seeking abortions.\n“Women are leaving Ohio to access abortion care,” said Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio.\nThe number of abortions performed in Michigan increased 6 percent with a doubling of the rate of women who crossed Ohio’s border to find a doctor, she said.\nIn addition, Ohio’s abortion report revealed that the percentage of abortions performed in the first nine weeks of pregnancy declined from 56.5 percent to 52.3 percent. Correspondingly, the percentage of abortions performed between 9-12 weeks rose from 28.5 percent to 31.3 percent while those performed between 13-18 weeks rose from 12.6 percent to 14 percent.\n“This indicates that women have to delay access to care” because of new restrictions and clinic closures, Copeland said.\n“These bills create stigma and additional barriers to accessing care quickly.”\nThe three bills under consideration in the legislature:\n• House Bill 135 by Rep. David Hall, R-Millersburg, and Rep. Sarah LaTourette, R-Chagrin Falls, would make Ohio the first state in the nation to outlaw abortions sought because of a diagnosis of Down syndrome. A House committee has recommended passage of the bill and it is awaiting a vote before the full House.\n• Senate Bill 127 by Sen. Peggy Lehner, R-Kettering, would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy when supporters say a fetus can feel pain. Currently, abortions are legal up to 24 weeks. With some exceptions, doctors and scientists say there is no evidence that a fetus feels pain at 20 weeks. About a dozen states have enacted similar laws.\n• Senate Bill 214 by Senate President Keith Faber, R-Celina, and House Bill 294 by Rep. Bill Patmon, D-Cleveland, and Rep. Margaret Conditt, R-Liberty Township, would divert public funds from Planned Parenthood and others that perform or promote abortions.\nDuring testimony on Tuesday before a House committee, supporters of stripping funding from Planned Parenthood argued that public funds should not support organizations “in the abortion business.” The Ohio Department of Health provided about $1.3 million in tax dollars to Planned Parenthood last year.\n“Abortion may be legal but that doesn’t make it right,” Denise Leipold, executive director of Right to Life of Northeast Ohio, told lawmakers.\nPlanned Parenthood advocates, who will testify at a later hearing, have argued that the organization does not use state or federal tax dollars to pay for abortions but uses the funds for birth control and other health-care services for women.\nccandisky@dispatch.com \n@ccandisky", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:40:56.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
