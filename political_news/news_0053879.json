(AP) - Legislation that would weaken the ability of public-sector labor unions to collect full dues and political action committee contributions from members' paychecks is on the move in the Pennsylvania Legislature.\nThe GOP-controlled Senate approved the legislation Wednesday, 26-23, and sent it to the House of Representatives. All 19 Democrats and four southeastern Pennsylvania Republicans opposed it.\nIt's opposed by Gov. Tom Wolf. Similar legislation failed last year in the Senate, 20-28. An amendment to exempt police and firefighters' unions failed.\nThe bill would bar the state, school districts and local government employers from deducting any portion of union dues that underwrite political activity and union political action committee contributions from the paychecks of unionized workers.\nOnly deductions that pay for contract negotiation costs and other non-political activity would be allowed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:52:47.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
