I spoke with a co-worker today about this. I asked, wouldn’t it be a coincidence if the Syrian “refugees” brought a massive ebola break out into the US?\nNow Idaho wants an Ebola Coordinator in a place where there are these Syrian “refugees” ..I think you just confirmed my fear of this. Why else would DHS be having us law enforcement guys prepping for such an event?\nEspecially when they are going to spend hundreds of thousands on these biological suits for us that will include it’s own special mask, that I hope actually works.\nVery interesting, God be with us and protect us..http://www.infowars.com/idaho-quietly-seeks-ebola-coordinator/\nOct 23, 2015\nhttp://www.stevequayle.com/index.php?s=33&d=1587", "external_links": ["http://www.stevequayle.com/index.php?s=33&d=1587", "http://www.stevequayle.com/imgs/top-alerts.jpg", "http://www.infowars.com/idaho-quietly-seeks-ebola-coordinator/"], "published": "2015-10-23T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:11:00.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
