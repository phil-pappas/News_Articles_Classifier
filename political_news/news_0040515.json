The former Arkansas governor weighed in on our nations current criminal justice system during an appearance yesterday on Mickelson in the Morning, a leading Iowa radio program. Host Jan Mickelson began by bemoaning that the criminal justice system has been taken over by progressives. In order to fight back, he argued, conservatives should look to the biblical Book of Exodus. It says, if a person steals, they have to pay it back two-fold, four-fold, Mickelson explained. If they dont have anything, were supposed to take them down and sell them. Ah, that voice of the born again evangelical religious cult which loves the NIV god of the rich and hates Christ's demand that we take care of the poor. What a crock. Talk about imposing a Sharia fundamentalists law in America, here's Huck quoting from an over 3,000 year old Jewish law.

This guy hasn't a sliver of a chance at getting elected. For what it's worth, most evangelicals I know, if they heard this kind of talk, would brand the Huckster as a senseles Today we live in a humanist society. They control the schools. They control public television. They control the media in general. And what we have to say is we live in a humanist society .[Because] the courts are not subject to the will of the people through elections or re-election all the great changes in the last forty years have come through the courts. And what we must get in our mind is the government as a whole, but especially the courts, has be [T] he time has come when evangelicals are going to have to think about getting organized corporately .Im for evangelicals running for public office and winning if possible and getting control of the Congress, getting control of the bureaucracy, getting control of the executive branch of government According to Schaeffer, Robertson, and Billy Graham, then arguably the three most famous and influential leaders in the American protestant church world, Gods people had a moral duty to change the government of the United States Significantly, at the time, many other fundamentalist ministers were identifying communism and secular humanism as religions. However, the equating of a political ideology on the one hand, and a philosophy that rejects supernaturalism on the other hand, with religions was not accidental.[18] It allowed the preachers to revile an economic-political system as well as a philosophy as false religions, even demonic religions, which Christians should reject at any cost.[1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:41:51.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
