Bob Menendez \nA U.S. Supreme Court decision once assailed by Sen. Bob Menendez and campaign finance reformers is now at the center of his legal defense as he fights bribery charges. \nFive years ago, Menendez called it a “dark day for democracy” when the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Citizens United v. FEC that any person or group could make unlimited contributions to super PACs, then a new breed of independent spending committees. Menendez, a Democrat from Paramus, predicted that super PACs would skew the political debate toward the rich, giving them the ability to spend without limit. \nNow, Menendez is relying on the same protections in Citizens United to defend himself from charges that his biggest donor, Florida eye doctor Salomon Melgen, bribed him in part with $600,000 in super PAC donations. Under the court’s logic in that Citizens United ruling, Menendez argues, Melgen was exercising his free speech rights in 2012 when he cut two $300,000 checks to Majority PAC, a group the New Jersey senator does not control but that supports Democratic Senate candidates around the country. Melgen had designated the entire $600,000 to support Menendez’s reelection. \nRelated: Menendez fails to have federal case thrown out but four bribery charges dismissed \nThe Supreme Court indicated in Citizens United that no donor could be prosecuted on bribery charges for donations made to a super PAC, Menendez’s attorneys argue, a sweeping position that would transform the legal landscape for political donations if the courts were to adopt it, campaign-finance experts say. \n“The indictment is a direct assault on Supreme Court precedent,” attorneys for Menendez wrote in court filings. Citizens United and related cases, they wrote, “confirm that no quid pro quo corruption can arise when a private citizen contributes to a bona fide super PAC, because a bona fide super PAC does not coordinate its expenditures with a candidate.” \nBy rejecting this argument last month, a federal judge for the first time expanded the meaning of bribery to cover some donations to super PACs, campaign-finance experts said. Some say the issue could return to the U.S. Supreme Court. For now, it is headed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, because Menendez is appealing the ruling. \nRelated: Judge postpones Menendez corruption trial \n‘Changing daily’ \nThese independent spending groups have become a staple of political campaigns since the Citizens United ruling in 2010, unleashing hundreds of millions of dollars into the political arena. Super PACs allow candidates’ supporters to leverage historically large donations in contests from the presidential race to state elections and local council races — they are considered to be the most influential type of all the new outside groups that have grown out of the politicians’ fundraising arms race over the last decade. \n“The law around super PACs is still being developed, and the use and abuse of super PACs is changing daily,” said Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor and former director of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \nBefore Menendez’s trial begins, the appellate court must settle whether it’s possible to bribe a public official by donating to a super PAC. \nA federal judge in Newark ruled against Menendez last month, holding for the first time that a public official could in theory be bribed with a donation to a super PAC. U.S. District Judge William Walls did not weigh in on the evidence against Menendez; he said the bribery allegations should go to a jury. That ruling, if it is upheld on appeal, would be a significant step in developing the law around super PACs. \nEven if the donations went to Majority PAC and not Menendez’s campaign, the prosecution’s case turns on U.S. bribery law, Walls found. The big questions, he continued, are whether Menendez gave any “subjective” value to the PAC donations, in the same way someone might consider an expensive gift that might be seen as a bribe. \nIn addition, the judge wrote, U.S. law considers it a criminal offense “to give anything of value to any other person or entity, with intent to influence any official act.” \n“Public officials have been convicted for being influenced in the performance of their duties in return for bribes paid to third parties,” Walls wrote. \nSloan said the bigger question is whether Menendez specifically requested the super PAC donations or understood he was getting something valuable from Melgen in exchange for specific governmental actions. Ultimately, that is a question for a jury, she said. \nBy law, super PACs are not allowed to coordinate with any candidate, and the Supreme Court has said in Citizens United and other cases that donations to super PACs are a protected form of free speech. In practice, some super PACs are now vastly funded “shadow campaigns,” according to Paul S. Ryan, a lawyer at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington. They also are a key component of any major candidate’s electoral strategy, he added. \n“The prosecution is using this indictment to criminalize behavior the Supreme Court has repeatedly explained cannot be criminal, because contributions to super PACs cannot be improper ‘things of value’ to candidates who lack any say over their expenditures,” Menendez’s attorneys argued. They are preparing to file several appeals of rulings Walls issued last month. The judge allowed most charges against Menendez to proceed to trial. \n“Judge Walls in the Menendez matter got it right,” Ryan said. “To me the answer is obvious: Yes, of course, big contributions to a super PAC that will be spent in support of an officeholder can corrupt that officeholder.” \nBut he said court rulings on the matter would likely do little to stem the tide of outside spending, which reaches new heights with almost every election. So far, Ryan said, Menendez’s case “certainly hasn’t done much to discourage or chill the activities of presidential candidates and their super PACs, who are pushing and in some instances breaking federal laws in this cycle.” \n“What we have in the 2016 federal election cycle are super PACs created by candidates like Jeb Bush that are operated by close associates, that are dedicated to the election of a single candidate,” Ryan said. “It’s a shadow campaign.” \nA super PAC supporting Bush has raised more than $100 million this year. America Leads, a super PAC supporting Governor Christie’s candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, has raised more than $10 million. \nFunds for 2012 race \nThe First Amendment claims also are among the most important parts of the embattled senator’s defense. Menendez was indicted this year for receiving a series of gifts and $750,000 in bribes from Melgen, $600,000 of which went to Majority PAC. The PAC is run by people close to Sen. Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader. \nMelgen had stipulated that the $600,000 was for New Jersey’s 2012 Senate race. In the end, Menendez won reelection against state Sen. Joe Kyrillos, R-Monmouth, by 20 percentage points. \nAt the time of those two $300,000 contributions, in June and October 2012, Melgen was appealing a decision by federal health regulators. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had imposed a $8.9 million penalty after finding that Melgen overbilled Medicare for a drug to treat macular degeneration called Lucentis, prosecutors said. \n“Approximately six days after Melgen issued a $300,000 check … to Majority PAC, earmarked for New Jersey, Menendez advocated on behalf of Melgen’s position in his Medicare billing dispute,” prosecutors in the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section wrote in the indictment. Menendez also went to bat for Melgen before the Department of Health and Human Services after Majority PAC received the first $300,000 donation in June 2012, prosecutors charged. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:37:48.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
