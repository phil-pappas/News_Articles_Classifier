And now you're telling me that Harry Reid has endorsed Paul Ryan? Did you see that? Harry Reid's endorsed Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan says (paraphrasing), “I'll do it, but I have to be unanimously elected. I am not traveling on weekends, I stay with my family. And you gotta get rid of that provision that Thomas Jefferson wrote that can recall the Speaker. If you do all that, I might think about doing it.” And the Democrats are right along line with this.\nNow, if I'm not mistaken, isn't Paul Ryan the guy the Democrats accused of pushing a wheelchair-bound granny over the cliff? And now they're deciding that's the guy they want to be the Republican Speaker? What does that tell us all? ” – Rush Limbaugh", "external_links":
