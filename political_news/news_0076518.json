The four-week average, a less volatile figure, has fallen 8.2 percent over the past year to 267,500.\nApplications are a proxy for layoffs. Recent lows had pointed to greater confidence among employers. Yet the recent decline in hiring points to increased caution as growth has slowed in China and stalled in Europe. The reduced pace of growth cut into demand for oil and U.S. exports, hitting job gains in September. Employers added just 142,000 after notching average monthly gains in excess of 200,000.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
