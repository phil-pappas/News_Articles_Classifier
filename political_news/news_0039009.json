That’s a combination that hits the sweet spot councils and regions are now desperate to find as they calculate how to balance the books in a new era when they gain greater control over business rates, but will, eventually, have no direct grant from government.\nBeside the sea in Bournemouth, local authority chief executives are gathered in sessions and over coffee to decode the real meaning of what Simon Parker, director of the New Local Government Network, has described as a high stakes race between cuts and devolution. \n\nAllowing councils to keep all their business rates has been a dream of local government for decades, but the devil is in the detail. The inconvenient truthis that myriad Whitehall-controlled red tape is hedging in this idea, with councils able to cut business rates, but not put them up, unless they have a mayor who is directly elected. Council bosses worry that Osborne is setting up a race to the bottom that will set different parts of England against one another. \nRelated: George Osborne’s localist ideal is a race to the bottom \nBalancing the books will be no easy feat and councils are expecting very bad news indeed on 25 November, when the chancellor will announce next year’s public sector budgets. In addition to the usual budget bruisers, including the huge and rising cost of adult social care, councils now have to consider the implications of the newly-extended right to buy scheme .\nCouncil bosses are a collegiate bunch, but they fear being pitched into an era of divide and rule, as local politicians compete for resources. One answer will lie in pulling together many different strands. Chief executives and local politicians must become more like Osborne. Like him, they need to be magpies and steal good ideas wherever they can find them.\nOne way to do that is through even-closer partnerships with other local bodies. A guide to devolution , published on Wednesday by thinktank Localis and consultancy Grant Thornton says it is impossible to overstate the importance of councils having “non-local authority bodies onside”. That means working much more closely with clinical commissioning groups, universities, housing associations, the voluntary sector and the wider business community.\nGary Porter, chair of the Conservative-controlled Local Government Association , has told councils that they should employ their new powers over business rates to steal business from abroad, instead of from each other. He is reported by Local Government Chronicle as urging councils to “nick a load of business from … places like France where the bureaucracy is a nightmare”. \nPorter’s vision is of an England where local authorities will unite and rise as one, to attract the brightest graduates and businesses from around the world, to fuel our northern powerhouses , our Midlands growth engines, our financial hubs of the South East.\nWell, maybe. But there is genuine concern in Bournemouth that there is now no such thing as a policy for local government and that the drive for self-sufficiency will see council set against council, north against south, region against region. Whitehall wants a series of deals with metropolitan areas and large regions – and what then of the fate of smaller, poorer places?\nParker describes local authority chief executives as the best hope of a new, sustainable approach to healthcare, skills, housing and much more besides. Let’s hope he’s right. \n\nSign up here for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday.
