Photo: Hwa Goh\nViewers of the ABC satire Utopia can't help but make comparisons with the pioneering BBC series Yes Minister which premiered 35 years ago.\nBoth deal with the tensions between ministers, their staff and public servants.\nBoth have more than a ring of truth about them.\nBut there is one major difference between the two shows.\nAdvertisement In Yes Minister and its successor Yes Prime Minister , the bureaucracy wins out. Sir Humphrey runs his minister while paying deference to him and allowing him the illusion that he's in charge.\nIn contrast, in Utopia the public servants struggle to meet the ever changing demands of their political masters.\nAnd the difference may not be due simply to the sketch writers' imagination.\nIt probably reflects what has actually happened in government.\nThose with long memories will recall the days of the Seven Dwarfs, the public servants who, according to legend, ran the government during and after World War II. There's no agreed list but those named usually include Roland Wilson, H. C. (Nugget) Coombs, Fred Shedden​, John Crawford and Henry Bland.\nAll had long careers in senior public service positions. Wilson, for example, was Labor and National Service secretary from 1940 to 1946, Secretary to the Treasury from 1951 to 1966 and then chair of the government-owned Qantas airline and the Commonwealth Bank. Nugget Coombs was director general of post-war reconstruction from 1943 to 1949, Governor of the Commonwealth Bank from 1949 and Governor of the newly created Reserve Bank in 1960. He officially retired from the public service in 1968 but continued to work in many positions of great influence until the mid 1970s.\nCoombs is credited with conceiving and planning grand schemes such as soldier settlement, the Snowy River Hydro dams and the establishment of the ANU.\nIn the following years other mandarins such as Arthur Tange, Secretary of the Defence and Frederick Wheeler in Treasury were of the Yes Minister mould, seeking to run the show according to their agenda.\nWilliam Dunk, who headed the External Affairs department between 1945 and 1947 and went on to chair the Public Service Board put the Yes Minister approach bluntly, saying he made recommendations that were word-for-word what he hoped would emerge from Cabinet.\n\"I do not see how you can deal with it any other way. Certainly you do not get much change from either Minister or Cabinet these days….. if you just dish up about half a dozen alternatives, three of them silly, two of them 'maybe' and one perhaps good, and it is only the good one you want anyhow. I do not think we can run away from, or need run away from the fact of influence, and I don't care a hang what word you apply to it.\"\nToday I doubt if any department head would say such a thing.\nAt some time in the late 20th century, the culture changed to that seen in Utopia . Public servants were required to be more \"responsive\" to ministerial demands.\nAt times this \"responsiveness\" has run to extremes, as in the 2001 Children Overboard Affair where public servants were so keen to do their masters' bidding that they allowed false statements to run uncorrected.\nThe Senate Committee which went on to examine the Children Overboard Affair observed that some public servants were too concerned to please partisan government interests that they failed to keep proper notes, destroyed diaries and lifted security classifications of documents to keep them secret.\nIn her role as convenor of the People Smuggling Taskforce, Jane Halton, now Secretary of the Department of Finance, had first-hand experience of the Children Overboard Affair.\nShe told me some years later that among other things the experience had taught her of the need for good record keeping.\nFormer head of the Public Service Board, Andrew Podger​, is the foremost critic of the overly responsive service, arguing that there should be greater emphasis on the service's obligations of professionalism, impartiality and compliance with the law.\nBut it requires both status and backbone to take a stand.\nHow many today would refuse a direct request from the Prime Minister to mail out a publication, as senior bureaucrat Mike Codd​ did to Malcolm Fraser in 1979?\nFew department heads today have the longevity required to have status and we don't know if any have the backbone.\nInterestingly Jane Halton is one of the few department heads serving today who can claim enough career experience to warrant respect.\nAnother stayer is Lisa Paul, with ten years as head of the Education Department.\nBut only three department heads in recent years have both the departmental standing, status and longevity to match the gnomes – Dr Peter Shergold, who stepped down as head of the Prime Minister's department in 2008, Dr Ian Watt, who retired as secretary of the same department last year and who previously had a long stint as head of the Finance Department and Dr Ken Henry who retired as Secretary of Treasury in 2011.\nOthers have headed the Prime Minister's department but have been pulled in from outside, had short terms in the job and have been seen to be too closely linked to the Prime Minister who appointed them.\nThe position of Chief of the Defence Force still carries the authority to stop ministers in their tracks and past ministers would think twice before taking on former occupants such as Peter Cosgrove and Angus Houston.\nBut today public servants mostly have short careers at the top and simply do not have the presence to impress even a junior minister, or his or her staff.\nThe growth in ministerial staff has also shifted the balance. Utopia ministerial staffer Jim Gibson, played by Anthony Lehmann, has ample time to roam and harass the Infrastructure Australia crew.\nAnd not all ministerial staffers are as good humoured in their requests as Jim is.\nMany demand that public servants do as they're told and expect them, without question, to use their positions and funds to promote government policies.\nThe reality is no laughing matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:14:41.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
