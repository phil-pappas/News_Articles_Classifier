Jason Chaffetz's personal information.\nClancy says he now recalls knowing about the Chaffetz leak prior to being told last March of the imminent publishing of a Washington Post article breaking the story. Originally, he said that story is how he first learned about it.\nChaffetz is the chair of the congressional committee currently investigating Secret Service misconduct, and it was illicitly disclosed to the media that he had previously been rejected for a job at the agency.\nThe Post reported that Clancy now says he became aware of a \"speculative rumor\" about a 2003 Chaffetz application as early as March 25.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Obama: Congress needs to stop flirting with a shutdown \"Congress should ... pass a serious budget rather than flirt with another shutdown,\" said Obama.\nBy Barbara Boland • 10/03/15 11:05 AM \"It was not until later that I became aware that this rumor had developed as agency employees had used an agency database to gain access to this information,\" he said.\nChaffetz believes that this new story from Clancy is indicative of department inaction and possible malfeasance.\n\"It wasn't as if the director made any effort to squelch this at the time. He knew about it the day after the hearing.

Minutes later, Chaffetz's file was accessed by someone at Secret Service, according to an Inspector General report released earlier this week.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner The push to end the 40-year-old ban on oil exports heats up Multiple lobbying campaigns are beginning to lift the ban on oil exports ahead of a major vote next week.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/03/15 9:49 AM Top Story Lawmakers wary of McCarthy's ability to deliver GOP message   [Chaffetz] is running.
