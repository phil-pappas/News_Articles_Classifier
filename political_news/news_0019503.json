Since the Board of Education staff moved out of Douglas' Department of Education headquarters in May, investigators have not had remote access to the information and say they need it to properly do their jobs.\n\"There is nothing the Department of Education can possibly do to slow down the investigations,\" Douglas said outside the court building. \"We don't have guns and badges to go find out if people have done any wrongdoing -- all we can do is either say yes they're a certified teacher or yes you have the right person to either revoke or suspend their certificate.\"\nAZCENTRAL\nFor some, more questions than answers in Diane Douglas Arizona education plan\nShe said the board's decision to move out of her headquarters \"have made it much harder for teachers to become certified.\"\nRecords obtained by The Arizona Republic detail the number of licensed educators under investigation as of September, and illustrate Board of Education staffer's frustration with the Department of Education in the months leading up to the lawsuit.\nBetween Jan. 5, when Douglas took office, and Sept. 30, there were 407 open cases. Of the cases both opened and closed between Jan. 5 and May 8, around the time board investigators moved out of Douglas' office, five cases involved alleged \"conduct such as sexual misconduct with students\" and pornography on district-issued computers; five involved alleged assaultive behavior towards students; five involved educators who were alleged to have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs while in the classroom or on school grounds, or the possession of illegal substances; one involved theft; and seven involved alleged breach of teaching contract.\nIt is impossible to determine from the records whether or how much educators' investigations have been slowed.\nChristine Thompson, executive director for the board, was on vacation and unavailable for comment. In the past, she has said the investigations have been delayed and complicated.\nIn an e-mail to gubernatorial senior advisor J.P. Twist, Board of Education Executive Director Christine Thompson laid bare the problems surrounding the board investigative unit's accessing the certification database.\nAZCENTRAL\nDiane Douglas recommends 2 Arizona education board candidates\nAccording to records, the department's certification unit managed the issuance and maintenance of teacher certificates while the board's investigators were responsible for processing applications where applicants had a history of \"immoral or unprofessional conduct\" as well as investigating and disciplinary proceedings that could result in board action against an educator.\nThose investigations have been slowed and complicated, Thompson said, because they must walk to Douglas' headquarters about half a mile away to access information in the database, such as disciplinary history, and to add case notes into the database.\nNow, Thompson wrote, \"Investigators are required to sign in at ADE and to be escorted throughout the building.\nShe added the new process is \"slowing down the process of notifying districts of educators\" status, getting information to the public and processing investigations of unprofessional conduct. Investigators work 10-hour days during the summer, she wrote, but the computers are only available starting at 8 a.m. \"and are automatically shut down\" at 5 p.m.\n\"Investigators have been quietly warned by some staff that there is monitoring software on the machines,\" Thompson added.\nIn another e-mail, Douglas' chief of staff Michael Bradley expressed his own frustration with the board's decision to move out of the Department of Education's headquarters.\n\"Should I put you and the others down for annual leave, or for absent without permission,\" Bradley asked, writing to Thompson and others. \"What is frustrating is staff abandoning their assigned duties and duty stations without warning on a weekend. Usually, if offices are cleaned out on a weekend, one would expect burglars. It is fascinating to me that you feel frustrated after having committed such a disruptive act.\"\nHe maintained board staffers, under the law, must report daily to their \"assigned duty location,\" which is the Department of Education.\nA judge has ruled Douglas does not have the authority over board staffers. Douglas is appealing that ruling.\nFollow the reporter on Twitter @yvonnewingett or reach her at yvonne.wingett@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4712.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1de19d3700197058a0ec552bffb30e6cc810ffe1/c=498-0-3090-2592/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635803397871314269--X5R1362.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4f858232ed7bcea6c1997d9e1f4a57350bf0b20d/c=361-0-2493-2132/local/-/media/2015/10/01/Phoenix/Phoenix/635793236717160738-PNIBrd2-10-01-2015-Republic-1-A001--2015-09-30-IMG-PNI-Douglas-new-1-1-GNC3NGMV-L684691894-IMG-PNI-Douglas-new-1-1-GNC3NGMV.jpg", "https://twitter.com/yvonnewingett"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:14:49.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
