During the speech, the President spoke at length on the influence of the sharing economy. While this is not the first time that President Obama has publicly addressed the Uber-inspired, part-time and on-demand status of a growing segment of workers, his focus on the emerging employment trend highlights its importance moving forward as well as in the 2016 presidential race.

That’s a bad phrase,” the POTUS said. \nCould the President’s recent comments be an indication of how the Democratic party will deal with companies like Handy, TaskRabbit, Lyft and Uber in the future? That’s the question that executives in boardrooms across the U.S. seem to be asking themselves, today. \nHow and if the federal government should regulate the sharing economy is a major question, and it looks to be a hot issue heading into the 2016 election. A few interesting quotes from President Obama standout, however, and they show, for the most part, an internal conflict from the executive level in approaching nationwide regulation. \nLater in the speech, he said “we’ve seen an explosion of American innovation in the workforce. And because of technology, people are empowered and employers are empowered to create value and services in new ways … we’ve got to make sure that as we continue to move forward, both in this new “on-demand” economy and in the traditional economy as a whole, hard work guarantees some security.” \nFirst, it’s important to realize the context for Wednesday’s event and speech, which was ultimately to promote the WAGE Act. The legislation essentially sets forth a national plan to incrementally raise the minimum wage over the next several years, from $8.00 to $12.00 within 6 years—it was introduced to the Senate in May. \nNaturally, how lawmakers will implement and amend this law is unclear at the moment, but it’s sure to run into conflict with sharing economy businesses, which is to say their employees are “contractors” and as such should not be affected. \nAs it stands, on-demand drivers for these services are typically paid less than minimum wage but can make much more, depending on commissions. Unsurprisingly, the traditional services companies are, as it’s been widely covered, not happy about their disruptive rivals—as they believe the newer entrants are avoiding legitimate federal compliances. \n“We’ve got folks who are getting a paycheck driving for Uber or Lyft; people who are cleaning other people’s houses through Handy, offering their skills on TaskRabbit. And so there’s flexibility and autonomy and opportunity for workers,” Obama explained, “And all this is promising. But if the combination of globalization and automation undermines the capacity of the ordinary worker and the ordinary family to be able to support themselves, if employers are able to use these factors to weaken workers’ voices and give them a take-it-or-leave-it deal … then we’re going to have problems.” \nDuring the speech, Obama also said that “this is a fight on the ground” while touching on the importance of labor unions, the need to expand their influence in this conversation and working towards “strengthen[ing] workers’ voices across the country.” \nThe full transcript of speech can be found here.
