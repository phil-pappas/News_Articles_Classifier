The party, through a memorandum, also demanded ban on Modi's 'further rallies' in Bihar to uphold the \"true spirit of free and fair election.\"\nA three-member RJD delegation, comprising its national spokesperson Manoj Jha, Bihar spokesperson Chittranjan Gagan and state general secretary Bhai Arun Kumar, on Friday called on the chief electoral officer (CEO), Bihar, Ajay V Nayak and submitted its complaint addressed to the Chief Election Commissioner. The delegation urged Nayak to send the complaint to CEC Nasim Zaidi.\nThe memorandum also drew the EC's attention to Modi's remark â€” \"Hamara muqabala shaitan se hai (now our fight is with devil).\" It alleged the PM used \"disparaging and insulting\" remarks against the RJD president at his several political rallies in Bihar on October 8 by \"deliberately fabricating rumours and baseless\" allegation against him.\n\"Besides, he also went on not only to brazenly appeal to a particular caste but used provocative language for Yaduvanshis/Yadavs violating para 1 and 2 of the Model Code of Conduct issued by the EC,\" said the one-page complaint.\n\"These inflammatory and insulting speeches made by the PM also blatantly violate Article 153 of the Indian Penal Code, which amounts to promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony,\" the complaint alleged.\n\"What disturbs the political atmosphere and the idea of free elections (is) that these kind of insinuating remarks were coming from no less than the PM?\" the complaint reads.\n\"We urge you to have an informed look on the seriousness of the matter raised by us and take strong action by not allowing him (PM) to address further rallies, so that the true spirit of fair elections is upheld and peace in public life is not threatened,\" the complaint said.\nAddressing an election rally at Munger on October 8, the PM had said Lalu Prasad cannot absolve himself of his beef remarks by claiming that it was the 'shaitan' (devil) on his tongue which made him say it, and added \"I want to know how the shaitan got the address (of Lalu).\"\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-10T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:29:34.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
