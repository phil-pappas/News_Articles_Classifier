Gov. Gavin Newsom is raising money for his 2018 gubernatorial campaign by raffling off tickets to a Grammy-winning band that prides itself on its San Francisco pedigree. \n“We’re putting on a small concert with Train on November 3 in San Francisco, and I’m hoping you’ll be able to join me!” Newsom wrote in an email to supporters Wednesday. “When Train played the Bay Area this summer, it was for a crowd of 22,000 – but this will be a small crowd and an intimate venue (not a bad seat in the house!). We’ll get to hang out with the band before the show, and I’ll also introduce you to some of my family and friends – and Jen will be there, too, of course!” \nA donation of $5 or more automatically enters the contributor to win two tickets, plus travel and hotel costs for winners coming from out of town. \nFormed in San Francisco in 1993, Train has had platinum-album hits including “Meet Virginia” (1998), “Drops of Jupiter” (2001), “Calling All Angels” (2003), and “Hey, Soul Sister” (2009) – the latter from the album “Save Me, San Francisco,” of which the title track is a paean to the city by the bay . \n  Elwood \nWhen I saw the headline I thought it meant Handsome Gavin Newsom was selling tickets for Jerry’s crazy train. JohnW \nI’m pretty sure Gavin has read the tea leaves and signaled that he isn’t on board the Jerry Train. Grant Macdonald \nLt. Governor Gavin Newsom; could you please tell Gordon Getty to pay the overdue bill at MACDONALD BANK after we earned Getty Oil Company shareholders over $4,000,000,000 …! \nGrant MacDonald & MACDONALD BANK are filing a $22,000,000,000 Getty/Hitler war crimes lawsuit based on J. Paul Getty’s support for Hitler beginning in 1938 and the GETTY OIL COMPANY shipments of oil during the Battle of Britain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:10:39.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
