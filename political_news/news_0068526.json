Not everyone has the spare money for pay TV. \n\"While the quarter-final with be live and free to air, New Zealand First will continue to fight for an equal footing with our Australian and UK friends who under the law are guaranteed free and live coverage of listed events. Our Bill, Broadcasting (Games of National Significance) Amendment Bill, is awaiting selection from the members’ ballot. \n\"I have made a stand and I will not shave until the All Blacks bring the World Cup home or the tournament is over. I’m confident I won’t be shaving anytime soon.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:51:24.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
