(Photo: AFP) Islamabad: Pakistan on Thursday said it was ready for talks with India to resolve all outstanding issues, including the core issue of Kashmir, but without pre- conditions.\n\"We have insisted for negotiations on all issues including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan is ready for talks but pre-conditions are not acceptable,\" Foreign Office spokesperson Qazi Khalilullah said at a media briefing.\nHe said the four-point initiative presented by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at the UN General Assembly last month is the way forward for reducing tensions and the resolution of outstanding disputes.\nThe spokesperson also said the dossiers was given to the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to inform him about the alleged Indian involvement in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan.\nHe said that Pakistan will continue to inform the United Nations about its concerns in this regard in future as well. He also criticised the violence in India over the issue of beef and said a country claiming to be a secular state should guarantee the basic rights of minorities.\n\"Attacks on Muslims on the issue of cow slaughtering are beyond comprehension and a cause of concern for the Muslim ummah (community),\" Khalilullah said.\nThe spokesperson also said that India is known as the world's second largest exporter of beef.\n\"The export of beef is not possible without the slaughtering of cows,\" he said.\nTalking about cancellation of popular singer Ghulam Ali's concert, the spokesman said it was \"regrettable\" that Pakistani artists were receiving threats in India.\nHe said that cultural exchanges were vital for the improvement of relations between the two countries.\n Pakistan Pak India talks World India Pak outstanding issues Also Read Ukraine forces abandon airport Sri Lanka Prime Minister urges unity after election victory Taliban confirm leader's death, choose Mullah Omar successor How the US plans to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/world-neighbours/article/ready-talks-india-without-pre-conditions-pakistan", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Pak-_1_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Pak-_1_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:33:53.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
