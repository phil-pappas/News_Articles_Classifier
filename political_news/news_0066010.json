I'm only posting about it not because it's “my day in the barrel,” but because of the injection into it of unconstitutional federal overreach.\nBut first, the latest instance of an intolerant “boy named Sue” :\nA “transgender” student, who identifies as female….\nBut is most definitely and resoundingly male, and always will be.\n….has voiced frustration after Palatine-based Township High School District 211, Illinois’ largest high school district, denied his plea for full access to the girls’ locker room.\nAnd nobody should give a good Goddamn about his “frustration” because he's one student and in a society concurrently being blitzed by the feminazi “rape culture” jihad, one would think that the rights and opinions of hundreds of girls at that high school should and would take precedence.\nBut that just isn't the leftwingnut identity politics pecking order:\nThe district denied the student’s request citing privacy concerns for the rest of their students. [But] the Department of Justice’s Office of Civil Rights already ruled that “transgender” students should be granted unrestricted locker room access . A violation of this ruling could be deem discriminatory, a decision that threatens withdrawal of federal education funding.\nFederal education funding is, of course, also unconstitutional, since none of the seven Articles or twenty-seven Amendments enumerate education as a power of the federal government. But the feds ladle it out anyway, and that will be more than sufficient leverage to, well, screw those hundreds of high school girls and shove a boy with a big talleywacker under his skirt into their naked midst.\nHere are more sordid details :\nThe Department of Justice argued in a brief to a federal court [back in June] that “transgender” high school students should be able to use school restrooms that match up with their “gender identity,” and can’t be forced by the school to use the restroom that matches up with their physical characteristics.\nIt wasn't that long ago that this would have been called a mental illness and their demands would have been deservedly laughed and sneered at.\nBut on this, too, the world has been turned upside down and inside out.\nIt’s the first time the federal government has tried to make the case for this “transgender” right in a courtroom.\nBeats me what took the Regime this long to do so.\nJustice’s Civil Rights Division filed the brief on behalf of [Gabriella] Grimm, a Virginia high school student who “identifies as a boy,” even though Grimm was born [and is, and always will be, female.]\nThese messed-up young people are invariably supported to the hilt by their equally messed-up parents. I'd wonder what in the bloody hell is wrong with these parents, but then they obviously poisoned their children with this “transgender” insanity, or at least didn't take steps to correct them and/or get them the psychiatric help they clearly needed. And now they are insisting on inflicting their parental malpractice, their outright child abuse, on everybody else and calling it a “civil right”; and the Regime that sixty-two million Americans twice voted for is backing them up.\nYou know what the Obamas should do now? They should publicly announce that they're both “transgender” – “Barack” is really “Bobbie,'” and “Michelle” is really Michael. Which would mean that we've already elected – twice – our first woman president as well as our first black president, which would have the virtue of removing the last remaining justification for Hillary Clinton's insatiable power lust.\nAnd the best part of all? Sasha and Malia might in that case have been adopted, and therefore might have a chance of having escaped that crippling genetic handicap.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to go piss out the window.", "external_links": ["http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/.a/6a00d834515c5469e201b8d10c3695970c-pi", "http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/justice-dept.-transgender-students-can-use-bathrooms-that-match-their-gender-identity/article/2567357", "http://news.yahoo.com/rights-collide-transgender-teen-barred-locker-room-over-153441378.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:11:51.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
