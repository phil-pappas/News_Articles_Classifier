Taxpayers’ Union Executive Director, Jordan Williams, says: \n\"Wasting millions on a line that barely saw one, five-carriage train per day crawl along it would be a shameful waste of money. Hawke’s Bay has much higher infrastructure priorities than this.” \n“This week saw Rio Tinto deploy its first 69 driverless trucks. For rail that means its days are numbered. To satisfy a vocal train enthusiast lobby, Mr Nash appears to want to subsidise Walkmans when it’s very clearly an iPod world.\" \nSince Helen Clark's Government renationalised rail in 2008, the total cost of subsidies and write-downs of KiwiRail has totalled $12.8 billion. \n\"$12.8 billion is an average of $2,863 for every New Zealander trying to breathe life into loss-making lines up and down the country,\" says Mr Williams. \"This is pork barrel politics at its worst.\" \n“Mr Nash is one of the smarter members of the Labour Party’s caucus. What is it about rail that makes even sensible politicians go so silly, and want to waste taxpayers' money flogging a dead horse?\" \nENDS New Zealand Taxpayers' Union \nNew Zealand's grassroots campaign for lower taxes and less government waste \nThe New Zealand Taxpayers' Union is an independent activist group, dedicated to being the voice for Kiwi taxpayers in the corridors of power. It's here to fight government waste and make sure New Zealanders get value for money from their tax dollar.
