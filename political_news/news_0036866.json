But the charge will still be less than the $750 it costs to create each of the spaces, Larson and Armstrong said, according to people who attended the meeting.\nWhile space is limited, getting into the convention itself is free for credentialed media, and roughly 200 seats where reporters can watch the proceedings and speeches, albeit without a writing surfaces or an electrical outlets, will remain free of charge. But sight lines to convention speakers is typically inferior in those seats, and they are not situated in a way that allows news organizations to add — at their own cost — hard-wired communications such as Internet and telephone lines or to set up shared wi-fi networks that they also pay for. Reporters consider these communications tools essential if working on deadline.\nThe RNC routinely has charged broadcast networks for the costs of building working space for their staff. However, those setups are much more elaborate, and range from $10,000 in cost for a broadcast platform to nearly $100,000 for an anchor desk.\nMembers of the press corps said they hope the GOP will reconsider, and expressed concern that the increased cost particularly will squeeze smaller outlets.\nJonathan Salant, chairman of the Standing Committee , referred to the charge as an \"access fee,\" and said the press has never been charged to cover public officials at public news events that have significant interest to the general public.\n\"We expressed our opposition to the access fee,\" said Salant, Washington correspondent for New Jersey Advance Media. (The company operates NJ.com and, like the Northeast Ohio Media Group and The Plain Dealer Publishing Company, is owned by Advance Publications.) \"We hope they will reconsider.\nAs for the size of the fee, the impact will depend on the news organization, he said.\n\"I don't think it will break the bank,\" Salant said, but \"editors are already weighing costs.\" In an era of news media cutbacks, an added expense could play into news organizations' decision of whether to attend and cover the convention, he said. \"This will just be another cost.\"\nA spokesman for the Republican National Committee declined to comment for this story.\nThe Q will be the primary venue for the convention, scheduled for July 18-21, 2016. The arena will undergo an estimated $20 million in modifications for the RNC, including removing 3,500 seats and 30 luxury suites, building five platforms for the major networks and creating 30 affiliate broadcast centers, officials have said.\nThe arena will not be completely available for the RNC work until the completion of the Cleveland Cavaliers season. The work could be particularly rushed if the basketball team makes a championship run, as they are expected to do.", "external_links": ["https://owa.plaind.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=vm3PJVQLDkmUHduzNAOwrYPdHjR21tIIARx_CArctAZd7OTN-x39Hxildi_AvFbCGwxGcIp2JvQ.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.cleveland.com%2frnc-2016%2findex.ssf%2f2015%2f06%2fanother_cavs_title_run_might_s.html", "https://owa.plaind.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=vm3PJVQLDkmUHduzNAOwrYPdHjR21tIIARx_CArctAZd7OTN-x39Hxildi_AvFbCGwxGcIp2JvQ.&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dailypress.senate.gov%2f%3fpage_id%3d23"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:45:38.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
