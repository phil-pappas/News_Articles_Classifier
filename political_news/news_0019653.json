(Joe Raedle/Getty Images) By Katrina vanden Heuvel October 13 at 9:11 AM Follow @KatrinaNation Tuesday night, Democrats will finally hold their first presidential debate. Already ideas for the drinking games are piling up. Take a drink for any question mentioning Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server, the FBI or Benghazi. A sip for every time Martin O’Malley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee are asked how they expect to win given their lack of support in polls or in money. A drink when the candidates are asked what they think about Vice President Biden getting in the race. Another for every time the candidates are invited to attack someone else on the stage.\nAnd if you want to get plastered quickly, two shots for all if Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is asked in the first five minutes if he really thinks Americans will vote for a socialist. A drink for every time he’s called an outsider or he’s asked if his proposals are “realistic.” A full shot for questions on his writings from decades ago, cheap titillation utterly divorced from his qualifications.\nEditor and publisher of the Nation magazine, vanden Heuvel writes a weekly column for The Post. View Archive Facebook RSS The media narrative on the Democratic race has already congealed. Clinton, the prohibitive favorite, has been sliding in the polls, burdened by the scandals over her private server and her “character.” Sanders, the insurgent, is rising but can’t win because he’s a “socialist.” The remaining three are too far behind to count. Joe Biden, the media wait for you.\nThis is the reigning narrative, and the moderators very likely will feel it’s their “responsibility” to impress that conventional wisdom on those watching the debate. They will try to put each candidate in a box that has very little to do with the substance of his or her ideas for the country.\nAlready the pundits are complaining about the dearth of insult. The Clinton campaign has indicated she has no intention of attacking Sanders and alienating his supporters. And Sanders, who has never run a negative campaign ad, says he looks “ forward to an exchange of ideas with Secretary Clinton. She and I have significant disagreements on a number of issues.”\n“With that kind of trash talk, I can hardly wait,” whined media critic Howard Kurtz on Fox News . He couldn’t imagine what the debate would look like if the two leading candidates “aren’t going to slam each other.” It surely won’t be “scintillating television,” he concluded. His remedy to the horror of a substantive debate is that the “main moderators” supply “any fireworks.”\nBut why not use this occasion not for cheap shots or horse race babble but to explore what Americans are interested in: Who has the best ideas for making this economy work for working people and for addressing our real security challenges?\nOne sensible focus should be the contrast between these candidates and the Republican field on the direction for the country. The recent Candidate Scorecard released by the Campaign for America’s Future measures the Democratic candidates against a popular populist agenda of political and economic reforms. Not surprisingly, Sanders gets the highest scores, with O’Malley second and Clinton third. But what is striking is the extent to which all of the major candidates embrace populist reforms.\nAll support raising the minimum wage, guaranteeing paid family leave and paid sick days and empowering workers to organize and bargain collectively. All support moving to universal pre-K and providing debt-free college. With Clinton’s recent switch, all oppose the president’s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. All favor increasing taxes on the rich and shutting down corporate tax dodges, and increasing public investment in everything from infrastructure to new energy and research and development. All call for more regulation on Wall Street and more accountability from chief executives. All have put forward ambitious plans to address climate change. All support comprehensive immigration and criminal justice reforms. All would curb big money in politics.\nThe contrast between these positions and those of the Republican field is stark — and worth highlighting in the debate.\nEqually important, the moderators should resist labeling ideas politically “unrealistic” or candidates “unelectable” or too radical. Voters will decide who is electable; debate moderators can keep their biases to themselves. The Beltway consensus — a.k.a. “mainstream ideas” — on corporate trade deals, tax cuts and deregulating Wall Street, austerity lite, starving public investment, scorn for labor unions and harsh mandatory sentencing has failed most Americans. We are now in our second straight “recovery” in which the typical household is losing ground. We won’t get out of that by continuing the same failed policies. The moderators might be well advised to show more skepticism about conventional thinking than about fundamental reforms.\nFor example, the American Society of Civil Engineers reports that it will take more than $3 trillion dollars over five years to bring our infrastructure into “good repair.” Sanders commits to a major program to rebuild America, raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for it. Clinton and O’Malley echo PresidentObama in calling for an increase in investment far smaller than what is needed. It is hard to see why the latter is somehow more realistic.\nSimilarly, Clinton, like many “mainstream” voices, supported the disastrous intervention into Iraq (though she now apologizes for that decision), the ill-considered foray into Libya and the myth of the “moderate opposition” in Syria. Sanders and others who have been opponents of these ventures surely have been more realistic.\nOur debate formats are more conducive to marking out a position than elaborating one. But why not focus the debate on the contrasting visions for America’s future? Forget the gotcha questions about private servers or youthful follies. Can the scorn about socialism. Don’t waste time on the horse race or the polling. Let these candidates contrast their ideas with Republicans and with one another. Highlight where they agree and where they differ. Let them make their case without trying to put them in a box. Republicans already are wallowing in a grotesque food fight, both in their debates and now in their House caucus. Why not let Democrats have a debate that features ideas rather than insults?\nRead more from Katrina vanden Heuvel’s archive or follow her on Twitter .\nTo read more on this topic:\nMichael Gerson: The Democrats’ wounded queen?\nGeorge F.
