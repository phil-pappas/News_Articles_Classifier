I can bet that lawyer that he will be running away from the Committee sitting the day he gets there…\" Baako said on Kokrokoo on Peace FM \nHe revealed that a lawyer of one of the suspended judge was so embarrassed at the Disciplinary Committee he walked out on his client after viewing the damming evidence where he saw his client collecting a bribe.
