And for those who invested more money with Madoff, they could get back at least 61 cents on the dollars for their investments if their claim has been approved, Harbeck said. He called it a \"major victory.\"\nU.S. officials have recovered $11 billion of the $17 billion believed to have been lost when Madoff's Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008. A majority of the money recovered has come from the bank accounts of Jeffrey Picower, now deceased, an alleged co-conspirator. His widow agreed to turn over the $7.2 billion Picower made in the scheme to the victims, which is more than Madoff himself made, officials said.\n  Webb drops out, considers independent run \"I'm stepping aside from the Democratic primary process,\" Webb said.\n  1:21 PM After the next round of payoffs, the Picower trust will have paid out over $9 billion and hopes to recover and distribute $3 to $4 billion more.\nIn 2009, Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison. Now 77-years-old, Madoff is serving his time in at FCI Butner, a medium-security facility in North Carolina.\n(h/t ABC News )\nTop Story Biden: 'I actually like Dick Cheney'   Hillary Clinton's skills working with others.\n  11:33 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:27:18.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
