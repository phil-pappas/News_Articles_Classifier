Supporting a civilian nuclear agreement with Pakistan - a Benedict Arnold ally of the US - while the Pakistani government continues to demonstrate it cannot be trusted would be irresponsible and dangerous,\" Mr Poe said.\nIn his letter Mr Poe expressed strong concern about reports that the US is engaged in policy discussions, and possible bilateral negotiations, with Pakistan related to its nuclear program which may include US support for a US-Pakistan civilian nuclear agreement, relaxation of Nuclear Suppliers Group export controls and possibly also NSG membership.\nAs the Chairman of the Subcommittee on the House Foreign Affairs Committee responsible for non-proliferation issues, he requested that a briefing on this issue be arranged for him as soon as possible.\nOne of the vital US national security interests is to ensure that Pakistan has a safe and secure nuclear arsenal and infrastructure. Constraining Pakistan's nuclear weapons program and its development and its ability to threaten India and other countries is also a key US objective, he said.\n\"However, as you well know, Pakistan's nuclear program has been built through the theft of technology, deception, and clandestine international cooperation. Its record of unabated nuclear proliferation, first as a recipient and then as an active proliferator of nuclear know-how and technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea, is long and well-documented,\" the lawmaker said.\n\"If you consider the US-Indian civilian nuclear cooperation, the contrast cannot be starker,\" Mr Poe told the President.\n\"India had no record of nuclear-related proliferation. Pakistan has yet to come clean on its nuclear (and missile) dealings with China, North Korea, Iran and Libya. India did not try to cover up or grandfather nuclear cooperation with other countries - because there was none. Pakistan continues its efforts to grandfather reactor deals with China. India committed to a separation of its military and civilian programs, while Pakistan has not,\" Mr Poe said.\n Nuclear deal US lawmaker barack Obama Pakistan Also Read Pakistan to challenge bail for 26/11 mastermind Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi Pakistan spends $1.9 billion on anti-Taliban offensive Kashmir issue root cause of Indo-Pak tension, says Bilawal Bhutto Zardari US prepared to confront challenge posed by Ebola: Barack Obama", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/obama%20sharif_0_0_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/obama%20sharif_0_0_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/world-americas/article/us-lawmaker-urges-obama-not-ink-any-kind-nulear-deal-pakistan", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:38:05.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
