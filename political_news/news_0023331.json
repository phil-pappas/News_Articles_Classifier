This substantial new power will give councils more control over business rates, and an opportunity to tailor them to their local area.\"\nHe said the SNP government had already \"set a strong platform nationally by delivering the most competitive business taxation in the UK\" with the Small Business Bonus Scheme meaning companies either pay no rates or a reduced amount for 96,000 properties.\nMr Swinney said: \"Scottish councils will be able to use these powers from the end of this month and, in contrast to England, will be able to retain all the business rates they collect.\nShare article \"With these new flexibilities councils could, for example, use their local knowledge to attract new investment into town centres and help create vibrant communities where people want to live, socialise and do business.\"\nCouncils welcomed the move, with Kevin Keenan, the finance spokesman for the Scottish local government body Cosla, describing it as a \"positive start to the journey on increasing local flexibility of funding and taxation powers for councils\".", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-16T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:58:07.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
