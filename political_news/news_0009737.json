It has been a privilege to be a part of various teams during my career including the Indian cricket team, Baroda, Mumbai, Worcestershire (critical to my comeback in the national team in 2007), Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils.\n\"Today I have many many individuals to thank – from physios, trainers, support staff, colleagues, captains, coaches selectors, senior officials, administrators in various associations, groundsmen, team management, as also team owners.

It has been a pleasure to play alongside them as each added a different perspective. I have enjoyed listening to them as also contributing in a small way to their growth,\" he said.\n\"I can't thank my parents enough for understanding me and allowing me to chase my dream. My elder brother, Zeeshan, who dutifully reminded me that, 'my job wasn't finished with my India debut, but I needed to make every game count'. My younger brother, Anees, has shouldered a lot of pressure which allowed me the freedom to enjoy on the cricket field,\" he added.\n\"To those millions of fans and well wishers of Indian cricket who've watched and encouraged me over the years, I trust you know that I was always trying and never gave up.\"\nIn the end, Zaheer expressed his gratitude towards the game.\n\"Cricket has been my only life over the past two decades and is in fact that the only thing I know well. Cricket has made me the individual I am, giving me everything in life and much more. I walk away with fantastic memories, life defining experiences and great friendships.\nMy mother summarised it well in reaction to my decision to retire, 'Theek hein, bahut accha safar tha hamara' (It's ok, our journey has been very good),\" he said.\nTags: Cricket India Zaheer Khan ICC World Cup 2011 Also Read India’s World Cup hero Zaheer Khan announces retirement from international cricket The most clever fast bowler I know, says MS Dhoni Zak of all trades!", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://deccanchronicle.com/151015/sports-cricket/article/zaheer-khan-reveals-why-he-retired-international-cricket", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Zaheer-Khan_AP_0_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "https://www.facebook.com/imzaheerkhan", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Zaheer-Khan_AP_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://www.facebook.com/imzaheerkhan/posts/10153132211091625", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:07:53.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
