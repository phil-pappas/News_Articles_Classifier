Updegraph, the Republican candidate for Lockport 2nd Ward alderman, owes more than $7,500 in unpaid property taxes on two Spalding Street houses she owns, along with more than $3,000 in sales tax sought by the state from her business.\nThe delinquent property taxes were dug up by Updegraph’s opponent, incumbent Democrat Anita Mullane. The Buffalo News confirmed the figures Friday and also found that Updegraph’s special effects business, Darkride Studio, was hit with two sales tax liens by the state Department of Taxation and Finance in 2013.\n“She has plenty of money for signs, but she can’t pay her taxes,” Mullane said.\nHow much money Updegraph has for yard signs and other political costs is unknown, because she hasn’t filed any financial disclosure forms with the state Board of Elections, as required by law.\n“It is unfortunate that Anita is taking the low road with her cheap, tawdry assertions,” Updegraph, a first-time candidate, said in an email to The News.\nShe accused Mullane of “gutter tactics and smears” and added, “Unlike my opponent, who has always drawn her paychecks from the public sector, my husband and I actually built a business and contributed to the public treasury by paying taxes.”\nMullane is a teaching assistant at Charles Upson Elementary School in Lockport. The News confirmed that her taxes are paid in full.\n“For someone who wants to run the finances on the City Council, you should make sure that you’re doing everything correctly and paying your bills on time and that your home finances are in order before you try to turn around the city’s,” Mullane said.\nPublic records show Updegraph owes the city, Niagara County and Lockport City School District at least $7,591.03 in taxes, penalties and unpaid water, sewer and refuse bills, along with $3,111.77 in sales taxes owed to Albany.\nThe county taxes owed on her home are unpaid for 2012 through 2014, the county Treasurer’s Office confirmed. The city Treasurer’s Office said this year’s city taxes, issued in January, haven’t been paid. Updegraph paid the city $10,000 at last year’s tax foreclosure auction for another house, on which this year’s county and city tax and last year’s school tax are delinquent.\nHer email did not address why the property taxes are unpaid. As for the two-year-old sales tax liens, Updegraph said, “You can be assured that we will have this taken care of in the current quarter, as we are just entering our busy season.”\nUpdegraph said she had to change campaign treasurers because of an illness, and that’s why she hasn’t filed her required financial disclosure forms.\n“We are wrapping up a retroactive filing,” she said.\nMullane’s campaign finance forms are up-to-date. She has raised $2,220 this year and spent $796.20.\nemail: tprohaska@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:46:37.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
