WFTV published footage of the July hearing on Tuesday. Collins has refused to comment on her decision because the woman could still file an appeal. Collins, who was re-elected last year, sent the woman to jail for refusing a court order to appear during the trial of her abuser. According to WFTV, she also had the option of fining the woman or ordering her to perform community service for failing to respond to the subpoena. There's that compassion we all have seen time and time again against women. OMG. What a bitch this judge is.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:48:22.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
