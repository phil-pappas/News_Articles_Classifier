Fire trucks and police vehicles blocked the road for a block in every direction. \nA witness at the scene said that two civilians, a father and son, were hit by falling debris while returning from prayer. A firefighter is also being treated for minor injuries. They were all transported to Methodist Hospital. \nGov. Andrew Cuomo offered a statement, following similar explosions in East Harlem and the East Village earlier this year. He stated he intends to direct the state Department of Public Service to investigate the cause of the explosion. \n“This explosion is the latest in a disturbing trend of incidents that occurred in Harlem and the East Village,” he said. “On behalf of all New Yorkers, my thoughts and prayers are with those who have been impacted by today’s explosion, especially the friends and family of those lost or injured.” \nCity Department of Buildings staffers are to assess the damage. National Grid said they were responding to the scene and working under the direction of the FDNY to shut off gas in the area, CBS2 reported.
