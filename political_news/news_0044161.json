While the government makes minor increases in our refugee quota, it continues to support bombing campaigns and occupations in the Middle East which only make the problem worse. \nOn November 17th and 18th Wellington city plays its own part in the cycle of endless war by hosting 2015's annual Weapons Conference, in which companies get a chance to network and promote themselves as legitimate industries rather than the war profiteers that they are. \nWhat has happened about the conference in the past?What is happening about the upcoming conference?How big is the weapons industry in Aotearoa?What can we do about it? \nCome along and share kai and conversation on these important topics. Speakers include Murdoch Stephens from the Doing Our Bit campaign and Valerie Morse on the NZ Weapons industry, along with an action briefing for the November conference. \nWednesday, 21st October, 6pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:22:30.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
