The program, open to all coeds of accredited two and four year universities, promises to match any payment made by the young woman towards her student loans up to the amount she earns as a legal prostitute at The Bunny Ranch over a 60 day period.\nHof (author of \"The Art Of The Pimp\") says he took notice over the years that, as tuition skyrocketed, he was seeing more in debt college students flocking to his legal brothel to make the large amounts of money needed to pay for their education. \"I had a University of Michigan cheerleader named Krissy Summers come to The Bunny Ranch a few years ago after she was $40,000 in debt with student loans,\" says Hof. \"She paid them all off in two months. She even ended up liking the business and staying long enough to fund her graduate studies.\"\nFurther evidence to Hof was the growing number of his employees that he was initially encountering in an academic capacity.\n\"We have The University Of Northern Nevada (located in Reno ) right here in The Bunny Ranch's back yard, and every semester one of their sociology professors brings her class to our brothel for a very popular field trip,\" Hof chuckles. \"The purpose of their excursion is to ask questions and see how our ladies interact with a wide variety of clients, but each year a couple of the students end up coming back to fill out applications. I never forget a pretty face, and when I see the girl working as one of our legal prostitutes and I ask her where I know her from, she always says 'the sociology department's field trip!'\"\nPresident Obama has publicly called for broad revisions to the student loan structure that often financially cripples college graduates well into adulthood. Hof received an honorary doctorate this past year, and says that \"making education affordable to all who want it is a humanitarian endeavor. I felt a responsibility to use my position to help others in that regard.\"\nDennis Hof is available for interviews by contacting pr@bunnyranch.com or by calling 775-721-0276 or 775-720-9090.\n releases/bunny-ranch-brothel-launches-student-loan-matching-funds-program-300154526.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bunny-ranch-brothel-launches-student-loan-matching-funds-program-300154526.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=LA20456&Transmission_Id=201510060800PR_NEWS_USPR_____LA20456&DateId=20151006", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:26:29.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
