Maybe not murder, but I know a guy just like you,' \" Kelly said. Kelly said that he \"liked (Clinton) for a long time\" and plans to vote for her, citing Clinton's stance on gun control among other factors. Kelly said that while he really \"really likes\" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, he is \"lighter on gun control.\" RELATED: 'Inside the GOP's House of cards' Read More \"If we hold our elected officials accountable, the majority of this country wants change, so its going to happen and I have to, in my heart, believe that,\" Kelly said. The \"House of Cards\" star said the Democratic debate made the Republican debates \"look like a clown circus.\" \"And I'm not just talking about Donald Trump,\" Kelly said, referencing former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's \"really sharp\" comments in his closing remarks as effectively distinguishing the Democrats from Republicans. Kelly said that divisions in the country are really strong and \"the country needs\" candidates like former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, who can \"pull people form both sides.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:44:24.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
