While looking for more data, I found that the Congressional Research Service (CRS) already had done the analysis. Their report, #R42729, from December 12, 2012, can be found here: https://www.fas.org/ .... It looked at a number of variables using appropriate statistical techniques and found no statistically significant correlation between the 65-year reduction in the top statutory tax rates and economic growth. Nor did it find a correlation between tax rates and savings, investment, or productivity  everything that Republicans invoke as a mechanism by which tax cuts produce their supposed growth. Further, the same results were obtained for capital gains tax rates. In the end, only one variable strongly correlated with tax cuts: inequality. The income share of the top 0.1% goes up as their tax rates go down. Surprise! This is unambiguous and definitive. Republicans are wrong about tax cuts. Ronald Reagan was wrong then, and Jeb! is wrong now. It all has been arm-waving, wishful, unsupported pontification. In the end, what Republican tax polices do, all that they do, is increase the wealth and power of the already wealthiest and most powerful. More Below. Of course, anyone who can add and subtract knew this already. The corporate media just wanted to keep the lie alive for their right wing base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:25:38.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
