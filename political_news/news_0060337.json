MPs voted to axe the peers' change to the Cities and Local Government Bill by 301 votes to 220, with a majority of 81.\nIt means the Tory flagship devolution Bill no longer contains the protection introduced in the House of Lords, which was designed to prevent ministers from making it a condition that large powers are only devolved to a city or group of authorities led by a directly elected mayor.\nMillions of pounds in funding will be available if an agreement can be reached.\nBut Northern Powerhouse Minister, James Wharton refuted Kevan Jones and Ian Mearns' claims, insisting the Government was not \"imposing\" mayors on regions.\nJames Wharton defended the Government's position in Parliament today. He added that any such move would come first as a proposal from the relevant local authority in return for major powers.\nSpeaking in the Commons today Mr Wharton said, \"Mayors are not being imposed anywhere. If any area has a mayor, it will be because that area, through its democratically elected representatives, has chosen to have one.\"\nMPs are continuing to debate the Bill on the first day of committee stage in the Commons.\nLast updated Wed 21 Oct 2015 Politics devolution", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:36:03.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
