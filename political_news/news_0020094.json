Trust us, trust me, to always do the best for you, for your family and for your community.\"\nTo underline her determination to reform public services in the years after 2016, Ms Sturgeon will announce a major scheme to relieve pressure on emergency hospitals by creating extra capacity for routine operations.\nUnder the plan, the Golden Jubilee hospital, which is run as a national waiting times centre, will receive a £50million investment.\nNew centres will also be created at St John's Hospital, Livingston, Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Ninewells in Dundee, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the Raigmore in Inverness.\nThe move will help ready the NHS for an expected 50 per rise in the number of over-70s by 2037.\n\"If we don't prepare now for 10 and 20 years ahead, our NHS will be overwhelmed by the demand,\" Ms Sturgeon will say.\n\"Our manifesto will rise to the challenges of the future.\"\nMs Sturgeon will also use her speech to rule out SNP support for possible airstrikes on Syria, reinforcing a conference resolution tabled by the party's foreign affairs spokesman Alex Salmond.\nShe will reiterate the Scottish Government's willingness to \"play a full part\" in the resettlement of refugees displaced by the bloody civil war.\nBut she will add: \"What we should certainly not do in Syria is make matters even worse.\n\"The motivation for UK military action appears to be based on a need to do something, rather than any real consideration of whether the action proposed will make a positive difference.\"\nShe will say that airstrikes by the US, Russia and other powers have failed to resolve the conflict and argue: \"What is needed is not more bombing but a renewed and intensive diplomatic initiative led by the UN.\"\nShe will add: \"At a time when sovereign countries need to work together to resolve issues of such magnitude, the prospect of UK withdrawal from the EU seems even more misguided.\"\nHowever, the main focus of her speech will be the SNP's bid to win an unprecedented third term in power next May.\nHer plea to \"trust us\" mirrors comments by John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, who used his speech to frame the election as a choice between the SNP and an \"untrusted\" Labour.\nHe acknowledged economic problems, including rising unemployment, but added: \"At the election in May, people can entrust these challenges to the SNP or they can gamble with the untried, untrusted and divided Labour Party.\nShare article \"Our task is to persuade the people of Scotland that the one, the only party to entrust these challenges to is Scotland's party, the SNP.\"\nTo underline the Scottish Government's efforts to boost the economy he announced immediate plans to give local authorities the power to cut business rates.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-17T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:35:04.666+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
