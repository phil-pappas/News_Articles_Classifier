They are also accused of shooting vultures, squirrels, foxes, feral hogs, doves, ducks, cormorants, blue herons, alligators, white egrets, armadillos and raccoons.\nAnd that's just the critters; the group also allegedly shot road signs and mailboxes. Officials say they also burgled hunting cabins.\nDepartment Spokesman Carter Smith called it a \"reprehensible and senseless killing spree\" that had \"no resemblance to hunting,\" according to the release. \"And I know sportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts everywhere will be appalled to learn of this thoughtless waste of life. It is fitting to see these violators brought to justice, thanks to an observant landowner who provided the initial tip and the diligent work of our Texas Game Wardens working with the sheriff’s office.”\nContact: Craig Malisow Follow: Houston Press Houston Press", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/HairBallsNews", "http://www.twitter.com/houstonnews_"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:04:37.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
