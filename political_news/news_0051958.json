Barack Obama -- ardently. \"I voted for Obama, I made donations, I had phone banks, I set up at condominiums and (sent) thousands of emails,\" said Barr, a 74-year-old south Florida resident. \"By the third year, I realized I made a humongous mistake.\"\nThe next election, he voted for Republican nominee Mitt Romney as a rejection of Obama's policies toward Israel. And as the 2016 election nears, Barr has no plans to vote for Clinton, the Democratic front-runner.\nRepublicans have seized on Obama's rocky relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has publicly clashed with the President over Iran and the Palestinians, to argue that Obama has not been a strong ally of the Jewish state. And they're extending that criticism to Clinton, who carried out Obama's policies for four years in her role as his secretary of state.\nREAD: In backing Iran deal, Clinton stresses commitment to Israel\nRead More Though Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat, conversations with Jewish voters at Ben's Kosher Delicatessen in Boca Raton suggested the GOP strategy is more than just wishful thinking. Patrons expressed deep dissatisfaction with Obama's dealings with Israel, and those feelings have tainted their impression of the former New York senator, who won Florida's Jewish voters 2-to-1 over Obama in the 2008 primary.\nHal Silverman, a 78-year-old Brooklyn transplant who's lived in Boca Raton for the last 25 years, was one of those Democrats who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. In the latter contest, the President won the county -- Palm Beach -- by 17 points, thanks in part to the Jewish vote; the county has the fourth-highest number of Jews in the country.\n\"I've always voted straight Democratic Party unless I particularly knew one or two of the people running who weren't Democrats who were better for the community,\" he explained on a sunny Friday outside Ben's, where CNN spoke with a dozen Jewish voters about Clinton and the 2016 election.\nDisaffection over Middle East policy\nBut U.S. policy under Obama toward Israel and Iran has turned Silverman off from the President.\nAnd from Clinton: \"Absolutely, absolutely,\" Silverman said.\nEllen and Bob Hausner, a married couple of nearly 30 years divided along party lines, said they have finally found a point of agreement -- or mutual disapproval -- on politics. (Hint: She's a pantsuit aficionado and the leading Democratic candidate for president.)\n\"I would say a lot of people are disenchanted with the Democratic Party. People down here in particular,\" said Ellen, the Democrat in the family. \"They have issues with the Iran deal now. They have issues with what's happening domestically, and they just have lost confidence and respect in Obama. And I don't think they're particularly supportive of Hillary.\"\nBob, a Republican, gleefully eyed his wife in agreement.\n50 photos: Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight 50 photos: Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pictured here on Tuesday, March 3, has become one of the most powerful people in Washington.

For her, this goes beyond policy; it's personal.\"\nDespite talk of a slide in Jewish support for the Democratic Party since Obama's election in 2008, Jewish voters still turned out in droves for Obama in 2012. Obama's share of the Jewish vote slipped to 69% from 74%, based on exit polling, a fall that mimicked drops among other typically pro-Democratic voting blocs.\nThough Jews make up about 2% of the national population, they comprised 5% of voters in Florida that year, also according to exit polls. While still a small fraction of the total, every vote in the crucial battleground state is hotly contested. Florida's Jewish population also tends to be older and less progressive than Jews in many other parts of the country, making them more inclined toward hawkish positions on the Middle East.\nREAD: Hillary Clinton opposes Israel boycott, unilateral moves on peace process\nKenneth Wald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who has studied the Jewish vote throughout his career, said that while there's a clear \"unease\" about Obama's policies toward Israel among American Jews, he would \"be surprised if that crystallizes into a significant political shift.\"\n\"For as long as I've been studying Jewish voters, people keep telling me this is the year we're going to see the transformation,\" he said. \"I just think that this is stuff that happens between elections and the atmosphere changes when you actually get into choice.\"\nAnd the Clintons, he said, still enjoy \"a very deep well of attachment\" among Jewish voters.\nUnfortunately for Clinton, though, her staunchest supporter outside the Boca Raton delicatessen last Friday refused to be named for fear that her friends would mistakenly think she's anti-Israel.\n\"A lot of my friends, family -- some of whom are Democrats -- do not feel that Obama is for Israel. It's plain and simple,\" she said.\nShe said she was not concerned \"at all\" about the strength of Clinton's support for Israel and said that while she waffles on whether the Iran deal is good, she is hopeful it will result in a peaceful outcome.\nShe also hopes that one of her own reasons for supporting Clinton will resonate with fellow Jewish voters.\n\"People know the Clintons and I think that that will reign over anything else,\" she said. \"You know, voting for Hillary is voting for two presidents, not one president. So you're getting two for the price of one. And a lot of Jewish voters loved Bill.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130123105257-02-clinton-gallery-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg",
