And, of course, many people know the story when I was 14 and I tried to stab someone,\" Carson said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\"You know, fortunately, you know, my life has been changed,\" he added. \"And I'm a very different person now.\"\nCarson's comments came after Donald Trump, his leading opponent for the Republican presidential nomination, said at a rally in Miami on Friday that Carson has even less energy than Jeb Bush, who the developer has repeatedly called a \"low-energy\" candidate.\n\"Ben Carson is super low energy, right? He's super low,\" Trump said. \"Super low energy. We need tremendous energy. We need tremendous energy.\"\nRead More Carson told NBC's Chuck Todd that he thinks people mistake his soft-spoken manner with a lack of energy.\n\"I do have a tendency to be relaxed,\" he said. \"I wasn't always like that. There was a time when I was, you know, very volatile. But, you know, I changed.\"\nThat's when Carson mentioned his violent childhood growing up in Detroit, Michigan. He'd also detailed his youth in his book \"Gifted Hands,\" writing about nearly stabbing a friend during an argument before beginning to read the Book of Proverbs and applying its lessons.\nRELATED: Carson: 'My energy levels are perfectly fine'\nCarson, a retired brain surgeon, pushed back against Trump on Saturday in Iowa, too.\n\"As I've said many times, there have been many times where I've operated 12, 15, 20 hours, and that requires a lot of energy,\" Carson said. \"Doesn't require a lot of jumping up and down and screaming, but it does require a lot of concentration.\"\nTrump has taken aim at Carson after two polls showed that Carson had surpassed him as the Republican front-runner in Iowa.\n\"Donald Trump falls to second place behind Ben Carson,\" Trump said, pretending to read a headline. \"We informed Ben, but he was sleeping.\"\nThen, at a rally in Jacksonville on Saturday, Trump expressed incredulity at Carson's rise.\n\"I don't know what the hell is going on there,\" he said. \"I don't get it!\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics Correction: An earlier version of this story had misstated the show on which Carson appeared.
