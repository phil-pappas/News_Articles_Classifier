The colleges are also working with the Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology to encourage Chinese student enrolments into courses relevant to New Zealand’s wine industry. \nFollowing the district council’s signing of a sister city agreement with Haikou in 2014, Whangarei Intermediate School, Whangarei Girls’ High School, and Whangarei Boys’ High School have received $5,000 to develop sister school relationships. The schools are also collaborating with NorthTec, which has an existing relationship with Haikou Vocational Tourism School and Haikou College of Economics. \nThe China-New Zealand Sister School Fund has a total of $50,000 in funding available to schools, and was announced during President Xi Jinping’s visit to New Zealand in November 2014. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:43:35.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
