More China seeks to build chain of UK nuclear plants \nAudit Scotland said Scottish health boards were under financial strain as demand grew for its services from an ageing population. \n“The NHS in Scotland missed seven of its nine key waiting time targets and standards at March 2015, reflecting a general decline in performance in recent years,” it said in its annual report. \nNicola Sturgeon, first minister, said at the SNP’s conference last week that she was happy to be judged on its eight years in power, during which the party had “protected our precious NHS” by increasing its budget by £3bn to £12bn since they took office in 2007. \nBut Audit Scotland said that when inflation is taken into account, Scotland’s health budget, including both day-to-day and capital spending, had fallen 0.7 per cent between 2008-09 and 2014-15. \nThe watchdog said Edinburgh had made inadequate progress towards its goal of shifting the balance of care from hospitals to patients’ homes and communities, and that it needed to introduce longer-term financial planning by hard-pressed regional boards. \n“The NHS will not be able to continue to provide services in the way it currently does . . . together, these pressures signal that fundamental changes and new ways to deliver healthcare in Scotland are required,” it said. Under the SNP government [the health service] has suffered from a lack of resources and a sticking-plaster approach \n- Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour \nThe auditor noted pressures including drug costs that had risen 4 per cent in cash terms from 2012-13 to 2013-14 and a 15 per cent surge in spending on temporary staff from 2013-14 to 2014-15 amid higher employee turnover. \nLabour, which hopes public concern over the health system will help ward off a likely rout in May , said the audit report was a damning illustration of problems in the NHS. \n“Under the SNP government it has suffered from a lack of resources and a sticking-plaster approach,” said Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s public services spokesperson. \nThe SNP has waved aside criticism that it has not matched English health spending increases by pointing out that health spending is higher per head than in England. \nShona Robison, health secretary, said the decline in real-terms health spending during the seven years to 2014-15 reflected the completion in 2013-14 of a new hospital in Glasgow. Total health spending in 2013-14 was slightly above the 2008-09 level in real terms. \nMs Robison said she agreed with Audit Scotland that more urgent action was needed to promote care in the community, but insisted the NHS was performing better against tougher targets under the SNP. \nThe auditor said the NHS had done well against two standards involving prompt referral for drugs and alcohol treatment, and decisions on cancer treatment. \nBut it said performance in seven other areas, including A&E waiting times, inpatient appointments and patient discharge, had shown a “pattern of steady decline over recent years”. \nDespite the SNP’s criticism of what it calls the creeping “privatisation” of NHS services south of the border, Audit Scotland reported that Scottish health boards were also using the private sector to help them meet targets by increasing short-term capacity. \n“Since 2009-10, NHS spending on using the private sector has increased by 18 per cent in real terms,” the watchdog said, although it also noted that at £85m this only accounted for 0.8 per cent of total NHS day-to-day spending.
