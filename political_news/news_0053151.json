Sylvia Garcia Reproductive Equity Awards take place Wednesday write a letter illustration by Jason Stout \nIt’s no secret that abortion rights and adequate health care for women have long been under siege by Texas lawmakers. The ongoing crisis is both dispiriting and dismally repetitive.

In advance of the Austin Reproductive Equity Awards this Wednesday, Oct. 7, which will honor both Tuma and Sen.
