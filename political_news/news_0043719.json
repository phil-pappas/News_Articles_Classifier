Participating units from the Royal Canadian Navy include Canadian Fleet Pacific, Halifax-class frigates HMCS Calgary (FFH 335) and HMCS Vancouver (FFH 331), and Victoria-class submarine HMCS Chicoutimi (SSK 879). “The Royal Canadian Navy frequently participates in training exercises such as this with the U.S. in order to provide mutually beneficial realistic and relevant training which is necessary for the proper integration of units from various nations to work as a cohesive task group,” said Cmdr. Julian Elbourne, commanding officer of Calgary. “We look forward to this exercise in order to continue to build our proficiency as allies.” U.S. Navy units include Commander, Expeditionary Strike Group (ESG) 3, Commander, Amphibious Squadron (CPR) 1, amphibious assault ship USS Boxer (LHD 4), amphibious transport dock ship USS New Orleans (LPD 18), and dock landing ship USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49). “We are excited to have the opportunity to work with the Royal Canadian Navy,” said Capt. Keith Moore, CPR 1, currently embarked on Boxer. “Operating with our [Canadian] counterparts during this exercise will facilitate a quicker and smoother integration into the coalition environment during our upcoming deployment.” The U.S. 3rd Fleet exercise serves to train units in amphibious warfare, air defense, anti-submarine warfare, surface warfare, and maritime interdiction operations, while also building a strong working relationship between the maritime forces of the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. and Canada regularly participate in exercises together, the most recent being Pacific Partnership and Trident Fury. Joint, interagency, and international relationships strengthen U.S. Third Fleet's ability to respond to crises and protect the collective maritime interests of the U.S. and its allies and partners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:39:08.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
