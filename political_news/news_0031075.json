How about a hot dog at your favorite sporting event? It depends on the portion size, according to the study published in Lancet Oncology. According to the researchers, each 50-gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increased the risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent.\n\"For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,\" Dr. Kurt Straif, head of the IARC Monographs Programme, said in a press release . \"In view of the large number of people who consume processed meat, the global impact on cancer incidence is of public health importance.\"\nRed meat refers to beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse and goat. Processed meat refers to meat that has been salted, cured, fermented, smoked or processed to enhance its flavor or improve preservation. This type of meat includes hot dogs, ham, sausages, corned beef, beef jerky, canned meat and meat-based preparations and sauces.\nGrilling, pan-frying or cooking red meat at high temperatures produces the greatest amount of chemicals suspected to cause cancer, the report says.\n\"These findings further support current public health recommendations to limit intake of meat,\" Dr. Christopher Wild, director of IARC, said in the release. \"At the same time, red meat has nutritional value. Therefore, these results are important in enabling governments and international regulatory agencies to conduct risk assessments, in order to balance the risks and benefits of eating red meat and processed meat and to provide the best possible dietary recommendations.\"\nThe Other Side of the 'Beef is Bad' Story\nThe Best Protein You Can Eat\nTAGS: cancer diet and nutrition food and drink colon cancer", "external_links": ["http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)00444-1/abstract", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek7eb%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek7eb%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr240_E.pdf", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek7eb%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek7eb%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Red%20Meat%20May%20Cause%20Cancer", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek7eb%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Red%20Meat%20May%20Cause%20Cancer&summary=The%20international%20study%20links%20red%20meat%20consumption%20to%20colorectal%2C%20pancreatic%20and%20prostate%20cancer.%3Cbr%20%2F%3E&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZek7eb%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Red%20Meat%20May%20Cause%20Cancer"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:19:32.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
