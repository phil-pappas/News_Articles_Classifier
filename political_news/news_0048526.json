They were drawn in a demanding group with Ferro Carril Oeste, Fluminense and Vasco da Gama, where only the winner progressed.\nArgentinos began with a 1-0 loss to Ferro, but rebounded with two wins in Brazil: 2-1 over Vasco da Gama and 1-0 against Flamengo. They shared the top spot with the other Argentine team and moved on after a 3-1 playoff win ( Claudio Borghi 2 - Carlos Ereros). Waiting for them in the semifinals was Blooming and Independiente, the defending champion. Argentinos went up 2-0 in the first five minutes thanks to goals by Mario Hernán Videla and Jose \"Pepe\" Castro. Quickly José Percudani pulled one back. It was pins and needles when in the 89th minute the referee called a penalty for Independiente. Marangoni took the shot and Vidallé became the hero when he stopped it to put Argentinos into the final against America of Cali.\nThe first game was played on October 17 in the Monumental stadium of River Plate, with the home side getting the 1-0 victory thanks to an Emilio Commisso header. Five days later, Cali won by the same score (Willingto Ortiz). The tie-breaker would be played 48 hours later in Asuncion. The Argentines arrived decimated without their two strikers (\"Pepe\" Castro and Carlos Ereros), leaving the talented Claudio Borghi as the only reference in attack. Commisso opened the scoring and Ricardo Gareca headed home the tying goal. The match would go to penalties. The first eight all scored: Gareca, Olguin, Cabins, Batista, Herrera, Pavoni, Soto and Borghi. The last shot for the Colombians came down to De Avila who shot strong to the right of Vidallé, who dived in that direction and punched the ball out.\nChilean referee Hernán Silva made a mistake and ended the match, but one shot remained for the Argentines with the score tied at 4-4. With his usual calmness, Mario Videla placed the ball to the left of Falcioni and Argentinos Juniors were now champions.\nThe teams for the final:\nArgentinos Juniors: Enrique Vidallé; Carmelo Villalba (Carlos Mayor), José Pavoni, Jorge Pellegrini (Miguel Lemme), Adrián Domenech; Jorge Olguín, Sergio Batista; Mario Videla, Renato Corsi, Emilio Commisso; Claudio Borghi. Coach: José Yudica. América de Cali : Julio Falcioni; Hugo Valencia, Gonzalo Soto, Henry Viáfara, Gabriel Chaparro; Pedro Sarmiento, González Aquino, Roberto Cabañas; Willington Ortíz (Antonhy De Ávila), Ricardo Gareca, Juan Battaglia (Hernán Herrera).
