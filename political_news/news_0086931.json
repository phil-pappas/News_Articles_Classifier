Our political reporter Leah Ferguson was there and has this special blog:\nIn a gloomy boardroom at St Paul's Centre today, the unions representing States workers are seething.\nAn atmosphere of deep discontent, to put it mildly.\nThey are rallying against the government's approach to tackling the financial deficit and opposing the job cuts happening across the public sector.\n£145m The financial 'blackhole' that the States need to fill The words emboldened on the large white screen in front of me scream out their frustration.\n\"The States' approach is flawed\", they say.\"Unions are deeply concerned, disappointed\".\nThey talk of a workforce \"terrified of redundancy\", \"terrified of the slash and burn approach\" and \"terrified of the brutal cuts.\"\nThe language used is emotive but they get their message across in a calm and collected way.\nStop freezing wages\nA plea to the States Employment Board to reverse the freeze on pay rises comes forward.\nUnion members are \"public servants\" they say, \"dedicated to providing the best services for Jersey\". Why should they be punished, they ask.\nIn the unions' eyes their workers \"deserve to be rewarded fairly\". No one can argue those points, surely.\nYet the Council of Ministers have argued that \"pay restraint\", as they call it, is vital in order to make savings, after all the States is spending more than it earns.\n£70m Planned to be cut from public sector wage bill 'Outsourcing is a dirty word here'\nThose cuts could mean outsourcing services too. Outsourcing is a dirty word in this room. Unions say it would force workers into private company contracts, an \"attack on pay and conditions\".\nOne union member in the room says private companies are already visiting his site, working out the costs of providing the service in order to tender for the contract.\nAnother union member says morale in his department is on its knees. He says trust in the States Employment Board has reached rock bottom.\nUnite, one of the unions attending today Credit: Anthony Devlin / PA Wire/Press Association Images A breakdown in communication\nWhat comes across most loudly from this meeting is an apparent breakdown in communication between unions and the States Employment Board who set policy.\nUnions say, rather than being dictated to, they want meaningful conversation. A lack of negotiation and a lack of detail in the government's financial plan is only serving to instil fear in their workers.\nSenator Andrew Green Senator Andrew Green, States Employment Board\nI met Senator Andrew Green earlier today. He sits on the States Employment Board. I asked him why public sector workers are baring the brunt of the government's austerity measures.\nHe was almost apologetic, saying he understands workers' concerns, but he said cutting the States' wage bill is the most appropriate way to make savings.\nThe unions do not accept that. So furious are they, they're taking to the streets on Saturday, to shout out their feelings of discontent.\nThey're opting for maximum impact, in the hope their very visual message will get through to States members who are due to vote on the Medium Term Financial Plan on Tuesday.\nLast updated Thu 1 Oct 2015 Politics Jersey", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LeahFergusonITV"], "published": "2015-10-02T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:21:41.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
