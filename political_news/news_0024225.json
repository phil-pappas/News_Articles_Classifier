On Monday, Gregg called 30 minutes before an interview was to begin saying that he and his attorney were working on legal matters and he needed to postpone until Tuesday. Then Tuesday afternoon, Gregg sent an e-mail saying he wouldn't be able to sit down with News 3 at all because his attorney advised against it, though he hoped \"that under the advice and guidance of my legal counsel that I will be able to do an interview with you in the very near future.\" \nGregg lost his $85,884 position on the parole board after the Rauner administration began investigating reports in the Belleville News-Democrat that Gregg listed outside income on his bankruptcy filing in federal court in Benton. Members of the parole board in Illinois are not allowed to have outside income. \nNews 3 has also obtained the bankruptcy documents in which $4,027 in \"net income from operating a business, profession, or farm\" is listed under Gregg's name. His attorney also typed in a large box on a monthly expenses document that \"Debtors (sic) income will be reduced due to self employment being greatly reduced.\" \nReached by phone over the weekend, Gregg told News 3 his attorney made an error and it should've been listed under his wife's name. \nBut Gregg's attorney, Brad Olson in Carterville, tells News 3 that all information for bankruptcy filings come from clients. \n\"In addition, all bankruptcy filings are approved and signed by the client,\" Olson wrote in an e-mail. \nOlson says another income statement has been filed with federal bankruptcy court in which the outside income is now listed under Mrs. Gregg's name. \nGov. Rauner's general counsel, Jason Barclay, wrote Gregg on Friday saying it was too late to try to correct the record, saying a letter Gregg wrote him on September 20 \"constitutes an admission\" that both his bankruptcy filing and the Statement of Economic Interests he filed for his parole board position \"were both false.\" \nIn the letter, obtained by News 3, Barclay warns Gregg that he could be guilty of violating federal and state laws. \n\"Whether your conduct constitutes willful criminal violations or whether your belated efforts to correct that conduct are sufficient to cure any possible criminal violations is for law enforcement officials to decide,\" wrote Barclay. \nAs for what got Gregg in such a deep financial mess that he needs to file for Chapter 13, his attorney says medical bills are to blame. Just weeks after the Leap Day Tornado of 2012, according to News 3's archives, Gregg developed a dangerous case of diverticulitis. He underwent emergency surgery and doctors removed 18 inches of his intestine. \nA bankruptcy filing from last December showed Gregg owed $38,031 to Deaconess Hospital of Evansville. \nOlson said that because debt collectors were not pursuing Mrs. Gregg, \"her bankruptcy filing was not necessary.\" \nAccording to the federal government's computer system, Eric Gregg will next have to appear in bankruptcy court in December. \nMeanwhile, he is considering legal action against the state. He told News 3 over the weekend he did nothing that rises to a level that would enable a governor to remove an appointee who's been confirmed by the Illinois Senate. Barclay disagrees, citing Article V, Section 10 of the Illinois Constitution . It states, \"The Governor may remove for incompetence, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office any officer who may be appointed by the Governor.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:02:45.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
