Jeb Bush said while discussing the Second Amendment and shootings, also saying: \"Look, stuff happens. There's always a crisis.\"\nOn Facebook, neurosurgeon Ben Carson wrote that he \"never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away.\" He also last week suggested arming more people - including \"well-trained\" kindergarten teachers - could prevent violence.\nLike a number of rivals, Gov. Christie has advocated for focusing on mental health rather than tighter gun restrictions. \"We don't need new laws in this country,\" Christie said at a town-hall meeting last week in New Hampshire, when asked what he would do for people \"who proudly own guns.\"\nIn the primaries, \"the best bet for Republican candidates is to avoid any talk of gun control and instead shift attention to issues like mental health,\" said Julian Zelizer, professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\"Republican primary voters tend to be more conservative than the rest of the electorate, so it is too risky to take any other kind of position,\" Zelizer said.\nChristie's remarks countering the need for more gun laws may be in line with his party's base, but his record and past rhetoric have drawn mixed interpretations.\nOn the campaign trail, Christie is touting his veto of a ban on .50-caliber guns passed by the Legislature, describing it in a radio interview as a \"crazy\" gun law. In 2013, Christie put forward a plan to reduce gun violence that included a ban on future purchases of the Barrett .50-caliber.\nIn New Hampshire last week, Christie spoke of \"holding back all of these gun grabbers at the gate\" and said New Jersey has \"some of the worst gun laws in America. All of which were passed before I became governor.\" In signing a package of bills in 2013 that targeted gun violence, Christie said the measures would \"strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws.\"\nChristie tells early-primary state voters that he's been unable to change New Jersey's gun laws because the state's Democratic-led Legislature won't put forth bills to do so.\nRunning for governor in 2009, Christie responded to a question from Fox News' Sean Hannity on whether there were any areas where he was \"moderate to left\" as a Republican by saying, \"I favor some of the gun-control measures we have in New Jersey.\"\nSome gun-rights advocates said Christie could be more proactive, including by easing the state's standard for obtaining a permit to carry a gun, which requires applicants to demonstrate \"justifiable need.\"\nA spokesman for Christie said the justifiable-need standard was stringent because of court interpretation.\nEarlier this year, Christie announced - on the eve of his presidential kickoff - regulatory changes to enable domestic-violence victims and others facing \"a demonstrable threat\" to get gun permits more quickly.\n\"No matter where you are on the Second Amendment, you can find a reason to criticize Chris Christie,\" said Barry Snell, president of the Iowa Firearms Coalition, a National Rifle Association affiliate. \"He's one of those guys that he can't get out of any argument scot-free.\"\nAt a town-hall meeting this summer in Iowa, Christie got into a heated back-and-forth with a man who asked the governor about claims that he was \"antigun.\"\nTelling the man he was \"dead wrong,\" Christie told the man to look at his record, noting his veto of a bill that would have reduced the limit on gun magazine capacity from 15 rounds to 10.\n\"Is that somebody who's antigun?\" Christie asked.\nScott L. Bach, executive director of the Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs, praised Christie in a statement. \"Garden State gun owners owe Gov. Christie a debt of gratitude - his historic vetoes, pardons, and executive actions have disrupted the gun-ban agenda in New Jersey.\"\nGun-rights advocates in and outside New Jersey have taken notice of Christie's pardons of gun owners, including five this year. The pardons have involved people with valid permits in other states who have been arrested for taking their guns into New Jersey.\n\"Give Christie credit\" for the pardons, said Bob Clegg, a former New Hampshire Republican state senator who is president of Pro-Gun New Hampshire, a lobbying organization.\nChristie, citing concern for states' rights, has opposed the idea of a federal law to grant state reciprocity on gun permits.\n\"It's not what we want,\" said Clegg, who asked Christie about the issue in a private meeting. Still, \"for those of us who don't believe that more federal regulation is the answer, it was the right answer.\"\nIn New Jersey, Democrats are continuing to battle Christie over his veto of a bill that would require law enforcement to be notified when someone seeks to expunge a mental-health confinement record to obtain a gun.\nCriticizing the bill as part of a \"patchwork\" approach, Christie offered a different proposal, including a requirement that people previously involuntarily committed to mental-health treatment demonstrate \"adequate medical evidence of suitability\" to obtain a firearm-purchaser ID card.\nSenate President Stephen Sweeney (D., Gloucester) said Christie was \"trying to distract the public\" with a plan that \"fails to address public safety.\"\n\"The governor has shifted his position on gun safety in order to appeal to archconservatives in other states, but New Jersey legislators shouldn't follow his lead,\" said Sweeney, who is planning a second push to override Christie's veto, after Republicans who voted for the bill didn't provide enough votes for an initial override attempt.\nIn New Hampshire last week, Christie told voters \"violence in America is caused by criminals, not by everyday folks\" who want guns for self-defense, hunting, \"or for any other reason that they want to own them.\"\nHe vowed to protect gun rights, ensuring \"the Second Amendment is treated with the same measure of respect that all of the other amendments are treated.\"\nmhanna@phillynews.com\n856-779-3232@maddiehanna\nwww.philly.com/christiechronicles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:49:04.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
