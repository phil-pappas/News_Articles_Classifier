(AP) -- Pennsylvania state senators are forming a special bipartisan committee to look into removing embattled Attorney General Kathleen Kane from office under a never-used constitutional provision. \nFriday's announcement comes a day after the suspension of Kane's law license took effect. A top Senate lawyer, Drew Crompton, say more details are to come. \nUnder the constitution, certain elected officials can be removed by the governor and a two-thirds Senate vote \"for reasonable cause,\" but the constitution doesn't spell out the process. \nThe state Supreme Court voted unanimously last month to suspend Kane's law license, based on the criminal case against her. She's awaiting trial on charges she leaked secret investigative information to a newspaper and lied about it. She says she's innocent. \nShe remains in office and says she'll continue to perform most of her official duties. The Reading Eagle first reported the Senate's move. \nKane's spokesman says any action by the Senate before the legal process plays out is premature.
