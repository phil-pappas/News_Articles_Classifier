However, just 45 per cent of over 55s wish to remain.\nPromoted stories Support for leaving the EU is highest amongst those without any educational qualifications and lowest amongst university graduates. Two surveys indicated that if the decision was left to those without formal qualifications, Britain would vote to leave. However, one survey found as few as 15 per cent of graduates backed a UK exit.\nUnlike the independence referendum, where women were consistently more likely to back a No vote, no significant gender split on the issue of the EU has yet been detected.\nAn analysis of recent opinion polls show that Conservative voters are split down the middle on how to vote, with 42 per cent each favouring in and out. Just over a quarter of Labour supporters plan to vote to leave the EU, with 58 per cent hoping to stay.\nWhile there is less data on SNP voters, a recent survey showed 24 per cent plan to vote to leave compared to 64 per cent who want to remain.\nShare article In his analysis, Professor Curtice raises the prospect of the EU vote leading to a second independence referendum, saying: \"Should the UK as a whole vote narrowly to leave the EU, it seems highly likely that Scotland and perhaps Wales will have voted at least narrowly in the opposite direction, thereby potentially creating new debates about the future of the United Kingdom.\"\nHe added that overall, the British public is \"seriously divided\" over Europe. He added: \"The referendum is not only going to be a debate about the UK’s future relationship with the EU, but also seems set to expose a significant social division between those who feel they are likely to be winners in an international jobs market and those who do not. The outcome will thus tell us a lot about what kind of country we would prefer to be.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-21T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:39:09.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
