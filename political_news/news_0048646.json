Chris Christie and members of his administration Thursday, saying the governor violated her civil rights for political gain.\nHickox, 34, whose confinement made international headlines for weeks, had been caring for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone before her arrival at Newark Liberty International Airport, a waypoint to her home in Maine. She was held in isolation for more than three days, first at the airport and then at University Hospital despite testing negative for the deadly virus .\nHer detention marked the first test of strict new policies put in place earlier in the day by Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo concerning returning health workers.\n\"I never had Ebola. I never had symptoms of Ebola. I tested negative for Ebola the first night I stayed in New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's private prison,\" Hickox said in a statement Thursday. \"My liberty, my interests and consequently my civil rights were ignored because some ambitious governors saw an opportunity to use an age-old political tactic: fear.\"\nMORE : Read Kaci Hickox's lawsuit against the Christie administration The suit, filed in federal court in Newark, names as defendants Christie, former state Health Commissioner Mary O'Dowd and other Health Department officials. The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey and two New York law firms are representing Hickox, now a clinical nurse in Oregon.\nHickox's attorneys, who formally announced the suit at a 3 p.m. press conference in Manhattan, contend the Christie administration adopted a flawed quarantine process more stringent than federal standards and kept the nurse confined despite obvious evidence she was not ill and did not have Ebola.\nKaci Hickox appears via Skype as her attorneys discuss her lawsuit against Gov.

Now, a year later, we are proud to help Kaci vindicate those rights.\"\nA spokesman for Christie said Thursday that because the suit represents a pending legal matter, the governor would have no comment.\nThe suit does not name University Hospital or its medical personnel as defendants.\nHickox, answering questions at the press conference via Skype, said her doctors and caregivers were not targeted because they weren't the ones responsible for her detainment.\n\"It was always clear that the workers in the hospital treated me very well. They were wonderful and compassionate and kind,\" she said. \"It was always clear that some of those decisions weren't being made by them. They clearly didn't have the power to make them.\"\nOfer said his office requested documents about the episode from New Jersey officials, but when they received about 1,200 pages in response to their request, \"99 percent\" of the text was blacked out.\nRELATED : 'Ebola nurse' slams Christie, calls quarantine a 'political stunt' Another lawyer for Hickox, Steve Hyman, said an additional aim of the lawsuit is to overturn the state's quarantine policy, which remains in effect.\n\"While this lawsuit has been filed to vindicate Kaci's constitutional rights, an important corollary of this action is to change the existing New Jersey quarantine policy so that what happened to Kaci will not happen to another health care worker on their return,\" Hyman said.\nThe lawsuit details, for the first time, that Hickox was actually cleared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while still at the airport. That information was in documents her attorneys acquired from the CDC in preparing the lawsuit.\nThose documents also show Hickcox was told she would be quarantined almost immediately after disclosing she'd been a medical volunteer in West Africa — before any kind of screening took place, the lawsuit states.\nThe lawsuit seeks damages of $250,000. The dollar amount was determined by putting a price tag of $2,000 for each of the 80 hours during which she was quarantined, along with an additional 60 percent of that for punitive damages, the attorneys said.\nBecause Christie and officials in his administration are being sued as individuals, any judgement against them would come out of their own pockets, said Norm Siegel, the other Manhattan attorney on Hickox's team. That would have a strong deterrence to other officials who wanted to come up with health policies that were not rooted in medical science, he said.\nAt the time of the episode, Christie was dismissive of her situation , saying, \"I've been sued lots of times before. Get in line. I'm happy to take it on.\"\nThe governor added that he was sorry for the inconvenience to Hickox but that his highest priority was to safeguard the people of New Jersey.\nHickox, who has masters degrees in nursing and public health, spent a month in Sierra Leone, working for Doctors Without Borders as a nurse and medical team leader tending to Ebola patients amid an outbreak of the virus.\nAccording to the lawsuit, she was highly trained in precautionary measures and was never exposed to bodily fluids, the chief form of transmission.\nShe left the African nation on Oct. 22 and spent two days in Brussels before flying to Newark, where she disclosed she had treated Ebola patients overseas.\nFollowing protocol, airport officials escorted her to a quarantine site operated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A temporal scanning thermometer showed her temperature to be normal, the suit says, but Hickox was repeatedly questioned by a succession of people, one of whom acted aggressively and wore a weapon belt.\n\"Hickox was tired from jetlag and traveling for two days, hungry, thirsty, confused and emotionally exhausted,\" the suit states. \"No one told her what was going on or what was going to happen to her.\"\nMeanwhile, at a press conference, Christie confirmed a health worker returning from West Africa had been quarantined as a precaution despite her apparent fine health.\nLater in the afternoon, as Hickox's frustration mounted, a nurse again used a temporal scanning thermometer on her forehead, indicating to Hickox she had a fever, the suit states. Fever is one indication of Ebola.\n\"Hickox explained to the woman that her face was flushed from frustration,\" the suit states. \"Hickox also said she did not believe the temporal scanner was accurate. Despite her emotional distress, Hickox felt physically healthy. She did not feel fevered.\"\nBy evening, over her continued protests, Hickox was taken by ambulance — accompanied by an escort of eight police vehicles, sirens blaring — to University Hospital, where she was placed in an isolation tent that would become her home for nearly three days.\nWhile an oral thermometer repeatedly showed her temperature to be normal, a temporal thermometer at times continued to show a slightly elevated temperature as high as 102 degrees, the suit states, adding that a doctor told Hickox he did not believe the temporal thermometer was working properly.\nThe isolation tent, in a cold room with exposed pipes, had no telephone and no computer, leaving Hickox with limited access to the outside world.\nWhen she was at last released, the suit said, three medical workers drove her to her home in Maine, where state officials sought to quarantine her . She fought the home confinement in court and won.\nSiegel said that ultimately Christie will have to explain his policy-making decisions in response to the lawsuit.\n\"There's no question the buck stops with Governor Christie,\" he said.\nKathleen O'Brien may be reached at kobrien@njadvancemedia.com .
