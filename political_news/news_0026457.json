A floor vote on the speakership in the full House will follow on Oct. 29. \nIt will then be up to the new speaker to set elections for lower-level posts from majority leader on down. \nThe changes could help Boehner's likeliest successor, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who is working to lock up support to become speaker but facing an unexpected challenge from Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz. \nWith daunting challenges ahead, it's increasingly clear that Boehner's resignation only deepened divisions in the caucus. \nA day after announcing his candidacy for speaker, Chaffetz sought to present himself Monday as a new face who can unite the House. \n\"If we don't inject new blood into the leadership team, our constituents are going to be irate at best,\" Chaffetz told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"There's a massive drumbeat out there that the status quo is not what we sent you there to perpetuate. This is a national wave, it's not something that was driven by Jason Chaffetz. I'm just someone who was smart enough to recognize it and try to get ahead of it.\" \nChaffetz, the 48-year-old chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has used that post to launch high-profile investigations of the Secret Service, Planned Parenthood and other issues. \nHis candidacy underscores chaos in the House little more than a week after Boehner, R-Ohio, announced he would resign rather than face a possible floor vote to depose him, pushed by hard-line conservatives. \nIn the days immediately following, McCarthy was viewed as the presumptive favorite to replace the outgoing speaker. \nBut that dynamic began to shift, particularly following McCarthy's gaffe last week suggesting that the purpose of a special House committee investigating the deadly 2012 attacks on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, was to drive down Hillary Rodham Clinton's poll numbers. Clinton, secretary of state at that time, is now the front-runner for the Democratic nomination for president. \nMcCarthy retracted the comment and said he regrets it, but it's given a potent weapon to Democrats ahead of a high-profile Oct. 22 appearance by Clinton before the committee. \nMcCarthy appears to have the support of a majority of House Republicans, making him the likely winner in Thursday's vote. \nBut under House rules, that outcome does not guarantee that McCarthy will become speaker. He also has to win a public vote of the full House. That outcome is less certain because of potential opposition to McCarthy from the same 30-plus hard-line conservatives who pushed Boehner out. \nMcCarthy could lose 29 Republicans and still come out with majority support on the floor, but so far he has not claimed he has the needed 218 votes locked up. But Chaffetz' ability to get 218 votes in the House seems even less certain. \nThat suggests ongoing tumult in the weeks leading up to the floor vote, even as Congress is confronting a weighty to-do list, starting with raising the government's borrowing limit in early November.
