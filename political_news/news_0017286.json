Your party and yourself have put forward a budget which cuts tax credits, gives tax breaks to the very wealthiest in our society, so inequality is getting worse not better.\n“Should you not think for a moment about the choices you are making and the reality it is for the very poorest people in our society?” he told the PM.\nVideo loading Watch next Watch this video again Watch Next\nMr Cameron replied by saying that Kelly would benefit from the rise in the minimum wage.\n“What we are doing is bringing in the national living wage, which will be a £20-a-week pay rise for people next year. Obviously Kelly will benefit as that national living wage rises to £9,” he said.\nBut the PM failed to mention that the tax credit cuts will be cut from April 2016 but the £9-an-hour rate will not start until 2020.\nPA Cut to the quick: Labour's Seema Malhotra says there is no defence for the tax credit cuts\nLabour’s Treasury spokeswoman Seema Malhotra MP said: “David Gauke has been forced to admit that families who are working hard and depend on tax credits to make ends meet will be worse off after the Tories tax credit cuts come into effect in April 2016.\n“Until now Government Ministers - including the Prime Minister - have tried to pretend that the increase in the national minimum wage will more than compensate for the tax credit cuts.\n\"David Gauke has blown the lid off that defence. I shall be writing to the Prime Minister demanding that he clarify the impact on the income of hard working families of his tax credits cuts .”\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201510/1380/4221396001_4557420008001_4557299501001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/JBeattieMirror", "https://twitter.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts"], "published": "2015-10-15T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:27:33.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
