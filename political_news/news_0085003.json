The senator's tally for the period surpasses the $6 million raised by rival Marco Rubio and the $2.5 million collected by Rand Paul. But it falls short of the $20 million reportedly collected by Ben Carson, who is surging among the evangelical voters Cruz has been courting.\nWith his third-quarter haul, Cruz has raised $26 million through his official campaign so far.\nAdditionally, in July, a group of super PACs supporting his candidacy said it had raised $37 million â€” much of it from the wallets of mega-donors Toby Neugebauer and Robert Mercer.\nThe campaign said it had garnered just short of 185,000 contributions over the course of the third quarter, and that its average donation was $66. It also said it had secured the backing of 6,000 individuals who had pledged to give a recurring monthly donation to the campaign.\nCruz officials declined to disclose the total of its cash on hand.. That figure is expected to be released on Oct. 15, when Cruz and other presidential candidates file their financial disclosure reports.\n\"We have both the financial and organizational resources to compete for the long haul,\" Cruz said in a statement.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:30:23.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
