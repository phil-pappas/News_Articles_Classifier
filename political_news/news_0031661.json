That's why we've created the Cut's Style Personality Quiz , a highly detailed Myers-Briggs-inspired test optimized to nail down your exact personal style.\nJust like Myers-Briggs sorts you into one of 16 personality types like ENFP or INTJ, our quiz will determine whether you're an MCRI (Minimalist Consistent Romantic Individualistic) or an XAIT (Maximalist Adventurous Intellectual Trend-Enthusiast).
