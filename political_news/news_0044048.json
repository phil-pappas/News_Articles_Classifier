John Kasich's approval rating broke his previous record high in a new Quinnipiac poll released Thursday. The survey of three \"swing states\" — Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania — shows Kasich soaring while President Obama's approval rating underwater in each state.\nApproximately 62 percent of Ohioans approve of his job performance while 29 percent of respondents disapprove. The survey noted that the Republican presidential candidate \"even gets 42 percent of Democrats, with 45 percent disapproving.\" In August, a Quinnipiac poll showed Kasich matching his all-time high approval rating.\nFellow Ohio Republican, Sen. Rob Portman, fares worse in the poll's results of his re-election chances as \"Democratic challenger Ted Strickland has 46 percent, with Republican incumbent Sen. Rob. Portman at 43 percent.\"\nThe poll also showed voters of the three swing states overwhelmingly support medical marijuana legalization, including 87 percent of voters in Florida and 90 percent of voters in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The politics of marijuana could be a determinative factor in several upcoming elections and some Democrats hope it will increase voter turnout for their candidate in 2016.\n  McCarthy drops out of speaker's race Republicans were set to hold an internal election Thursday afternoon, but that election was postponed.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/08/15 12:30 PM Top Story McCarthy out of speaker's race GOP was set to hold an internal election Thursday afternoon, but that election was postponed.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/08/15 12:30 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:50:48.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
