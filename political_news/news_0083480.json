(Petula Dvorak/The Washington Post) (Petula Dvorak/The Washington Post) October 2 at 6:11 PM Petula Dvorak’s Sept. 29 Metro column, “ A sex-toy shop turns out to be surprisingly tame ,” did a disservice in mocking the Leesburg Town Council and the people who shared its concerns about the lingerie and sex-toy shop Le Tache.\nResidents have been upset about Le Tache for the five years that it has been there. The problem is that nobody knows what to do about it; there is no ordinance in Leesburg regarding such a shop.\nThe shop is on the most prominent corner in Leesburg, directly across from the courthouse. Leesburg’s council and residents take pride in their historic town that draws tourists and is home to many families with children. Does Ms. Dvorak advocate that Leesburg’s children close their eyes as they pass the shop? If such shops must exist, they should not be at the most prominent intersection.\nRather than making fun of us, I wish that Ms. Dvorak would help us to bring closure to this eyesore and source of contention.\nJoan Gorman , Lansdowne", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:33:37.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
