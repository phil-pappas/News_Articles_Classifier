Institution providers must refer the request to the Headquarters Utilization Management Committee for evaluation. \nA six-member subcommittee consisting of physicians and psychologists will then determine any medical consideration that would preclude surgery, the current treatment offered to the inmate to alleviate gender dysphoria and whether the procedure is appropriate from a medical and mental health perspective. \nCriteria the subcommittee will consider include whether the inmates have sought to make their body congruent with their preferred gender for at least two years, have lived in the desired gender role for at least 12 months; and have at least two years before an anticipated parole or release date. \nConsideration will also be given to whether an inmate can transfer safely and adjust medically and psychologically to confinement post-operatively with other inmates with the same gender identity and whether “there are no penological contraindications for placement in the prison housing the inmate’s professed gender.” \nThe Headquarters Utilization Management Committee decision is the final step in the process. If a request for gender reassignment surgery is denied, an inmate can renew the request no sooner than one year afterward. \nCalifornia makes the policy change as the issue of affording taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgery to inmates has emerged at the forefront of the transgender rights movement. \nHarper Jean Tobin, policy director for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said the new California policy is a “positive development,” but isn’t perfect. \n“It’s unfortunate that any state has to go through multiple lawsuits and make a special policy for one type of medical service just to do what the Constitution requires: Provide health care for everyone based on medical decisions by medical professionals,” Tobin said. \nTobin also objected to a portion of the policy linking gender reassignment surgery for inmates to housing placements. \n“We are deeply concerned, though, that CDCR’s policy links prisoner housing placements with surgery, in violation of the Prison Rape Elimination Act,” Tobin said. “This means that many transgender prisoners will continue to be housed in extremely unsafe settings.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:40:38.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
