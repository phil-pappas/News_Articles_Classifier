Until then, Wilson was widely viewed as a war leader who held himself above the political fray. Some historians regard his maladroit attempt to influence the legislative outcome as a turning point in his presidency.\nThe 1918 campaign was conducted in the midst of World War I, while the nation dealt with a deadly influenza epidemic. Through the prior 18 months of U.S. involvement, congressional leaders downplayed partisan differences. Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge (R-Mass.), the minority leader, privately warned his colleagues to suspend their “attacks on Wilson that we all want to make [to avoid] the charge that we are drawing the party line and the cry that we are not loyal to the war.”\nEarlier, Wilson, declaring that “politics is adjourned,” had called for a political moratorium during the wartime emergency. As his concern mounted, however, over the Democrats’ precarious congressional majorities, he plunged into fight, backing candidates who pledged to support his programs.\nOn Nov. 5, Republicans emerged with a two-seat majority in the Senate and a 41-seat margin in the House. Local issues, the tendency of the president’s party to suffer losses in midterm elections and dissatisfaction with Democratic legislative accomplishments accounted for some of the Republican gains.\nThe bitter tone of Wilson’s plea might have made a crucial difference.\nThe election results made Lodge both the Senate majority leader and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. After the war ended in 1919, the president’s subsequent failure to work with Lodge to secure ratification of the Treaty of Versailles ultimately doomed his presidency and helped set into motion a chain of events that tied World War I to World War II.\nSOURCE: WWW.SENATE.GOV\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:07:31.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
