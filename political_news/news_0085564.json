Johnson, who chronicled the events on social media with the hashtag #LaughingWhileBlack, told SFGate that the manager later threatened to throw them off the train if they didn't \"tone it down.\" When the train pulled into St. Helena, police officers were waiting for the women and escorted them off the train.\nMore From Cosmopolitan \"I felt like it was a racist attack on us. I feel like we were being singled out,\" Johnson told SFGate, saying that while they were loud, they were not \"obnoxious or intoxicated.\"\nFollowing the incident, Napa Valley Wine Train's Facebook account posted (and quickly deleted) a statement characterizing the women as \"verbally and physically abusive.\"\nNapa Valley Wine Train CEO Tony Giacco issued a formal apology, saying the company \"was 100 percent wrong in its handling of this issue\" and acknowledged that \"we knew in advance when we booked your party that you would be loud, fun-loving and boisterous — because you told us during the booking process that you wanted a place where your Club could enjoy each other's company.\" However, he did not believe the ousting was racially motivated.\nJohnson tells the Guardian that two of the women lost their jobs over the media attention. She hopes the lawsuit draws attention to racism that black people continue to face in America.\nThe women are being represented by leading civil rights attorney Waukeen McCoy, who said at a press conference Thursday, \"This lawsuit shows that blacks are not just being treated different in big cities, but also in small towns like Napa ​.\" ​\nSaid Johnson, ​\"Racism is something we are going through as a country. We hope that as a result of this [lawsuit], people will start to look more at their internal biases.\" ​\n​ Follow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/US/napa-valley-wine-train-apologizes-booting-black-womens/story?id=33306287", "https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Black-women-humiliated-after-getting-kicked-6460912.php", "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/01/napa-valley-wine-train-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-laughing-while-black"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:55:43.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
