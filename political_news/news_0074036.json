Here are five of the reasons for and against Britain's membership of the EU.\nReasons To Stay \n:: Millions of jobs are linked to our EU membership \nAs far back as the year 2000, it has been claimed that three million jobs rely directly on our membership of the European Union. The figure was even cited by Nick Clegg during his time as Deputy Prime Minister.\nAn analysis by Full Fact found that millions of jobs are linked to the EU, but said there is no evidence to show how many would be in jeopardy if we left.\n:: Some of Britain's biggest trading partners are in the EU \nSome of Britain's largest trading partners - including France and Germany - are in the EU.\nMore than 50% of our exports go to EU countries, and our membership allows us to have a say over how trading rules are drawn up.\n:: It's easier than ever for us to work and travel abroad \nAround 1.4 million British people live abroad in the EU, and having membership makes movement around the continent incredibly easy. Driving licences issued in the UK are valid in all EU countries.\n:: Crime fighting \nThe European Arrest Warrant cuts out the need for long and complicated extradition procedures and allows criminals to be brought to justice across the EU.\n:: Influence in the world \nThe EU is the world's biggest market and plays a big role in world trade, climate change issues, development projects and more.\nIt has the clout to take on multinationals such as Google and Microsoft. At the moment Britain plays a key role in the EU, and leaving would see us forgo that.\nReasons To Leave \n:: Border control back in our hands \nThe flip side of the freedom of work and travel for UK citizens is that people from other EU countries are free to travel to and live in Britain.\nUKIP leader Nigel Farage says any attempt by the Government to control immigration into the UK is futile as long as we are in the EU.\n:: We could make a large membership fee saving \nLike most clubs, the EU charges a membership fee, and it has been claimed that the cost is around £55m per day.\nAnalysis by Full Fact estimates the figure is closer to £24m per day when rebates and other receipts are taken into account.\n:: Institutions are seen as lacking democracy \nThe European Parliament is directly elected, although the powerful Commission which proposes legislation is not.\nBecause many of these laws supersede legislation made by individual states' parliaments, some see the system as undemocratic.\n:: Other countries successfully go it alone \nMany Eurosceptics look to rich Norway as a country which trades with the EU without being in it. It also controls its own agriculture and keeps its fish, rather than being bound by EU quotas.\n:: Get rid of any threat to Britain's military freedom \nThere is a push within the ranks of the EU's leaders for it to have its own army.\nThe president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said earlier this year that it would help show Russia the EU was serious about defending member values.\nIn the past the British Government has been forced to block moves to create EU-controlled military forces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:33:27.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
