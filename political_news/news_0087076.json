The protesters said they wanted to ensure the government interference stopped and they declared victory when the August lawsuit was filed. \nThe government's lawsuit asks a judge to declare the men acted illegally in building a garage, cutting down trees, opening a road and locking a gate near the mine. \nThe miners say an 1872 law grants them surface and subsurface rights to the land where their mine is located. \nThe Forest Service, however, says it has the surface rights because the 1872 law does not apply to the claims. \nKorne's relatives homesteaded the property in 1924, according to the countersuit. He and Nappo partnered in 2007 to form a company called Intermountain Mining and Refining, and they pay a fee each year to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for the claims. \nThe men say they have exclusive rights to the land but were harassed by a Forest Service worker who damaged their property, demanded a cleanup of the area and changes to their operations. \nWhen reclamation began on the nearby Mike Horse Mine, with toxic material being shipped out on the shared road, Kornec and Nappo had to request permission to travel on the road. That restriction amounted to interfering with their operations, the countersuit said. \nLast year, the Forest Service cited the men for violations that included cutting firewood, construction of a building and erosion. The men met with the agency officials, but \"it appeared the Forest Service had no intention of conducting a meaningful discussion or of resolving the issues,\" Campbell argued. \nLovell has ordered the lawyers for the two sides to meet to discuss the possibility of a settlement and develop a plan to manage the case before a Nov. 12 court hearing. \nThink your friends should see this?
