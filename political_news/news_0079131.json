(AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\nAssociated Press Oct. 8, 2015 | 3:01 a.m. EDT + More JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, Associated Press Writer\nBRUSSELS (AP) â€” NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said alliance defense ministers on Thursday will consider the implications for NATO's own security of the \"troubling escalation of Russian military activities\" in Syria.\nOn Wednesday, Russian warships fired cruise missiles in the first combined air-and-ground assault with Syrian government troops since Moscow began its military campaign in the country last week.\nOver the weekend, NATO ally Turkey reported back-to-back violations of its airspace by Russian warplanes.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter and his counterparts from the 27 other NATO nations had already been scheduled to meet Thursday in Brussels.\nStoltenberg told reporters the meeting will receive an update from its military commanders on the situation in Syria, as well as Afghanistan.\n\"In Syria, we have seen a troubling escalation of Russian military activities,\" Stoltenberg said. \"We will assess the latest developments and their implications for the security of the alliance. This is particularly relevant in view of the recent violations of NATO's airspace by Russian aircraft.\"\nNATO on Monday issued a statement demanding that the violations cease. Russia called its penetration of Turkish airspace a minor incident that was unintentional.\nThe defense ministers' meeting, their first since June, is also expected to approve ongoing efforts to retool NATO to meet a daunting array of contemporary security threats. Decisions expected include approval for two new NATO headquarters units in Hungary and Slovakia to enhance their defenses and speed the deployment of reinforcements sent by other alliance nations, and changes in the beefed-up NATO Response Force to, in Stoltenberg's words, make it \"bigger, faster and more capable.\"\n\"We are facing many challenges from many different directions,\" Stoltenberg said. \"Conflict, instability and insecurity.\"\n\"We will assess what we have to do to adapt NATO to current and future challenges,\" he said_including cyberattacks and the mix of conventional and unconventional tactics commonly known as hybrid warfare.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
