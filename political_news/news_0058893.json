In the absence of the vice president and the president pro tempore, the secretary of the Senate assigned the presiding duties to Sen. Hattie Caraway. Arkansas Gov. Harvey Parnell had named Caraway (D-Ark.) to the Senate in 1931, following the unexpected death of her husband, Sen. Thaddeus Caraway. She then ran successfully for the remaining months of her husband's term after assuring state party leaders that she had no interest in running for the subsequent full term.\nIn March 1932, however, she changed her mind and ran. Several of her six male primary opponents said she would be lucky to get 1 percent of the vote. Nevertheless, she won, aided by a nine-day joint campaign tour with her populist ally, Sen. Huey Long (D-La.).\nIn 1938, Caraway ran again, this time opposed by Rep. John McClellan who ran on the slogan “Arkansas needs another man in the Senate.” She was supported by women’s groups, veterans and union members and won the primary by 8,000 votes.\nAs the first woman elected to the Senate, Caraway had presided over the chamber once before. On May 9, 1932, she briefly filled in for Vice President Charles Curtis when he took a break, but there was no official recognition of the event.\nCaraway rarely spoke on the floor and became known as “Silent Hattie.” Dressed in her Victorian-style dresses, she would sit quietly at her desk knitting or doing crossword puzzles.\nWhen asked why she avoided speeches, she quipped, “The men have left nothing unsaid.” Her path-breaking career ended in 1945, when Rep. William Fulbright defeated her in a primary. On Caraway's final day in office, her fellow senators gave her a standing ovation.\nSOURCE: WWW.SENATE.GOV ; “HATTIE AND HUEY: AN ARKANSAS TOUR,” BY DAVID MALONE (1989)\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:29:29.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
