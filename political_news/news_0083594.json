The state’s lawyer, though, didn’t try to delay a Jan. 18 trial.\nTherapy providers and parents of affected children have warned the cuts would cause providers to drop Medicaid patients. By one estimate, 60,000 disabled children and poor seniors would lose services.\nHowever, the commission has insisted it adhered to rate-setting rules. The agency said it simply was following lawmakers’ directive to decrease payments and change policies to deter suspected overuse of therapy services.\nSulak, though, said the commission relied on a “seriously flawed” rate analysis by Texas A&M University researchers. The planned cuts “are probably based on arbitrary criteria that lack adequate or appropriate consideration for the impact on service providers or recipients,” he said.\nThree pediatric therapy companies and the families of five disabled children they serve sued the commission. The youngsters suffer from autism, seizure disorders and, in one case, a genetic disorder called Williams syndrome. It causes a heart murmur and developmental delays.\nMichael Reiswig, chief executive of Dallas-based Care Options for Kids, one of the plaintiff firms, said Friday that the state failed to follow its own procedures.\n“I have no doubt that we will prevail,” Reiswig said in a statement. “But what’s most important right now is to resolve this matter. … The families of these disabled children need to have peace of mind.”\nSenate GOP leaders have told the commission it needs to reduce rates, though not so much as to drive providers from the program.\nSulak froze rate cuts scheduled to take effect Oct. 1. If reinstated, they would save about two-thirds of the $350 million the commission needs to squeeze out of Medicaid therapy spending, according to a provision in the two-year state budget passed in May.\nThe rest would come from policy changes designed to eliminate suspected overuse of therapy by some patients.\nLast year, about 242,000 disabled children and seniors received the benefit, according to the commission.\nOn Twitter:\n @RobertTGarrett", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RobertTGarrett"], "published": "2015-10-17T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:02:20.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
