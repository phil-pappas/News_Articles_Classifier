He contested Thatcher’s euroscepticism by insisting Westland should be taken over by a non-existent euro-consortium instead of finding its own salvation. \n“It eventually did, with USA’s Sikorsky. Unfortunately, Leon Brittan, trade and industry secretary, and responsible for Westland, was no match for Tarzan on the media rampage. \n“Things got so bad that Brittan sought Heseltine’s dismissal.” \nSir Bernard said that senior ministers and the cabinet secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, were summoned by Thatcher. \n“I was asked: ‘So, he should be sacked?’ I said he might well deserve it but then was not the time. He was winning in the eyes of the media.” \nLater, he said, the head of information at DTI Colette Bowe rang him saying she had now got permission to leak the letter. \n“I had no idea a leak was proposed and Bowe did not tell me, as is claimed, that No 10 wanted it leaked. I said I did not like the idea at all. She then told me the DTI wanted me to leak the letter. \n“I refused point blank, saying ‘I have to keep the prime minister above this sort of thing’. Leaking was anathema to her. \n“I regret I did not tell Bowe not to leak instead of effectively saying ‘on your head be it’, but I certainly had no right to countermand Brittan’s decision.” \nHe said that Charles Moore, in his second volume of the late prime minister’s memoirs, accurately portrays all this as government falling apart, with clashes of egos, massive hypocrisy and general chaos. \nSir Bernard added: “In such ways can prime ministerial careers be threatened. I plead not guilty to being part of any conspiracy.” \nLater both Heseltine and Brittan resigned from office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:16:21.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
