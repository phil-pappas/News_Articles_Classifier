Advertisement More by this Author \nThe fate of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula will be known this week when the electoral commission meets to review and consider a Supreme Court report on voter bribery allegations made against him. \nThe Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) meets Tuesday to determine the matter after Senate Speaker Ekwee Ethuro published the election offences against him last week, allowing the electoral body to take up the matter. \nThe commission is now expected to spell the way forward for the Cord co-principal who was found guilty of voter bribery by the Supreme Court in March in a case that was filed against him by political arch-rival Mr Musikari Kombo who was also eyeing the Bungoma Senate seat in the last election. \nThe Senate Speaker was first required to publish the Supreme Court’s report in the Kenya Gazette before the electoral body could take up the matter for review and consideration and eventually make recommendations for any further action. \nThere are fears that with the latest turn of events, the beleaguered Senator could be barred from taking part in the next election if his name is struck out of the voters’ register. \nA former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Wetang’ula, by virtue of being the only Cord co-principal serving in the current Parliament is considered to be the Opposition chief in Parliament. \nHe is the Minority Leader in the Senate. \nWhen contacted by the Nation on Sunday, IEBC Chief Executive Officer Ezra Chiloba declined to comment on the matter terming it sensitive. \nHe said there has been a lot of confusion in how the media has reported the issue but insisted that the commission would issue a statement on its decision when it meets on Tuesday. \nJUBILEE-CORD BLAME GAME \nAnd speaking to the Nation , nominated Jubilee Senator Paul Njoroge Ben came to the defence of Mr Wetang’ula and asked the electoral commission to handle the matter cautiously. \n“My appeal to the IEBC is that they really need to consult widely before making a decision,” he said. \nThe senator said he does not support deregistration of the Cord senator from the voters’ list, arguing that it is IEBC that cleared and declared Wetang’ula a winner of the 2013 election where it is claimed he committed election offences. \n“For me that would the most unfortunate thing to do. If they deregister him they will be contradicting themselves. We are all watching. We don’t want games on this one, we really want it to be democratic,” he said. \n“If anybody really wants to knock Wetang’ula out then he should do in the right way in direct elections and not this kangaroo style of blocking him from contesting the seat,” he stated. \nDeputy Minority Whip in the National Assembly Mr Chris Wamalwa on the other hand insisted that Jubilee was behind Mr Wetang’ula’s woes. \n“They are targeting him; they are trying to see how they can win the Luhya votes and the truth is that the undisputable leader right now in Luhyaland is Mr Moses Masika Wetang’ula,” the Kiminini MP said. \nHe said Jubilee’s intention was to cripple Mr Wetang’ula and divide the Luhya vote. \n“The community is not ready for Jubilee rejects like Eugene Wamalwa and Musalia Mudavadi whose ANC is their project. \n“Fortunately we are already aware of that scheme and we are solidly in Cord behind Wetang’ula and that is why they want to kill him politically so that he does not have a bargaining vote in 2017,” he said. \nThe MP urged the IEBC to be fair and consider Wetang’ula’s side of story before reaching a verdict. \n“This is a Jubilee ploy to frustrate Weta and the Luhya community will not accept it. We are warning IEBC not to do anything that is not within the law,” he stated. \nHowever, Senator Njoroge argued that Mr Wetang’ula’s Cord coalition could also be involved in his predicament. \nVICTIM OF POLITICAL MANOEUVRES \nAccording to the senator, Mr Wetang’ula could be a victim of political manoeuvres from both the Jubilee and even Cord, owing to his growing popularity. \nHe asked the Bungoma senator to be cautious of not only the Jubilee coalition but also of his own Cord associates, arguing that he had become a threat to some of his partners in consideration of future political arrangements. \n“They would also want him out of sight because he is becoming a big threat considering that of late he seems to have won the confidence of not only his Luhya community but also I can see the Kikuyu community is becoming a fan of him as time goes by,” he said. \nHe further said there was every indication that Jubilee might consider working with the Bungoma Senator come 2017. \n“Cord should stop playing these games. This is not a Jubilee-Cord issue. This was purely a court matter and I think we all need to support Senator Wetang’ula on this because I don’t think it makes any sense to me for him being kicked out at this point,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:00:10.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
