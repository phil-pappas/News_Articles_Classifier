However, I have not been able to find information in the submissions that give me confidence that the Proprietor will be able to resolve the issues it faces. \n\"The roll of the school has dropped to about 49 students and the financial information provided suggests the Proprietor’s indebtedness will grow because of the financial costs associated with building assessment and earthquake-strengthening. \n\"As a consequence I am now initiating a second round of consultation and will make a final decision about the school’s future in November.\" \nTwo petitions and about 15 submissions were received during the first round of consultation. \n\"After considering Ministry of Education advice on the submissions I sought further information from the Proprietor. I regret that the information provided did not give me confidence in the Proprietor’s ability to strengthen its financial position. \n\"This has led me to make an interim decision that Turakina should close. In making this decision, my priority is to provide parents and students with certainty for 2016 in as timely a fashion as possible.\" \nThe consultation will run until 6 November 2015. Following this, the Ministry will develop a report summarising feedback. A final decision will be made after this process has been undertaken. If the final decision is to close the school, this will be implemented on 27 January 2016. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
