The 22 hectares will be flooded by the Ruataniwha Water Storage Scheme reservoir. In return 170 hectares of Smedley Station will be incorporated into the park. This is land HBRIC Ltd has bought specifically for this purpose, subject to the project proceeding. \nMr Newman says HBRIC Ltd believes DOC ran a very rigorous process, including public submissions and a public hearing on the proposed exchange. \nHe says after receiving confirmation of the land exchange earlier this month, HBRIC Ltd has moved forward with the project. \nMr Newman says HBRIC ltd will be seeking to get the matter heard under urgency. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:31:36.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
