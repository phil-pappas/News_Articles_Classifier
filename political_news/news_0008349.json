Jeb Bush’s political stock has fallen sharply over the past few months. The debate now taking place among Republicans is whether that stock is undervalued or a fair reading of the current shape of his campaign.\nThe latest quarterly financial reports brought new questions for the candidate who began the campaign with assets none of his rivals could match. He raised barely more in the third quarter than he did in the second — even though his second-quarter fundraising amounted to just 16 days of activity. His average daily fundraising dropped sharply from one quarter to the next.\nBush advisers cry foul at some of the interpretation of his fundraising prowess. Yes, as the son and brother of former presidents, he is supposed to have a big network of potential givers. But, they argue, look at what Mitt Romney raised in the third quarter of 2011 when he, as the GOP front-runner, had the biggest fundraising network of any of the candidates. Romney raised less than a million dollars more that Bush did this time.\nThat’s one way to look at it, but by this time four years ago, Romney had raised $34 million. That compares with Bush’s total of about $25 million to date. Romney then had $15 million in cash available. Bush has about $10 million.\nThird-quarter fundraising is notoriously difficult for all candidates. The next quarter will provide another opportunity for comparison between Bush 2016 and Romney 2012. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Romney’s network produced another $24 million and ended the year with almost $20 million in cash available. Bush will have to step up his pace if his team hopes to keep making comparisons to Romney.\nBush advisers say it’s tough to raise huge amounts of money in a field with so many candidates. Still, he has drawn critical coverage for fundraising numbers that either lag or are about equal with others who started with fewer assets. So far this year, he’s raised less than Ben Carson, slightly less than Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and slightly more than Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. His third-quarter fundraising was second best behind Carson.\nSquabbling over cash\nThe Bush and Rubio campaigns were squabbling last week over the exact amounts of cash in the bank and available for the nomination campaign as opposed to the general election. Their quibbles were over relatively insignificant amounts of money.\nThe bottom line is that Bush’s campaign account is competitive with that of Cruz, Carson and Rubio, and it is well ahead of two other mainstream candidates, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Donald Trump, the self-funder, is in a different category.\nThe third-quarter-fundraising reports tell one part of the story of the Republican campaign over the summer. Polling tells another. Overall, the biggest surprise has been the staying power of Donald Trump. In July, he led the Pollster.com average of national polls and its average of Iowa and New Hampshire polls.\nThat’s still true today, although in each case his support has grown. In July, Trump’s national poll average was just under 15 percent, according to Pollster.com. His current average nationally is just over 28 percent. In Iowa, he’s risen from 14 percent in June to almost 24 percent today. In New Hampshire, he’s is up from about 20 percent to about 28 percent.\nFrom second to fourth\nWhat’s happened to Bush during the past three months? Nationally, Bush was running second in July with an average poll rating of 13 to 14 percent. Today’s he’s fallen to just about 8 percent and is fourth overall. In Iowa, his standing is now fifth rather than third. In New Hampshire, he’s gone from second place in the poll average to fifth.\nWith Kasich and Christie farther down, Bush and Rubio are seen on a collision course in the mainstream conservative competition. Rubio has gotten the better of the coverage of late, the aspirational fresh face vs. a candidate with experience and a family name that is a mixed blessing.\nThere are caveats, however. Rubio raised less than half of what Bush collected in the third quarter. In fact, he raised a million and a half dollars less than Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who quit the race last month. He raised about a million less than Carly Fiorina.\nBetween July and today, Rubio’s poll numbers nationally have ticked up a point and he continues to occupy third place. In Iowa, he’s lost a point and has dropped from fifth to six. In New Hampshire, he’s also lost a point and dropped one place, to seventh. This is not evidence of a surge.\nOne Bush adviser said the campaign has hit its financial targets and is focused on building a broad and sustainable campaign operation capable of going the distance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:46:11.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
