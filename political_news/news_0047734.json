Also on the flight was ​Mark Curry, the former star of ABC's hit 90s show ​Hangin' With Mr. Cooper, ​who recounted the frantic moments after the alleged incident.\nWitnesses reportedly told investigators the man began choking the woman when she reclined her seat back. The woman shouted for help and flight crews immediately intervened. The man was reportedly very calm when confronted by flight crew and later police. Curry, who now hosts a radio show in San Francisco, said he was sleeping and suddenly woke to a scene of chaos on the plane.\n ​ \"I thought it was a terrorist so I jumped up. I didn't know what to do. A guy got into it with a lady and choked her or something,\" Curry said. \"The lady was frantic....It was an incredible situation.\"\n ​The flight was immediately rerouted back to Los Angeles; a spokesperson for Southwest Airlines confirmed the emergency landing was due to ​a \"rapidly escalating situation\" involving two passengers. ​ (This isn't the first time passengers have gotten in physical altercations over reclining seats .) ​\nMore From Cosmopolitan \"Evidently, we've got two passengers who are in a physical altercation, so we need to get turned around back to LAX,\" a pilot on the flight was recorded saying before the plane turned around. ​ The plane came back to Los Angles around 11 p.m. and all 136 passengers except for the man involved in the incident were switched to another flight. ​\nAn FBI spokesperson said one person was detained \"on allegations of an assault involving a fellow passenger,\" but no arrest had been made at that time. The spokesperson said the investigation into the incident was ongoing.\nFollow Rebecca on Instagram .", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/rebeccaburtrose/", "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Southwest-Passenger-Allegedly-Chokes-Woman-For-Reclining-Seat-Witness-334095251.html", "http://gawker.com/yet-another-flight-diverted-after-battle-over-reclining-1629496138"], "published": "2015-10-20T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:45:01.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
