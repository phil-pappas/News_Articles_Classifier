Maggie Hassan's office criticized lawmakers for counting on rolling nearly $50 million in surplus into the next budget. \nHassan's office says the surplus will help strengthen the state's rainy day fund and improve the state's financial outlook. She says the Legislature should consider using some of the money to address public school funding concerns. \nSenate President Chuck Morse says the surplus shows the state is living within its means and appropriately budgeted for fiscal year 2015. \nHe says he's concerned about $20 million in unspent money for services for people with developmental disabilities.
