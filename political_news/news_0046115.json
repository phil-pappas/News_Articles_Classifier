Franklin, File) Some patients with bladder and prostate cancer died waiting for care, and medical treatment for almost 1,500 others was delayed because of short-staffing and mismanagement of urology care at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Phoenix, a new investigation has found.\nSenior officials at the medical center, the center of a national scandal last year over fudged wait times, did little to respond to a severe staffing shortage as recently as April 2015, investigators for the Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general found.\nTheir solution? They canceled appointments for 3,200 urology patients, some of them for crucial follow-up tests, and never rescheduled them. And many veterans had no idea they couldn’t see a doctor until they showed up for their appointment.\n“The Urology Service was not able to manage the volume of patients in need of either diagnostic evaluation, treatment, or routine follow-up related to multiple urological conditions,” the report by John Daigh, Jr., assistant inspector general for health-care inspections, said. The delays placed patients at “unnecessary risk for adverse outcomes.”\nSeven patients died after delayed treatment and lapses in the quality of medical care they received in Phoenix, investigators wrote.\nHospital administrators “did not promptly respond to the staffing crisis, which contributed to many patients being “lost to follow-up” and staff frustration due to lack of direction,” Daigh wrote.\nWhen some patients finally were referred to outside doctors for follow-up care, almost a quarter of them may never have received it. In 23 percent of the cases, investigators would find no documents to show the appointments ever took place.\nOver two years, this delayed or non-existent care affected almost half of all patients in Phoenix with bladder, prostate and urinary-tract issues, even after patient wait times became a national scandal. The former director of the medical center was fired amid reports that managers falsified waiting lists in order to collect bonuses by covering up months of delays in appointments.\nSen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, called the report’s findings “absolutely tragic and appalling.”\n“No veteran should ever be denied care after he put his life on the line in our country,” he said in a statement. “I expect every person responsible for this tragedy to be held accountable.”\nThe inspector general returned to Phoenix this year to follow up on the most serious problems that came to light during the wait-times scandal.\nStarting in 2013, the urology clinic in Phoenix grew woefully understaffed and overbooked with the departure of doctors and nurse practitioners. At one point, almost the entire urology staff had quit or was on leave, with one part-time physician left, the report found.\nSchedulers pleaded with hospital administrators for guidance. One employee pleaded to then-director Sharon Helman:\n“We as clerks’ ( sic ) are dealing with the frustrations of the veterans daily and we don’t have any answers for them. We can’t make appointments for them … This has been going on now for months and still no guidance or answers. We are getting our heads handed to us by the patients. How much are we supposed to endure … PLEASE HELP. We are leaving our vets in limbo.”\nPatients who were referred to outside doctors had little information from VA to go on, the report says. The private doctors frequently misinterpreted referring vouchers as authorizing only one visit for an initial evaluation, instead of follow-up care as well.\nThe inspector general recommends that the Phoenix hospital ensure that it has enough urology staff to guarantee timely care. The report also calls for records of visits to private doctors to be readily accessible electronically.\nIn a response to the report, VA officials agreed with the recommendations and said they have taken steps to improve care.\nInvestigators did not estimate the number of deaths that might have been prevented by more timely care. The report says that 1,484 patients experienced significant delays, and listed 10 who were placed at “unnecessary risk for adverse outcomes.” At least half of those died.\nFor example:\nA veteran with a history of prostate cancer had a checkup canceled and not rescheduled. When he finally saw a primary care physician 10 months later, he had relapsed with metastatic cancer. He died four months later. A patient who was referred for a urology evaluation with symptoms did not get an appointment for three months. It was canceled and rescheduled a month later. That appointment also was canceled. After more delays, the veteran finally had a biopsy and was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. He did not begin radiation therapy until about 18 months after the initial referral. A elderly patient who had begun treatment for an enlarged prostate discovered blood clots in his urine eight months later. His daughter tried to get him to see a specialist, but was told repeatedly to “be patient, there are still no providers.” Eleven months later, she got her father an appointment with a private physician. He needed a procedure requiring further authorization. The veteran died 10 days later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:34:10.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
