Steve Scalise (R-La.), who announced less than 24 hours earlier he had the votes to win the majority leader race. The House Republican Conference will still choose its nominee for speaker on Thursday, and the full chamber will vote on Boehner's successor on Oct. 29.\nBoehner's decision could take some of the pressure off House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the favorite to replace him. But the bigger impact may be on the majority leader's race: the delay will give conservatives more time to find a candidate to run against Scalise (R-La.) and Georgia Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.) for the No. 2 leadership position.\nSome hardline GOP conservatives are opposed to simply promoting McCarthy and Scalise up the leadership ranks following Boehner's departure, believing that such a move will just leave in place a team that has failed to deliver on its promises to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood or dramatically reduce government spending. These hardliners have searched for an alternative candidate to Scalise and Price, but no one has stepped forward to take up that mantle. Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) and Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) are running against McCarthy, but neither is given much of a chance of defeating the California Republican.\nScalise, currently the majority whip, told supporters on Sunday night that he had enough votes to win the battle against Price to replace McCarthy as majority leader, assuming the California Republican moves up to the speaker's chair.\nWhile Boehner's decision is a setback for Scalise, his aides say he will keep working to round up votes.\n\"Our team is strong and growing, and we look forward to having all of these elections take place as soon as our conference is ready,\" said Chris Bond, Scalise's spokesman.\nChaffetz says he's flipped some McCarthy backers By Rachael Bade\nThough he is resigning at the end of the month after losing control of the GOP Conference, Boehner has emerged as a major player in the leadership elections. Beyond delaying the vote for majority leader and whip, Boehner personally tried to recruit Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) to jump into the majority leader's race. Gowdy turned down the request.\n\"After consulting with my colleagues, I am announcing today that all members of the House of Representatives will vote to elect their next Speaker during a floor vote on October 29th,\" Boehner said in a statement released by his office.\nâ€œNext Thursday, October 8th, the members of the House Republican Conference will meet to elect our nominee for Speaker. After the new Speaker is elected on October 29th, the members of our Conference will select the rest of their leadership team. The new Speaker will establish the date for these additional leadership elections.\"\nThe delay will also push the GOP leadership elections up against a looming vote to raise the federal government's $18 trillion-plus debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told Boehner in a letter last week that the debt ceiling has to be increased by Nov. 5 or the United States will risk defaulting. During Boehner's tenure, he relied on a group of centrist Republicans to join with Democrats to pass such legislation.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:30:09.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
