Anderson, South Carolina (CNN) Donald Trump on Monday served up a fresh platter of red meat to a crowd of 5,600 supporters in this deep red part of South Carolina, including suggesting that President Barack Obama is planning to sign an executive order to \"take your guns away.\" \"You know, the President is thinking about signing an executive order where he wants to take your guns away. You hear about this? Not gonna happen. That won't happen. But that's a tough one, I think that's a tough one for him to do,\" Trump told the crowd. \"There's plenty of executive orders being signed, you know that. And we can't let that go on.\" Obama has not announced any plans to sign an executive order that would take Americans' guns away or further restrict access to guns. He has, however, called for Congress to pass legislation that would establish universal background checks and implement laws aimed at minimizing the number of mass shootings in the country. About 5,600 people filled the 6,000-person capacity civic center in Anderson, South Carolina, to see Trump, according to the local fire marshal. The Trump campaign said more than 7,900 people attended the event. Trump also appeared to reverse his stance on the war in Afghanistan on Monday night, telling the crowd that he was only opposed to the war in Iraq, not the war in Afghanistan -- saying Afghanistan is where the U.S. should have focused its attention. Read More \"Afghanistan is where we should have gone,\" Trump said. But just two weeks ago, Trump called the decision to send troops into Afghanistan after the September 11 attacks a \"terrible mistake.\" Trump, who typically takes questions from reporters after his events, declined to do so on Monday. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Race to the White House More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:44:56.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
