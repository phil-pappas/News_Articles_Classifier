Photo: Tatan Syuflana\nRetno Marsudi is no stranger to dealing with the challenging dynamics between Australia and Indonesia.\nIn 1990, the then junior diplomat was awarded her first foreign posting: she was an information officer at the Indonesian embassy in Canberra. The following year, 250 East Timorese pro-independence demonstrators were shot in the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili.\nIn an often Quote: d interview with Nova , Retno recalled finding her car vandalized after a university visit after the massacre, being put under 24-hour police guard and having to keep her son home from preschool for a week. The Indonesian embassy was blockaded; staff were forced to pick up their mail and dispose of their rubbish through the Chinese embassy. Instant noodles and eggs were on standby at the embassy in case they couldn't leave.\n\"It was very difficult,\" Retno says in an exclusive interview with Fairfax Media. \"But I learned a lot from the way my ambassador [former Jakarta Post editor in chief Sabam Siagian] tried to handle that issue: how to work very fast, how to engage journalists. I know it was a very difficult time for Indonesia but as ambassador he handled it in a very good way. My post in Australia gave me so many experiences that bring me to this point.\"\nAdvertisement This point is, of course, Retno's role as Indonesia's first female foreign affairs minister. This time last year, Retno was one of eight women sworn in to President Joko Widodo's cabinet. Prior to this she had been Indonesia's ambassador to the Netherlands. \"Mrs Retno is a career diplomat,\" Jokowi – as he is popularly known – said at the time. \"She works hard and strong, she is visionary.\"\nHer diplomatic skills would soon be tested. Within months, Australia's relationship with Indonesia was once again rocky, after Jokowi refused the clemency pleas of Bali nine heroin smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, despite their arguments that they had been rehabilitated in jail.\nFormer Prime Minister Tony Abbott did not help matters when he reminded Indonesia of the $1 billion of Australian aid given after the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami in a clumsy attempt to fight for the men's lives. The comments spawned a #KoinuntukAbbott (Coins for Abbott) social media campaign, which asked people to hand over their spare change to \"pay back\" the tsunami aid.\nAnd then in June, Indonesian police reported an Australian official had paid people smugglers to return a boat of asylum seekers to Indonesia – allegations never denied by Abbott. \"From ourselves the evidence is very obvious. But of course we want to get the information from the Australian side,\" Retno says. \"But it seems there is very minimum information that the Australian authorities could share with Indonesia. But we expressed our concern obviously at that time. I think the message has been conveyed clearly to Australia.\"\nRetno believes there is an intensity to the relationship between the two countries, due to the close geographical proximity and the many differences. \"The closer you are the more challenges you have, of course.\" But she stresses the importance of a close relationship – for trade, stability in the region and co-operation in areas such as counter-terrorism and people smuggling among other things.\n\"I think from the conversation we have had, it's clear the intention of Indonesia to strengthen the bilateral relation with Australia,\" Retno says. \"We couldn't afford to have a bad relationship with Australia and I'm sure Australia has the same view towards Indonesia. So let's do it together, let's co-operate to bring the benefit of the bilateral relationship to contribute to the region's peace and prosperity.\"\nThrough all the dog days this year, the personal relationship between Retno and her counterpart, Julie Bishop, has remained strong. They share many experiences. Both women were the first female foreign affairs ministers of their countries, both are keen exercisers (Retno told The Jakarta Post in 2012 she jogged five kilometres every day) and they share a passion for unconventional forms of ministerial communication.\n\"Retno Marsudi and I keep in constant contact, we're text buddies – much to the chagrin of our diplomats,\" Bishop said last month. It's this open line of communication that Retno appreciates. \"I am very happy with the fact that whatever the situation is I always have good communication with Julie Bishop,\" she says. \"Whenever we have good communication, then, God willing, it will help us to solve the problem.\"\nOne area in which the two countries work closely together is countering terrorism. Retno is passionate about the role of women in fighting extremism. Her logic, she says, is simple. \"Women bring up children, so the mother is the one who injects all the values since the very beginning. Since an early age my mum always mentioned the importance of tolerance, the importance to maintain harmony, never talk about differences with others. And here I am.\"\nIndonesia and Australia are co-chairs of one of the Global Counter-terrorism Forum's working groups: Detention and Reintegration. Last month Bishop told a high-level counter-terrorism meeting hosted by the US Secretary of State John Kerry that Australia and Indonesia would work together to rehabilitate hundreds of convicted terrorists expected to be released from Indonesian prisons in the coming years. Retno says priorities of their work together included training prison officers, strengthening the security of detention facilities, a detention and corrective program for convicted terrorists and a pre-release and post-release support program.\nIt has been suggested that foreign policy under the Jokowi administration has moved away from former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's \"one thousand friends and zero enemies\" style of diplomacy, to more targeted allegiances with countries such as China. But Retno says Indonesia's bebas aktif (free, active) foreign policy remains the same because it is mandated by the constitution. \"We call it the down to earth diplomacy, to make things easier\". She says this means foreign policy should reflect the national interest of the people with three main priorities: protecting Indonesia's territorial integrity, protecting Indonesian nationals and strengthening economic diplomacy. \"And we are open, very open, to any country because our foreign policy is bebas and aktif, free and active.\"\nAustralian media coverage of Indonesia tends to focus on the three Bs: Bali, beef and boats. Retno would like to see a fuller picture emerge – one that tells the story of the country's rambunctious democracy, the remarkable pluralism of the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation, the tolerance of its people. \"They deserve to be more reflected in the media,\" Retno says.\nFor Retno, Australia will always be the place where her second son was born. As a young mother she was impressed with Canberra, she says. \"It's not that crowded but you can find almost everything there, it's a bit quiet, you have so many spacious public facilities. So that's an ideal place for family life.\" Retno never returned to Canberra after her four-year posting ended. Her second son is a doctor. \"So it is my dream that one day I will take my family back to Canberra and show him the hospital he was born in.\"\nFollow Jewel Topsfield - Indonesia correspondent on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://nostalgia.tabloidnova.com/articles.asp?id=9451", "https://www.facebook.com/JewelTopsfieldIndonesiacorrespondent"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:20:50.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
