(Photo: File / Getty Images) \nDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton will no longer accept campaign contributions from lobbyists associated with Nashville-based Corrections Corporation of America or any other private prison company. \nIn fact, the campaign for the former U.S. secretary of state announced Clinton will entirely do away with private prisons if elected president. \n\"Hillary Clinton has said we must end the era of mass incarceration, and as president, she will end private prisons and private immigrant detention centers,\" campaign spokesman Tyrone Gayle said in a statement to The Tennessean. \n\"She believes that we should not contract out this core responsibility of the federal government, and when we're dealing with a mass incarceration crisis, we don't need private industry incentives that may contribute — or have the appearance of contributing — to over-incarceration.\" Private Prison Lobbyists Are Raising Cash for Hillary Clinton \nThe move comes as the Clinton campaign faced ongoing criticism for its tie to private prison lobbyists raising funds for her campaign. As The Intercept reported this summer, five Clinton bundlers — people who help raise large sums of money — work for a lobbying firm that CCA paid $240,000 to last year. The firm also legally represents CCA, and one of the firm's employees who also served as a Clinton bundler acknowledged lobbying for CCA in the past. \nLobbyists represent multiple people frequently, and that doesn't mean there are ties between a lobbyist's separate clients, argued CCA spokesman Jonathan Burns. \n\"CCA has not donated money to the Clinton presidential campaign, nor have any lobbyists donated to the campaign on our behalf. We hardly think it’s newsworthy that professional critics of our industry have persuaded a candidate to stop doing something that she already doesn’t do,\" Burns said in a statement. \n\"We do think it’s unfortunate that they advocate against the benefits we provide without themselves offering any real solutions to the serious challenges our corrections and detention systems face.\" Hillary Clinton promises to stop accepting donations from private prison companies \nCCA is the largest private prison company in the country. In addition to managing three Tennessee prisons and one of Metro's detention centers, it houses thousands of inmates and immigrants across the country in prisons and detention centers. \nCritics argue CCA and other private prison companies have a financial incentive to keep inmates in prison, or to keep their beds full. Private prison companies have denied those allegations, arguing they do the best they can to keep communities safe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:06:39.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
