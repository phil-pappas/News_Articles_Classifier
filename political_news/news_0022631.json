In turn, Roberts has agreed to pull a negative ad targeting Congemi that's set to the song \"Louie, Louie.\"\nThe agreement, accepted Monday (Oct. 12) by Judge Scott Schlegel of the 24 th Judicial District, followed nearly three hours of private negotiations between legal representatives for Roberts and Congemi in which the sides hammered out the details to end the suit filed Oct. 6.\nBoth sides claimed victory. Roberts he said the ads against him were false and misleading.\n\"We're happy,\" Roberts said. \"The bottom line is that these were serious allegations. The point that I want to get across is that they strictly were not accurate.\"\nCongemi said he won because Roberts also has to pull his negative ads aimed at Congemi's record.\n\"We wanted to make sure his commercials stopped as well, which was our goal,\" Congemi said. \"So we found this as a victory for us; that we were able to get his commercials off television.\"\nCongemi , a former councilman, is challenging Roberts for the Parish Council's Division A post. Also on the Oct. 24 ballot for the at-large seat is former Councilman Jimmy Lawson.\nRoberts sued Congemi in the 24 th Judicial District arguing the advertising, which labeled him a \"tax cheat\" is false and misleading. Congemi countered the ads, which aired on television, radio and social media, were a form of political satire which is protected free speech.\nSchlegel began hearing arguments Friday (Oct. 9) about the commercials, and the hearing was concluded on Monday.\nRoberts, a Harvey Republican, said he has paid his taxes and is owed a refund.\nHe says Congemi, a Republican former council member who lives in Metairie, aired two television spots and posted a Facebook piece containing \"false and misleading statements'' that Roberts didn't pay taxes. The suit says one TV spot repeated the false allegations four times and a second repeated them six times. One says, \"Councilman Chris Roberts: Paid by taxpayers but refuses to pay his own taxes,'' according to the lawsuit.\nCongemini who is heard in one ad saying, \"I absolutely approve of this message,\" said Monday he still stand by the ads, despite agreeing to the settlement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:51:29.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
