Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, during Thursday's hearing that were sent by Clinton to her daughter and the Egyptian prime minister hours after the Benghazi attack occurred. In the emails, Clinton identified the incident as a \"planned attack\" by an \"al Qaeda-like group\" and indicated that she knew it \"had nothing to do with the [anti-Islam] film\" that she and President Obama publicly blamed it on afterwards.\n\"If you listen to the people who were in Libya and Benghazi, they were saying not a protest and if you listen to Secretary Clinton's private conversations, she wasn't talking about a protest or a video. It was only in public when it came time to talk to the American people that we heard this spun up story about a video,\" Gowdy said.\n\"She told the foreign leader that it had nothing to do with a video so there's this dichotomy between what we tell the American people versus what we tell folks in private,\" he added.\nGowdy also said Clinton, who's previously testified before House and Senate committees on Benghazi in January 2013, was \"a good witness\" and delivered a \"certain level of candidness … on some responses.\"\nHowever, in an impromptu press conference following the hearing Thursday, Gowdy told reporters that in terms of Clinton's testimony, \"I don't know that she testified that much differently today than she has the previous times she testified.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump: I tried to tell Carson about his Iowa lead 'but he was sleeping'   while Trump lagged behind.\n  1:10 PM Top Story Trump: I tried to tell Carson about his Iowa lead 'but he was sleeping'   while Trump lagged behind.\n  1:10 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:57:51.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
