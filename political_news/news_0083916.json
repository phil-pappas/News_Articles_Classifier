The monumental arch sat atop the famed colonnaded streets of the ancient city, which linked the Roman Empire to Persia. \nAn opposition activist who uses the name Khaled al-Homsi posted on Twitter late Sunday that the militants destroyed the arch. \nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the group blew up the arch but left the colonnades in place. \nMilitants also recently blew up two famed First Century temples in Palmyra.
