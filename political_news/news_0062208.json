Jane Hull appointed Rebecca White Berch to the Arizona Supreme Court in 2002, she sent her there saying Berch would curb a “very, very activist court.” \n“I think she actually put me there because I understand how government works,” Berch said last week, reflecting on her retirement from the state’s highest court. \nThe contentious relationship between the courts, which are supposed to be non-partisan, and the political branches of state government, the Governor’s Office and the Legislature, has not changed. \nPoliticians threaten to change the way judges are appointed, how lawyers are disciplined. They lobby to have judges elected instead of appointed in Arizona’s largest counties. They give more and more money to police and prosecutors, then expect the courts to keep up. \nThey demonize judges who issue rulings they don’t like. \n“Judges are not their representatives,” Berch said. “Our job is to rule according to the law.” \n“The appropriate response is not to try to punish the courts. The appropriate response is to change the law.” \nBerch, 60, was the court’s chief justice from 2009 to 2014, during an economic downturn that colored its budgets, during a time when the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office and Sheriff Joe Arpaio were attacking the courts by bringing lawsuits and criminal charges against sitting judges, and during a time when the Legislature and the Governor’s Office jockeyed for more control over the judiciary. \n“Her tenure was during the worst period in the state’s fiscal crisis,” said current Chief Justice Scott Bales. “She was able to lead us through that.” \nHer former colleague on the court, Andrew Hurwitz, now a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said, “She was always willing to go over there (to the Legislature) to get yelled at and smile back, because that’s her style.” \nThough Berch officially retired in September, Bales almost immediately called her back to the bench to sit on panels and continue to deliberate and rule on cases until her replacement is appointed by the governor. Why Arizona has some of America's best judges \nMonday, the Arizona Commission on Appellate Court Appointments will discuss 12 lawyers and judges who have applied for her seat. They will cull the list and make final nominations, and Gov. Doug Ducey will appoint a new justice to the court from that list. \n“One of my regrets is that I wanted to be chief justice in a time when Arizona was flush, so I could do a lot of good,” Berch said. \nInstead she presided over an era of belt-tightening, even as she worked to modernize the way cases are filed and followed, and to streamline the rules lawyers follow during court procedures. \nThe cases run together. The high-profile political footballs and the sordid crime cases come and go. More important Supreme Court decisions, in Berch’s mind, deal with “less sexy” issues like water and taxes, things that truly affect peoples’ lives. \nShe also bristles at prosecutor misconduct. \n“I think prosecutors are supposed to represent the best of society,” she said. “Police and prosecutors should be held to very high standards, just like judges.” \nDuring her tenure as chief justice, the court instated new rules requiring prosecutors to turn over evidence of a defendant’s possible innocence if it turns up after conviction. The new rule was imposed over the objections of prosecutors. \nBerch once said in an e-mail to The Arizona Republic, “It has occurred to me that a couple of prosecutors routinely jeopardize virtually certain convictions by overzealousness.” \nDoing good has been a theme in Berch’s career, though she might have gone in a different direction. \nShe was a child actor growing up in the Phoenix area in the 1950s and ‘60s. She appeared in commercials and had a regular part on “The Lew King Rangers Show,” a Phoenix-based talent show that morphed from radio to early black-and-white TV and debuted future stars the likes of Wayne Newton and Tanya Tucker. \n“I had a SAG (Screen Actors Guild) card at 10,” Berch said. She spent at least one season in Hollywood as a regular on “The John Forsythe Show.” \nDespite doing theater and performing as a singer in local clubs, she didn’t like the hours or the uncertain lifestyle. \nBecause she wanted to do good, she majored in sociology at Arizona State University and continued for a master’s degree. Her first boring job as a sociologist verifying demographic data convinced her to go to law school. After graduating from ASU’s law school, she worked for years at a law firm specializing in litigation. \nWhen she became a mother, she left the law practice and went to work as a law professor at her alma mater, ASU, where she taught legal writing for five years. \nIn 1991, an ASU classmate, Grant Woods, who was then Arizona Attorney General, asked Berch to work for him as Solicitor General, the office’s top appeals attorney.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:42:52.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
