Tina Warren filed a federal lawsuit last week against Bill Kirkpatrick, the mayor of Piedmont, accusing the elected official of retaliating against her for her one-finger political expression, reported the Riverfront Times. ADVERTISING The mayor directed city workers to remove Warrens water meter and ordered Piedmont police to pull her over and order her to stop a petition drive against rising water bills, the suit claims. Kirkpatrick also persuaded Wayne County Sheriff Dean Finch, two deputies and a state police narcotics officer to search her home three weeks ago for drugs, according to the suit. That search turned up no evidence of illegal drugs. Warren began expressing her disgust with the mayor after her water service went out for six days in April 2014, and she stopped to question city workers. She claims Kirkpatrick told her to get back in her car and go down the f*cking road, so she began flipping off the mayor each time she encountered him. Warren said city workers removed her water meter July 7, and she went to City Hall to ask why. You flipped us off, a city employer says in a video she recorded of the encounter. Workers agreed to replace the meter after a police officer intervened and Warren assured them she was flipping off the mayor, not maintenance workers. It's a new world, right wingers. And your nasties are no longer tolerated. Long live the left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:52:16.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
