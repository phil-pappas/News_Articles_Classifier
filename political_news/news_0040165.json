Bush, was to blame for the 9/11 attacks.\n\"My brother responded to a crisis and did it as you would hope a president would do,\" Bush said. \"He kept us safe and united the country. There's no denying that. The majority of americans believe that. I don't know why he keeps bringing it up.\"\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ \"I think we need a president with a steady hand,\" he added.\nJeb continued that he had \"grave doubts\" about Jeb's readiness to be commander-in-chief, when asked about a new television ad he released lampooning Trump.\n  Ukrainian president warns Russia violence could spread \"Fourth, maybe, I don't know, Afghanistan.

Tim Miller tweeted, quote, 'Lying about budgets? I guess Marco picked up something in the senate.' Them's fighting words,\" Tapper said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Gowdy to GOP: 'Shut up' about Benghazi committee He has told fellow Republicans to \"shut up talking about things that you don't know anything about.\"\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 10/18/15 11:04 AM \"Yeah, I'm not into all that,\" not necessarily standing up for the tone of his spokesman.\n\"Indeed, he kind of misled people about his fundraising results.
