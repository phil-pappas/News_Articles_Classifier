Upgrades to the facility will also help to enhance patients' treatment experience, patient and employee satisfaction, and create an environment that feels welcoming, comfortable and fresh.\n\"The number of individuals who suffer from addiction is increasing at an alarming rate, making this disease and, in particular, overdose deaths, a public health crisis, said Paul Bacharach, president and CEO of Gateway Rehab. \"We're grateful to have the support of the Thomases Family Endowment and others like them in the Mahoning Valley.\"\nCarolyn Givens , executive director of NKRC, also noted that, \"Given surging local and statewide drug use, project funding will be expended to renovate a heavily used facility, and provide the opportunity to accommodate the expanded need for treatment services.\"\nNeil Kennedy Recovery Clinic was the nation's first nonprofit addiction treatment facility of its kind. Since its inception in 1946 as the Youngstown Committee on Alcoholism, Inc., NKRC has provided a safe, secure place where those with substance use disorders in Youngstown and the Mahoning Valley can receive treatment. In 1999, NKRC became a part of Gateway Rehab.\nGateway Rehab is a private, not-for-profit organization with the mission of helping all affected by addictive diseases to become healthy in body, mind and spirit. A positive force and leading resource for effective education, prevention, research and treatment of substance use disorders, Gateway Rehab serves nearly 1,700 adults and youth daily through four divisions at locations throughout Western Pennsylvania and Ohio .
