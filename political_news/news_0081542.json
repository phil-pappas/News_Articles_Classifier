If politicians oppose gun safety measures, he continued, “Even if they’re great on other stuff, you’ve got to vote against them.”\nAt the same time, Obama compared his passion for gun control laws to Republicans' devotion to abortion restrictions -- and said they had no place in budget discussions.\nObama’s ongoing call for action was in contrast to Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who responded to a question on Friday about gun control.\nPelosi calls for special committee on gun violence By Lauren French\n“I had this challenge as governor,” Bush said in South Carolina . “Look, stuff happens, there's always a crisis. And the impulse is always to do something and it's necessarily the right thing to do.”\nWhen a reporter read Bush’s remarks to Obama, the president said, “I don’t even think I have to react to that one. I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments based on the fact that every couple of months we have a mass shooting, and make them decide whether they consider that ‘stuff happening.’”\nWhile Obama said he’d directed his staff to look for more ways to take executive action and enforce existing laws, the president said he plans to use his bully pulpit on the issue for the rest of his presidency.\nObama on gun violence President Obama's remarks on gun violence.\nObama on gun violence\n“I’m going to talk about this,” Obama said, “and I’m going to politicize it.”\nIntended or not, Obama’s call for single-issue voting could have consequences in the race among Democrats to succeed him. Consistent support for gun control is one of the few areas where Hillary Clinton is positioned to the left of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders, who comes from a rural state, was endorsed by the National Rifle Association during his first run for Congress, and he has voted against the Brady Bill and other gun control measures.\nObama drew a distinction, however, between how he thinks voters should make decisions and how elected officials should approach governing, especially as budget and debt ceiling negotiations threaten to cripple the government and economy.\nObama acknowledged that some Republicans feel strongly about defunding Planned Parenthood. However, he continued, \"You can’t have an issue like that potentially wreck the entire U.S. economy, any more than I should hold the entire budget hostage to my desire to do something about gun violence. I feel just as strongly about that, and I think I’ve got better evidence for it.”\nIf he were to shut down the government and refuse to lift the debt ceiling unless Congress assented to new gun laws, Obama added, \"that would be irresponsible of me, and the American people rightly would reject that.”\n<div", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:39:38.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
