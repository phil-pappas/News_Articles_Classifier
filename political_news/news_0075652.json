John Sununu warned Monday that Donald Trump will win unless Republicans \"wake up.\" “I think Trump can win anywhere if the electorate doesn't wake up. But it may not be the best thing for the party or the country,” he told Andrea Mitchell Monday.\nSununu hasn’t endorsed a candidate yet, but he worked as chief of staff for Jeb Bush’s father, former President George W. Bush. His son, a former senator, is involved with Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s campaign.\nSununu said that it isn’t too late for Bush to gain back control of his campaign, which is suffering from weak poll numbers and slowing fundraising, but the electorate will need to start focusing on important issues for that to happen.\n“I think Jeb Bush is just making a mid-course correction … This has been a very different campaign than most people anticipated, primarily because the media has chosen to cover the entertainment side. You like the outrageous statements that come from Donald Trump,” Sununu told Mitchell. “You seem to enjoy the divisive effort he's made in trying to really attack some of the candidates… That seems to be the formula that he has found [that] allows him to get on just about every show whenever he wants. “\nEverything you need to know about Wednesday’s GOP debate By Noah Weiland\n“The other candidates are now finding that in order to fight that, they're going to have to spend more money on television than they anticipated and I think Jeb Bush is cutting back on personnel to make more money available for TV ads,” Sununu said.\nMitchell pointed to an outburst from Bush over the weekend in South Carolina, and asked Sununu if he thought the candidate's remarks represented an effective “mid-course correction.”\n“If this election is about how we are going to fight to get nothing done, then I don't want any part of it. I don't want to be elected president to sit around and see gridlock just become so dominant that people literally are in decline in their lives,” Bush said. \"That is not my motivation. I got a lot of really cool things that I can do other than sit around being miserable listening to people demonize me and me feeling compelled to demonize them. That is a joke. Elect Trump if you want that.”\nSununu said while the tone was wrong, Bush’s message was correct.\n“If Republicans go on to nominate someone that can govern the country in a way they want and make the policies they want, they ought to pay attention to the issues that the candidates support,” he said. “I think it's possible for any of the serious Republican candidates to come in and win this thing. Either Jeb or Kasich or Rubio or even Christie. But it really depends on the Republican electorate waking up to the fact that issues are important. “\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:04:59.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
