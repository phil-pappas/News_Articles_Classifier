Tammy Duckworth D-Ill. was supporting terrorists because she did not vote for an Iran sanctions bill co-sponsored by Sen. Mark Kirk R-Ill.\nTom Lopach, Executive Director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Friday the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s allegations were “despicable” and the group owed her an apology.\nNRSC spokesman Andrea Bozek said, “It is very simple Tammy Duckworth voted against a bill called, “The Justice For Victims Of Iranian Terrorism Act.” She gave a free pass to state sponsors of terror, and has a history of firing VA whistleblowers, that’s just not the kind of leadership Illinois families deserve.”\nKirk is one of the strongest opponents of the Iran nuclear deal, making it one of his main issues. Duckworth, a wounded Iraq war veteran who wants to replace Kirk, backs the agreement.\nOn Wednesday, Kirk joined as a co-sponsor of the Justice for Victims of Iranian Terror Act, a bill, his office said in a release, “to prevent economic sanctions from being lifted on Iran until the Iranian government has paid all the judgements against it for acts of terrorism.”\nIn the House, Duckworth, voted against the House version of the bill after which the NRSC said in a statement Duckworth’s “blind support for the nuclear giveaway to Iran reached a new low today when she cast a vote in Congress to protect the Iranian regime and support terrorists instead of their victims.\n“…Duckworth had the opportunity to hold the Iranian regime accountable, instead she gave a free pass to state sponsors of terror, that’s just not the kind of leadership Illinois families deserve.\nLopach said in a statement, “regarding the NRSC’s despicable allegation that Veteran Tammy Duckworth is siding with terrorists\n“Yesterday the NRSC stated that Congresswoman and Army Veteran Tammy Duckworth was siding with terrorists. We know that campaigns are tough and our candidates are prepared for the political fights ahead.\n“However, the NRSC’s allegation that this remarkable woman who served her country in Iraq and lost limbs in battle is standing with terrorists is beyond the pale. The DSCC is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Tammy Duckworth and we look forward to her continuing to serve her country in the United States Senate. The NRSC owes an apology to Lt. Colonel Tammy Duckworth (retired).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:54:59.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
