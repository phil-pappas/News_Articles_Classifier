For the opposition [NPP] to also say that the register must be changed is also fairly ridiculous”, Mr Jackson said MultiTV's current affairs programme, pm; Express. \nThe Electoral Commission is currently engaging the services of IT experts to help review the country’s electoral roll, a move that has been necessitated by persistent calls for a new register to be compiled for next year’s general elections. \nThe opposition New Patriotic Party, the Convention People’s Party and the Progressive People’s Party say the current register is bloated and so must be changed. They contend that the credibility of next year’s poll hinges on a new electoral roll. \nThe NDC on the other hand disagrees. The ruling party says evidence gathered by the NPP purporting to show that there are foreigners on Ghana’s electoral register are false. \nThe EC has called a meeting with the political parties to discuss proposals submitted by various parties and groups on the voters’ register and other matters. \nMr Jackson says the approach adopted by the EC on the proposals submitted is laudable. \n“We must give the EC time to evaluate the issues and then tell us what the submissions were about. Give [the EC] a chance to evaluate the work the NPP has done and tell us whether in their opinion the register should be scrapped or not,” the political analyst added. \nHe said he suspects the EC Chair, Charlotte Osei “is looking for a middle ground somewhere” between calls for a new register and those for the current roll to be maintained. According to him, that approach can help to restore confidence in the register. \nMr Jackson said changing the whole register is almost impossible. \n“It is a fact that we are broke. There is no point hiding that,” he said to buttress his point that the voter’s register cannot be changed presently. \nA young IT specialist on the show said the problem with the electoral register exemplifies a much bigger problem. \nKwabena Offei Nkrumah said what Ghana needs is not a new register but a reliable identification system that can be used to cross reference the voters’ register. \n“The problem is about how the system is being used. We have a very porous backbone. I don’t even think a backbone exists,” he said. \nThe backbone, he explained, is a centralized system that can feed the various mechanisms used to identify Ghanaians. \nHe suggested that every Ghanaian should be given a unique number that identifies to him or her, right from infancy. \n\"If I am going to vote, I need to have a unique number.\" \n“We have copied the wrong things and applying it badly”, he said. \nKobby believes had the National Identification System been successfully done, Ghana would have had this backbone. \nHe said as it stands now it would be expensive to overhaul the current system and build a new backbone, noting sadly that it would have been less expensive if Ghana had invested in a reliable backbone from the start. \nStory by Ghana | Myjoyonline.com | George Nyavor | [email protected]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:54:20.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
