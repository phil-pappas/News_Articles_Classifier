More than 220 participating drivers contributed data as they drove their normal, revenue-producing routes, including:\nMore than 3,000 driver duty cycles, as captured by electronic logging devices More than 75,000 driver alertness tests More than 22,000 days of driver sleep data Data analysis has commenced, and the agency is working toward completing the final report by the end of the year. The agency does not have preliminary study findings; however, FMCSA is pleased with the high volume of data collected from participating drivers and expects this data will help inform future activities by the agency as well as the current study.\nThe Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235), enacted December 16, 2014 , suspended enforcement of sections 395.3(c) and 395.3(d) of the HOS regulations. Section 395.3(c) requires a CMV driver who wants to restart his/her weekly driving window (of 60 hours on duty in 7 consecutive days, or 70 hours in 8 consecutive days) to take two consecutive periods off duty from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. as part of the 34-hour (or longer) restart. Section 395.3(d) allows the voluntary 34-hour restart to be used only once every seven days. These provisions were enacted following extensive research and public comment with the goal of reducing excessively long work hours that increase both the risk of fatigue-related crashes and long-term health problems for drivers. Enforcement of these sections will remain suspended as required by Congress until the Secretary of Transportation submits the CMV Driver Restart Study final report to Congress.\nFor additional information and to view an updated list of Frequently Asked Questions, visit http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/research-and-analysis/commercial-motor-vehicle-driver-restart-study .\n releases/commercial-motor-vehicle-driver-restart-study-data-collection-concludes-300152669.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC17470&Transmission_Id=201510011118PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC17470&DateId=20151001", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/commercial-motor-vehicle-driver-restart-study-data-collection-concludes-300152669.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/research-and-analysis/commercial-motor-vehicle-driver-restart-study"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:39:04.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
