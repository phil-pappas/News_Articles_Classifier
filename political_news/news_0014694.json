I love Massachusetts.”\nTrump said Clinton was following Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, her main competition for the Democratic nomination, all the way to the poorhouse.\n“He wants to raise costs by trillions of dollars. You’re going to pay for it,” Trump said. “The problem is that he’s dragging Hillary — poor Hillary — and he’s ranting and raving and she has to say, ‘I’m going to do that, too.’ ”\nHe said a Reuters poll has him leading all Republican challengers with 33 percent of the vote. Trump chided the media for saying his campaign has lost some steam.\n“We go down one point and it’s like we’re on the Titanic,” he said.\nHe called the Iran deal the “worst deal I’ve ever seen negotiated in history,” and made an odd reference to LaGuardia Airport in New York, which has a runway “full of potholes.”\nTrump went through two different rooms and also took the stage outside, where people were waiting for him in the cold. He entered and exited to blaring rock ’n’ roll music.\nThe Republican entered the school with a massive police escort and passed by a large image of his face, lit up by spotlights, in the back of a pickup truck.\nWhen he entered the gymnasium, Trump’s iconic “Make America Great Again” hats were on full display, and some of his more ardent supporters arrived wearing suits and ties to go along with the bright-red cap.\n“I think financially he’s done a good job with his own companies,” said Mike Golmer, 30, of Lowell, who was wearing a Trump hat with a matching red tie. “He also has an exciting quality about him. He’s a bit more boisterous than the other candidates.”\nGolmer and his friends entered the small gym singing the Beatles’ “Hey Jude,” which was blasting over speakers brought in by a private company for the event.\nSome brought their children to the event, which at times had a rock concert feel.\n“I’m here to support an independent candidate,” said Derek Quirbach, 43, of Lowell, who had his son and daughter in tow. “We’re interested in supporting a candidate and not a politician.”\nMembers of NARAL Pro-Choice Massachusetts — separated from the throng by a makeshift barrier — hurled anti-Trump chants at the crowd.\n“We’re here to stand up to Trump’s anti-woman, anti-choice positions,” said Megan Amundson, the group’s executive director. “Those values are not in line with the voters of Massachusetts.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:29:13.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
