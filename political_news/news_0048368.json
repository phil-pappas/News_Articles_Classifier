Walsh didnt say that Sanders has consistently supported specific gun-controls during his tenure in Congress, such as banning semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity bullets, nor allowing people to carry concealed weapons across state lines. Instead, she wrote that Sanders has an open-minded approach to guns thats from his political reality: Hes the senator from a pro-gun state that suffers little gun violence. That blurry synopsis is the conventional wisdom about Bernie and guns. It echoes reports from this summer recounting the NRAs surprising endorsement. And like this detailed Politifact.com summary of all Sanderss congressional gun votes, it notes that talking about guns is outside his comfort zone of economic inequality and justice. However, the Nation and the other reports like it dont shed real light on where Sanders is coming from. They dont explain why he supports some gun controls but not others. Nor do they ask if theres a consistency to Sanders positions and votes over the years? They simply suggest that Bernies position is muddled and makes a good target for Hillary. . . . Hillary is a good politician. But her stand on issued is swayed by how Bernie is received from liberals. She's not a democratic candidate. She, like Bush and Obama and her husband, are neoliberals.
