The outgoing speaker received a standing ovation at the GOP conference gathering, which came a day after Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly dropped his bid for speaker. Boehner (R-Ohio) did not set a date Friday for the leadership election, sources said, but he still hopes to resign from Congress at the end of October as planned. However, Boehner has said – and reiterated Friday morning – that he will remain speaker until House Republicans settle on a replacement.\nWith House Republicans in a state of disarray after Thursday's whirlwind, Boehner, McCarthy and other top Republicans have made multiple appeals to Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to run for the House’s top spot. Ryan is considering it, but people close to him say he remains very resistant to taking the post.\nRyan's Ways and Means Committee had a meeting scheduled Friday morning, but it was canceled, according to sources.\nReps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Daniel Webster of Florida are still candidates for speaker. GOP lawmakers are talking about a host of other Republicans for the post, including Reps. John Kline (Minn.), Lynn Westmoreland (Ga.), Tom Cole (Okla.) and Darrell Issa (Calif.).\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:50:07.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
