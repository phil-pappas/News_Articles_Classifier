And something new has caught my eye.\nIt started innocently enough. Over the past couple years, when a Yankee game got boring I’d switch over and watch an inning or two of the Mets. Last month, I found myself rooting for the Mets to beat the Yankees in the Subway Series. I have to face facts: I’m a Met fan.\nRight off the bat, let me state that I am not a bandwagon fan. My love for the Yankees was at its height when the team was at its nadir: I was the guy in the bleachers in 1990 telling everyone that Álvaro Espinoza was the next Phil Rizzuto, Greg Cadaret the next Whitey Ford.\nA lot has to do with A-Rod. Even before the scandals, I always felt embarrassed to have A-Rod wearing pinstripes. I will argue until my dying breath that the Yankees would have been much better off if they had never traded Alfonso Soriano for him back in 2004.\nAlso, I hate the new stadium. It looks nice on TV, especially the restored frieze above the upper deck, but it lacks the authenticity and atmosphere of the old one — partly because the field box seats, which cost upward of $500 per game, are usually half-empty. A concrete moat separates real fans from the corporate playpen.\nAlso missing is the defining characteristic of the old Stadium: the enormous upper deck that rose straight up over the field. I used to have season tickets in the front row of the upper deck, right behind home plate. You were so close you could call balls and strikes. If you yelled at a player, he could hear you.\nMariano Rivera writes in his biography that the new stadium “doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man — a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands.” Derek Jeter, in New York magazine last September, said that the old stadium had “a different feel. . . It was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you.”\nI guess it’s true that you can’t go home again. When I’m in the new stadium, fond memories of the old one flood back: watching my childhood heroes Greg Nettles, Thurman Munson, and Ron Guidry; cheering the talented 1980s teams led by Don Mattingly and Dave Winfield that always came up a couple of games short in September.\nThe Yankees’ resurgence — which mirrored New York’s — throughout the 1990s was a joy. The city embraced the team, and vice versa — and never more than the playoffs after 9/11.\nAs long as any of the core four of Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, Rivera and Jeter remained, I couldn’t stop rooting for the Yankees. But now that they’re gone, I feel liberated to switch my allegiance.\nIn some ways, Citi Field reminds me of the old Yankee Stadium. Fans pay attention. They clap when a Met pitcher has two strikes or the Mets have men on base. The Mets’ “7-Line Army” is larger and louder than what remains of the Yankees’ “Bleacher Creatures.” The Citi Field food options — from Shake Shack to Rao’s to Mama’s of Corona — are authentic New York.\nThe Mets are also more family-friendly, which matters now that I have two young daughters. There are fireworks nights. Kids can run the bases. Mr. Met comes around and says hello. Watching the Mets’ minor league team, the Brooklyn Cyclones, play at Coney Island’s beautiful MCU Park is heaven, especially on “princess nights.”\nOh, and the Mets have a very talented young team, one that’s made a connection with its fan base, as evidenced by the fact that their shortstop, Wilmer Flores, started to cry when he thought he was being traded this summer.\nThanks for the memories, Yankees, but it’s time to make some new ones. Let’s go, Mets!\nSahm works at a New York City think tank.
