A consensus has been built on many of them. But, the one issue that is threatening confidence in the 2016 race is the stubborn refusal of the ruling party to the compilation of a new, credible register,' he said. \nNana Akufo-Addo, however, urged the new EC boss, Mrs Charlotte Osei, 'to know that she can call on such renowned organisations like The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), National Democratic Institute (NDI), the International Republican Institute (IRI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), to support Ghana resolve this matter early for the budgetary considerations to be also looked at, hand in hand, timeously.' \nHe continued, 'Other countries in the region, such as Tanzania, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Kenya, have all ditched their similarly young but defective registers for new, credible ones. Why can't Ghana do the same?' \nThe NPP flagbearer was convinced that the simple explanation why the NDC government and President Mahama want the flawed register of 2012 maintained for 2016 is because 'the government believes a suspect register is the only way to guarantee victory. After all, if the administration of President John Mahama was to compete based on its record alone, its re-election would be almost unconceivable.' \nIn concluding, Nana Akufo-Addo noted that it is time that Ghana's friends among the world's leading nations realized there are significant problems brewing in one of their favourite African countries, which can be avoided. All well-meaning Ghanaians are interested in maintaining the reputation of Ghana as a peaceful, stable, democratic nation. \n'Serious changes must be made to the electoral infrastructure if we are to have a chance for a genuinely democratic election. And if those changes are to happen, they have to happen now. We must start today. The clock is running out. We need your concern, your support, and your vigilance. The Ghanaian people deserve a free, fair, and credible election next year,' he ended. \nCredit: NPP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:05:54.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
