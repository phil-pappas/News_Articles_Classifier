I live there, you see. I pay tax there and I contribute more than bile there.\"\nThe exchanges also involved broadcaster and journalist Muriel Gray and crime writer Val McDermid.\nIt comes as World Rugby admitted referee Craig Joubert blundered by awarding Australia the last-gasp penalty that sent Scotland out of the World Cup.\nPromoted stories Scotland led 34-32 at Twickenham when Jon Welsh was ruled deliberately offside for playing the ball after a knock-on by a team-mate.\nThe sport's governing body said in a statement that having reviewed the incident and as Wallabies player Nick Phipps had touched the ball the \"appropriate decision was a scrum to Australia for the original knock-on\" and not a penalty.\nMs Sturgeon's full tweet read: \"Note to my fellow independence supporters. People who disagree are not anti Scottish. Does our cause no good to hurl abuse (& it's wrong).\"\nShe also re-tweeted Ms McDermid who said in one of her postings: \"I for one am proud to call @jk_rowling and @ArtyBagger [Muriel Gray] my fellow countrywomen.\"\nIn June, Ms Sturgeon warned so-called \"cybernats'' who are members of the SNP that they could be disciplined by the party.\nWriting in the Daily Mail, she said it was ''not acceptable'' for people to use social media to ''threaten violence, or hurl vile abuse, or seek to silence the voice of others through intimidation''.\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie MSP said: \"This is not new and not the first time that Nicola Sturgeon has reprimanded her own supporters for their online abuse but it is refreshing none the less as they used to deny that there was ever a problem.\n\"This reveals the scale of the problem for the nationalist movement which has been infected by large numbers of people who believe the way to win an argument is to be offensively aggressive online.\"\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron said Scotland's rugby team performed more bravely and boldly than any performance he has seen.\nMr Cameron described the team's performance in the quarter final defeat as \"remarkable\" and revealed he was heartbroken at the result.\nShare article During a Commons statement, Mr Cameron offered his commiserations to the team.\nHe went on: \"They really played like lions, I don't think I've seen a braver, more bold performance, it was remarkable to see.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-20T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:30:31.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
