We have a responsibility to make sure that the new Syria has access to those qualified and educated people.” \nBut the SNP’s Kirsten Oswald, who represents East Renfrewshire, pointed out how David Cameron’s new ambition for Britain to take in 1000 refugees by Christmas equated to just two refugees per constituency. \nThis, she insisted, was “simply not good enough and represents a real missed opportunity to do the right thing”. \nIn response, David Lidington, the Europe Minister, disagreed and accused Ms Oswald of “under-estimating the importance when we shall be offering a home to people, who are the most vulnerable and the most traumatised by the conflict to ensure they are given a proper reception and the full package of support from the NHS, in many cases from social services from local authority level as well; they have got to be properly provided for”. \nLater, Alex Salmond, the SNP’s Foreign Affairs Spokesman, accused the Foreign Secretary as well as the Prime Minister and Michael Fallon, the Defence Secretary, of having their “itchy fingers” on the trigger of military intervention in Syria. \nBut, he asked, with 12 other countries already bombing in Syria, what analysis had been carried out on the “additionality” further RAF sorties could make to the military situation. \nMr Hammond argued that extending bombing to Syria was a matter of “military efficiency”. \nHe explained: “We are already flying reconnaissance missions over Syria but our reapers(drones) now have to fly over Syria unarmed, looking for situations, which they then relay back to call in other allies to carry out strikes; that is not the most efficient way to carry out operations.” \nMr Salmond urged the Secretary of State to listen to his own backbenchers. “As a non-combatant nation there are certain advantages in being able to make diplomatic initiatives. Given the PM is meeting the President of China, another non-combatant nation and a permanent member of the UNSC, why not discuss a joint diplomatic initiative instead of just thinking additional bombing is an answer.” \nMr Hammond said he had indeed discussed it with his Chinese counterparts several times but “judged” Beijing was not yet willing to undertake a diplomatic initiative that would separate it from Moscow.

We are not carrying out kinetic actions but we are flying reconnaissance and surveillance missions and feeding back the output of those missions to the Coalition.” \nThe Prime Minister is said to be increasingly confident that at least 50 Labour MPs would back a Commons vote on extending RAF strikes from Iraq to Syria. Expectations are rising that such a vote could happen before Christmas but Mr Cameron, scarred by losing a previous Commons vote on military action in Syria, is keen to make sure he has the numbers before putting the issue to Parliament.
