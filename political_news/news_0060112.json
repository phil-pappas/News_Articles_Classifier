I am a caring person who does not look down on people.” \nHe told the citizens to vote for him for more development projects in the communities, adding that, he would lobby investors to the area to create job opportunities for them. He said his contestant has nothing to offer the people when given the chance. The MP said after winning the primary, he would continue to defeat the New Patriotic Party (NPP) candidate, Sylvester Mathew Tetteh in the 2016 parliamentary election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:09:02.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
