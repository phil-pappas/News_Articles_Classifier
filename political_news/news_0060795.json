Ross’ book is titled “Doomed to Succeed: The US-Israel Relationship From Truman to Obama.”\nIssues of race have popped up more than once in the relationship between Obama and American Jews and Israel. Notable examples are: Obama’s disavowal of his anti-Semitic pastor, Jeremiah Wright; racist expressions about Obama from those identified with Netanyahu; black lawmakers otherwise sympathetic to Israel seeing Netanyahu’s speech to Congress as part of a pattern of white comeuppance, and Obama’s fury with Netanyahu for making a bogeyman of bused-in Arab voters during Israel’s March election .\nSo did Rice, in her conversation with Foxman, mean to say Netanyahu was a racist?\nI’ve asked Foxman to give me his firsthand impression, and I’ll update when he does. Rice’s spokesman gave the New York Times an answer about her relationships with the Israelis, but did not directly address the “N-word” Quote: .\nRoss, in a conversation posted Friday by The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, says he does not think Rice thinks Netanyahu is a racist (nor does he think Netanyahu is a racist.) Rather, he says, Rice thinks Netanyahu has pulled out every stop except for racism in his contentious relationship with the president to fight the Iran nuclear deal.\nGoldberg asks: “Is there a chance — did she use this expression, ‘N-word,’ just as a way of saying, ‘This is how bad it got,’ or was the president really thinking that Bibi was engaged in some sort of race-based attack?\n“I think it’s the former,” says Ross. “This is how mad we are at what he’s doing, and doesn’t he realize that we did a deal in good faith, and look at how he’s reacting, or he’s overreacting to it. It’s out of bounds.”\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:18:18.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
