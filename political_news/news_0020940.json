Dave Grohl Gets Revenge on High School Music Nemesis Jost argued that devotion to gun ownership in America is linked to Americans’ obsession with unnecessary things. “We don’t need a Baconator. We don’t need a beer that’s a margarita inside a beer. And we definitely don’t need our dogs to wear Halloween costumes,” he said. Top Celeb Pics: 'Black Mass' Premiere Che quipped that drivers licenses, a purple belt in karate, and tickets to see Kevin Hart are all harder to get than a gun and went on to tell viewers that, “you can't have whatever you want.” “The forefathers said you had the right to own a gun. They also said you had the right to own people,\" he said, before comparing the Constitution to a grandfather.

Sentimental music plays in the background as a narrator says, \"there are things we all share: love, family, connection, a sense of purpose. And also, guns.\" Malcolm-Jamal Warner Opens Up About Cosby In her opening monologue, Schumer knocked the Kardashians for being poor role models for women who weren’t born with their figures or faces, and told a story about when she asked Hillary Clinton if she ever drank tequila. Schumer said that the presidential candidate replied that she only drank it when her friends made her, which led Schumer to wonder —“who’s hazing Hillary Clinton?” Schumer later appeared in skits about a hands-free selfie-stick, a porn-star teacher and a Delta flight gone horribly wrong.
