The Act regulates the issue of the legal title to FWP property, not regulated for 17 years. Pursuant to the Act, which was voted for by all senators without any amendments, NSZZ Solidarność, Ogólnopolskie Porozumienie Związków Zawodowych and Forum Związków Zawodowych shall become co-owners of FWP property which the property of liquidated Fundusz Wczasów Pracowniczych was contributed to. The property includes several dozen hotels, vacation lodges and guest houses in various parts of Poland. This property will be at last owned by the representative Polish trade union organisations. The title to the property of Fundusz Wczasów Pracowniczych, awarded to trade unions, shall be converted into the joint co-ownership of the shares in the company which has been managing the former FWP assets. Pursuant to the said Act, the Treasury holds no claims vis-a-vis the FWP property or to the shares in the company deciding thereon, as well as that no claims on the said title can be addressed to the Treasury. This is grounded as the FWP property had never been deemed the one belonging to the state but it was considered public property aimed at satisfying public needs by the trade union organisations. The need to regulate the former FWP property ownership by a legislation is the consequence of the decision of the Constitutional Tribunal of 3 June 1998. After it was awarded, the problem of the former FWP property had remained controversial and unequivocal as for 17 years there were no regulations specifying the succession of the property left by a legal person who no longer exists in such a form due to the legislators' decision. The former FWP property has a high value not only materially but primarily in social terms as it serves to perform one of the basic employees' rights, that is the right to dignified rest. The solutions proposed in the act do not focus solely on regulating the legal situation of the former FWP property but also ensure uninterrupted satisfaction of social needs the said property serves. The Act assumes providing the control of the said property to all trade union organisations representative in Poland.
