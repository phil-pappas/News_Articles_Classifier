(Carlos Barria/Reuters) By Editorial Board October 18 at 7:52 PM C HINA’S MERCILESS effort to crush dissenters and those who defend human rights not only aims to break the spirit of individuals who challenge the system. Authorities also go after family members, subjecting them to threats and punishment. In a brazen new example, China has reached across the border into Burma to nab the fleeing 16-year-old son of human rights lawyers who were detained in July.\nOn the night of July 9, China began a widespread crackdown on lawyers and activists known as members of the rights defense movement.
