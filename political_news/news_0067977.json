Renee Ellmers.\nElmer's page was also altered, and the changes were tracked to an IP address at the DHS office in Springfield, Virginia, CBS News reported.\n\"DHS has immediately launched an investigation into this serious matter,\" DHS spokeswoman Marsha Catron told CBS. \"If it is discovered that a DHS employee, using Government property, is responsible for these alleged actions, immediate and appropriate disciplinary action will be taken.\"\nThe changes to Rep. Ellmers' (R-North Carolina) page were first reported by Washington Free Beacon reporter Lachlan Markay, who also noted changes to McCarthy's page. The changes referenced a report of alleged infidelity between the two written by controversial conservative writer Charles Johnson, Fox News reported.\nBoth McCarthy and Ellmers have vehemently denied the rumors.\nMcCarthy stunned colleagues in the House when he dropped out of the race to replace House Speaker John Boehner.\nHe removed himself from the race following a letter from Rep. Walter Jones, R-North Carolina, who mysteriously told candidates for speaker with \"misdeeds\" to withdraw from the race. It made reference to former Louisiana Rep. Bob Livingston, who stepped down as he was preparing to become House speaker after admitting to having an affair.\nMcCarthy denied that the letter had anything to do with his exit from the race. Jones would not specify who his letter was meant for when reporters asked if the rumors about the affair arose from the letter.\n\"That's their decision to interpret it that way,\" Jones said. \"Anybody in leadership, male or female, should be a man or woman of integrity. That is nothing personal about anybody.\"\nEllmers primary rival Kay Daly reference Jones letter in a Facebook post refering to \"fidelity\" in the House and calling McCarthy an \"infidel.\"\nMcCarthy was also reportedly sent a direct email from a conservative activist threatening to reveal the alleged affair, according to The Huffington Post .", "external_links": ["http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kevin-mccarthys-exit-affair-allegations_5616f004e4b0082030a1e0a8", "https://www.facebook.com/KayDalyforCongress/posts/995687667139363", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-investigating-wikipedia-entries-on-alleged-mccarthy-affair/", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/09/dhs-investigating-wikipedia-edits-citing-alleged-mccarthy-affair/"], "published": "2015-10-10T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:34:09.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
