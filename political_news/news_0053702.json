More Congressional chaos spurs US debt fears \nAt a closed-door meeting he asked colleagues to decide whether or not they would support him by Friday, in effect laying down an ultimatum for hardcore conservative lawmakers whose uncompromising criticism of their own leaders has torn the party apart. \nMr Ryan’s move ensures that confusion over the party’s future will continue for at least a few more days as lawmakers barrel towards a series of critical deadlines, including a possible breach of the federal debt ceiling in early November that only congressional action can avert. \nCongressional Republicans have been in turmoil since John Boehner announced last month he would step down as speaker and his expected successor Kevin McCarthy ended his bid for the job at the last minute amid infighting. \nMr Ryan, who chairs the House’s tax writing committee, had spent weeks saying he did not want to be speaker. \nHe told reporters on Tuesday night he was “reluctant” to take the job but said: “I came to the conclusion that this is a very dire moment, not just for Congress, not just for the Republican party, but for our country. I think our country is in desperate need of leadership.” I think our country is in desperate need of leadership \nA spokesman for Mr Ryan said: “If the members agree with his requests and share his vision, and if he is a unity candidate — with the endorsement of all the conference’s major caucuses — then he will serve as speaker. He will be all in. But if he is not a unifying figure for the conference, then he will not run.” \nAmong other conditions, Mr Ryan said the House rules should be changed to make it less easy for rank-and-file members to launch moves to eject their leader. \n“No matter who is speaker, they cannot be successful with this weapon pointed at them all the time,” his spokesman said. \nMr Ryan, who has three young children, also told members that “family comes first”. \nAs the US approaches another debt ceiling, Republicans need a leader \nRead more \n“A successful speaker must be able to maintain a healthy work-family balance. Less time on the road can be compensated for with a greater focus on communicating our message to the public,” his spokesman said. \nBefore Tuesday the prospect of a Ryan candidacy had received a mixed reception from the House Freedom Caucus, a small band of conservative lawmakers who consistently undermined Mr Boehner and played a central role in pushing him out. \nMr Ryan said the next speaker needed “to use the platform to create a clear policy choice for the country”, according to his spokesman.
