Congress has not authorized or delegated to the [Bureau of Land Management] authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing and, under our constitutional structure, it is only through congressional action that the BLM can acquire this authority,\" Skavadahl wrote.\nThe Bureau of Land Management regulations were enacted based on what critics say is an unsubstantiated fear that the process of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, by the oil and gas industry may pose a threat to water supplies. The rules would require oil companies to disclose the chemicals used in the fracking process, monitor well integrity and other aspects of production.\n  Poll: Scott Walker's slide in Wisconsin continues Wisconsin Gov.
