No group has claimed responsibility, but the government suspects the Islamic State group.\nOne of Turkey's problems, domestic political wrangling, is attributable to the ambitions of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He called early elections to improve the position of his party. It finished first on June 7, but by such a narrow margin that he had to try to form a coalition government. He was unsuccessful and scheduled new elections for Nov. 1.\nThe move provoked another problem. Turkey's Kurdish minority, estimated at 25 percent, has been emboldened by Kurdish military successes in Iraq and Syria. The Kurds did better in the latest elections, stirring up anti-Kurdish sentiment among other Turks. In addition, a longstanding truce between extremist Kurds and the government ended and hostilities are open again.\nAdd to that the Turks' concern over the improving situation in the Middle East of the Islamic State, to which it is opposed, and the flood of about 2 million Syrian and other migrants into Turkey. The country's situation starts to become dangerous, if not impossible.\nIts membership in NATO should provide some reassurance, but most NATO members have no stomach for becoming more deeply involved in Turkey's security or for accepting more of the migrants.\nAll in all, it is difficult to see a viable road out of this swamp. Mr. Erdogan should postpone the elections until the spring, form a coalition government that includes the domestic Kurdish party and focus on cooling things down. The United States, given its friendship with Turkey, should encourage this course.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1737719", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1737719&h=Latest+violence+in+Turkey+is+another+cause+for+concern", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/opeds/s-1737719&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:15:15.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
