But with mail voting increasing in popularity, both voters and election officials still face planning challenges when it comes to absentee and mailed ballots.\nThe report\nBob Andres July 22, 2014 - Atlanta - Poll worker Ask Muhammad (left) watches as Robbie Ashe, chairman of MARTAâ€™s board, signs in to vote at Grady High School. The voter turnout was light this morning at the Grady High School precinct in Atlanta. BOB ANDRES / BANDRES@AJC.COM The indexes in the past have dinged Georgia.\nBy releasing this early data now, Pew provides an updated snapshot of both the expectations and the reality of voting practices across the nation.\nAmong the findings for the wait times facing national voters last year:\n83 percent reported waiting less than 10 minutes. 13 percent waited 10 to 30 minutes.\nOverall, these wait times either met or were shorter than what voters expected:\n expected to wait, they typically moved through very quickly — something that person to their local election office. Among the findings:\n69 percent of mail voters across the nation returned their ballots via the U.S. Postal Service. 29 percent returned them in person to an official election location such as a polling place, early voting center or drop box. 85 percent returned their ballots themselves, and 14 percent gave their ballots to someone else to mail or drop off for them.\nGiven that nearly three in 10 voters returned mail ballots — and that all voting is done by mail in states such as Oregon and Washington, and state such as Arizona and Colorado allow voters to register as permanent mail voters — Becker said election officials need to have the infrastructure in place to accept ballots delivered in person.
