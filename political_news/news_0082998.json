As insurers enrolled more older, sicker Americans under the new healthcare law, they were promised some federal money to help cover their new costs, through a program known as risk corridors.\nFor example, if a health plan found itself with at least 3 percent more medical claims than it had anticipated, the government would reimburse it for half of those losses. If claims surpassed expectations by more than 8 percent, the government would pay 80 percent of the losses.\n  Colbert to Kerry: How are you not Neville Chamberlain? Kerry said the comparison would be wrong because Chamberlain \"relied on words, there was no agreement.\"\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/02/15 12:01 PM But the law requires the program to be budget-neutral, meaning that if there aren't adequate funds, insurers have to go without. The HHS announcement, insurers will get about $2.5 billion less than they asked for, and they weren't pleased.\n\"Stable, affordable coverage for consumers depends on adequate funding of the risk corridor program,\" said Marilyn Tavenner, CEO of America's Health Insurance Plans. \"It's essential that Congress and CMS act to ensure the program works as designed and consumers are protected.\"\nThe administration insisted the insurers will still eventually get their entire payouts, sometime within the next two years of the temporary program. The program expires after 2016. HHS officials said that if there's still a shortfall after that point, the agency will \"explore other sources of funding\" and potentially work with Congress on the issue.\nTop Story Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump stokes prejudice, paranoia \"He has been stoking prejudice and paranoia.
