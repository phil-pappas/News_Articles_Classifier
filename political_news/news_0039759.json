But his ratings have moved in a positive direction in two consecutive Post -ABC surveys.” Related Posts Never miss a Political Wire post Your email address: * Please enter all required fields Correct invalid entries  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:05:51.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
