The potential financial compensation would be similar to what the federal government now offers. \n\"This is about doing what's right. This is about integrity,\" said Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine), a former police officer. \"When we do get it wrong, we have to make it right.\" \nCurrently, Wisconsin law provides exonerated inmates no more than $5,000 for each lost year of their life, up to a total of $25,000. Of the states with laws providing for payments to the wrongfully convicted, Wisconsin has the lowest amount per year, said Keith Findley, co-director of the Wisconsin Innocence Project, which has helped overturn the convictions of wrongfully accused prisoners. \nSince 1990, roughly 40 inmates have been exonerated and released, supporters of the bill said at a statehouse news conference. Rep. Gary Hebl (D-Sun Prairie) and Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield) said that the measure's sponsors are considering making the bill retroactive in light of that fact. \nBut Findley said that not all of the 40 prisoners would qualify for additional compensation. Some have died or can't be located or wouldn't successfully complete the application process, he said. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
