The agenda included two hours of debate time plus four commercial breaks and no opening or closing statements.\n\"We thought that the only way to make sure that candidates are heard early and late was not to rely on the moderators,\" he said, referring to the push for opening and closing statements.\nThe letter came after a heated call between the campaigns and the Republican National Committee over the debate's format.\nNeither Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski nor Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks immediately responded to requests for comment. But Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to express his anger.\n\"The @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party,\" he said. He accused the network of trying to lengthen the debate in order to sell more ads. Trump has complained often about the second debate, hosted by CNN, which stretched on for a marathon three hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:27:33.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
