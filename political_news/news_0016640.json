With consistently low rates of unemployment in the technology field, there is a significant, growing demand in Los Angeles for information technology professionals with a broad range of skills. Companies in the greater Los Angeles marketplace in particular have found challenges hiring qualified talent to fill all of the technology positions. Vaco Technology hired Melissa Thadani as senior recruiter, and Gloria Gutierrez and William Weiss as technical client services managers.\nVaco Technology has already achieved a 100 percent growth rate thus far this year over 2014 due to the large and growing demand for technology professionals for project-based, contract positions and full-time, permanent positions. Some of the most in-demand technology areas are application development, including SQL, .NET, Oracle, front-end and back-end development, and web development; and infrastructure management, including network engineering, network administration, project management, systems architecture and help desk support.\nWith over 20 years of experience in IT project management in addition to recruiting, Gloria offers a unique blend of job knowledge and insights to her clients as she places top IT talent.

Vaco Technology excels at sourcing and placing top IT professionals, and as a result, we're experiencing tremendous growth as the demand for more technology professionals increases across all industries. We expanded our team to meet this demand, and Gloria, Will, and Melissa will be instrumental to our success.\"\nGloria, Melissa, and Will stated they chose to join Vaco for a variety of reasons, including the company's values of teamwork, service, and results; the entrepreneurial spirit that's embodied in the corporate culture; and that Vaco really felt like a family.\nAbout Vaco Los Angeles\nVaco Los Angeles , LLC is an award-winning technology firm also specializing in disciplines of finance and accounting for interim and executive search. \"Vaco\" is derived from a Latin word meaning \"to free yourself from a master.\" Vaco Los Angeles launched in 2006 and has been named #1 Best Place to Work in Los Angeles four times.
