He agreed to host “Saturday Night Live” on NBC next month and live-tweeted the Democratic face-off. (Associated Press) more > By David Sherfinski - The Washington Times - Wednesday, October 14, 2015 \nBusinessman Donald Trump holds sizable leads on his next-closest 2016 GOP competitor, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, in the early presidential states of South Carolina and Nevada, according to a pair of polls released Wednesday that showed the rest of the field well back. \nMr. Trump had 36 percent support in South Carolina, followed by Mr. Carson at 18 percent, according to the CNN/ORC poll. In Nevada, Mr. Trump led Mr. Carson by 16 points, 38 percent to 22 percent. No other candidate reached double digits in either state. \nGOP voters in both states overwhelmingly chose Mr. Trump as the best candidate to handle the economy (67 percent in Nevada and 59 percent in South Carolina, with no others in double digits) and illegal immigration (55 percent in Nevada and 51 percent in South Carolina — leading others by 40 or more points). \nAbout six in 10 voters in each state said Mr. Trump is the candidate most likely to change the way things work in Washington. And almost half — 47 percent in Nevada and 44 percent in South Carolina — said Mr. Trump has the best chance of winning the general election next November. \nHe was also judged the best candidate to handle foreign policy, the Islamic State terrorist group, and social issues, albeit by smaller margins. \nFifty-three percent of likely caucus participants in Nevada said they have made up their mind or are leaning toward someone, while 60 percent of GOP voters in South Carolina said they are still trying to decide on a candidate. \nIn South Carolina, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was in third at 9 percent, followed by former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina at 7 percent, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 6 percent, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and native son Sen. Lindsey Graham at 5 percent each, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky at 4 percent and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee at 3 percent. \nIn Nevada, Mrs. Fiorina was in third at 8 percent, followed by Mr. Rubio at 7 percent, Mr. Bush at 6 percent, and Mr. Cruz and Mr. Huckabee at 4 percent apiece. \nThe polls were taken Oct. 3-10. In South Carolina, 521 likely GOP primary voters were interviewed, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. In Nevada, 285 likely GOP caucus-goers were interviewed, with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:49.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
