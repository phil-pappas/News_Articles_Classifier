What's the rest of Oregon think? AX153_342B_9.JPG A scene from Owyhee country in Malheur County. Is the sun setting on Oregon's rule in the eastern county? (Terry Richard/Oregonian) Comments \nGive me liberty or give me ... death ? No, that can't be right. Rather extreme, don't you think? \nThe famous Patrick Henry quote clearly needs an update. How about: Give me liberty or give me ... um ... secession. \nYes, much better. That's a way more appropriate sentiment for modern America. Let's face it: We've got more to live for than folks in Henry's time. SportsCenter is on at 6. \nAnd Americans have been fascinated with secession for generations. The southern states famously tried it in the 1860s in an effort to keep the Enlightenment at bay. That brought only death and destruction, but the dream didn't die. Many southern states still include their defeated rogue nation's symbol in their official flags. \nThere have been plenty of other efforts over the years, all unsuccessful so far. Californians have floated various ideas for splitting up that mammoth state, the most recent one just last year. In 1969, Norman Mailer ran for mayor of New York City on the promise to split the city off from the rest of New York. In 2009, then-Texas Governor Rick Perry said he wouldn't mind seeing the Lone Star State go its own way . \nNow it's Malheur County, Oregon's turn to take their ball and leave -- or at least to talk about it. Word out of the eastern Oregon outpost is that farmers there are agitating to join Idaho, whose conservative, agriculture-focused legislature is more in tune with their values than the liberal kooks who stroll the Capitol's halls in Salem. \n\"Everything about Malheur County is more identified with Idaho,\" Nyssa-based produce shipper Shay Myers told Capital Press . \"I wish I knew how to actually make this happen.\" \nIdaho, it turns out, might be ready to back the Malheur uprising. (Et tu, Idaho?) \"With the kind of agricultural industry they have over there, we'd take them in a heartbeat,\" said Gayle L. Batt, a Republican state representative in Idaho. \nWell ... it's nice to feel wanted. A kind word or two can go a long way. Gov. Brown, do you have something to say to Malheur County farmers? \n-- Douglas Perry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:04:53.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
