He announced new steps to help improve doctor training and ease access to drug treatment. \nHe says sales of powerful prescription pain medications have skyrocketed by 300 percent since 1999. \nAnd in 2012 alone, doctors wrote 259 million prescriptions for these highly addictive drugs. Obama says that was more than enough to give a bottle of pills to every American adult. \nBut he says the federal government alone can't solve the problem. \nWest Virginia has the highest rate of overdose deaths in the U.S., more than twice the national average. President Barack Obama walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015, toward Marine One heading to Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,, then onto Charleston, W.Va., to host a community discussion on the prescription drug abuse and heroin epidemic.
