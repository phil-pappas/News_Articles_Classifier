Like if somebody throws a stone at a dog, then the government is held responsible... It is not like that.\"\n\nDeprecating Singh's comment, Punia said, \"It is insulting not only for that particular Dalit family but the entire Dalit society.\"\n\nThe NCSC Chairman said that Singh's statement has been condemned by all political parties. Even Ramvilas Paswan, \"who is part of the NDA government, has condemned it\", he claimed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:44:45.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
