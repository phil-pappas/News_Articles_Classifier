(Evan Agostini/Getty Images) October 16 at 5:45 PM The Oct. 14 Style article “ The Donald’s toy box ” elaborated on just how wealthy Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is. The real estate mogul claims to have a net worth of nearly $10 billion, which he uses to enjoy a lavish lifestyle that includes opulent properties and private jets.\nIf that weren’t enough, Mr. Trump has proposed a tax overhaul that would primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans. Under his plan, the after-tax income of the top 1 percent of income earners would surge 21.6 percent or more, Tax Foundation figures reveal. The bottom 10 percent, however, would receive only a 1.4 percent increase.\nMr. Trump has claimed such policies would create growth as high as 6 percent , but the U.S. economy has not expanded that quickly in more than a decade. Mr. Trump makes promises about how well his policies will work, but millions of Americans struggle with joblessness and a high cost of living.\nHow can this man represent the American people?\nCharles L. Bovaird II , Boston\n●\nIt was interesting to read of “The Donald’s” multibillion-dollar wealth in “ The Donald’s toy box .” I wonder whether someone might ask him whether he would consider selling one of the five residences described in the article to fund an urban food bank.\nNancy Scott , Fairfax", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:52:44.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
