Dr Rajesh Kumar from Paras Hospital said, \"The number of cases is expected to come down by the end of autumn.\"\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-17T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:18:59.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
