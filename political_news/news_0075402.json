The military said they had no permit. When they arrived they were confronted by Palestinians and a violent clash ensued. In consultation with Palestinian security forces, the military extracted the worshippers. One of them was lightly wounded and five were taken for police questioning.\nOn Friday, Palestinian assailants firebombed the West Bank compound. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said extremists were trying to turn the current conflict into a religious one.\nSunday's incident comes after another bloody day in which Palestinian assailants carried out five stabbing attacks against Israelis in Jerusalem and the West Bank, as a month-long outburst of violence showed no signs of abating.\nOver the past month, eight Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, most of them stabbings. In that time, 40 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, including 19 labeled by Israel as attackers, and the rest in clashes with Israeli troops.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb29w%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=The%20Latest%3A%20Dozens%20of%20Jews%20enter%20West%20Bank%20shrine", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb29w%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=The%20Latest%3A%20Dozens%20of%20Jews%20enter%20West%20Bank%20shrine&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb29w%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb29w%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb29w%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=The%20Latest%3A%20Dozens%20of%20Jews%20enter%20West%20Bank%20shrine", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeb29w%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:36:55.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
