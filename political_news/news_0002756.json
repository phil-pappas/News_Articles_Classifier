Ted Cruz, former Sen. Rick Santorum, former Govs. Mick Huckabee and Jeb Bush, and Dr. Ben Carson who accepted the challenge. \nReligious freedom, Islamic State terrorism, abortion, education and the economy were among the top issues discussed by the candidates, who were given around 10 minutes for opening remarks followed by 15 minutes of Q&A with Prestonwood Baptist Church Pastor Jack Graham before an audience of 7,000 people.

We went to a Planned Parenthood clinic and I watched as she was given no choices. I watched what that procedure did to her physically, emotionally, spiritually.\" \nShe continued: \"A little later, I met my husband — we've been married over 30 years — and when we married I learned that his mother had been told to abort him. ... Her son was the joy of her life and he is the rock of mine, and I've thought often how different my life would be had she made a different choice.\" \nFiorina shared that later in her marriage she learned \"in a profoundly personal way how precious a gift life is\" after she found out that she wouldn't be able to have children of her own. \nHoming in on prayer and faith in leadership, Fiorina said she believes \"people of faith make better leaders\" because \"faith gives us humility, empathy and optimism.\" \n\"Humility because we know each of us is made in the image of God and gifted by God,\" she said. \"Faith gives us empathy. We know that every one of us can fall, and each one of us can be redeemed. And humility and empathy are vital in a leader if a leader is to serve and unlock potential in others. And finally, faith gives us optimism — the belief that things can be better and people will rise to the occasion. …\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:08:49.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
