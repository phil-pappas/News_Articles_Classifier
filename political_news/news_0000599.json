The government has never failed to meet its obligations and a default would likely have severe effects on interest rates and the economy. \nSince the limit was reset in March, Treasury has employed accounting maneuvers known as \"extraordinary measures\" to be able to continue to borrow. Those measures chiefly involve suspending payments into federal retirement funds. \n\"We now estimate that Treasury is likely to exhaust its extraordinary measures on or about Thursday, Nov. 5,\" Lew wrote top lawmakers. \"At that point, we would be left to fund the government with only the cash we have on hand, which we currently forecast to be below $30 billion.\" \nCongress last increased the debt limit in February 2014. \nIn 2011, Republicans used the need to increase the debt limit as leverage to force President Barack Obama to agree to spending cuts. But Obama has since refused to negotiate over the debt limit and last year's increase passed largely on the votes of House and Senate Democrats.
