But you see a situation where there is vindictiveness, there is an attempt to exorcise some people…the centre cannot simply hold for the NPP. \n“If you claim you want to rule this country and in your own backyard you lack the capacity to hold the people together what is the guarantee that when given the whole country you would be able to rule it”. \nAmaliba added that Ghanaians no longer view the NPP as a credible alternative to the governing National Democratic Congress. \n“I think the NPP is beginning to make people feel that they are not a credible opposition and until they hold themselves together am sure these things would continue happening in their party”.
