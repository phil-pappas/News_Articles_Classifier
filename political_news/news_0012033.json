Richard Hanna, R-New York, said that he thinks \"that there was a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after people and an individual, Hillary Clinton.\"\nHanna's comments came just a few weeks after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said one result of the committee was to hurt Clinton's poll numbers, which Democrats interpreted as an admission that the goal of the committee was to hurt Clinton. And just days ago, Maj. Bradley Podliska. a former staffer on the committee, said publicly that the committee was conducting a \"partisan investigation\" targeting Clinton.\n\"After what Kevin McCarthy said, it's difficult to accept at least a part of it was not,\" Hanna said Wednesday on New York's WIBX 950. \"I think that's the way Washington works. But you'd like to expect more from a committee that's spent millions of dollars and tons of time.\" Hanna is not a member of the Benghazi committee.\n  Fed official acknowledges confusion over interest rates 'We probably haven't been doing that well' in communicating, New York Fed president says.\nBy Joseph Lawler â€¢ 10/15/15 1:07 PM Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ At the first Democratic debate Tuesday night, Clinton told the audience that since the committee is \"basically an arm of the Republican National Committee.\" Clinton is due to testify before the committee on Oct. 22.\n\"House Republicans aren't even shy anymore about admitting that the Benghazi Committee is a partisan farce,\" Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon said after the radio show comments. \"Hillary Clinton will still attend next week's hearing, but at this point, Trey Gowdy's inquiry has zero credibility left.\"\nListen to the interview here. Hanna's comments on Benghazi start at the 9:45 mark.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:11:46.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
