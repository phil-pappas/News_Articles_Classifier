Ted Cruz’s campaign is well-ensconced in the top tier of Republican presidential candidates. \nThe Cruz campaign announced Thursday night that it had raised $12.2 million for the third quarter of the year, ending Sept. 30, bringing his total haul in direct fund raising to $26.5 million since he launched his campaign, and not including an even larger sum of $38 million raised from mega-donors by super PACs backing his candidacy. \nAccording to the Cruz campaign, it is receiving enough monthly income from 6,000 sustaining supporters to fully fund its national field operation. \nCruz’s fund raising total for the third quarter is twice Florida’s Sen. Marco Rubio’s for the period. \nBefore fund raising for the most recent quarter — which the campaigns must report to the Federal Election Commission by mid-month — Cruz had led all his rivals in direct “hard money” contributions, and was second to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in “soft money” super PAC fund raising. \nIt appears that Cruz will be supplanted by Dr. Ben Carson in hard money donations. The AP has reported that Carson has raised $20 million in the last three months. He had raised $10.6 million earlier in the year. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Bush has raised more in the third quarter than the $11.4 million he raised the last quarter, but it was not clear how much more. Meanwhile, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, whose campaign had raised $6.9 million by the end of June, raised a meager $2.5 million since, echoing his diminished standing in the polls. \nOn the less crowded Democratic side, Hillary Clinton raised $28 million in the third quarter, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders raised $26 million. \nCruz remains in the middle of the pack in the polls, but his money-raising suggests both grassroots support — his campaign reported it receved 185,000 contributions in the third quarter with an average donation of $66 — and the potential to mount a national campaign. \nDonald Trump, who is leading in the polls, is funding his own campaign from his fortune, and Carson, who generally runs second in the polls, also has ample resources. Carly Fiorina, whose standing has surged in the polls following two attention-grabbing debate performances, has not yet reported how much she raised in the third quarter. Rubio has also won renewed attention of late, but he has yet to match Cruz as a money-magnet. \n“We are thrilled to see a grassroots wave of support for our campaign gaining momentum all over the country,” Cruz said in a statement released by his campaign. “Not only are we seeing a surge of new donors and recurring donors to our campaign, but also continued growth of our organizations in the early states and all across the country. Americans are ready for real change, and I am ready to stand with them to take on the Washington Cartel and return power to the American people. We have both the financial and organizational resources to compete for the long haul and to take our optimistic message all across the country.” \nThe Cruz campaign reported that it has one or more donors from 58 percent of the zip codes in America, a 10 percent growth from the second quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:07:03.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
