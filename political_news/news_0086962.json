In Carson's view, the U.S. could assist financially, but not open its doors.\nCarson's comments echo Trump, who Thursday said, \"If I win, they're going back,\" referring to Muslim Syrian refugees.\nHowever, Carson has taken an increasingly skeptical view of Muslims in his public comments in recent days, as his political fortunes have improved. Carson now finds himself atop national Republican preference polls with Trump, and reported raising an impressive $20 million for his campaign in the third quarter of the year.\nCarson has also launched a petition challenging the tax exempt status of the largest Muslim advocacy group, part of an escalating rift with the U.S. Muslim community.\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations last month called for Carson to quit the presidential race after he said a Muslim should not serve as president. He has since clarified his position, stating he wouldn't support a radical Muslim who did not support the Constitution. And in a Thursday radio interview, Carson said the same standard should apply to a Supreme Court justice.\nCarson has repeatedly warned that officials needed to carefully screen for potential terrorist ties Syrian refugees seeking to enter the United States, but went further Friday.\nDespite anxiousness among some Republicans about the appearance of intolerance in a party trying to reach more minority voters, Carson's team has said publicly it works to his advantage in segments of the GOP electorate, especially in Iowa.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:34:17.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
