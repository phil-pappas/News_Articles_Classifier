It also shows photos of Stevens and three other Americans killed during the 2012 attacks. \nDemocrats on the House Benghazi committee condemned the ad and said Stevens' image was used without his family's permission. Democrats urged the panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy, to use his influence to get the ad removed immediately. \nDan Backer, treasurer of the anti-Clinton group, said the ad was designed to \"convey as powerful a message as possible\" about the tragedy and Clinton's possible role in it.
