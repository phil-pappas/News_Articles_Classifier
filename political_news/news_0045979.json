It remains unclear how the money was spent. \nThe Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, failed to deny that the Government had helped to get a state which carried out 79 executions in 2013 – three on people convicted of offences committed before they were 18 – into the UNHRC. \nMr Hammond told The Independent : “All sorts of people approach us and indeed this week all sorts of people have been approaching us about upcoming votes for different posts and we always listen politely to them and we always tell them the same thing: that we consider candidate on their merits... make our decisions in due course and we do not reveal either before a vote or after a vote our voting intentions or how we voted.” \nMembership of the UNHRC had enabled Saudi Arabia to spread its influence. Three months ago Faisal bin Hassan Trad, its UN envoy, was appointed to chair a team, giving him the responsibility for appointing of specialists. \nA day before his appointment was announced, Mr Trad denounced a UN report calling for member states to end the death penalty. A few weeks later, Saudi Arabia advertised for eight new executioners. \nThe figure for those executed by the Saudi state has risen to 137 this year, more, it is claimed, than those carried out by Isis. A Shia human rights activist, Ali al-Nimr, faces death by crucifixion after being convicted of taking part in an anti-government protest aged 17. \nAmnesty International UK’s head of policy and government affairs Allan Hogarth said: “If the UK is doing back-room deals with Saudi officials over human rights, this would be a slap in the face for those beleaguered Saudi activists who already struggle with endemic persecution in the Kingdom.” \nThis news was first published by independent.co.uk .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:57:58.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
