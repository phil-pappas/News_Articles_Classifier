Article said: Werner Toogood, of the Student Lettings Agency in Canterbury, launched legal action for unpaid rent after students felt unable to return to house where friend died The parents of three students who were too traumatised to return to their student digs after discovering a childhood friend dead in his room have been taken to court by the landlord over unpaid rent.The four young men had to seek counselling and psychiatric help after discovering their beloved friend Robert Chavda dead in January last year.Werner Toogood, who runs the Student Lettings Agency in Canterbury, Kent, sent a letter to Robert’s parents within a week of the 21-year-old's death offering them a two year repayment plan to cover his share of the rent for the rest of the academic year.Those costs were eventually waived by Mr Toogood, who runs 200 properties.But when Robert’s four housemates were too deeply affected to go back to the 1970s semi-detached property, and deferred their studies for a year, they were met with demands for more than £7,000 in rent, plus interest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:36:08.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
