(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) more > By SERGIO BUSTOS - Associated Press   \nDAVIE, Fla. (AP) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton says she will fight for stricter gun controls following this week’s deadly mass shooting at an Oregon community college. \nShe addressed the issue Friday while speaking at a community college in south Florida. She says Republicans have put the interests of the National Rifle Association “ahead of American families.” \nThe Democratic front-runner says there needs to be a “national movement” to counter the NRA’s influence in Washington. \nShe says she’s well aware that taking on the NRA means there is a “political mountain to climb.” But she adds that Americans “need to build a movement. It’s infuriating.” \nSpeaking at Broward College, Clinton says people should not have to be afraid to go to a college, a movie theater or Bible study. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:47:52.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
