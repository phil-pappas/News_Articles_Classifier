Dattu said that an apex court bench would consider the case on 26 October. He refused an early hearing of the case. CBI, represented by additional solicitor general P.S. Patwalia, had asked the court to consider the case initially on Friday.\nPatwalia told the court that the high court’s order restrained the CBI from pursuing all aspects of investigation. He said that the CBI would have to approach the high court for its permission before questioning Singh and his wife, taking them into custody, among other protections.\nThe Himachal high court on 1 October had protected Singh and his wife from arrest, but allowed the CBI to proceed with the inquiry, albeit with several conditions.\nPTI contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:57:51.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
