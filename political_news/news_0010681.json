Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Saturday. \"The fact is, his time is now.\" \nChristie said \"the 45-year-old construction worker who's trying to raise his family could care less.\" \n\"Real Americans do not care. They care about the Russians in Syria, Iran developing a nuclear weapon, 'I can't find a job,' 'my kid is loaded with student debt,' and these jokers inWashington, D.C., are talking about who's going to get the big office. ... That's why we need term limits and get these people out of here,\" he said. \nChristie also said the Federal Reserve should have raised rates a long time ago. \n\"It's bad because we have nothing left in the toolbox,\" he said. \"We've had the ... worst recovery from a recession since World War II.

You can't go below zero.\" \nThe Fed voted to keep interest rates at near-zero percent at its September meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:56:48.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
