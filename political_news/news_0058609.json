According to the sources, Turkish Foreign Minister Feridun SinirlioÄŸlu met the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey John Bass and Turkish diplomats met Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov. The envoys were warned about the sensitivities regarding Turkey's position on the PYD. On Wednesday, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu strongly criticized Washington's military aid to PYD that Ankara considered as the Syrian extension of the terrorist PKK organization. The U.S. distinguishes between the PYD and PKK and considers the PYD as a reliable partner in the fight against ISIS. It provided ammunition to the group last year while militants fought to liberate the Syrian town of Kobani from ISIS militants. \"Turkey will not accept any cooperation with terrorist groups fighting against Turkey. We have shared this with U.S. and Russia,\" Davutoglu said Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:38:50.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
