By Veronica Vanterpool Comments Email Print × \nThe New York metropolitan region was spared the worst of Hurricane Joaquin, but all the talk of storm preparedness got us thinking about what might happen if catastrophe struck again. Some components in the region’s transportation network are particularly vulnerable, but perhaps none more so than the rail tunnels beneath the Hudson River. \nThe century-old North River Tunnels serve about 200,000 New Jersey Transit and Amtrak passengers each day, but their condition is a daily threat to transport and commerce because of the damage they sustained from Superstorm Sandy. \nFortunately, there is hope for the Gateway project, which would include a new pair of tunnels connecting New York and New Jersey. Last month, Govs. Cuomo and Christie committed to paying for half of Gateway’s cost, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx recently announced that early planning is underway at the federal level. \nBut Gateway won’t be finished before 2025 , and according to the Port Authority, trans-Hudson commuter demand will increase by 50% over the next 25 years. Fortunately, we can help accommodate that demand before Gateway is complete. It might be helpful to look at measures taken for special events such as the Super Bowl and during emergencies such as Superstorm Sandy and 9/11: \nIncrease ferry service. Ferries are how people crossed the Hudson before we had any tunnels under the river, and a practical solution for getting across if another storm (or years of neglect) disabled the tunnels we now have. \nAdd Lincoln Tunnel bus lanes. The tunnel’s single exclusive bus lane opened in 1971, and still only serves eastbound commuters during the morning rush (even though just about as many people head west during the evening rush). That needs to change . The Port Authority installed a westbound exclusive bus lane for the Super Bowl in 2014. Let’s do it for commuters , every day. \nPrioritize buses. Remember the “bus bridge” over the East River after Superstorm Sandy? We shouldn’t have to wait for a natural disaster to get better bus service. Let’s convert some general travel lanes in the Holland Tunnel and on the George Washington Bridge to bus-only lanes. And since west-of-Hudson commuters also come into Manhattan from the north, why not bus-only, bus/HOV or high-occupancy toll lanes on the Tappan Zee Bridge? This would require (as my organization recommended in 2009) a coordinated effort between NJ Transit, the MTA, Transport of Rockland and Westchester County’s Bee-Line to expand bus service between Bergen, Rockland and Westchester counties and the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal. \nExpand Manhattan bus capacity. With more buses coming into Manhattan, and a Port Authority Bus Terminal at capacity since 1966 , there would be a need to reshuffle the way buses pick up and drop off passengers in the city. Perhaps NJ Transit buses would get exclusive access to the gates at the terminal, with intercity buses relocated to the back end of Moynihan Station or to curbside stations like the block of 34th Street where Megabus operates. Of course, finding all this new street space for bus operations would likely entail—gasp—losing some curbside parking. And speaking of reducing space for cars... \nBan single-occupant vehicles. Single-occupant vehicles are the least space-efficient means of moving people, especially in a place and time where road space is so limited. They were banned on Manhattan crossings for months following 9/11. It might seem a bit extreme today, but if the North River Tunnels went offline on short notice, this would be a useful congestion mitigation tool. \nLarge transit infrastructure projects are crucial but will cost billions of dollars and won’t deliver relief for at least another decade. For these reasons, New York must make policy decisions today to prioritize transit on our region’s roads, bridges, tunnels and waterways. While voices of opposition will be loud, we shouldn’t wait for a crisis to put practical and cost-effective mobility solutions in place to keep the region moving safely and efficiently. \nVeronica Vanterpool is executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit advocacy organization that promotes sustainable and equitable transportation throughout New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:15:26.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
