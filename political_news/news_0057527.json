Share article \nBut Mr McDonnell took to Twitter to make the announcement – another one seemingly taken without Shadow Cabinet approval – saying: “We are calling on Osborne to reverse his decision to cut tax credits. If he doesn't reverse these cuts, we're making it clear that we will.\" \nLast week, the Shadow Chancellor performed a dramatic u-turn to oppose the Government’s fiscal charter on balancing the nation’s books, an announcement some colleagues criticised because they were not told of the shift in policy beforehand.
