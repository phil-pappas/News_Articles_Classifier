Share article \n“What will my right honourable friend do to enable better use of this facility to allow provision of a minor injuries unit and a GP practice and more primary care?” \nMr Hunt replied: “Well she is right that regrettably the PFI projects under the last Labour Government did create a lot of unsustainable debt, but I know that her local Clinical Commissioning Group is meeting with GP practices and working with community health partnerships to see if they can progress the idea that she is campaigning for, and I hope to visit her in the near future to discuss it myself.” Promoted Stories Jeremy Hunt will visit Fareham Community Hospital after MP Suella Fernandes asked him to take action over service provision Sorry, an error occurred.

The NHS is struggling with existing services let alone expanding into new ones (which is needed). This Tory arrogant scum caused this unnecessary voluntary 'austerity' BS. Who's asking for austerity? That's right, no-one - just these Tory ****-tards! People who deal in government debt bonds are not asking for austerity, and government interest rates are still historically very low. We are being conned. Ohh, so it opened in 2010 when the ConDem lot came in, they cut funding in real terms while existing services see an increase in activity, and then says it is underused.
