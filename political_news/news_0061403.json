Listen / 0:59 \nAfter clashing with the Attorney general’s office and former Governor John Lynch over the state’s handling of FRM, Connolly resigned in 2010, and wrote a book accusing the state of a cover-up. \nHe then set up shop as an investment advisor. When Connolly spoke at last month’s New Hampshire Democratic Convention, he stressed his work policing the world of high finance. \n“Over an eight year period, an office of ten people we fined these banks, these Wall Street interests over 50 million dollars. We said no, not in New Hampshire.\" \nConnolly flirted with runs for U.S. Senate in 2010 and Governor in 2012. He confirms his plans for 2016 are more serious, but is deferring comment until later this month. \nHe joins Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern in the Democratic primary. \nOn the GOP side, executive Chris Sununu is running and State Rep Frank Edelbut, among others is considering running.
