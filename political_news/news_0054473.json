Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., will chair the new panel, and Boehner said her committee would \"have the resources and the subpoena power to get to the bottom of these horrific practices, and build on our work to protect the sanctity of all human life.\"\n  Major public-sector union AFSCME endorses Clinton A union for state and local government workers says she has the best chance among labor-friendly candidates.\nBy Sean Higgins • 10/23/15 1:41 PM Others on the panel are Reps. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania, Diane Black of Tennessee, Larry Bucshon of Indiana, Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, Andy Harris of Maryland, Vicki Hartzler of Missouri, and Mia Love of Utah.\nThe announcement stems from a series of undercover videos in which undercover members of an anti-abortion talked to Planned Parenthood staff, some of whom seemed to indicate the group may be profiting from the sale of fetal remains, which would be illegal.\nAs a result of the series of videos, Planned Parenthood announced they would no longer accept reimbursements for fetal tissue donations.\nThe creation of the new committee is likely to be one of Boehner's last major acts as House speaker. Boehner is hoping to retire a week from today, and Republicans will nominate a new speaker, likely Rep. Paul Ryan, on Wednedsay. The full House is expected to vote for a new speaker on Thursday.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Romney admits: 'Without Romneycare, I don't think we would have Obamacare' Romney explained that his signature achievement helped pave the way for the Affordable Care Act's passage\nBy Al Weaver • 10/23/15 2:01 PM Top Story House Republicans vote to repeal key pieces of Obama's health law House GOP   Obamacare.\n  11:59 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:42:07.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
