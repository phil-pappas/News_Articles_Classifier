However, its six-month growth rate has moderated considerably over the past six months. Meanwhile, the CEI continues to increase at a modest pace, and its six-month growth rate has improved. Taken together, the recent behavior of the composite indexes suggests that the current economic expansion should continue into next year, but the pace may moderate somewhat.\nAbout The Conference Board Leading Economic Index ® (LEI) for Spain\nThe composite economic indexes are the key elements in an analytic system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. The leading and coincident economic indexes are essentially composite averages of several individual leading or coincident indicators. They are constructed to summarize and reveal common turning point patterns in economic data in a clearer and more convincing manner than any individual component – primarily because they smooth out some of the volatility of individual components.\nThe six components of The Conference Board Leading Economic Index ® for Spain include:\nCapital Equipment Component of Industrial Production\nContribution to Euro M2\nStock Price Index\nLong-term Government Bond Yield\nOrder Books Survey\nJob Vacancies\nFor more information including full press release and technical notes:\nhttp://www.conference-board.org/data/bcicountry.cfm?cid=9\nFor more information about The Conference Board global business cycle indicators: http://www.conference-board.org/data/bci.cfm\nAbout The Conference Board\nThe Conference Board is an independent business membership and research association working in the public interest.
