Bernie Sanders. The announcement caps a week in which Sanders announced he had raised nearly as much money as Clinton during the past three months. \nThe union calls Clinton a \"strong leader who will do what is best for America's students.\" \nThe former secretary of state has won eight labor endorsements representing about 7 million workers, including the nation's two main teachers' unions. \nThe American Federation of Teachers endorsed Clinton during the summer.
