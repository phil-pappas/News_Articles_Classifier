Paul Ryan will agree to run for House speaker, Republican lawmakers Friday settled into the reality that it could be weeks, if not longer, before they find a candidate who can win enough votes to succeed John Boehner.\nRepublicans met privately Friday morning in the Capitol basement, a day after the unexpected announcement by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy that he was dropping out of the race for speaker in spite of his front-runner status. \"Everybody is upbeat, and looking forward to picking a speaker,\" said House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Pa.\nBut they admitted they lack a candidate who can win the support of their fractured conference.\nGOP lawmakers have been lobbying Ryan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to jump in the race. They told him he is the only Republican who can unite the fractured House GOP now that McCarthy dropped out of the race.\n  Seth Rogen to Ben Carson: 'F--- you' Rogen expressed his exasperation about Ben Carson's recent string of controversial comments.\nBy Joshua Axelrod • 10/09/15 5:19 PM But by Friday morning, Ryan remained a \"no,\" telling his fellow lawmakers the job would put too much strain on his family.\n\"He's decided not to do it, the way I understand it,\" House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas, said following the meeting.\nWith no immediate replacement for McCarthy, Republicans plan to go home Friday for the Columbus Day recess and deal with the speaker's race when they return.\nBoehner, the current speaker, said he will remain on the job until a successor is elected. He had planned to retire Oct. 30.\n\"I don't think Boehner is happy with Boehner sticking round for a while,\" said Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., a longtime member. \"But, one thing that is quite apparent is unless people unite behind a Republican speaker, Boehner will be sticking around for a while.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner House passes bill lifting oil export ban Lifting the oil export ban has become a major GOP priority.\nBy John Siciliano • 10/09/15 2:58 PM Lawmakers in the morning huddle described the mood as \"upbeat,\" and said the meeting included applause for Boehner, McCarthy and other GOP leaders. Lawmakers appeared to be recovering from the McCarthy decision to drop out, which nobody was expecting.\n\"I think people were so shocked when we adjourned, and confused,\" Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Missouri, said, describing Wednesday's announcement from McCarthy at an afternoon election that was expected to result in his nomination for speaker. \"It's been positive today. Much more so than yesterday.\"\nWagner said lawmakers are acknowledging they need to move quickly, but it could take time to find a speaker.\n\"Urgency doesn't mean today,\" Wagner said.\nLawmakers in the meeting focused on a plan to begin addressing rules changes conservatives are seeking in exchange for their support in an eventual election for speaker.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Pro-gun protestors greet Obama in Oregon Twitter became populated with pictures of demonstrators with signs with slogans like \"prayers not politics.\"\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/09/15 5:44 PM Sessions, House Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., will begin meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 20, to begin examining possible rules changes.\nConservatives have long complained that the GOP ignores \"regular order\" consideration of legislation and instead rushes bills to the floor without time to read them. Conservatives also complain about the top-down management style that shuts them out of participating in important decisions.\n\"It's a matter of let's go back to regular oder process of hearings, markups, scheduling and who can control that outcome,\" Sessions said.\nTop Story Book: Valerie Jarrett got Joe Biden 'psychiatric help' for 2016 Ed Klein's book claims   hard for Biden to enter the race.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/09/15 1:43 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:03:10.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
