In fact, The Clarion-Ledger has not editorialized one way or the other on Initiative 42. I called the anti-Initiative 42 ad a load of horse crap. I did so in a blog post. It’s my stance, not the stance of the newspaper or the editorial board. To say otherwise is misleading, and that’s why I’ve emailed the group behind the latest ad, and asked them to correct the ad or pull it. As for my previous post, I stand by it. That ad is a load of horse crap, regardless of what any partisan blogger wants to say about it.
