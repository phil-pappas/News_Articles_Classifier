He then brought down the very woman who charged him with doing it Geoffrey Howe in 1990 Photo: Rex Comments \nFew men have been as underestimated as Geoffrey Howe. Denis Healey described debating him as akin to being savaged by a dead sheep. He was softly spoken, for sure. But he was also one of the most successful statesman of his era with a good claim to having remade his country. Mrs T had lost it; it was time for her to go. But who had the guts to do it? Ironically, it was the very man who had made Thatcherism possible \nA lot’s been written since Healey’s death about the former Labour chancellor having introduced Monetarism and fiscal conservatism to 1970s Britain . It’s true that he was the man who first trialled it – but he couldn’t make it work. Why? Because a) he couldn't control wages without reforming union laws, b) he followed it with more spending and c) he wouldn’t endorse the deregulation necessary to generate private sector growth. All of that was thus left up to his successor, Geoffrey Howe. \nSir Geoffrey Howe, Chancellor of the Exchequer, opens a Gladstone budget box in 1981 Photo: PA \nHowe's infamous 1981 budget was so stringent that many criticised it within the cabinet and commentators predicted that it would lead to Margaret Thatcher’s downfall. He cut spending while allowing taxes to rise, defying wisdom that reflation was needed to tackle recession. A group of economists wrote an open letter damning it for having “no basis in economic theory or supporting evidence”. One Tory MP even crossed the floor to join the SDP. Howe’s economics contradicted Reagan’s programme in the United States. There the administration slashed taxes across the board while (albeit unwillingly) allowing spending to rise, specifically through defence appropriations. It’s hard to understate how radical, draconian and even shocking Howe’s approach was. Howe’s budgets brought misery to millions in the short-term. But in the long-term they created a framework for future prosperity \nHowe had good cause to say that it worked. By 1983, inflation had dramatically fallen and the economy was slowly growing again. It should be noted that the world was generally picking up and that productivity was improving because so many “inefficient” industries had gone under. But it was also thanks to Howe’s microeconomic reforms – such as deregulation and, slowly, de-nationalisation. Howe’s budgets brought misery to millions in the short-term. But in the long-term they created a framework for future prosperity. The markets saw that Britain was serious about reducing the size of the state and liberating the private sector to fill in the gap. This liberal economic programme became the template for much of the rest of the world, from New Zealand to Estonia. Arguably, it was made possible in Britain precisely because it was steered by a man of such incredible inner-calm. Howe never came across like a firebrand or fanatic, but like a bank manager simply doing what he had to do to keep the company afloat. \nGeoffrey Howe, left, and Margaret Thatcher \nWhich is why it’s astonishing that his other great contribution to British history was the product of pride. After serving as foreign secretary and deputy prime minister, he resigned in 1990 in part over Mrs Thatcher’s attitude towards Europe. In fact, he was quitting in protest at a regal style of government that no longer took cabinet collegiality seriously. Mrs T had lost it; it was time for her to go. But who had the guts to do it? Ironically, it was the very man who had made Thatcherism possible back in 1981: Geoffrey Howe. His speech in the Commons, delivered with all the rhetorical force of a light snore, was devastating. That is the way an English assassination should be: calm, reasonable and conducted in broad daylight. \nGeoffrey Howe remade his country. Few chancellors can so rival their prime minister as he did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:12:09.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
