Headlines blast President Obama for letting Vladimir Putin outmaneuver him. At the UN, they criticized Obama because he let the Russian President ‘steal his thunder’ . In Ukraine, Russian backed rebels will be coming to the table with government representatives and international mediators to hammer out an accord. In Syria, Russian aircraft are striking US-backed rebels to support government forces while Iranian troops prepare for operations against them. Is Russia all over the news because Putin and his allies are eclipsing American power? \nA year after the Minsk protocol was agreed to implement a ceasefire in Eastern Ukraine and nine months after an agreement to withdraw heavy weapons was finalized, a lull in fighting finally seems to be holding. In another step for peace, government and rebel forces agreed earlier this week to a deal to move small arms weapons away from the frontline. Optimism aside, this comes just days after Russia moved heavy incendiary artillery systems into the country . In all likelihood both sides are using the time to prepare for the resumption of fighting. Ukrainian commanders attest that they believe the rebels are doing so , and no doubt with increasing Russian aid. \nThese developments are being overshadowed by Russian moves in Syria, where Putin has ordered the launch of a bombing campaign against the enemies of embattled President Assad. Far from targeting ISIS militants and territories, the Russian military has so far bombed civilian areas and western-backed rebels . The West has responded by calling on Putin to halt the bombing of non-ISIS targets . These public statements are doing little to dissuade Assad’s coalition from acting as they please, and the flood of hundreds of Hezbollah and Iranian troops to support government forces under Russian air cover speaks volumes to this. \nOn a quick reading Putin is staying ahead of the United States. He’s outmanoeuvring and outwitting Obama. He’s expanding Russian influence and beating down perceptions of the United States as the premier world state. He has eclipsed American power time and again. \nUnfortunately, all of this overlooks the fact that Putin is digging Russia into an economic grave. \nRussia is facing a litany of market issues. Economic sanctions from the west are constricting international trade and have locked down sizeable portions of Russian oligarch funds. The rest of the population has been hit by tightening credit lines and falling wages. The ruble has tumbled along with oil prices and the Russian budget has not accounted for the loss. This downturn comes amid years of growing military expenditures that are putting increasing pressure on the Russian economy. These expenditures are not accounting for military ventures into Ukraine or into the Syrian Civil War. \nThe tallying dollar and social cost of mounting two military adventures could easily balloon into a problem that Putin can’t outmaneuver. Any growth in dissatisfaction may be a few months off at least, and while Putin has a well-financed cluster of oligarchs to draw on for support, it’s unclear how soon the economic troubles and the new recession will bleed his support. Over one hundred of these billionaire oligarchs, “control 35 percent of the wealth in a country of more than 142 million people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:32:32.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
