I think this should be made clear,' the former president noted, adding that the EC is accountable to the people of Ghana from whom it derives its power. \nSpeaking on the mounting demand for a replacement of the register, he said 'People demanding needn't even be the majority…if truly some sections feel that they need to be sure of the quality of the vote….then those people should be entitled and the Electoral Commission is accountable to the people generally.' \nFormer President John Agyekum Kufuor is the latest high profile personality to join the growing list of supporters for a new voter register. \nHis explanation about the limitation of the EC's powers and its subservience to Ghanaians comes at the heels of a similar one by Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings, former first lady, who said that it is not for Charlotte Osei, EC Chairperson, to determine whether Ghanaians deserve a new register or not. \nFormer President Rawlings had also stated: 'If a new voter register will restore confidence, let's do it. As a sitting government I think if we feel pretty confident about that register, we should have no fears in doing what needs to be done to win the confidence…to take away doubts.' \nMr Kufuor could not have given a better assurance of his support to the new register crusaders than when he told them that “I am with you entirely, completely that the Electoral Commission should not plead excuses like cleaning the voter register.' \nThe EC, he said, could not be independent from accounting to the people of Ghana, explaining that he had seen what faulty polls had wreaked on countries where these had gone on. \n'I have seen what faulty elections can do to otherwise peaceful people. So the Electoral Commission should listen,' he charged. \nAs a former president who has undertaken countless international assignments bordering on polls and the enhancement of democratic cultures, especially on the African continent, Mr JA Kufuor said he has witnessed at firsthand the effects of incredible polls. \nHis remarks, steeped in experience, are highly respected in the international community of democratic nations and organisations. \nIn Nigeria, he played a crucial role in getting Goodluck Jonathan to accept the reality of a lost election when it dawned during Nigeria's recent election. \nThe LMVCA pressure group, armed with the discovery of a number of lapses in the voter register used for the last polls such as the said insertion of 76,000 foreigners, has not rested on its oars as it demands the replacement of the roll call of voters. \nBy A.R.
