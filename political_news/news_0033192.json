Credit Stephen Yang for The New York Times Carl Icahn , the billionaire businessman who is supporting Donald J. Trump for president, is starting a “ super PAC ” with an “initial commitment of $150 million” that will focus on corporate tax reform. Mr. Icahn posted his news to Twitter on Wednesday morning. “I am starting a Super PAC with my initial commitment of $150 million to help end the crippling dysfunction in Congress,” Mr. Icahn wrote in a post on Twitter. 1/2 I am starting a Super PAC with my initial commitment of $150 million to help end the crippling dysfunction in Congress — Carl Icahn (@Carl_C_Icahn) October 21, 2015 “I have therefore sent the following letter to the relevant committees and leaders of Congress,” he added, linking to the letter, in which he said he wanted to end so-called “corporate tax inversions” that took place when companies left the United States. “While I plan to raise third-party funds, I believe my own commitment of $150 million to the PAC will be more than enough to make voters fully aware of the horrible consequences that will ensue if Congress fails to pass legislation immediately to stop these ‘inversions,’” Mr. Icahn wrote. That amount is bigger than anything that any other super PAC devoted to a candidate has raised so far this cycle. He wrote that he had spoken with both Senator Chuck Schumer , Democrat of New York, who is expected to becoming the new Senate minority leader after the 2016 elections, and Representative Paul D. Ryan , the Wisconsin Republican currently weighing whether to seek the post of speaker of the House. Tue.
