(M. Spencer Green / AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nSenate Democrats are preparing a legislative push to curb guns, a week after a mass shooting at an Oregon community college refocused attention on the nation's toll of firearms deaths. \nRepublicans controlling Congress have shown scant interest in restricting guns and the Democratic effort has little chance of success. But their drive could keep the issue alive during next year's elections, driving up support from sympathetic voters and contributors while complicating GOP senators' re-election campaigns in some closely divided states. \nIn a letter to fellow Democrats, Sens. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., wrote that their effort \"will be a rallying point for a public that is eager for congressional action and will be the basis for future legislation that we will demand\" receives a Senate vote. \nDemocrats would use procedural delays to thwart legislation if Republicans refuse to allow votes on the gun proposals, a Democratic aide said Wednesday who wasn't authorized to discuss the plans publicly and requested anonymity. Schumer and Stabenow are leaders of Senate Democrats' messaging efforts. \nDemocrats said their effort would include broadening federal background checks, now required only for sales by federally licensed firearms dealers, to cover all purchases at gun shows and online. A bipartisan version of that plan, opposed by the National Rifle Association, was blocked in 2013 by Republicans and a few Democrats, months after the fatal shooting of 20 students and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:14:04.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
