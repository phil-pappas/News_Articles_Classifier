Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) is endorsing Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) for Speaker of the House of Representatives. Gutierrez, perhaps the most extreme open-borders advocate in Congress, was interviewed on MSNBC.\nAs CNN is now reporting , “Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez on MSNBC called Ryan one of the smartest men in the GOP. ‘He would be good for the country,’ Gutierrez said. ‘He would be good for the Republican Party. Paul Ryan is the kind of individual that would work with people on the other side of the aisle and that’s what we need.'”\nGutierrez has worked tirelessly to expand immigration levels and open America’s borders up to the rest of the world. As Gutierrez once declared , “I have only one loyalty…and that’s to the immigrant community.”\nGutierrez and Paul Ryan have been longtime partners on efforts to open Americans borders. Indeed, Paul Ryan is arguably the most pro-amnesty GOP lawmaker in Congress, and even supports expanding immigration levels beyond many Democrats.\nMany amnesty opponents believe that if Ryan had been House Speaker, rather than Rep. John Boehner (R-OH) , the Gang of Eight bill would have been sent to President Obama’s desk.\nAs NumbersUSA’s Director of Government Relations told Breitbart News : “A vote for Paul Ryan is a vote for Gang of Eight style amnesty that includes massive increases in legal immigration and replacing American workers with foreign-born workers. A vote for Paul Ryan is a vote to continue Obama’s transformation of America.”\nLuis Gutierrez has called Paul Ryan his “ good friend ” and “ guiding light ” on immigration. Gutierrez’s glowing comments are featured on Ryan’s website to this day.\nAs Politico reported in 2012, “Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said Wednesday that Paul Ryan had reached across the aisle to work with him on immigration reform and added that the Wisconsin Republican told him, “I want to do it because it’s the right thing.”\nIn 2013, Guterriez described Ryan as his ally in Gutierrez’s goal to “free” the illegal immigrant community: “When I sit down and talk to people, I clear the table, so I can see Paul Ryan not as budget chairman… but as a friend and an ally to free 11 million people.”\nIndeed, Paul Ryan helped craft the House Republican Immigration Principles that doomed Eric Cantor’s congressional career and whipped votes for Obama’s amnesty plan. Ryan also opposed Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) ’ effort to kill the Gang of Eight bill. When then-Ranking Member Jeff Sessions exposed how the Gang of Eight bill would cost American taxpayers trillions, Ryan used his Budget Committee prestige in the House to argue that an influx of poor immigrants would somehow reduce the deficit.\nAs Conservative Review’s Daniel Horowitz recently wrote, “There is nobody around in the party who is more fanatically dedicated to the cause of open borders than Paul Ryan.” Ryan has even campaigned for amnesty with Gutierrez.\nA Congressional aide told Breitbart News, “Putting Paul Ryan’s finger on the nuclear switch when it comes to open borders is one of the most terrifying thoughts imaginable. It’s no different than giving La Raza control over whether America has a border.” If Ryan became speaker, he would have unilateral control over whether amnesty and immigration-expansion legislation came up for a vote.\nAmerica’s foreign-born population is at an all-time record high of more than 42 million, but Ryan has argued that America faces labor shortages unless even more poor immigrants are provided to wealthy CEOs.\nRyan has similarly come under criticism for busting federal budget caps, pushing through spending and debt increases, having been “ shredded ” by Joe Biden in the Vice Presidential 2012 debate, and being one of the central architects of Obamatrade.\nIn what may come to be regarded as one of American political history’s greatest ironies, a revolt which began with the unseating of Majority Leader Eric Cantor would result in the installment of his intellectual soulmate, Paul Ryan, as Speaker of the House.\nHowever, whereas Gutierrez criticized Cantor for not being open borders enough, he has endorsed his longtime ally Paul Ryan. Whereas a Pelosi speakership would likely make an amnesty compromise between a GOP senate and Democrat House impossible, if Ryan wields the gavel, the Gang of Eight – or something just like it – could very quickly come back to life.\nAs Ryan once told the pro-amnesty Hispanic Chamber of Commerce “To me, it’s not a question of ‘if’ we fix our broken immigration laws… it’s really a question of ‘when.’”\nRead more at Breitbart.com .", "external_links": ["http://paulryan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=343411", "http://www.businessinsider.com/vp-debate-poll-biden-wins-ryan-2012-10", "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/ryan-immigration-a-question-of-when-105042#ixzz3o5X4X4sX", "http://www.breitbart.com/", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/09/vote-paul-ryan-vote-amnesty-luis-gutierrez-endorses-paul-ryan-speaker/", "http://www.newsweek.com/pushing-obama-immigration-reform-70093", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/09/politics/house-speaker-race-paul-ryan/", "http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/immigration-reform-luis-gutierrez-says-ryan-wants-immigration-reform-084631#ixzz3o530pRTj", "http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2015/10/will-paul-ryan-be-the-next-speaker-i-hope-not.php"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:54:59.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
