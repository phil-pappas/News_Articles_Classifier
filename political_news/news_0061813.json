I’ll leave the irony to just sit there a while. They posted their hatred and all over the Internet and attempted to impact her livelihood by encouraging readers to shun her books – all because she dared have an opinion that we don’t need agendas in books.\nRosoff isn’t the first author bullied by social justice warriors, and she certainly won’t be the last. Remember my friend and author Brad Torgersen being accused of using his African-American wife and biracial daughter as “ shields ” for his alleged “racism?”\nRemember the Internet assault on science fiction great Neil Gaiman for daring to not toe the line on trigger warnings?\nAnd I won’t even get into the vile attacks on Larry Correia and Sarah A. Hoyt, with the latter being called everything from stupid to a white, Mormon male.\nAnd it’s not just the Internet bullying. It’s the rudeness and attacks on those who don’t walk the SJW walk. Remember Tor editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden unprofessionally screaming at one of Tor’s authors, because he happened to be angry with her husband? Remember Tor employee Irene Gallo calling the Sad Puppies extreme right-wing to neo-nazis? Remember the “ no award ” at WorldCon this year – a block vote by SJWs to keep the “undesirables” away from the Hugo awards?\nIt’s unfortunate that there seem to be more and more women bullying others on the Internet. I noted with no small amount of sadness that the majority of the attacks on Rosoff came from women. I wonder if this is an attempt to compensate for decades of inequalities – both perceived and real – by flexing their figurative muscles against those they allege to be the “oppressors” and getting even.\nI also have noticed that the men who support these types of SJW agendas tend to be petty, less than masculine, screechy, and self-flagellating. Remember, science fiction author John Scalzi is living his life on the lowest difficulty setting as a while male. But hey, he’s appropriately guilty about it, so he’s not just accepted in the militant SJW circles, but revered for attacking others who don’t conform to his perception of being a white male in the developed world.\nRemember the pedantic, sniffy, pedo-apologist Phildo Sandifer ? He’s another one who humps the white privilege carcass like a dog that desperately needs to be neutered.\nOK, but let’s be clear: Cecil the Lion is about race too. It’s 100% about colonialism and white privilege.\n— Phil Sandifer (@PhilSandifer) July 29, 2015\nPhil once engaged me on Facebook in a gun control discussion, and as soon as he realized his usual gun-grabber rhetoric wasn’t going to fly with me, he proceeded to claim he was terrified that people like me actually owned guns, and that I am one of the reasons he wants gun control. That makes me giggle. I’m female. I’m relatively strong for a female; I’m an Army veteran, after all. But physically, I’m no match for a fairly strong guy. I know this. I accept this. I carry, because it’s my right, and because as a female, I understand I’m no match for many thugs. Phil had no problem admitting that he was scared of little ole me, because in the absence of any common sense regarding guns, he reverted to advertising how weak and cowardly he was!\nArthur Chu, whom I mentioned above as the fetid sack of rancid crap that attacked Brad Torgersen, is another one of these screeching pseudo male cowards . His odious history of attacking everyone who doesn’t agree with him is well-known and documented.\nThese pseudo-males remind me of howler monkeys . They can’t compete in the arena of physical prowess, so they compensate with loud, obnoxious screeching.\nIn his 1871 book on evolutionary theory called “The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex”, Charles Darwin posited that sexual selection was determined in two main ways: through combat, or through display. For those animals who win mates by means of mating displays, those characteristics that are more likely to win a mate come at a cost to the animal. For instance, the peacock’s tail feathers hinders its mobility. In other words, there’s a trade-off.\nFor male howler monkeys, that trade-off is an unusual one. The larger their vocal organs, a new study has found, the smaller their testes and the lower their sperm count. The research has been published in the journal Current Biology .\n“We have strong evidence that howler monkey species that invest in larger vocal organs produce less sperm,” said lead author Jacob Dunn of the University of Cambridge.\nThe resemblance is stunning. The SJW howlers are generally effeminate and loud. They attack ideological opponents and are sometimes rewarded by SJW females shrieking harpies with attention or affection. They don’t have the intellectual strength, self assurance, or the testicular fortitude to approach and have relationships with real women , so they choose to screech, howl, and holler in order to attract the kind of woman who appreciates the ability to compensate for weakness with bullying, cowardly attacks – mostly from the safety of a keyboard.\n“Male” SJWs and perpetual offendapotomi in their natural habitat.\nThey have no problem with bullying others, because a) it’s safe to do so as a keyboard commando, and b) the females who claim to be perpetually offended appreciate the attacks for the illusion of “strength” they provide. It’s not that these “men” are strong protectors of their perspective mates. It’s more like they’re obsequious seekers of their affections, and the Internet provides a perfect megaphone for them to flex their cyber vocal chords in a sad attempt to gain female attention.\nAnd it’s not that these alleged “feminists” seek out actual strong men as mates; hell, from what I’ve seen they actually prefer the pseudo-males they can bully into defending their sometimes outrageous positions! They just like having these spineless pimples around, because then they don’t have to put any real effort into a relationship with a strong, independent, intelligent man, who wants an intellectual match – a rational, emotionally strong woman.\nThey can just have the howler monkey with the shriveled testes, who will bow to their will, and pretend.\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\nFiled under: social justice warriors Tagged: Arthur Chu , feminism , howler monkeys , John Scalzi , social justice warriors", "external_links": ["http://thelibertyzone.com/2015/10/03/modern-woman-a-response-to-the-nyts-modern-man-list/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/tag/arthur-chu/", "https://thelibertyzone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/howler-monkeys.jpg?w=500&#038;h=375", "http://thelibertyzone.wordpress.com//feed/https://thelibertyzone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/howler-monkeys.jpg", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://dailycaller.com/2015/02/18/brave-jeopardy-man-arthur-chu-takes-a-stand-against-helping-abused-porn-star-and-family/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/category/social-justice-warriors/", "http://theralphretort.com/arthur-chu-knew-rapists-didnt-say-anything/", "http://thelibertyzone.wordpress.com//feed/https://popehat.com/2015/09/29/arthur-chu-would-like-to-make-lawyers-richer-and-you-quieter-and-poorer/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/tag/social-justice-warriors/", "http://thelibertyzone.wordpress.com//feed/https://www.google.com/search?q=gaiman%20attack%20trigger&#038;cad=h", "http://theralphretort.com/arthur-chu-sinks-even-lower-2016015/", "http://www.cnet.com/news/compensating-loudest-howler-monkeys-have-the-tiniest-knackers/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://whatever.scalzi.com/2012/05/15/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is/", "http://www.scifiwright.com/2015/08/in-memoriam-of-the-hugo-awards/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://theralphretort.com/arthur-chu-leads-sjw-sperg-out-over-gamergate-sxsw-threatens-boycott-1022015/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://thelibertyzone.wordpress.com//feed/https://twitter.com/arthur_affect/status/585635584070262784", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/tag/feminism/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/2015/09/06/phil-sandifer-doubling-down-on-the-stupid/", "http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thelibertyzone.com&#038;blog=27856414&#038;post=5214&#038;subd=thelibertyzone&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/2015/09/02/smells-like-pedo-bear/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/2015/10/12/the-unbearable-racism-of-social-justice-warrior-jerks/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/2015/08/25/to-burn-or-not-to-burn/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/tag/john-scalzi/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/tag/howler-monkeys/", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.09.029", "http://www.teleread.com/chris-meadows/sad-puppies-roundup-and-the-irene-gallo-controversy/", "http://thelibertyzone.wordpress.com//feed/https://twitter.com/PhilSandifer/status/626515393662857216", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5214/"], "published": "2015-10-23T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:59:30.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
