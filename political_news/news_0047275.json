(AP Photo/Jacques Brinon)\nAssociated Press Oct. 9, 2015 | 4:28 a.m. EDT + More PARIS (AP) â€” Air France is resuming negotiations with pilots' unions over hotly contested job cuts, and Paris garbage collectors have ended a smelly strike, soothing developments at the end of a week of high labor tensions.\nFrustration over spending reductions erupted into violence earlier this week as union activists ripped clothes off Air France executives. The leading pilots' union, SNPL, said talks are resuming Friday with management about a sweeping cost-cutting plan that involves 2,900 job losses at France's money-losing flagship airline.\nAir France would not comment.\nIn a separate labor dispute that left Paris streets crowded with overflowing trash cans, city officials and waste workers' unions reached an agreement Thursday night, ending a four-day strike. City hall said it agreed to raise pay for certain workers and consider expanding promotion opportunities.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
