Dominion East Ohio periodically reviews the budget amount and adjusts it, if necessary, so that the customer will not have a high balance or large credit at the end of the budget year. Customers should call Dominion East Ohio for more information. Current-Plus Plan: Customers with a past-due balance pay their current monthly bill, plus 1/6 th of the total account balance at the time they enroll in the plan.

Shortâ€“Term Extension grants up to five additional days to pay before the next bill date. Medical Certification Program can delay a shutoff when it would be especially dangerous to the health of a permanent member of the household. It allows time to get financial help or make payment arrangements. It does not reduce the amount owed. A medical certification form can be requested by calling 1-800-362-7557. A licensed medical professional must sign the form. A medical professional can apply by phone, provided that Dominion East Ohio receives the written notification within seven days. If gas service is off, the signed form must be returned within 21 days of the shut-off date to restore service.\nGovernment Assistance Programs\nThe following programs are available for income-eligible customers. Customers can apply for all programs with one application at www.energyhelp.ohio.gov . Applications also are available at post offices and libraries or by calling 1-800-282-0880.\nThe Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) has issued its annual Winter Reconnection Order , which allows any Dominion East Ohio residential customer to restore service or to avoid a shutoff between October 19, 2015 , and April 15, 2016 , by paying $175 . Under the order, customers, who have had service disconnected, can have their service restored by paying the amount they owe Dominion, or $175 , whichever is less. A reconnect fee of $33 , plus applicable taxes, also will be billed to the account if the service has been disconnected. There is no income eligibility requirement to use this program, and customers will be enrolled in a payment plan to help pay off any additional past-due balance.

Under PIPP Plus, participating customers may maintain their natural gas service by paying 6 percent of their total gross monthly household income, or $10 , whichever is greater. PIPP Plus has special benefits for participating customers. Each time customers make their required PIPP Plus monthly payments in full by the due date, Dominion East Ohio will credit their accounts for the rest of that month's current charges, plus a 1/24 th credit toward their prior account balances. After 24 months of on-time and in-full PIPP Plus payments, their accounts would become current.\nAlong with lower payments and balance crediting, PIPP Plus also carries the following responsibilities:\nCustomers will have 30 days from their PIPP Plus anniversary date to make up any missed payments, or they will be removed from PIPP Plus. NOTE: Income-eligible customers interested in re-enrolling or maintaining participation in PIPP Plus must pay any remaining plan arrears in excess of $175 with their first bill following the $175 payment. If participating customers do not re-verify their gross monthly household income once every 12 months, they will be removed from PIPP Plus. Customers can re-verify sooner if their household size or income changes. Customers who no longer meet PIPP Plus income guidelines, and still have a balance, can enroll in the Graduate PIPP program . This plan allows any outstanding balance to be paid within 12 months of leaving the PIPP Plus plan. Incentive credits also are applied for on-time and in-full payments. The PIPP Plus maximum yearly household gross income levels for the 2015-2016 heating season are higher than last year. For example, for a single person, the maximum income limit is $17,655 ; $23,895 for two people; $30,135 for three; $36,375 for four; $42,615 for five; $48,855 for six; $55,095 for seven; and $61,335 for eight.
