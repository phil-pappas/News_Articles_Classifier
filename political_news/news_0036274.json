The last budget year ended with at least a $100 million deficit. On top of that, the Medicaid program is $300 million short. Almost everything in the budget is protected from cuts except colleges and universities, which have lost more than a third of their state funding since 2008. That has weakened what should be one of our greatest economic strengths.\nFoolishly, the state has gone on a tax credit spree. Louisiana is giving away $7 billion each year in credits, rebates and exemptions with virtually no scrutiny.\nThese aren't new problems. But the governor's misplaced priorities and lack of leadership over the past seven years have only worsened them.\nWe can't go on like this. Our state needs a committed, resolute chief executive with a desire to govern and a plan to lead on many fronts.\nDavid Vitter is that leader.\nHe is a veteran of the state Legislature, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. In each of them, he has fought against the good-old-boy status quo. He succeeded in passing legislation to limit how many terms Louisiana lawmakers can serve. That was no small feat. Few lawmakers were eager to let go of the chance for a lifetime spot in the State House.\nHe also has stood up for his constituents.\nHurricane Katrina and the levee breaches that flooded 80 percent of New Orleans occurred soon after Sen. Vitter was elected to his first term in the Senate. He fought to hold the Army Corps of Engineers accountable for the levee failures and to get recovery resources for South Louisiana, including essential funding for coastal restoration. He was a leader in forcing the corps to close the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet , which destroyed or damaged 600,000 acres of wetlands and worsened flooding during Katrina.\nThat background will make him particularly suited to guide Louisiana's coastal restoration efforts as governor. His understanding of how Washington works and his connections there should help the state maximize federal resources for its $50 billion coastal master plan.\nThere is arguably no more important issue for South Louisiana than shoring up the coast. Lives depend on it, and Sen. Vitter knows that.\nOur next governor also will need to present a clearly articulated plan to lift Louisiana out of its fiscal mess and to execute that plan in the face of opposition from powerful special interests. Sen. Vitter has said he wants to remove protections for most spending categories in the budget and eliminate excessive tax credits, exemptions and deductions.\nHe will need two-thirds of the Legislature on his side to do much of that. We are convinced that Sen. Vitter, having witnessed the paralysis of government in Washington, will understand the need to build consensus while not giving in to the forces that keep us mired in mediocrity.\nDespite a reputation for going his own way, he has shown an ability to work collaboratively. He did that as lead Republican sponsor on the $12.3 billion Water Resources Development Act, which passed in 2014. It was the first water resources bill to be signed by a president in 14 years, and it included major projects for our state.\nLouisiana has made remarkable progress in reforming education and improving the choices and outcomes for students, particularly in New Orleans. A strong, principled state education superintendent has been a key to our success. The next governor must build on these achievements.\nSen. Vitter promises to add seats in high-quality preschool programs, focus on improving basic skills like reading, increase skills training at the high school level and trim Louisiana's school administration costs. He also must ensure that the state keeps standards high and that students are measured against their peers in other states.\nHaving grown up in metro New Orleans, Sen. Vitter instinctively understands the importance of New Orleans as an economic engine for the state and its potential as a world-class city nearing its tricentennial. He also understands the severity of New Orleans' crime problem and the role the state can play in solving it.\nHe has pledged to create a new State Police troop in New Orleans for policing the city's tourist district and to offer state training for city police. Those would be important resources for the city.\nPublic safety is only one way in which the state and city could work together, and the governor and mayor need to have a collaborative and cordial relationship. Sen. Vitter and Mayor Mitch Landrieu both need to ensure that happens.\nThe Louisiana governorship is an inherently powerful position. That's all the more reason why the leadership vacuum we have suffered under the current governor is such a waste.\nSen. Vitter's highest ambition is to lead this state as its governor. He promises to be devoted to that job, to work hard and to be reachable. We take him at his word, and we believe he has the ideas, the experience and the skills to help Louisiana thrive.\nDavid Vitter interview Gubernatorial candidate David Vitter answers questions during an interview with NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune.", "external_links": ["http://house.louisiana.gov/housefiscal/DOCS_TAXREV/TaxStudyInformation3102015.pdf", "http://www.vitter.senate.gov/"], "published": "2015-10-11T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:26:43.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
