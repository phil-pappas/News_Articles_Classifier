But the attacks were in western Syria, far from Isis strongholds, suggesting that the aim was to shore up Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

Syrian rebel groups said Russian targets included US-backed forces. \nThe US, which was informed in advance of the strikes, criticised the attacks, which have created more uncertainties for the US-led coalition that has been fighting Isis in Syria and Iraq for the last year. \n“Fighting Isil without pursuing a parallel political transition only risks escalating the civil war in Syria and with it the very extremism and instability that Moscow claims to be concerned about and aspire to fighting,” Mr Carter added. “That approach is tantamount . . . to pouring gasoline on the fire.” \nFrance and the UK also warned Moscow not to attack other rebel factions. \nThe Russian air strikes add another unpredictable factor to the multipronged civil war in Syria, which has claimed more than 300,000 lives and created millions of refugees, thousands of whom are trying to enter Europe . \nAccording to Hizbollah , the Shia militant group allied with Mr Assad, Russian warplanes hit the towns of Talbisa, Rastan, Zaafaraniya and Makramiya near Homs. A US official said the target of the first Russian air strikes appeared to have been near Homs. \nManar, Hizbollah’s television channel, said the Russian air force targeted arms caches, ammunition, other military hardware and fuel belonging to “terrorist organisations” in Syria. \nOne of the Russian targets was Tajamaa al-Ezza (Dignity Gathering), a rebel group assisted by the international joint operations room in Jordan, a military co-operation body that includes the US. \nJamil al-Saleh, one of the group’s commanders, said its positions in Hama were hit after nearly a week of what he said were Russian reconnaissance flights in the areas. \n“Each strike was 10 rockets, done by four planes and covered by one reconnaissance jet. The first strike hit the Latamneh area and had mostly civilian casualties. The second hit our headquarters near the front. There was heavy damage and eight wounded but none of our fighters were killed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:11:28.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
