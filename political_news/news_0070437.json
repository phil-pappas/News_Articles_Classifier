(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) By Editorial Board October 23 at 6:15 PM VIRGINIA’S LEGISLATIVE elections are Nov. 3. The following is the second and final batch of The Post’s endorsements in Northern Virginia’s most competitive races for the House of Delegates. Endorsed candidates appear in bold type. (Our first group of picks was published in Friday’s edition . Our picks in the region’s key state Senate races appeared earlier.)\nTo determine your legislative district and candidates on your ballot, go to www.1.usa.gov/1jD5q2i .\nDistrict 32 . In a rematch of a 2013 race, the incumbent Republican , Thomas A. “Tag” Greason , faces the Democrat he narrowly beat, Elizabeth Amy Miller . We think Mr. Greason, a darling of the National Rifle Association, is wrong on a range of social issues as well as Medicaid expansion. But he’s also proved himself an effective lawmaker on measures that attract bipartisan backing, including a bill to extend insurance coverage to autistic children and to rationalize test-taking in public schools.\nWhile Ms. Miller is a solid and serious candidate, Mr. Greason, a pragmatist, deserves reelection. He proved educable by ditching his initial opposition to raising taxes and embracing the biggest tax increase in Virginia history, to fund transportation improvements, in 2013.\nDistrict 34 . Democrat Kathleen J. Murphy , a retired federal official who narrowly beat Republican Craig A. Parisot , a consultant, in a special election for this seat in January faces him again. Although new to the House, Ms. Murphy has taken gutsy, outspoken stands by pushing measures to expand background checks on gun buyers and limit gun sales to violent domestic abusers. Mr. Parisot, an Air Force veteran, is highly scripted as a campaigner but seems reluctant to offer more than boilerplate on the issues.\nDistrict 86 . Republican Raul “Danny” Vargas , a business owner who has been instrumental in lobbying for transportation improvements in the Dulles area, is one of the region’s more impressive first-time candidates for the House of Delegates in recent memory. An Air Force veteran with broad corporate experience, he has led the state’s Board of Workforce Development and is authoritative on education and training issues, among others. His Democratic opponent, Jennifer B. Boysko , is also an excellent candidate — a committed and knowledgable local activist who worked for years on the staff of Fairfax County Supervisor John Foust. But she cannot offer Mr. Vargas’s breadth of knowledge on statewide questions.\nDistrict 87 . Democrat John J. Bell , a retired Air Force officer and now a financial consultant, is substantive, thoughtful, informed, detail-oriented and an excellent candidate to fill the open seat in this highly diverse district centered around Dulles International Airport in Loudoun County. His Republican opponent, Chuong D. Nguyen , also has impressive credentials — having emigrated as a boy from Vietnam , he was a high school teacher and coach and a prosecutor before opening a private law practice. But Mr. Bell, who came within a hair’s breadth of winning the seat two years ago, has the edge by dint of his broader and deeper familiarity with the district’s issues.\nRead more about this topic:\nThe Post’s View: For Virginia’s House of Delegates\nThe Post’s View: For Virginia’s state Senate\nThe Post’s View: Sharon Bulova for chairman in Fairfax\nThe Post’s View: For Fairfax Board of Supervisors", "external_links": ["http://www.craigparisot.com/", "http://www.chuongfordelegate.com/meet-chuong.html", "http://www.murphyfordelegate.com/", "http://www.elizabethmillerfordelegate.com/", "http://www.jenniferboysko.com/", "http://virginiageneralassembly.gov/house/members/members.php?id=H0218", "http://www.johnbellfordelegate.com/", "http://vargasforvirginia.com/", "http://www.chuongfordelegate.com/", "https://voterinfo.sbe.virginia.gov/PublicSite/Public/FT2/PublicElections.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:20:44.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
