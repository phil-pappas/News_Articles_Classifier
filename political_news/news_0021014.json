We Informed Carson But He Was Sleeping.'\"\n“Ben Carson is leading Iowa supposedly. Ben Carson is super low energy. We need tremendous energy,\" Trump continued, recycling an attack he’s used repeatedly on Jeb Bush.\nThe polls in question , conducted by Quinnipiac University's Peter Brown and Des Moines-based J. Ann Selzer, showed Carson ahead of Trump by 8 and 9 percentage points, respectively.\nBut Trump was having none of it.\n“I don’t believe those polls, by the way, because both of those pollsters don’t like me,” he said.\nHe also criticized the press for playing up the numbers, which showed Trump falling behind one of his Republican rivals for the first time in months. “They made it seem like the greatest defeat in history,” he said. “All day long, ugh my head.\"\nTrump, whose campaign is often interpreted in terms of his experience as a builder and reality television star, is also a prolific golf course developer, a background that appears to inform his candidacy as well. He opened his stump speech with an extended soliloquy on the property, which he said he rescued from decline after negotiating a last-minute price reduction from $170 million to $150 million.\nHe said an unnamed person recently praised the property and told him, “If you could do the same for the United States as you did here, it would be unbelievable.”\nIf the Doral indeed represents a vision of Trump's America, it's a mixed one.\n“Trump courses are, if nothing else, an oasis from reality,” said Richard Phinney, the producer of two critical documentaries about Trump golf courses that focus on their economic and environmental impact.\nThe impeccably manicured grounds are filled with lush flower arrangements and picturesque sculptures. Inside the Donald J. Trump ballroom, the chandeliers sparkle and the candelabras gleam. The air-conditioning is powerful. Even the garbage bins are nice: solid wooden structures with a Trump coat of arms affixed to them.\n“It’s awesome,” said Marcy Masters, a self-employed seller of nutritional supplements, of the venue where she had lined up three hours early. “Oh my gosh, did you see the carpets? Doral spells rich.”\nThe Bolivian-born Masters held a banner with “Hispanics for Trump” on one side and a doctored image of a shirtless, muscle-bound Trump wearing a loincloth, clutching a knife and carrying Lady Liberty over his shoulder on the other. “Vote Trump to save America!” it said.\n“I came in the legal way, and I made a fortune,” said Masters. “I don’t want another communist country.”\nReferring to a news report about excessive regulation she heard some months back, Masters said, “a nine-year-old child who cannot even sell lemonade. We don’t want that. That’s stupid. We want 10, 15, 20 million lemonade girls.”\nMasters said she hopes Trump does for the country what he’s done for Doral. “This place was probably garbage when he bought it. Now he’s changed it. Such splendor.”\nThe sprawling complex is walled off from its more mundane surroundings — a strip mall, a six-lane thoroughfare, and especially the Univision offices on its southern and eastern border — by chain-link fences, trees and towering hedges.\nOn Friday, the entrance for the Donald J. Trump Convention Center, on another part of the resort property, was manned by guards and flanked by two parked police cars with their siren lights flashing.\nTrump staffers sectioned off a large portion of the hall. | Ben Schreckinger\nA Doral employee asked if a POLITICO reporter arriving early and identifying himself as a member of the press was with Univision. He confirmed that the news outlet had been barred from the event, despite having offices next door. “It’s ironic,” he said.\nThe sealed border was not the only parallel between Trump's courses and his campaign rhetoric.\nTrump, for example, often derides EPA-mandated environmental impact statements. He has said that such statements prevent the United States from building artificial islands as China is doing, and that he would not allow them to prevent him from building a wall on the Mexican border.\nIn 2011, New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection cited Trump National Golf Club in the township Bedminster for multiple violations, including disturbing wetlands. At his golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, concerns about the health of nearby dunes threatened to derail the project.\nTrump has also offered his support for governments that invoke eminent domain, a position unpopular with many libertarian-leaning Republicans. He successfully invoked eminent domain to build a golf course in Scotland (he lost an attempt to invoke it in Atlantic City).\nTrump often boasts about employing “thousands of Hispanics” and claims that they love him. Many of those employees work at Doral. Two Hispanic staffers manning a concession stand where candy bars ran $5 who asked not to be named said they more or less agreed with that assessment.\n“Yeah, why not?” said one. “The pay is good and the benefits aren’t bad.” They pointed out that parking is free. At many other area businesses, employees must pay for their own parking.\nDespite their love for their employer and Trump's love of his signature Florida property, he failed to pack the hall here.\nA campaign spokeswoman said local police had provided her with an estimate of 2,500 attendees.\nA chart on the Trump hotels website puts the highest maximum capacity of the entire ballroom at 3,500, but after doors opened to attendees, staffers closed off the back quarter of the space. The back half of the remaining space also sat largely empty.\n“Apparently they were expecting much more people,” said Julio Cerra, an on-duty inspector with the Miami-Dade fire department, who said the campaign would eventually provide the department with an official headcount based on ticket receipts.\nBut there were also signs of Trump's strength in Florida. Those who had gathered showed great enthusiasm, breaking into sporadic champs of “We want Trump” as they waited for the businessman to appear.\nAnd a University of North Florida poll released this week showed Trump first in the state with 22 percent support, ahead of Carson at 19 percent and ahead of the two Floridians in the race: Sen. Marco Rubio, at 15 percent, and Bush, at 9 percent.\nEarlier Friday, the campaign announced its Florida campaign chairs, Republican activist Joe Gruters and Susan Wiles, who managed Rick Scott’s 2010 gubernatorial campaign.\nGruters, standing backstage and clutching notes a few minutes before Trump’s arrival, said he expected to introduce the businessman. Trump went on late and Gruters never spoke.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.trumphotelcollection.com/pdf/TND-Capacity-Brochure-Horizontal_PAGES_Aug-2014.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-23T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:08:47.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
