And he was enraged.\nYahoo Sports reports that Mendoza did her job quite admirably , joining ESPN in the American League wild-card game between the Houston Astros and New York Yankees . Off the air, however, she was subject to Bell's sexist tirade on Twitter. Bell's Twitter account has been deleted, along with the offending tweets, but the Internet has preserved his rude comments in which he referred to Mendoza as \"Tits McGhee\" and called ESPN \"too frigging cute for their own good \" for having a female softball player analyze the game.\nSeveral people immediately called Bell out for the misogynistic commentary:\nA woman made history tonight calling an MLB Playoff game for ESPN. This is what an Atlanta radio guy thought of it. pic.twitter.com/xf3Rc07EFY\n— Boiled Sports (@BoiledSports) October 7, 2015\nEmbarrassed by Mike Bell’s comments, given he’s on our flagship station. Inappropriate and disappointing.\n— Atlanta Falcons (@AtlantaFalcons) October 7, 2015\n\"Tits McGhee\" is a reference to Will Ferrell's bombastic, sexist character in Anchorman , Ron Burgundy, in which Burgundy's team pranks his female co-anchor by introducing her as \"Tits McGee\" on air during a news broadcast. On Twitter, Bell turned into a real-life Ron Burgundy.\n. @Rachel__Nichols but not shocking, as @mikebell929's failed attempts at sexist humor have been aimed at me in the past.\nI'm Ron Burgundy?\n— Kristen Ledlow (@KristenLedlow) October 7, 2015\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution saved some of Bell's other commentary, in which he defends himself against critics:\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail Share Tweet Pin E-mail Share Tweet Pin E-mail\nThe level of public shame must have reached a tipping point, however, as Bell soon issued an apology on Twitter:\nShare Tweet Pin E-mail\nBell has also been temporarily suspended from 92.9, where he hosts a sports radio program. He issued an apology that aired Wednesday. \"What I said was hurtful and I wanna take this opportunity to say to Jessica that what I said was dumb, and there's just no place for it, and I apologize for putting that garbage on Twitter,\" he said.\nMendoza told ABC's Good Morning America that she accepted his apology . \"To me, it really was about the fact that he came after me because I was a woman,\" she said.\n\"Any time there is a change, there's normally a lot of resistance. I think the [thing I was most] excited about was the aftermath and how much support there really was,\" she said, remarking on the swift backlash against Bell.\nMendoza admitted that she has not read the offensive comments. \"Just before I was going to click on it, I thought, 'You know, Why? Why even give it the attention?' I didn't even want to open it, so I have actually yet to read it,\" she said.\nShe hopes that going forward, her performance is not an indictment of her gender. \"Yes, I am a female, but I want it to get to the point where, let's think about what I am saying, what I am doing, and not so much the sex that I am,\" she said. \"I want to get to a point when we hear a female voice on NBA, NFL, or just anything in men's sports, and it is like, 'Sweet. She's doing a good job.'\"\nFollow Prachi on Twitter .", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/nyy/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444327327-mike-bell-apology-blurrier.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444327169-mike-bell-tweets-1.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x854/gallery-1444327169-mike-bell-tweets-1.png", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x882/gallery-1444327327-mike-bell-apology-blurrier.jpg", "https://twitter.com/BoiledSports/status/651599872731283457", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x854/gallery-1444327143-mike-bell-insults.png", "http://t.co/xf3Rc07EFY", "http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/10/07/mike-bell-uses-anchorman-insult-gets-in-twitter-war/", "https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x1000/gallery-1444327110-mike-bell-arse.jpg", "https://twitter.com/AtlantaFalcons/status/651819882904989698", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x750/gallery-1444327110-mike-bell-arse.jpg", "http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/1st-female-baseball-analyst-jessica-mendoza-sexist-backlash/story?id=34334201", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x661/gallery-1444327327-mike-bell-apology-blurrier.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444327110-mike-bell-arse.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444327143-mike-bell-insults.png", "http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/teams/hou/", "https://twitter.com/KristenLedlow/status/651869728454131713", "https://twitter.com/Rachel__Nichols", "http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/atlanta-radio-jock-launches-ugly-twitter-attack-on-espn-s-jessica-mendoza-072238057.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:22:08.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
