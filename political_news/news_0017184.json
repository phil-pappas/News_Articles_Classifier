Minorities are being crushed and writers and rationalists are being murdered, and the right to express is suppressed,” said Tiwana. She also bagged the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1971 for her novel Eho Hamara Jivana (This our life). \nAt the same time, Assamese litterateur and journalist Homen Borgohain also returned his Sahitya Akademi award, which he received in 1978 for his novel Pita Putra. \nHe protested against the lynching of a man in Dadri area over rumours of cow slaughter and the “growing fascist tendency in the country” and forces that are “trying to hit at the core ideology of Indian civilisation”. \nTiwana used to teach Punjabi at Patiala’s Punjab University and is now a writer-in-residence there. She said “In this land of Gautama Buddha, the atrocities committed on Sikhs in 1984 and now on the Muslims is an utter disgrace to our state and society.” \n“In the 21st century, we are killing those who stand up for truth; it’s a shame,” said Tiwana. “I laud this form of protest and hope this will make people think and remind them that secularism is most important. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:45:11.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
