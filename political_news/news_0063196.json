She may later have been spotted sitting under a bridge near the Cowlitz River.\nElizabeth's vehicle was located, unlocked with the keys inside, along southbound I-5 near near Toledo on Saturday evening by the Washington State Patrol.\nInvestigators believe Pham left her vehicle along I-5 Saturday morning, then walked to GeeCees Truck Stop at Exit 57, where she attempted to get a ride with a truck driver who was heading to Redding, Calif. An employee of GeeCees stopped her from getting into the truck cab and called a taxi for her, Brown said.\nOnce the taxi arrived, Pham asked the taxi driver to take her to Olympia. The taxi driver first stopped at Pham's vehicle so she could retrieve personal items from it. The taxi driver described her behavior as \"unusual and confused.\"\nThe taxi driver then dropped Pham off at the Shell station at Exit 59. She went into the Shell station, but did not buy anything and stayed in the store for about 20 minutes. Witnesses say she then walked to Beasley's restaurant, where she ordered a meal, Brown said.\nFrom there, a witness reported seeing a woman later in the day, matching Elizabeth's description, sitting under the overpass at Exit 59, staring into the Cowlitz River.\nOn Sunday, a makeup bag identified as Pham's was turned into the Castle Rock Police Department after a fisherman spotted it downriver from the area Pham was last seen. Detectives are trying to determine how the makeup bag ended up where it was found.\nPham is described as a white female standing 5-feet-6-inches and weighing 122 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes.\n\"At this time, we do not know what happened to Elizabeth. There are a lot of possibilities that need to be examined,\" said Chief Deputy Bruce Kimsey of the Lewis County Sheriff's Office. \"Elizabeth may have gotten a ride out of the area, and be gone on her own volition, we just don't know at this time.\"\nKimsey said detectives will be reviewing video surveillance from businesses near the areas she was reported to be and will be coordinating a search of the river and riverbanks as well.\n\"Our detectives will continue to work diligently on this case,\" he said.\nA sister said Pham had a child a few months ago, and that it was completely out of character for her to leave her home and family.\nAnyone who sees Pham or knows of her whereabouts is asked to call Detective Jerry Almond of the Lewis County Sheriff's Office at 360-748-9286 or email him at jeremy.almond@lewiscountywa.gov.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:05:24.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
