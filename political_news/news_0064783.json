Now they are no longer in power, it's time to hit the brakes,\" said Mike Palecek , national president of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers.\nSeveral neighbourhood conversions to the controversial group mailboxes were scheduled on October 19 th , Election Day and still more are slated for November.\nThe union fears that Canada Post will forge ahead with its plan prior to the Liberal majority government taking the reins.\n\"We need to stop the cuts before more jobs are lost, before more damage is done to property and before more people lose this service,\" said Palecek.\nThe Liberals campaigned on an election promise to stop the cuts to home mail delivery and hold a review of Canada Post. These commitments have been welcomed by the union, but representatives say the Liberals need to move quickly and instruct Canada Post to call a halt.\n\"Many seniors, people with disabilities and others voted for the Liberals because they promised to stop the cuts to door-to-door delivery,\" said Palecek.\n\"It would be wrong for Canada Post to continue down this road now that the Liberals have been elected and the people have clearly spoken on this issue.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=C4375&Transmission_Id=201510210812CANADANWWEB______C4375&DateId=20151021"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:21:34.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
