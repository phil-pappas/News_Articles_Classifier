(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) By Charles Lane Opinion writer October 21 at 8:29 PM Follow @ChuckLane1 All right, let’s take Donald Trump seriously. Instead of ridiculing his hair, judge the man on his ideas, especially his business-oriented plans for rekindling the U.S. economy.\nOne of Trump’s top proposals, emblematic of a wider protectionist approach, is to stop Ford Motor Co.’s construction of a plant in Mexico, by threatening the Michigan company with tariffs on goods it might build south of the border.\nCharles Lane is a Post editorial writer, specializing in economic policy, federal fiscal issues and business, and a contributor to the PostPartisan blog.

And he calls Bernie Sanders a communist!\nSuch a tariff would violate the North American Free Trade Agreement , which, like it or not, is the law of the land — not to mention the Constitution, unless Trump is relying on some little-known codicil that empowers the president, not Congress, to levy tariffs.\nNever mind all that: Trump’s idea would be terrible even if feasible. For reasons familiar to all Economics 101 students, blunt-force protectionism destroys jobs , probably many more than it “saves.”\nIn the simplest terms, Trump’s approach amounts to an increase in the regulatory and tax burden on U.S.-based businesses. Other things being equal, the heavier that burden, the less likely businesses would be to invest in the United States, and the fewer jobs would be created.\nInvestors might get especially skittish if policy can change at the whim of a White House wheeler-dealer who relishes dissing CEOs by phone — and who told Fox News’s Chris Wallace on Sunday that, in negotiations, “I want to be unpredictable, because, you know, we need unpredictability. Everything is so predictable with our country.” So much for a stable business climate.\nPerhaps, cowed by Trump, Ford would keep its", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@ChuckLane1", "http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2015/10/18/donald-trump-talks-taxes-trade-11-and-why-takes-personal-shots-at-political/", "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/06/16/trump-press-ford-cancel-mexican-plant/28816173/", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/doliaestevez/2015/06/19/donald-trumps-threat-to-force-ford-to-scrap-expansion-plan-in-mexico-very-unlikely-under-nafta/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:12:19.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
