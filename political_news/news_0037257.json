(Jerome Delay/Associated Press) By Peter J. Hotez October 23 at 7:17 PM Peter J. Hotez is president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute and Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. In 2014, he was named a U.S. science envoy by the State Department. The views expressed are his own.\nWhile global attention has been focused on strengthening health systems in West Africa in the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak there , a new wave of tropical infectious disease is threatening Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.\nThe unprecedented appearance of tropical diseases in Southern Europe in recent years has been well documented. Dengue fever appeared on Madeira off the coast of Portugal in 2012, and chikungunya arrived in Spain this year. Malaria has returned to Greece after being eliminated in the 1960s, and West Nile virus has gained a foothold throughout Southern Europe. These infections are transmitted by mosquitoes that now inhabit the region. Schistosomiasis , a parasitic blood fluke infection transmitted by snails, just made its first recorded appearance on the island of Corsica, while outbreaks of opisthorchiasis , a liver fluke that causes bile duct cancer, have occurred in Italy.\nWe are still investigating the forces responsible for the transformation of Southern Europe into a tropical disease “hot zone.” Among the possible causes are the severe economic downturns in Greece , Italy and Spain, which may have slowed national public-health efforts, and global warming, which is creating temperature and rainfall conditions better suited for insects and other carriers of disease adapted to tropical climates.\nBut a third factor must also be considered: The conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. Ebola arose in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, in part because the health systems of the affected countries had been weakened by years of conflict and human migration. That same combination is now present in the Islamic State-occupied areas of Syria, Iraq and Libya, as well as in Yemen.\nWe are already seeing the consequences of drawn-out Islamic State occupation and the subsequent halting of public-health interventions in places under the terrorist group’s control. These include the reemergence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as polio and measles but also a dramatic increase in", "external_links": ["http://ec.europa.eu/health/communicable_diseases/events/travel_advice_dengue_201211_en.htm", "http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/healthtopics/west_nile_fever/West-Nile-fever-maps/pages/index.aspx", "https://www.rt.com/news/malaria-greece-austerity-healthcare-171/", "http://www.who.int/csr/don/10-august-2015-chikungunya/en/", "https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/emerging-diseases-other-health-threats-alphabetical-a-thru-h/food-safety/114018-opisthorchiasis-in-italy-episouth-e-web-bulletin-september-9-2011-edited", "https://www.gov.uk/government/news/travellers-to-southern-corsica-warned-about-parasitic-infection"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:09:43.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
