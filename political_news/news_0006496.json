That concern has eased since the summer, and gold has received further support since the Fed last week indicated economic conditions may not yet be right for an increase.\nSince then the dollar has trended lower, benefiting gold prices which move in inverse relation to the US currency. After remaining below $US1,150 per troy ounce for almost a month, gold finally rose above that level at the end of last week and has continued rising higher since.\nMore US economic data is due later Wednesday, when the US Commerce Department will release retail sales figures for September, with US inflation data later in the week also likely to influence gold's near-term direction.\n\"We are expecting more dollar weakness,\" said Howie Lee, analyst at Phillip Futures Ltd. \"It also looks like there is a bump up in [gold] demand from China because of concerns about the stock market\".\nMeanwhile, there are signs of resurgent interest in gold-buying from Chinese consumers, many of whom are looking for alternative investments following the sharp fall in China's stock markets since the summer.\nChow Tai Fook, one of the largest gold retailers in China, said its sales of gold products in the country rose 22 per cent in the three months ended September.\n\"We have seen interest from Chinese consumers and investors rising again on gold,\" said Daniel Meng, analyst at brokerage CLSA in Hong Kong. \"We believe this is partly related to the turmoil of A-share market and some worries about the recent renminbi depreciation.\"\nThe pickup in sales at retailers like Chow Tai Fook has come partly due to consumers taking advantage of previously low gold prices, which were hovering just above a five-year low in late July. China's anticorruption probe had also hit sales last year, another reason for the robust comparative sales.\nTypically, most Chinese gold buying takes place between the Golden Week holidays in October and Lunar New Year in February, as shoppers buy gold for festivals and to give as gifts.\nThe recovery in China's jewelry demand and constrained global gold supplies have given a boost to gold's price outlook, said Helen Lau, analyst with Hong Kong-based Argonaut Securities.\n\"While these positive catalysts support the case for investing in physical or paper gold, gold equities with a generous dividend yield...are more attractive,\" she said.\nThe surge in Chinese demand is likely to be supported by strong Indian demand over the next month and a half because of a series of Hindu festivals, when it is considered auspicious to buy gold. India and China together account for around half of global physical demand for gold.\nStill, gold's glitter could be tempered somewhat by scanty monsoon rains in India, which have hit farm incomes, says Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz Research.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:23:42.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
