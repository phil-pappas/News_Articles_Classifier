(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) October 9 at 5:37 PM Regarding the Oct. 9 front-page article “ A vacuum at the top for House GOP ”:\nThis shambolic battle to choose a new House speaker could be the ideal time to revert to the intent of the Constitution’s framers. The Constitution makes no allowance for party politics in choosing a speaker — or any other post, including president. The Founding Fathers hoped that the nation would escape partisan politics.\nIn creating the position of speaker, they drew on their experience with British parliamentary procedure. There, a speaker resigns from his or her party when taking the post and presides above the political fray. Imagine a brave moderate renouncing his or her current affiliation and rallying pragmatists to forge a working majority based on centrist, inclusive politics.\nThis is what disaffected voters are looking for when they rally to nontraditional politicians in the presidential race. Would it be too much to ask our elected representatives to embrace the Constitution, the good of the nation and their fellow legislators? Pope Francis didn’t think so, nor do most Americans.\nJohn McNamara , Derwood", "external_links": ["http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/the-role-of-the-speaker/role-of-the-speaker/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:58:17.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
