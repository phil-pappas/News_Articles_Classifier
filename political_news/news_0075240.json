(AP) - Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jack Conway tried to reinforce his friend-of-coal credentials Thursday, pledging to promote the industry and look for tax incentives to boost production as he distanced himself from a president routinely blamed for coal’s downturn. \nConway boasted of the multiple lawsuits that he has joined as Kentucky’s two-term attorney general, challenging federal environmental regulators. \nMeanwhile, Conway’s Republican opponent, Matt Bevin, said Kentucky should defend its constitutionally protected sovereignty to resist anti-coal federal regulations. \n“What can be done?” Bevin said. “Tell the EPA and every other regulatory agency that has no legal authority or recourse to enforce regulations, mandates and edicts upon us to ‘pound sand.’” \nThe rivals made separate appearances before the Kentucky Coal Association, less than a month before Kentuckians choose a new governor on Nov. 3. Reporters listened to the candidates’ comments through a live stream that the coal group made available on the Internet. \nKentucky is the nation’s third-leading coal producer, and both candidates touted their support for the industry. \n___ Man who says he killed wife to stop suffering given 15 years \nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - An eastern Kentucky man who says he killed his wife to end her suffering has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. \nErnest “Chris” Chumbley pleaded guilty last month to a manslaughter charge that allowed him to avoid a murder trial. He has been in jail since the August 2013 shooting. \nChumbley called 911 minutes after shooting his wife, Virginia “Jenny” Chumbley, saying she was a cancer patient. He later said she had asked him to die. \nLaurel County Commonwealth’s Attorney Jackie Steele said the 50-year-old Chumbley was sentenced Thursday in accordance with the plea agreement. \nThe shooting and Chumbley’s statements that it was a mercy killing came amid an ongoing national debate over right-to-die issues. Five states - Montana, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and most recently California - have laws that give terminally ill patients an avenue to end their life. \nSteele said family members disagreed about Jenny Chumbley’s wishes. Some said she was miserable and didn’t want to go on living.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:38:32.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
