By reducing food insecurity we can help the people of Malawi to lift themselves out of poverty.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-02T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:19:13.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
