It is loud, raucous, and it takes a certain talent for candidates to win the night, as supporters for each candidate roar their approval and disapproval. \nThe 2007 speech Barack Obama made there was masterful - inspiring his audience, while at the same time suggesting his main unnamed opponent, Hillary Clinton, was a poll-driven, triangulating, Washington insider: \n[T]hat is why the same old Washington textbook campaigns just won't do in this election. That's why not answering questions 'cause we are afraid our answers won't be popular just won't do. That's why telling the American people what we think they want to hear, instead of telling the American people what they need to hear, just won't do. Triangulating and poll-driven positions because we're worried about what Mitt or Rudy might say about us just won't do. If we are really serious about winning this election, Democrats, we can't live in fear of losing it. \nThis party - the party of Jefferson and Jackson; of Roosevelt and Kennedy - has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the American people when we led, not by polls, but by principle; not by calculation, but by conviction; when we summoned the entire nation to a common purpose - a higher purpose. And I run for the Presidency of the United States of America because that's the party America needs us to be right now. \nThe Obama campaign had historic ground operations Iowa yet that speech wascredited with fueling Mr. Obama's rise in the state before the 2008 caucuses. Candidates this cycle - including the target of his speech then, Hillary Clinton - hope for a similar impact this time around. \n\"This is probably the last big event before the caucus. The debates will mean something, but I don't think they will get the same activist Iowa scrutiny that we will see on Saturday night,\" explains Scott Brennan, former Chair of the Iowa Democratic Party. \nCome Saturday, there will be exactly 100 days until the Iowa caucuses. While every day now is critical for campaign messaging, Iowa Democrats largely agree there is no other night like the Jefferson Jackson dinner -- candidates and their staffers know that they must leave a lasting impression to fuel their campaign over the next few months. \nThe campaigns are leaving little to chance, when it comes to creating an hyper-charged atmosphere that attracts voters. \n\"You are working to turn out thousands of folks,\" explains Brennan. Those folks won't come if they do not believe in a candidate or do not want to sit and \"listen to politicians give speeches.\" \nCandidates worked with the Iowa Democratic Party to buy tickets and gettheir supporters into the room. The Sanders campaign bought 1,950 tickets-- which will be distributed to their supporters for free -- meaning thatalmost one fourth of the room will definitely be cheering for Sanders. Theother campaigns did not release the exact numbers of tickets they bought.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:50:34.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
