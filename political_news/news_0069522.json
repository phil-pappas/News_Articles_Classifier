(AP) - Two lawmakers are set to be sworn in to fill vacancies in the Illinois Senate. \nFormer Des Plaines alderman Laura Murphy will take the oath of office Monday. The Democrat is taking over for Democratic Sen. Dan Kotowski of Park Ridge, who is stepping down to become CEO of a Chicago nonprofit. \nMurphy tells the (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald she plans to run for a full Senate term when the seat is up for re-election next year. \nPeoria City Councilman Chuck Weaver was selected Sunday to replace GOP Sen. Darin LaHood, who won a special election to replace ex-U.S. Rep. Aaron Schock. \nWeaver says his background as a \"farm kid\" and businessman will help him represent the central Illinois district. \nThe new legislators were selected by their respective party committees. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
