I've never seen anything like it,\" Trump said. \"I'm going to unify. This country is totally divided. Barack Obama has divided this country unbelievably. And it's all, it's all hatred, what can I tell you. I've never seen anything like it. ... I've gotten along with Democrats and I've gotten along with Republicans. And I said, that's a good thing.\"\nTrump, whose appeal as a political outsider has helped his candidacy flourish, said that if elected, he'd be a \"great unifier for our country.\"\nFor Trump, criticism of both parties is nothing new.\nHe's relentlessly assailed his rivals, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, for being \"low-energy.\"\n\"We need high-energy people,\" Trump said. \"I think Ben Carson is a very low-energy person. Actually, I think Ben Carson is lower energy than Jeb, if you want to know the truth. We need strong energy.\"\nMoreover, in recent days, Trump has questioned Carson's Christian faith -- something that's appealed to evangelical voters in Iowa. Carson is a Seventh-day Adventist.\n\"I'm Presbyterian. Boy, that's down the middle of the road folks, in all fairness,\" Trump said in Florida. \"I mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don't know about. I just don't know about.\"\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1743387&h=Trump+says+he%27d+be+the+%27great+unifier%27", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1743387", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/politics/politicalnews/s-1743387&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:02:06.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
