(AP Photo/Darko Vojinovic)\n 05 a.m. EDT + More DOBOVA, Slovenia (AP) â€” The latest news as migrants make their way across Europe by the tens of thousands, fleeing war or seeking a better life. All times local:\n10:00 a.m.\nSlovenian police say more than 12,000 people crossing from Croatia on Wednesday, raising the total to more than 34,000 since Saturday.\nSlovenia became a new link in the migrant trail after Hungary closed its border. Asylum seekers who had reached Croatia then turned to Slovenia as the alternative.\nSome 12,616 migrants entered the country on Wednesday, higher than the usual number of up to 10,000 people reported by countries along the so-called Balkan corridor.\nSlovenia has said it can handle no more than 2,500 entries per day, and has accused Croatia of sending too many migrants through.\n___\n9:30 a.m.\nMore than 1,000 asylum seekers have streamed out of a crowded Austrian collection point on the border with Slovenia after Austrian police removed barriers to prevent possible violence.\nPolice said some followed instructions and regrouped outside the barriers Thursday but many continued walking northward away from the Spielfeld border crossing.\nMore than a thousand migrants fleeing war and hardship already broke through barriers at the Austrian center on Wednesday, but most were collected by police. This time, police said they removed barriers to relieve pent-up pressure that could have triggered violence among those waiting for transport to shelters.\nSeveral thousand more migrants are waiting on the Slovene side of the border for entry into Austria.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefl0n%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=The%20Latest%3A%20Slovenia%20says%20heavy%20migrant%20traffic%20continues&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefl0n%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=The%20Latest%3A%20Slovenia%20says%20heavy%20migrant%20traffic%20continues", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefl0n%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefl0n%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=The%20Latest%3A%20Slovenia%20says%20heavy%20migrant%20traffic%20continues", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefl0n%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZefl0n%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:24:34.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
