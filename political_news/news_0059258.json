In a flyer posted on Twitter, the church acknowledges that gay marriage is the law of the land (though against the will of God) and criticizes Davis for breaking her oath to protect and uphold the Constitution and the nation's laws.\nThe church then goes further by accusing Davis of being an adulterer for disobeying the word of God because she got married four times, three ending in divorce, to three different men. In the eyes of the church, she is still married to her first husband, so any relations with another man is cheating.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ \"That man that Kim Davis is living with, and calling her husband, IS NOT!\" reads the flyer. \"Her husband is Dwain Wallace, who she married when she was 18-years-old. It does not matter how many years you pile on! It was adultery at the beginning, adultery in the middle and it is indeed adultery today!\"\nLord willing, we will visit Kim Davis on Monday with some friendly, Christianly advice/wisdom: pic.twitter.com/iwLkypfhft — Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) October 16, 2015\nDavis was thrown in jail for several days for failing to fulfill her obligations, during which a number of Republican presidential candidates threw their support behind her — painting her as a symbol of religious liberty — including Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz.\n\"Let Kim go, but if you have to put someone in jail, I volunteer to go. Let me go. Lock me up if you think that's how freedom is best served,\" said Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and author of God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy.\nRead more on WashingtonExaminer.com", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/", "http://t.co/iwLkypfhft", "http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/", "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/share/source/washington-examiner.png", "http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/westboro-baptist-church-to-protest-kim-davis/article/2574347?utm_campaign=Fox", "https://twitter.com/WBCSaysRepent/status/655164104995381249"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:47:03.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
