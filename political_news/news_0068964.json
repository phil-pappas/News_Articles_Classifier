At the local level, however, I believe that our focus must be on improving the quality of life within our community and increasing affordability for all residents. \nThese two fundamental issues directly affect each of West Milford’s 10,000-plus households on a daily basis. I am running for Township Council to deliver results in dealing with these two issues. \nAs a concerned resident, I have approached the council pushing to increase Department of Public Works (DPW) services in an effort to build a better infrastructure within our town. West Milford needs cleaner and improved roads, free of roadside weeds, litter, and white grit while providing safer road conditions for local drivers. \nI have also explored multiple avenues to bring tax relief to West Milford. In June of this year, I addressed the Township Council about pursuing an unfunded mandate claim against the Highlands Act via the Council on Local Mandates. Our town council unanimously agreed and has started the process to fight for the funding West Milford deserves. \nThe Highlands Economic and Tourism Corp. (also known as \"HEAT\") is another means by which I have worked to improve our local economy. As chairman of HEAT, I have continued to support local business by way of the Shop Local Program and Highlands Savings Card. \nAs operator of the Greenwood Lake Airport, I have worked tirelessly to build up local tourism. The Greenwood Lake Air Show, which I started seven years ago, brings over 30,000 people to West Milford annually to dine at local restaurants and shop at local stores. \nThis election is not about politics; it is all about results. Our day-to-day needs as residents must be at the forefront of our local government’s agenda. We need results to make life better and more affordable in West Milford. \nI have proven myself as someone who gets results in my business career and will bring the same drive, determination, and experience to get results as a West Milford councilman. \nI humbly ask residents to vote for me on Nov. 3 and support Row B for better leadership in West Milford. \nTim Wagner,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:57:22.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
