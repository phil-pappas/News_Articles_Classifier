(Nikki Kahn/The Washington Post) By Editorial Board October 2 at 8:17 PM W ASHINGTON’S METRORAIL system is failing so spectacularly, and with such dangerous consequences, that federal safety officials have singled it out as the nation’s first urban subway system that merits detention and a dunce cap.\nAll right, the National Transportation Safety Board didn’t use those exact words. Instead, in what the board’s chairman, Christopher A. Hart, called an “urgent” recommendation, the safety agency said Metrorail should be subject to the tougher oversight regime ordinarily reserved for Amtrak, MARC and other commuter and freight railroads. In other words, the regulatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Transit Administration may be adequate to ensure the safe operations of every other subway system in the United States, but they are no longer equal to Metro’s deterioration.\nFine. But as long as we’re on the subject of Metro and the feds, let’s not forget Congress. In the face of the system’s travails, the only response by lawmakers has been threatening to cut federal contributions for modernization and improvements, and robbing Metro of passengers by slashing their subsidies for commuting.\nWe’re on board with the idea of shaking up Metro’s regulatory oversight. The FTA, formerly known as the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, has been the federal agency charged with overseeing Metro since Washington’s subway system was built. And the record, as Mr. Hart made clear, is dismaying: 11 accidents and incidents leading to NTSB investigations in 33 years, with a death toll of 18 (plus scores more hurt). A more muscular inspection regime may improve safety.\nBut Metro’s glaring management failures have been compounded for years by chronic underinvestment; all the inspection in the world won’t solve that problem. As Metro’s anemic investment in its future became clear, Congress agreed to pony up $150 million annually, starting in 2008 , on the understanding that Virginia, Maryland and the District would together match that amount. It was meant to be a 10-year deal, but this year Republicans — who, like Democrats, rely heavily on congressional staffers who come to work by Metro — tried to cut the federal contribution by a third .\nThat attempt failed. Yet the federal transit benefit, slashed last year , remains a $130-per-month deduction for commuters — about half the $250 monthly parking benefit. That has deprived Metro of ridership and revenue.\nSome Metro board members estimate that the agency will need $25 billion over the next decade — on top of anticipated funding — to cover shortfalls in pensions and health coverage for retirees as well as system-wide upgrades. That’s a colossal shortfall: Cutting service and raising fares won’t resolve it, nor will higher contributions from the three jurisdictions Metro serves. In addition to stepping up its regulatory and enforcement regime, the feds need to start coughing up more dollars.\nRead more about this topic:\nThe Post’s View: Metro’s forbidding future\nThe Post’s View: Yet even more proof of Metro’s incompetence\nThe Post’s View: Another disaster for Metro\nDavid Alpert: Getting Metro to move forward", "external_links": ["http://www.rollcall.com/news/local_lawmakers_want_metro_funds_restored-242160-1.html"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:39:04.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
