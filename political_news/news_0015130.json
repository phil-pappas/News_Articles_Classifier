They say it could add millions of newly registered voters to California’s voter rolls, the Governor announced yesterday that he signed the bill. \nThe goal of the bill is to boost California’s voter rolls by registering visitors to the Department of Motor Vehicles It follows Oregon’s move earlier this year to adopt the nation’s first automatic voter registration law. \nThe legislation calls for data collected by the DMV to be provided to the secretary of state’s office, which would verify a resident’s legal eligibility to vote before registering them. Drivers would have the option to opt out or cancel their voter registration at any time. \nThe legislation was among a package of election and voter bills that Brown signed, including AB 44 by Assemblyman Kevin Mullin, D-South San Francisco, which allows the governor to order a state-funded, manual recount of any statewide ballot measure or elected office in which the margin of victory is extremely small. Secretary of State Alex Padilla praised the signing of the automatic registration bill. \n“Citizens should not be required to opt-in to their fundamental right to vote,” he said in a statement. “We do not have to opt-in to other rights, such as free speech or due process. The right to vote should be no different.” \nSome Republican lawmakers were critical of the bill,They warned that automatic registration could lead to voter fraud if people who are not eligible are accidentally registered. \nCritics have also argued that merely increasing voter registration will not make Californians more engaged in the political process or interested in voting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:16:48.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
