(NYSE: THG) today announced the launch of its newly updated Nonprofit Management Advantage program within its management liability portfolio. The program provides an enhanced product suite and specialized coverages designed specifically for nonprofit organizations.\n\"Not-for-profit organizations, regardless of size, can face the same major exposures as for-profit businesses,\" said Helen R. Savaiano , president of management liability at The Hanover . \"With operating margins and finances already stretched thin, the financial impact of a liability could be potentially devastating to these organizations. Our enhanced management liability offering enables agents to better serve their clients, helping to ensure nonprofit organizations have comprehensive protection for both their resources and their reputations.\"\nThe Hanover's Nonprofit Management Advantage program now offers the following enhanced coverage parts, which can be tailored to fit each nonprofit organization's unique needs:\nDirectors & Officers Liability – Enhancements include an expanded definition of the terms \"claim\" and \"loss,\" as well as \"insured vs. insured exclusion\" updates. Employment Practices Liability – Several new enhancements have been added, such as third party coverage automatically included, defense expense coverage for breach of written contracts and independent contractors treated as employees. Fiduciary Liability – Several product improvements include variable sub-limits available for compliance resolution, 502(c) and HIPPA civil penalties, an expanded definition of the term \"claim,\" and priority of payments language improvements. Cyber Security and Privacy – A flexible cyber protection solution that includes three new first party cyber coverages and six new third party cyber coverages. Crime – A crime coverage base form that now incorporates several new coverages as well as enhanced coverages, including premises coverage and coverage for employees on military service. Kidnap, Ransom and Extortion – New insuring agreements added, including political repatriation, hostage crisis costs and security consulting services. Terms and conditions have been updated for all current coverage parts to help reduce the need to track or request a multitude of commonly provided policy elements, making it easier for both nonprofit organizations and independent agents. Additionally, all coverage parts have been expanded to include coverage territories anywhere in the world and claims reporting as soon as practicable, but no later than 90 days after the end of the policy period.\nThe Hanover also offers a suite of risk management solutions and specialized claims services, providing nonprofit organizations a well-rounded and comprehensive insurance program. The risk management solutions include complimentary access to The Hanover's eRisk Hub, which offers planning and loss prevention tools and resources for proactive cyber risk management, access to free legal advice on employment practices through an Employment Practices Hotline, and employee background screening services through IntelliCorp, an industry leader in employment screening.\nThe Hanover distributes all of its products, including its management liability products, exclusively through independent insurance agents.
