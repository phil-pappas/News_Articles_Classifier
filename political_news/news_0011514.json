Brandon and his wife, Teresa, were profiled on Cosmopolitan.com last year , talking about their immediate connection, how they dealt with Brandon's diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ​ in 2013, their decision to move up their wedding, and their future plans. \"When we got engaged and had these great careers and this perfect life, I thought, naively, 'Love is all you need,'\" Teresa said. \"But there's so much more to marriage, and to a meaningful relationship, than that. I've learned about patience and accepting the world as it is by going through this with Brandon.\"\n Brandon and Teresa spoke in the interview about their plans to move to San Francisco after his final round of chemotherapy, and though they did make the move, they returned to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Brandon's hometown of Houston in early 2015. \"Lepow relapsed at the beginning of 2015 and moved back to Houston for a stem cell transplant in April. This summer, he learned that his body was rejecting that transplant. Now he has pneumonia,\" the Los Angeles Times reported in August in an article about current and former members of the Obama administration going to Texas to visit him.\nThe family had been posting updates on a Facebook page with more than 2,000 followers , but over the weekend Teresa posted an update alerting everyone that Brandon had decided to stop treatment. \"Brandon is now sleeping all the time. He is peaceful and not in any pain,\" she wrote. \"For most of the past 40 days Brandon was awake. Holding our hands, kissing us and simply being Brandon. I have fallen more in love with my husband as I sit and watch him die. He continues to take care of me, to make sure we all are going to be ok. It's incredible.\"\nFriends are now filling Brandon's personal Facebook wall with memories and photos and tweeting about what he meant to them. \"So many of us will keep you close in our hearts and try to live a bit more like you did - with extraordinary kindness, humor, and strength,\" one wrote on Facebook. \"It's times like these that you really feel the unfairness of things. But then you realize how grateful you are to have gotten to know someone as special as Brandon Lepow. RIP. #TeamLepow,\" another wrote.\nMourning the loss of Brandon Lepow, our good friend & former WH colleague. Thoughts & prayers to his wife Theresa. pic.twitter.com/AXzoJQJMnm\n— petesouza (@petesouza) October 13, 2015\nOur hearts break at the passing of Brandon Lepow, but his example as the best friend, colleague, teammate and husband will live on forever\n— Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) October 13, 2015\nWe lost our brother @BrandonLepow today.This is one of my fondest memories of us winning a bball title. #teamlepow pic.twitter.com/iedkzsHinS\n— William Jawando (@wjawando) October 13, 2015\nThe White House also issued a statement about Brandon's passing .\nSeven years ago, like a lot of young people, Brandon Lepow got into politics because he believed he could change his country for the better. And in his time on the campaign trail and in the White House, both as a traveling aide and as a spokesman, he was tireless in that effort — hardworking, cheerful, one of the most unfailingly kind and gracious people I've had the honor to know. He was someone that any American could be proud to have working on their behalf.\nLast night, we lost Brandon after a long battle with leukemia. It's a testament to his dedication to others that, over the past few months, more than fifty of his White House colleagues traveled to spend time with him and support his family as he underwent treatment in Texas. We all have heavy hearts today — and all of us, Michelle and I included, share our condolences and all our support with Brandon's family, his legion of friends, and his wonderful and courageous wife, Theresa. Theirs is one of the great love stories. They, in many ways, kept the rest of us going. And Theresa will always be a part of our family.\nTo know Brandon Lepow was to know that he didn't need to get into politics to change the world, after all. He made his thirty-two years count. And those of us who knew him are better for it.\nDisclosure: I went to high school with Brandon.\nFollow Lori on Twitter.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/iedkzsHinS", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/480x357/gallery-1444764574-53a072f0a8848-cos-04-xkel8f-de.jpg", "https://twitter.com/petesouza/status/654003225885077504", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/42/1444764574-53a072f0a8848-cos-04-xkel8f-de.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/yeshecan.cer/photos/a.655036657862412.1073741827.654899904542754/1029174563781951/?type=3&theater", "https://twitter.com/BrandonLepow", "https://www.facebook.com/yeshecan.cer?fref=ts", "http://t.co/AXzoJQJMnm", "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-obama-aide-leukemia-20150831-story.html", "https://twitter.com/wjawando/status/653950409736912897", "https://twitter.com/danpfeiffer/status/653998066844872704", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/13/statement-president-passing-brandon-lepow", "https://twitter.com/LoriFradkin", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamlepow?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:27:21.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
