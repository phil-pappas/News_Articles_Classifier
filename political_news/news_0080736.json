Health care debate expands for 2016 In this Sept. 28, 2015, photo, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. speaks at the University of Chicago in Chicago. After seven years of the political drama known as \"Obamacare,\" you might think voters would be tired of big ideas for revamping health care. If so, the presidential candidates seem to have missed the memo. On the left, part of the appeal of Sanders is his years-long advocacy of \"single payer,\" a tax-supported, Medicare-like plan for all. The idea is in the political DNA of liberals, and Sanders as president would lead a movement to make it happen, his campaign says.
