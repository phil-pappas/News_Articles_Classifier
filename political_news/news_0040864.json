Nic Walker Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The Queensland Labor government is planning to scrap the merger of its two state-owned electricity generation companies in part because of pressure over alleged price-gouging in the National Electricity Market.\nBig electricity users have called on regulators to completely ban the practice of \"late bidding\", which they alleged the state-owned CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation used to distort wholesale prices and boost profits.\nDespite recent proposed rule changes by the electricity regulator Australian Energy Market Commission, industrial customers are worried the practice is still widespread in Queensland and want it outlawed because it will cost jobs.\nBusiness fears the issue could be exacerbated if the Palaszczuk government proceeds with its election commitment to merge the two state-owned generation companies into one.\nThe Queensland government has told senior energy executives it is considering scrapping the merger proposal, but a decision has yet to be submitted to cabinet, sources said.\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Competition chairman Rod Sims has warned about the lack of competition in Queensland's generation market, which is 66 per cent controlled by the two state-owned companies.\nLosers One large manufacturing company, which asked not to be named, said business and retail customers were the losers through higher wholesale prices. \"We have been hit very hard by this. It's a huge differential in price with NSW,\" the industry executive said.\n \"It really is affecting the profitability of the large energy users. It's not got to the stage where we are considering pulling the pin but it's another straw on the camel's back. I've got no doubt it's going to get worse if there's a merger.\"\nIt is alleged CS Energy and Stanwell Corporation engaged in deliberate \"late bidding\" in the NEM – in the final five minutes of a half-hourly settlement period – which distorted the market and contributed to higher prices for retail users.\nDuring a four-month period in 2014-15, electricity prices in Queensland spiked as high as $13,500 per megawatt hour for brief periods.\nThe AEMC acknowledged the problem of late bidding in a draft ruling in September and flagged a tightening of the rules, but has ruled out a complete ban as an option.\nStanwell and CS Energy have denied they have done anything illegal saying they abided by the laws set by the AEMC.\nEven after the AEMC's proposed change, there is still a significant price difference between the cost of wholesale electricity in NSW and Queensland.\nThe fixed price for electricity in NSW on the 2016 futures markets is $48.81 per megawatt hour, while in Queensland it is $63.70 or about $15 more expensive.\nHeadache On the more volatile quarterly market, the fixed price for NSW is $51 per megawatt hour, while in Queensland it is almost double at $97 per megawatt hour.\nThe issue is causing such a headache Stanwell Corporation emailed its major clients in September saying it wasn't involved in any price gouging.\nIt blamed the demand from the $60billion liquified natural gas industry in Gladstone for putting pressure on prices.\n\"The development of the LNG market has had a profound effect on the fundamentals of supply and demand in Queensland,\" acting executive general manager Richard Jeffrey said in an email obtained by The Australian Financial Review.\nQueensland Energy Minister Mark Bailey said he expected CS Energy and Stanwell to comply with all rules set by the AEMC. He denied it asked the companies to engage in the practice to boost dividends into state coffers.\n\"Stanwell and CS Energy are competitors in the market, with independent boards. Government ownership does not influence bidding behaviour,\" Mr Bailey said.\n\"The bidding process is transparent and wholesale electricity prices are determined by supply and demand. The facts are, Stanwell returned a decreased dividend to government for 2014-15, CS Energy didn't return a dividend at all.\"\nThe Palazczuk government's proposal to merge five state-owned power companies into two was expected to generate savings of about $150 million a year. But it is now re-considering the generation companies merger given industry concerns over market share.\nBut a spokesman for Mr Bailey said the mergers were still proceeding subject to negotiations with the ACCC.\nThe Major Energy Users Inc's project officer David Headberry said tighter rules were necessary to stop late bidding.\n\"Across the world of competitive generation markets, the regulators consistently impose rules limiting the exercise of market power,\" Mr Headberry said.\n\"Despite the harm to consumers across the NEM, the AEMC has decided that only small tweaks are needed.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-10-21T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:48:50.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
