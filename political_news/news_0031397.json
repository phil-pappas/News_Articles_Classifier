Here is the remark in question:\n\r \r \r Hitler didn’t want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews. And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said, “If you expel them, they’ll all come here.” “So what should I do with them?” he asked.

A Google search of the poster’s username led her back to one of her fellow editors.\n\r \r The photos were only the latest of several incidents of harassment. In 2014, Lightbreather made a request to the Wikipedia administrators: a space on the site to discuss ways to enforce Wikipedia’s civility policy, one of the site’s “ five pillars ” which says editors should always “treat each other with respect and civility.” In a page set up to discuss Lightbreather’s request, the user Eric Corbett, who was then an administrator, told her , “The easiest way to avoid being called a cunt is not to act like one.”\n\r \r Continue Reading Stephen Voss ‘We Need an Energy Miracle’ James Bennet Bill Gates has committed his fortune to moving the world beyond fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. \nIn his offices overlooking Lake Washington, just east of Seattle, Bill Gates grabbed a legal pad recently and began covering it in his left-handed scrawl.
