The county hopes to decide by the end of the year how to replace Oregon State University's extensive service as the public-participation system's long-time administrator. (Dana Tims/Staff) Comments \"I don't understand what the end game is here,\" Washington County Commissioner Roy Rogers said. \nWashington County's reexamination of its one-of-a-kind means of fostering public participation is well underway , but what the final product will look like is far from clear. \nThat much was evident at a gathering Tuesday between the county's five commissioners and a committee charged with tweaking a decades-old system that has suffered everything from overheated screaming matches to turnouts beyond anemic. \nAt issue is how the county replaces Oregon State University's extension service as administrator of its Citizen Participation Organization , a program that predates Oregon's landmark land-use laws. \nWith OSU ready to abandon the administrative role it has filled since the early 1970s, the county must now find another way to comply with statewide land-use laws requiring some means of citizen involvement. \nThe county plans to make a final decision by the end of the year. \nThe task is unique, since Washington County is the only one of Oregon's 36 counties that pays an outside administrator to fulfill the public participation requirement of state land-use laws. Other counties rely on commissioner-appointed planning commissions and other in-house advisory groups. \nHowever, with a tentative transition deadline set for sometime early next year, it's clear that much work remains to be done in terms of gaining consensus. \n\"I don't understand what the end game is here,\" said Commissioner Roy Rogers . \nMerely getting people to attend CPO and commission board meetings isn't enough, Rogers said. What is important, he added, is \"Not having people standing up at meetings and yelling because they didn't feel they had an ability is participate.\" \nSolid Ground Consulting , a Portland firm hired by the county to help with the transition has used comments from past meetings to develop a number of \"building blocks\" to define elements of a new program. \nThose include maintaining the geographical-based elements of the county's 10 current active CPOs, recognizing that many residents identify with other kinds of interests and exploring opportunities to bring other jurisdictions into the mix. \nCommissioner Greg Malinowski , who got his political start through the CPO system, said he would like to open up the range of items tackled by any individual group beyond strictly county issues. If the Oregon Liquor Control Commission is weighing granting a new liquor license, for instance, Malinowski said the CPO in that area could easily be consulted. \nAs things stand now, Malinowski said, anxious constituents routinely call him asking for state contacts to register those concerns. \n\"We're not making it easy for people to find their way to the state with issues that definitely affect local areas,\" Malinowski said. \"This would be a pretty simple way to get more folks involved.\" \nRegardless of any tweaks made to the new system, some people are bound to be disappointed, Commissioner Bob Terry said. \n\"If we do our job,\" he said, \"we'll be making decisions sometimes that not everyone agrees with.\" \nNext up is a chance Dec. 1 for the general public to get involved. An open house, from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., will be held at Portland Community College's Willow Creek campus , 241 Southwest Edgeway Drive, Beaverton. \n-- Dana Tims", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:50:14.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
