HRINY is a CO-OP that was formed under the Affordable Care Act legislation in the U.S.\nMorneau Shepell Inc. (\"Morneau Shepell\" or the \"Company\") has been supplying technology, call centre and back office functions to HRINY since 2013. HRINY represents approximately 3.5 per cent of Morneau Shepell year-to-date revenue, with an insignificant contribution to earnings.\nSince being advised of the wind down, Morneau Shepell has been working cooperatively with HRINY and the State and Federal regulators on an agreement to continue to support HRINY and its 200,000 plus members during the orderly wind down.

The write down relates to deferred implementation charges and internally-developed software originally capitalized and anticipated to be amortized over future periods.\n\"While the news regarding HRINY is disappointing, we remain confident in our overall U.S. growth strategy,\" said Alan Torrie , President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our core benefits administration business and technology offering remain a strategic focus, as evidenced by our acquisition of Ceridian's health and welfare administration business in this space earlier this year, as does our defined benefit pension administration business where we are already the fourth largest administrator in North America .\"\nAbout Morneau Shepell Inc.\nMorneau Shepell is the only human resources consulting and technology company that takes an integrative approach to employee assistance, health, benefits, and retirement needs.
