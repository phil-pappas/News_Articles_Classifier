In summer 2015 Russia's hostilities manner were subjected to serious changes. Ukrainian Armed forces are no more opposed by the joint Russian-terrorist forces as it was in the beginning of the conflict, but by regular Russian Army military units. Russian military command has finished forming up a powerful field unit within occupied territory which consists mainly of the two army corps trained to conduct active offensive. Command and service support of the 1st and 2nd Army corps are provided by purposely formed 12th reserve command of the RF Armed forces South military district (its headquarters is located in Novocherkask, Rostov region). Principal command and staff capacities are occupied by Russian regular officers. 40 per cent of the personnel of these corps are the locals of the occupied territory in the boundaries of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions as well as contractors and mercenaries from Russia who gained combat experience during the conflict in the east of Ukraine and in the other flash points in Russia. Manning space of the two corps makes up to 35 thousand people. In addition there are stand-by forces within the territory of Ukraine comprising 21 RF Armed forces task forces (15 battalion task groups and 6 company task groups) 9 thousand people strong. There are more 53 Russian Armed forces task groups concentrated on the eastern border of our country (39 battalion task groups and 14 company task groups) 50,5 thousand people strong. Regarding the peculiarities of formation and operation manner of the 1st and 2nd Army corps it comes clear that the Russian military authorities has selected troops building model approved by the German military command during the WWII known as Waffen SS. Waffen SS - are SS military units, involved in the battles at the front in the course of the WWII. On the ground of the limited manpower Germany military authorities decreed to engage the volunteers originating from the occupied territories. According to the official policy of the day only German citizens were authorized to serve in the national Armed forces (Wermacht). There were no similar restrictions for the SS therefore it comprised intentionally created waffen-divisions made of foreign volunteers and organized in compliance with ethnic and religious affiliations. German regular officers were in charge of those divisions meanwhile the volunteers were employed as a cannon fodder or assigned to the inferior posts. That is the experience applied by the Russian Armed forces General Staff to form military units designed to wage warfare in the east of Ukraine. We possess of the installation data concerning generals and officers of the Russian Army in charge of the Russian Federation occupation forces. Their case-files are being handed over to the Ukraine General Prosecutor's office in order to open criminal cases. Colonel-general Andrii Serdiukov is in charge of the whole Russian occupation military groups. He is Chief of Staff, first deputy Commanding General of the Southern military district (address call sign  Siedov). In particular it was Russian Armed forces major general Zavizion Oleksii who was in charge of the 1st Army corps till August 2015. He was detached from the post of the Chief of Staff of the 41st Army of the Russian Armed forces Central military district (address call sign  Pilevin). Commander of the 2nd Army corps is the Russian Armed forces major general Nikiforov Valerii detached from the under Commanding General of the 58th Army of the Russian Armed forces Southern military district. Staff turnover has also taken place In this corps. Until recently the corps was commanded by the lieutenant-general Sergii Yudin who was in charge of the 20th Army of the Russian Armed forces Western military district. I'd like to underline one more time that we are opposed by genuine Russian Armed force. A great deal of heavy armored materiel is deployed within occupied territory, echelon stockpiling of the ammunition is being carried out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:59:40.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
