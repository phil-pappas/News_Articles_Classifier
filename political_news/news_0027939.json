Presidents have signed the bipartisan bill into law annually for more than 50 years. \nThe move will force Congress to revise the bill or try to settle a larger budget dispute that led Obama to veto it. \nThe bill would increase defense spending by adding $38 billion to a separate war-fighting account. The White House says that's a \"funding gimmick.\" Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:33:44.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
