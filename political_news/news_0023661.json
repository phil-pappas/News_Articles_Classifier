Abrams, President Barack Obama has no intention of staying on the political sidelines during the 2016 campaign.

After a mass shooting at an Oregon community college earlier this month, Obama promised to \"politicize\" the issue, a comment that outraged gun control opponents. \nObama has a vested interest in handing the keys to the White House to Democrats. White House officials have said privately Obama is following the 2016 campaign closely, as he hopes to see key pillars of his political legacy, from the Affordable Care Act to the Iran nuclear treaty preserved by a Democratic president. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
