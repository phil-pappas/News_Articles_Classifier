Both Republicans and Democrats will be allowed to access the nearly 800 gigabytes of data, but it won't be made available to the public.\n\"A viewing room is set up in the committee office where all committee members and staff — majority and minority — have equal access to view the footage,\" he said. \"It will take significant time to evaluate all of the footage. Out of an abundance of caution to ensure the safety and security of all individuals recorded, the footage will not be released to the public at this time.\"\nThe move is an effort by Republicans to dispel charges that they're withholding details that would cast Planned Parenthood in a more positive light.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Your Voice, Your Choice: Ask Bobby Jindal a question Gov.

But Democrats have said the edited videos released by Daleiden obscured important details, such as the officials emphasizing that the clinics don't make a profit from the aborted fetal tissue, which would be illegal.\nPlanned Parenthood announced Tuesday that it will no longer allow clinics to accept any compensation for the overhead costs of supplying the tissue to biomedical companies, which in turn sell it to medical researchers. The oversight committee is one of several in Congress investigating Planned Parenthood over the matter.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:32:34.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
