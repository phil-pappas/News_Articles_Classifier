Ward boundaries were to remain similar to existing boundaries except that Burnham Military Camp would move from the current Selwyn Central Ward to Ellesmere Ward. The Council proposed to retain the Malvern Community Board with five members but not to retain the Selwyn Central Community Board. \nThe consultation was undertaken as part of a local representation review looking at the number of wards, ward boundaries, the number of councillors, whether councillors should be elected across the whole district or within wards, and whether there should be Community Boards. Councils are required to undertake representation reviews at least once every six years, with the last review carried out in Selwyn in 2009. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:53:28.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
