At least our people here can go to hospitals and schools with no fear of getting drowned'. \nMr Lukutor said he was developing a map of the socio-economic potentials of the area to market the Constituency to create job opportunities. \nHe said his focus was on making life a bit comfortable for the less privileged in the communities and 'positioning' the youth to be of service to their communities. \nMr Lukutor said he knew that Central Government and the district assembly could not address all the developmental challenges in the district, therefore, was lobbying natives and friends abroad to invest in the area. \nMr Lukutor lost the last parliamentary primary to Mr Kobla Mensah Woyome, the incumbent Member of Parliament for the Constituency, and he is hoping to beat Mr Woyome and three others in the November 7, contest to become his party's candidate for the 2016 Parliamentary Election. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:12:15.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
