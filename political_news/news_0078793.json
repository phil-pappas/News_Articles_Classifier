The day became an emphatic win for the NASDAQ , where so many of today’s quickly rising, publicly traded technology companies call home, because of the impressive results. \"Technology bulls in the stock market are about to get paid\" \nBloomberg Business' Anna-Louise Jackson and Joseph Ciolli may have described the rally best in saying that, “technology bulls in the stock market are about to get paid … internet and software stocks have been the biggest contributors to the recovery from August’s selloff and are poised Friday to fuel a rally that will erase losses for 2015 in the S&P 500 at the open of trading” \nAs of mid-morning Friday, these three big name stocks are spiking in price; Google is up nearly $50, Amazon is up $35 and even Microsoft, which many analysts doubted earlier this year given widespread staff cuts, is up $5 (10 percent) per stock. Credit: Wikicommons \nSo, why does it matter? \nLarge tech companies becoming a hit commodity in the stock market is nothing new. But with that being said, it overlooks recent context. Over the past several months, perhaps the highest profile tech stock, Apple ( APPL ), has been getting smoked, because of lagging investor confidence in new product sales, among other things. Meanwhile, most analysts estimate that the Fed’s likelihood of hiking rates in October remains at about 6 percent . \nOutside of Thursday’s tech-centric earnings report wave, and to fuel this idea that tech is eating the NASDAQ, Facebook ( FB ) stock also hit an all-time high this morning at $102 a share . \nThe intraday trading high for Mark Zuckerberg's social network giant was previous $99.73, set just 24 hours prior. Unsurprisingly, Facebook stock continues to be one of the best performers in the S&P 500 this year, up about 30 percent overall. Alphabet \nAlphabet revealed that Q3 revenue was $18.67 billion, beating analysts estimates by $140 million, and notched an earnings-per-share of $7.35, 14 cents greater than predicted. Third quarter revenue was up 13 percent year-over-year. Related 3 Things We Learned From Google's Q3 Earnings Report \n\"Our Q3 results show the strength of Google's business, particularly in mobile search. With six products now having more than 1 billion users globally, we're excited about the opportunities ahead of Google, and across Alphabet,” said Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet and Google, in a statement. Microsoft \nUnder the watchful eye of Satya Nadella, and just shortly after Microsoft was forced to reduce the size of its workforce—totaling 1,000 jobs or about 1 percent of employees—Microsoft turned in a nice earnings report that has investors buzzing. \nThe Windows OS creators logged a Q3 revenue of $20.4 billion and an earnings-per-share of 57 cents, beating analysts exceptions for both figures. On the news, Microsoft’s shares rose as much as 9.8 percent to $52.75 in after-hours trading, which for reference is their highest mark since March 2000 when Microsoft owned a vastly larger sway of both the commercial and enterprise computer market. \nWhat’s fueling this jump? Answer: the cloud, or more specifically cloud computing and data storage tech. Over the past several years, Microsoft’s Azure platform has consistently grown in scale, product development processes and customer base—positioning itself as a major rival to Amazon’s booming AWS cloud biz. In fact, Azure revenue rose 8 percent to $5.9 billion and perhaps more importantly, it’s expected to reach roughly $6.3 billion during the fourth quarter. \n“Customer excitement for new devices, Windows 10, Office 365 and Azure is increasing as we bring together the best Microsoft experiences to empower people to achieve more,” said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer at Microsoft, in a statement. Amazon \nThe fact that Amazon stock is killing may be one of the less surprising revelations floating the web today. On Thursday, Amazon revealed that Q3 revenue was $25.4 billion, up by 23 percent year-over-year, leading CEO Jeff Bezos to credit a growth in Prime subscription, the growth of AWS and the launch of Amazon’s latest tablet product (the Fire) heading into the holiday season. The earnings-per-share figure was 17 cents. The company beat analyst estimates on both marks. As a result, Amazon stock rallied by as much as 12.5 percent yesterday in the after-hours session. \nThe profit margins attached to the e-commerce behemoth’s burgeoning AWS cloud business expanded to 25 percent in the third quarter from 21.4 percent in Q2. Annual sales for just AWS could reach $8 billion for the year. \nAlso on a semi-related note—just in case you were wondering—Bezos’ net worth now roams just north of $54 billion. Nice.
