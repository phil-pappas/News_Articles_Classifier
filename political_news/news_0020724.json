In the more than 20 years prior to 2014, no actors have received royalty payments from SPP, nor have they shared in the pool of profits. \nIn 2014, a landmark industry-wide agreement was signed by Equity and SPADA which provides a small royalty share to key performers engaged on all NZ based productions. At SPP’s insistence, Shortland Street actors are excluded from this agreement. \nEquity would be delighted for SPP to provide royalty payments to all its actors as it claims to provide to other creatives. Copyright protection is important and all creatives should be able to share in the benefits of their work. \nends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:15:42.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
