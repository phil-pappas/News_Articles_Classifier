Promoted stories \n\"We need a body like Fiscal Affairs Scotland which is trusted by citizens, the public sector and the business community to provide objective analysis and commentary on taxation, spending and productivity.\" \nThe think tank's executive directors have frequently been asked to provide analysis and comment for the media, as well as speaking at conferences and seminars. \nHowever, a lack of stable funding means they will be unable to continue with their work until the New Year. \nDiscussions with universities in Scotland and potential private sector funders are continuing in the hope that the charity can carry on with its work in the future. \nMr Black added: \"The trustees will meet again around the end of the year to look at the options, but in the meantime, Fiscal Affairs Scotland does not have the resources to continue.\" Share article \nThe body, which claims to be politically neutral, produced one of its first reports just ahead of last year's independence referendum looking at the financial pros and cons of independence. \nIt has also analysed topics such as Scottish Government oil and gas forecasts, as well as Scottish GDP statistics.
