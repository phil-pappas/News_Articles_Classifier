She noted the location was similar to that of the recent mass shooting in Oregon that left nine people dead. Clinton told the crowd the nation needs to stop greeting such events with what she termed a shrug. Listen / 1:06 \n“It’s time for us to say, 'Wait a minute, we are better than this. Our country is better than this, and there are steps we can take.' \" \nClinton is proposing that any person engaging in \"a high volume of gun sales,\" over the internet or at gun shows, perform background checks like seller at gun stores. \nShe also wants to end the legal immunity now enjoyed by gun manufacturers and dealers. Those protections were put in place in 2005. Clinton opposed them as a senator; her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, supported them as a congressman. \nClinton was joined in Manchester by the mother of a child killed in the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. Former New Hampshire congressman Dick Swett also spoke, sharing a letter Ronald Reagan wrote him in 1994, asking him to support a crime bill that contained restrictions on some assault weapons. Swett did, and lost his reelection. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:55:24.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
