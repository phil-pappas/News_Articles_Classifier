(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nWelcoming guests with the traditional Muslim greeting of \"asalaam alaikum,\" Michelle Obama announced a U.S. pledge of $70 million to help educate 200,000 adolescent girls in Pakistan. \nShe said the money will help build more than a dozen schools, rehabilitate hundreds of facilities and provide training and scholarships to help Pakistani girls \"fulfill their promise\" to become the next generation of doctors, teachers and entrepreneurs. \n\"These girls are all of our girls,\" Mrs. Obama said. \"I have passion for this issue because I cannot look into the eyes of young women and not see myself and not see my own daughters, and not want the best for them.\" \nMrs. Obama was accompanied Thursday by the Pakistan prime minister's wife, Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif, and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who praised the first lady's global effort to educate girls. \nSharif said Mrs. Obama is an inspiration and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, \"could not have a better role model.\" \nJoining hands with Mrs. Obama at one point, Sharif said: \"We shall see about making a difference and we shall not rest until every girl is learning and in school. We shall not rest until every mother is confident that her daughter will have a better life than what she had.\" \nThe U.S. commitment follows Pakistan's recent promise to double education spending, enroll more girls in school and provide more female teachers. \nThe first lady leads a U.S. government effort to help more than 62 million adolescent girls around the world enroll and stay in school. \nMrs. Obama said since announcing the Let Girls Learn initiative this year, the U.S. has received pledges of more than $800 million. The sum includes $350 million from Japan, $200 million from South Korea and $200 million in a partnership with the United Kingdom. \nOfficials say girls in the developing world are less likely to attend primary school and more likely to face barriers to access and completing an education, which benefits themselves, their families and their communities. \nSince launching the program, Mrs. Obama has visited Japan, Cambodia and the United Kingdom to promote the initiative and recognize new partnerships. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Stacy A.
