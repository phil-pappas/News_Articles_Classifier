She estimated they would bring in $22 million a year.\nPreckwinkle also proposed a new tax on the liquids used inside of e-cigarettes that would charge 20 cents for every milliliter of liquid sold. It could bring in an estimated $1.5 million a year.\nCounty Commissioner John Fritchey questioned the proposed taxes.\n“I think that we’re at a tipping point when we start taxing people for any purchase they make and now we’re going to try to tax them when they go to relax from the sales tax they pay by bowling or golfing, we’re not leaving them a lot of escape,” Fritchey said.\nAsked if she was worried that the additional taxes would be viewed as piling on, Preckwinkle replied, “No, it’s very modest.”\nThe money is sorely needed to help pay down a $6.5 billion unfunded pension liability that grows by $1 million each day and to balance a $4 billion operating budget that will include investment in antiquated transportation infrastructure.\nPreckwinkle also proposed doing away with a Cook County State’s Attorney program that treats drug offenders. The program treats roughly 88 people per year for a cost of $710,000.\n“It’s an irresponsible use of our resources,” said Preckwinkle, adding a pilot program run by the Cook County Health and Hospital System would be launched to provide prevention and treatment services to drug users that will hopefully keep its clients out of the criminal justice system.\nIn addition, demolishing three divisions at the Cook County Jail that are largely vacant due to a declining inmate population will save $188 million in maintenance costs over the next 10 years, she said.\nLayoffs, reducing overtime, streamlining technologies also have saved millions, she added.\nShe called ObamaCare a “Godsend” that’s helped reduce the money allocated to the county’s hospital system from $380 million per year — much of it in uncompensated care — when she took office five years ago, to just $125 million next year.\n“In this state for a very long time we have not met our obligations and responsibilities,” Preckwinkle said. “So people who have the misfortune to be in executive positions now are struggling with challenges that have been bequeathed to them by their predecessors’ inaction, inability, irresponsibility, and when you find yourself in a position where you don’t have the resources to the job that needs to be done, you better figure out how to do it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:09:29.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
