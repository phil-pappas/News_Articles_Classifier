That compares to around $4,000 and $6,000 for a typical primetime ad on CNN, according to another person familiar with the situation.\nIt is not surprising that the Democratic debates did not have the same level of viewership as the Republican debates given that the Republican debates \"have a well known list of characters,\" like Donald Trump, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.\nWhile people know Clinton and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, they are less familiar with the other candidates, Lowenthal said.\n\"You don't have the same kind of draw with the Democratic debates as you did with the Republican ones,\" he said.\nAlmost five million 25 to 54 year olds tuned in Tuesday night, marking the highest number ever for that demographic in a Democratic debate.\n(Reporting By Jessica Toonkel; Editing by Franklin Paul and Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:45:12.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
