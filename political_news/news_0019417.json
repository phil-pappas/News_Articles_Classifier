Democrats, however, oppose the measure, fearing removal of the ban will drive up energy prices and harm the economy.\nThe bill has gone through some major changes since Monday, causing some splits among conservative groups that originally supported the measure.\nA contentious rider added without a vote by the House Rules Committee and the leadership sparked dismay by the groups Heritage Action and FreedomWorks this week for adding $500 million for a maritime defense program that the groups called a gift to the maritime industry and its unions.\n  Sanders and Cummings 'sickened' over drug CEO Turing Pharmaceuticals' Martin Shkreli hasn't lowered the price of a drug that he jacked up 5,000 percent.\nBy Robert King • 10/09/15 12:44 PM FreedomWorks withdrew its support for the bill on Wednesday, but by Thursday night said an amendment would be offered Friday to remove the contentious maritime stipend, which would regain their support. Regardless, other conservative groups support the lifting the ban even with the $500 million in added spending.\nThe bill is expected to be voted on by noon, according to some industry groups. But considering the questions over the House speaker race, and Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., bowing out of the race for a new speaker, it is uncertain what will happen.\nThe majority leader's website says legislative business will begin at 9 a.m. Friday, but when votes will begin is still to be determined. The bill lifting the oil export ban, H.R. 702, is the only piece of legislation on the agenda for Friday, according to McCarthy's website.\n\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Lawmaker wants birth control device off the market The Food and Drug Administration has received 5,000 safety reports about Bayer's Essure device.\nBy Robert King • 10/09/15 12:32 PM Top Story Rock bottom?
