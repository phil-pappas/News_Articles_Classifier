The tile is everywhere, both in the apartment and on the terrace. “I went with it,” says Andrisani, who lives in a mostly cream-and-brown-hued Hell’s Kitchen apartment. “I still think of it as a minimalist approach, because I just used one material.”\nRelated Stories This Santa Monica Loft Is a Neon Escape From New York Winters Tour a New York Interior Designers Bogotá Pied-à-terre The rooms pick up the blues of Ponti’s design, in the window treatments, the kitchen cabinetry, and the upholstery throughout. “Ponti specifically matched this tile to the water,” says Andrisani. “That’s why it was ideal. When you step in this, it’s the blue of the ocean.” The ocean features prominently in the apartment: “The way the space is structured,” says Andrisani, who created the open plan, “wherever you are, even if you are in the bathroom, you can see the water.”\nThe terrace (above): When Andrisani first saw the space, he thought to himself, “ ‘Oh, this is pretty.’ But when I saw the view, I was like, ‘Oh my God. Forget it. It’s amazing.’ ” The terrace is laid with the same tile found inside. The table and chairs, by Maurizio Tempestini, were bought at auction.\nThe bedroom.
