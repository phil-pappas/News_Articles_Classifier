It was a little strange at first, but I got quite used to the canine “students” and enjoyed their presence, especially when I felt lonely because of normal tween angst.\nI wish more schools allowed animals. They teach children valuable lessons about empathy, responsibility and gentleness.\nHeather Barclay , Reston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:05:39.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
