In the meantime, items related to the incoming leader have already been put up for auction.\nOn Thursday, a box of chocolates that were made by Trudeau while he was on the campaign trail were put up for sale on Facebook. They eventually sold for $450.\n \n  Ok who wants to open the bidding at $50.00. Top bidder when we close the auction at noon wins this box of chocolates...\nPosted by Eddie Matthews on  Thursday, October 22, 2015 The chocolates were made during a campaign stop in Stratford, Ont., according to Eddie Matthews, the man who listed the chocolates on his Facebook page .\nTrudeau signed the box of chocolates, scrawling \"Thanks for your support!\" above his signature.\nMatthews said the money from the auction will be donated to the Stratford Perth Animal Welfare Centre.\nOn Wednesday, a note written by Trudeau was also put up for sale in an eBay auction. It got 62 bids and went for $12,301.\nThe note, from 2013, captures a written exchange between Michael Kydd and Trudeau, while both were on a Porter Airlines flight.\nKydd saw Trudeau on the plane, and asked a flight attendant to pass a note on his behalf. In the note, Kydd wrote: \"Justin, Can you really beat Harper? Wishing you all the best, Mike.\"\nTrudeau responded back to Kydd, scrawling \"Just watch me,\" on the same piece of paper. The phrase was famously used by Trudeau's late father, former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, in an interview during the 1970 October Crisis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:47:56.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
