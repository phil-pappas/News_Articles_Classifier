Home for Heroes in Tappan wants to bring it to its campus at Camp Shanks. 1206 CONNECT 7 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nA program that comes to the aid of homeless veterans may soon be helping Rockland's dilapidated animal shelter. \nOfficials with the Hi Tor Animal Care Center have entered into an agreement with the Homes for Heroes program to obtain a piece of land on the site of the former Camp Shanks in Tappan. \nHomes for Heroes, which provides housing for homeless disabled veterans and their families, has invited Hi Tor to share some of its property in exchange for hiring veterans and creating a military service dog training program. \n\"We are thrilled to be working with Homes for Heroes and delighted that we can finally begin work on the best possible shelter for our animals,\" said Sharon Needelman, president of Hi Tor's board. \"Our goal is to create a fabulous, safe and healthy environment for pets and people.\" \nJohn Murphy, president of Homes for Heroes, said his organization needed to account for its uses of the land as it applies for ownership. \n\"Since one of the acceptable uses is an animal shelter, Hi Tor is a perfect match,\" Murphy said. \nHi Tor takes in about 2,500 animals each year at the facility it has been in since its founding in 1973. Its board has been seeking to move out of the building on Firemens Memorial Drive in Pomona because of plumbing, electrical and structural problems that have made it unsound, Needleman said. \"It's beyond repair,\" she said. \nShe said the search for a new home has been a long one. \n\"We've been searching for as long as I've been on the board, which is six years,\" Needleman said Monday. \nShe said Hi Tor will not have to pay Homes for Heroes for the land or for rent. The new facility would be on about 3 acres â€” triple the size of the current shelter. \nNeedleman said building a new shelter would cost about $1 million, about $850,000 of which has been secured. \nThe parcel is off Western Highway, behind the Homes for Heroes residences and away from private homes, Needleman said. She said Hi Tor hoped to muffle concerns over barking by soundproofing the building. \nThe next step would be to complete a preliminary design for the shelter, which Homes for Heroes must submit to be able to acquire the land that it now leases. Needleman said she hoped to begin work in 2016. \nHi Tor's annual budget is about $500,000; about $180,000 comes from the county and its five towns, the rest is from donations. \nOrangetown Town Supervisor Andy Stewart said the project provided mutual benefit because it included training companion dogs for veterans and other people. He also said it was one of the few uses approved for surplus federal land. Stewart was confident the building's soundproofing and setbacks would address any concerns about noise. \nHi Tor's relocation efforts have contained a number of twists. In June 2014, Hi Tor created a new fundraising committee after a key volunteer quit in a dispute with leadership after helping to bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars. In August 2014, Hi Tor signed a letter of intent for an agreement with Rockland officials to secure new building at no expense to taxpayers. This agreement never moved forward. \nHalloween adoption event Hi Tor Animal Care Center is holding a Halloween adoption event from noon to 5 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 24, at its facility at 65 Firemens Memorial Drive in Pomona. All adoption fees are being waved that day. All dogs will be dressed up in costumes; a pet boutique and bake sale.also will be offered. 1206 CONNECT 7 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1LH1iIQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:10:42.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
