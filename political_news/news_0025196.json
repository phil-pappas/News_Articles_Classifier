(Photo: Courtesy of Steve Undercoffer) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Williamson County Republican Party has waded into the traditionally nonpartisan Franklin city elections, a party official said, by endorsing political newcomer Steven Undercoffer for at-large alderman. \nUndercoffer is taking on incumbent Alderman Pearl Bransford under a new system that allows challengers to essentially choose their opponents for at-large alderman. Previously, the city's four at-large aldermen were elected as the top four vote-getters from a pool of candidates. \nIncumbent Aldermen Brandy Blanton and Clyde Barnhill are running for reelection unopposed, as is Mayor Ken Moore. \nIncumbent Alderman Ann Petersen is facing a challenge from another political newcomer, Peter Dellos, though the Williamson County Republican Party has not endorsed in that race. \nThe party's executive director, Jean Barwick, said on Friday that although the group has opted against endorsing candidates for local office in the past, an initiative from the Republican National Committee is encouraging local groups to get more involved in city and county elections. \nShe said it was the first time, as far as she knew, that the party had endorsed anyone for Franklin alderman. \nUndercoffer's views about affordable housing and his contention that the city should keep a Confederate monument at the center of Franklin's historic town square better align with party values. \nWhile Bransford has long advocated for measures aimed at boosting affordable housing, such as an ordinance that would require developers to set aside a portion of new housing units as affordable or pay a fee, Barwick said Undercoffer believes \"that is an issue better left to the market.\" \nIn the \"Key Points\" section of his website , Undercoffer wrote that such rules, which advocates say will go a long way to ensuring a diverse housing market, are \"an example of levying a special tax on one group that causes housing prices to be even higher.\" \nHe also wrote that he disagreed with Bransford, who — in the wake of a shooting at a historically black South Carolina church where a white man is charged with killing nine parishioners — suggested that a Confederate monument may send a less-than-inclusive message at the heart of the city's downtown . \n\"My position is that soldiers on both sides served with honor,\" Undercoffer wrote. \"We should not dishonor their service by trying to remove that part of history.\" \nUndercoffer did not respond to calls for comment. \nPearl Bransford (Photo: City of Franklin) \nBransford, whose family was active in the civil rights movement, told The Tennessean at the time that an archival setting would be more appropriate for the statue and that opening up the space would allow for a centerpiece that could better reflect Franklin's diverse population. \nOn Friday, she declined to comment via text message, beyond saying that she could not recall a party endorsing any Board of Mayor and Aldermen candidates in the past. \nWilliamson County Democratic Party Chairman Chris Polk said his group hasn't endorsed anyone and doesn't plan to. \n\"We have to have a two-party system with parties that are willing to govern, which means compromise,\" he said. \"If one side is completely and unequivocally willing to compromise, then we have what we have in Washington, and I don't want that in my city, my county or my state.\" \nPolk added that although Bransford has \"served our city well, I could not tell what her political leaning is,\" and that she has not been active with the local Democratic Party, as far as he knew. \nMoore said that although he's active in some Republican politics — he's set to host GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson at his home — at the city level, he tries to look at city issues without that lens. \n\"Franklin city politics has been traditionally nonpartisan and it's worked very well,\" he said. \"If you look to see how the board has worked — how the city has worked — I think that's helped us.\" \nReach Jill Cowan at 615-664-2150 and on Twitter @jillcowan .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:51:47.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
