Marco Rubio announced Monday that his team nabbed top conservative mind and healthcare policy wonk Avik Roy for his 2016 run.\nRoy most recently worked for Gov. Rick Perry's short-lived 2016 bid and is currently a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the opinion editor for Forbes. In addition, Roy was a healthcare adviser for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid. He is known as one of the sharpest critics of the Affordable Care Act.\nBoth parties announced the move on Twitter Monday morning.\nIn a tweet sent out Monday morning, Roy argued that \"no candidate expresses — and embodies — the American dream better\" than Rubio himself, adding that he is \"honored\" to advise the Florida senator on policy.\n  Iraq: ISIS leader Baghdadi hit in airstrike The statement said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was \"transported in a vehicle\" but \"his health status was unknown.\"\nBy Barbara Boland • 10/11/15 2:57 PM No candidate expresses&#8212and embodies&#8212the American dream better than @MarcoRubio . I'm honored to be advising Sen. Rubio on policy. @TeamMarco — Avik Roy (@Avik) October 12, 2015 \nRubio, who currently sits fourth in the Washington Examiner 's latest power rankings , returned the favor with a tweet welcoming him to the team.\n. @Avik Welcome to the team! Glad to have you on board.— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 12, 2015 \n\"Avik is helping us as a volunteer adviser,\" Rubio communications director Alex Conant told the Examiner on Roy's hire. \"We appreciate his support as Marco lays out his agenda for a new American Century.\"\nWhile Roy has jumped on the team, he has not always seen eye to eye with Rubio over the past few months. In a May column, Roy criticized the tax reform plan laid out by Rubio and Sen. Mike Lee, saying it promotes \"social engineering\" , as the plan includes a new child tax credit of $2,500 which would be refundable against income and payroll taxes.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Republicans not taking 'no' for an answer from Ryan His committee spokesman said there's no news to report so far, and that was likely to be the case all week.\nBy Pete Kasperowicz • 10/12/15 9:37 AM Roy argued that there is no evidence that the child tax credit would actually produce more children, and that the plan would eliminate taxes in one way or another for a large part of the population, adding that the U.S. tax code is the most progressive in \"the industrialized world\" and would be made worse by the plan.\nRoy joins Rubio's team ahead of the third Republican presidential debate, which will focus on the economy. The 2016 hopeful currently sits third in the latest RealClearPolitics national average with 9.9 percent, with only Donald Trump and Ben Carson leading him.\nRoy declined to comment on the move when reached by the Examiner. \nTop Story Study: Union collapses if workers allowed to leave it The decline underscores why public-sector union leaders opposed the court's decision in Harris v.
