The latest action would be the first purge of incomplete applications. \nKobach described the culling of pending applications as just \"common sense\" to maintain accurate records. \nAbout 10 states require voters to provide a photo ID at the polls to vote, but Kansas is one of only four that also requires proof of citizenship. Kobach has argued that the requirement prevents election fraud by unqualified voters, but Democrats have accused him of attempting to discourage voting by poor people and others who don't have passports or easy access to documents. \nLeading Democrats filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of two young prospective voters, claiming the proof-of-citizenship rule and the records culling violates their constitutional rights. \n\"This is something that makes Kansas and Secretary Kobach exceptional — and I don't mean that in a good way,\" said Dale Ho, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Voting Rights Project. \nKobach said discarding the \"suspended\" applications does not constitute a purge of voter rolls. \n\"It's impossible to purge someone from a list one is not on,\" Kobach said. \"These are people who have never completed registration.\" \nKobach said county officials should finish winnowing their records within a few working days. But some said the process will take longer. Jamie Shew, the county clerk in Douglas County and a Democrat, said he's planning to notify people with incomplete registrations and give them 90 days to provide missing paperwork. \nMore than half of the incomplete registration forms were from applicants listing no political affiliation. Twenty-three percent were for people who wanted to register as Republicans and 19 percent, Democrats. Forty percent of the forms came from residents under 30. \nKobach, in his second term as secretary of state, persuaded lawmakers this year to authorize his office to prosecute election fraud cases. \nThe only other states with proof-of-citizenship laws are Arizona, Alabama and Georgia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, though the last two haven't fully put them into effect. \n___ \nAlso contributing was Associated Press writer Bill Draper in Kansas City, Missouri. \n___ \nFollow John Hanna on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apjdhanna \n.
