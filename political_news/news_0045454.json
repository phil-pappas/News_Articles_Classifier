A four-star rating is the highest possible score, earned only by charities that prove to be transparent, reliable, and fiscally responsible.\n\"LUNGevity's coveted four-star rating puts it in a very select group of high-performing charities,\" shared Michael Thatcher , president and CEO of Charity Navigator. \"Out of the thousands of nonprofits Charity Navigator evaluates, only one out of four earns 4 stars â€“ a rating that demands rigor, responsibility and commitment to openness. LUNGevity's supporters should feel much more confident that their hard-earned dollars are being used efficiently and responsibly when it acquires such a high rating.\"\n\"The Charity Navigator recognition of four stars is a testament to LUNGevity's commitment to ensuring that our organization's priority is, first and always, to accomplish our vision of a world where no one dies of lung cancer,\" said Andrea Ferris , president of LUNGevity Foundation. \"It's important for our supporters to know that we take the fight against lung cancer very seriously. Donors can be confident that their contributions are tightly focused on lung cancer research, education, and advocacy and that our goals are being met effectively, efficiently, and transparently.\"\nVisit LUNGevity's Charity Navigator profile here .\nFor more information on LUNGevity Foundation, please visit www.LUNGevity.org .\nAbout Lung Cancer\n1 in 15 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in their lifetime More than 221,000 people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year About 60%-65% of all new lung cancer diagnoses are among people who have never smoked or are former smokers Lung cancer takes more lives than the next three leading cancers (colorectal, breast, and prostate) combined Only 17% of all people diagnosed with lung cancer will survive 5 years or more, BUT if it's caught before it spreads, the chance for 5-year survival improves dramatically\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lungevity-earns-top-score-from-charity-navigator-300162908.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC33253&Transmission_Id=201510201053PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC33253&DateId=20151020", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lungevity-earns-top-score-from-charity-navigator-300162908.html", "http://www.lungevity.org/", "http://goo.gl/VpgD2V", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:42:06.097+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
