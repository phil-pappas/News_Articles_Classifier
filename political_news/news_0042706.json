Gov. Cuomo has until Dec. 1 to pick one of seven nominees to replace Lippman. Previous Next Enlarge \nALBANY — Former U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia and Westchester District Attorney Janet DiFiore are among seven nominees to become New York’s next top judge. \nThe state’s Commission on Judicial Nomination on Thursday submitted the seven nominees to Gov. Cuomo, who has until Dec. 1 to pick one of them to replace retiring Court of Appeals Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman. \n“We’ll review the list,” said Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi, declining to comment further. \nLippman, 70, has reached the court’s mandatory retirement age and will step down on New Year’s Eve. It is one of two Court of Appeals vacancies that Cuomo must fill in the coming weeks. \nJudge Susan Read, a Republican, resigned from the court in August and the nominating commission is expected to release its nominees for that seat in December. \nCuomo’s selections — which must be confirmed by the state Senate — are likely to come under intense scrutiny because of the court’s leftward tilt during his administration. Xanthos Julia Freelance NYDN/Xanthos Julia Freelance NYDN Michael Garcia, who served as Manhattan U.S. Attorney from 2005 through 2008 and led the probe that took down Gov. Eliot Spitzer, is up for consideration to take Lippman’s seat. \nThe governor has so far made four nominations to the seven-member court, all of them Democrats. \nRead’s departure left the seven-member court with only one GOP member — Judge Eugene F. Piggot Jr. — and many conservatives and business groups are pressing the governor to appoint another Republican. \nThe list of nominees for Lippman’s seat contains two Republicans: Garcia, who served as Manhattan U.S. Attorney from 2005 through 2008 and led the probe that took down Gov. Eliot Spitzer; and A. Gail Prudenti, who was the state’s chief administrative judge until she stepped down in July. \nDiFiore, who became Westchester’s top prosecutor in 2006, is seen by many as the favorite because of her close ties to Cuomo. In 2011, the governor appointed her to head the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, where she served for nearly two years. \n“I am grateful to the Commission on Judicial Nomination for its nomination and for recognizing my experience, qualifications, and fitness to become chief judge,” DiFiore said in a statement. “If appointed by Gov. Cuomo and confirmed by the New York State Senate, I would be privileged to serve as Chief Judge and would fulfill the duties of that office to the best of my ability.” Viorel Florescu/for New York Daily News Westchester County D.A. Janet DiFiore has close ties to Cuomo and is considered a favorite. \nAlso on the list of nominees was Stephen Younger, a prominent lawyer who headed up Cuomo's transition team in 2010 and who is a regular donor to the governor. \nYounger, a law school classmate of the governor, has given Cuomo at least $23,000 in campaign donations since 2006. \nThe nominees were chosen from a pool of 33 people who submitted applications for Lippman’s post. \n“I am gratified at the extraordinary quality and diverse backgrounds of our applicants,” said Commission Chairwoman Judith Kaye. “That so many exceptional candidates were motivated to apply demonstrates the remarkable strength and depth of the legal profession in the State of New York.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:31:02.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
