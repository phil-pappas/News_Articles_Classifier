(Associated Press) more > By Ben Wolfgang - The Washington Times - Sunday, October 18, 2015 \nDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton is holding up the failed Copenhagen global warming summit as proof that under her leadership, the U.S. can bring other nations on board an international effort to curb emissions and fight climate change. \nBut some on the left say the 2009 meeting is nothing to be proud of, and conservative critics say the Obama administration has committed the U.S. to costly new environmental policies while China and other major polluters do very little. \nAs the former secretary of state struggles to distinguish herself on climate change, Mrs. Clinton raised the Copenhagen meeting — in the early days of President Obama’s tenure — during last week’s Democratic presidential candidates primary debate. She also discussed the gathering in her 2014 memoir, “Hard Choices,” explaining how she, Mr. Obama and other administration officials crashed a meeting between Chinese officials and other delegations and persuaded them to sign a climate deal. \nBut the deal they signed was virtually toothless and did not require China , the world’s top greenhouse-gas polluter, to take any concrete actions. In the immediate aftermath of Copenhagen , environmental activists blasted the agreement and cast the meeting as a letdown at best. \nEven Mr. Obama in 2009 said “people are justified about being disappointed” about what was and wasn’t accomplished at the meeting. \nDespite that, Mrs. Clinton has made the Copenhagen summit a centerpiece of her climate change platform. Like other Democratic candidates, she argues that it is vital to get China , India and other nations to agree to real actions on climate change. \nHer actions in Copenhagen , she says, prove that she can get that done if elected president. \n“When we met in Copenhagen in 2009 and, literally, President Obama and I were hunting for the Chinese, going throughout this huge convention center, because we knew we had to get them to agree to something, because there will be no effective efforts against climate change unless China and India join with the rest of the world,” she said at last week’s debate. “They told us they’d left for the airport. We found out they were having a secret meeting. We marched up, we broke in, we said, ‘We’ve been looking all over for you. Let’s sit down and talk about what we need to do.’ And we did come up with the first international agreement that China has signed.” \nThat agreement, in essence, called on all nations to commit to addressing climate change but required virtually nothing in the way of specific actions. \nMrs. Clinton ’s ardent defense of her work in Copenhagen had some environmentalists scratching their heads. \n“I can’t believe @HillaryClinton brought up Copenhagen as a foreign policy victory. Just shocking disconnect from reality,” Duncan Meisel, coordinator of the Fossil Freeze program with the environmental group 350.org, tweeted during last week’s debate. \nOthers on the left expressed similar disappointment — and, in some cases, astonishment — that Mrs. Clinton would cite Copenhagen in a positive way. \nThe Clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment. \n‘What the deal is’ \nIn the years since the summit, the White House has continued climate negotiations with Beijing. Last year, the administration and China made a joint announcement that both countries would commit to more greenhouse-gas reductions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:08:27.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
