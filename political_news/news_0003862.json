He cut the Jeb Bush-bashing Instagram ads that have been called “The future of American politics.” And he is seemingly the only person at Trump Tower other than the boss with an Apple computer at his desk. Meet Justin McConney, Trump’s 29-year-old social media whiz.\nThe GOP front-runner’s campaign has set a new benchmark for engaging the press and public online. His tweets drive news cycles and his 15-second Instagram videos often earn enough media to perform the function of ad buys, but for free.\nAs Dan Pfeiffer, a former top communications adviser to President Obama, tweeted last week, Trump “is way better at the Internet than anyone else in the GOP which is partly why he is winning.”\nThat’s in large part because of McConney, the Trump Organization’s director of new media. It is McConney who has pushed the businessman to deliberately build a social-media presence and experiment with new platforms and types of content.\n“Justin McConney has his ear to the social media world, and he’s ahead of the curve,” said Sam Nunberg, a former political adviser to Trump. “He’s innovative, well-connected and always thinking about how to push the envelope.”\nWhen McConney took on the role in February 2011, Trump had 300,000 followers on Twitter. Today, he has more than 4.3 million followers on the platform, where his campaign has made its biggest mark.\n“Justin has taken Trump's instinct to Tweet and developed it into an effective way to communicate with voters and fellow candidates,” said Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for Twitter’s government team.\nThe son of the Trump Organization’s controller, Jeffrey McConney, the younger McConney graduated from Manhattan’s School of Visual Arts in 2008 and landed gigs as an assistant editor to the Trump-owned Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants in 2009. He went on to work as an “apprentice editor” on Trump’s reality TV show, “The Apprentice,” before pitching the boss on his current role.\nTrump-Bush feud fizzles as race shifts to serious By Eli Stokols\nMcConney — who declined to comment for this story but recently granted an interview to the marketing and advertising publication the Drum — became convinced that Trump should turn his vivid putdowns and pronouncements into fodder for social media, a perfect outlet for his musings on the topics of the day.\nToday, Trump, who functions as his own communications strategist, is an avid user of Twitter. He takes occasional tweet suggestions from those around him but composes most himself, tapping them into his Samsung smartphone, calling them into his office or dictating them to a nearby aide. He also decides which of his supporters to retweet, a hallmark of his Twitter feed.\nLong before Trump became a candidate, McConney advised the businessman to tweet multiple times a day and to begin sharing his thoughts in no-frills videos — on YouTube, Vine, and now Instagram — in which he speaks straight to camera from behind his desk.\nTo further drive engagement, McConney encouraged Trump to live-tweet major cultural events, including a 2012 Republican debate.\nMcConney and Trump also began soliciting questions from fans, some of which Trump would then answer in videos uploaded to Facebook to take advantage of a new feature that allowed them to begin playing directly in users homepage feeds.\nLast summer, as the ALS ice bucket challenge swept the Internet, Trump faced mounting pressure from Vince McMahon, Mike Tyson and cartoon character Homer Simpson — all of whom nominated Trump when completing the challenge themselves — to participate. He dug in his heels, but McConney convinced his boss to take the plunge.\nThe resulting video, in which Miss Universe and Miss USA dump Trump-branded bottled water into buckets and then onto the mogul’s head on the roof of Trump tower, garnered 1.3 million YouTube views and multiple headlines about how Trump’s hair had been proven to be real.\nTrump was so pleased with the result that he joked to one of his female assistants, all of whom are famously good-looking, that she should go on a date with McConney (no date came to pass).\nLike many employees of Trump’s business, McConney has been called into service on the political campaign, where he has made a splash.\nIn April, when many political observers still doubted he would enter the presidential race, Trump released a video entitled “Make America Great Again.” Written by Trump and cut by McConney for next to nothing, the 45-second spot intersperses stock footage with Trump speaking direct-to-camera at his desk. It begins with somber horn music and a forlorn-looking homeless man sitting on a park bench. It succinctly summarizes Trump’s message of a down-on-its luck country overrun with undocumented immigrants and led by do-nothing politicians but capable of regaining its greatness.\nLike much of the content produced by McConney, as well as much else associated with Trump, the ad may come across as cheesy to highbrows. But large segments of the public love it.\n“That ad is one of the best ads of the entire cycle,” said Republican messaging guru Frank Luntz, who has tested the video with focus groups. “The amazing thing is that it’s not that well-produced but the tone and the topic are perfect.”\nLuntz — who Trump personally insulted in August after members of his post-debate focus group spoke ill of Trump on Fox News — said that the video performs well with conservatives, moderate Republicans, swing Republicans and swing Democrats. “There are so many divisions in the electorate right now, and that ad manages to bridge those divisions,” Luntz said. “That’s rare.”\nIn July, McConney oversaw a new entry into the inappropriate-use-of-stock-footage subgenre of gaffes when an image he created superimposed a picture of Waffen-SS soldiers marching in front of a picture of the White House. The memorable image also featured Trump’s face frowning seriously, hundred-dollar bills and an American flag.\nHispanic Chamber chief on defensive over Trump invite By Eliza Collins\nTwo people familiar with the project said McConney oversaw the composition of the image, though one of those people said McConney was not personally responsible for pulling the stock photograph of Nazi fighters. Trump deleted the tweet and his campaign issued a statement saying, “A young intern created and posted the image.”\nWith his background in video editing, McConney, who often takes photos and shoots video at Trump’s corporate events, has taken most enthusiastically to visual media like Instagram, a platform for which he signed up his boss in 2013.\nIf McConney makes a lasting contribution to American politics, it will likely be the 15-second videos — kept short to break through in a hyper-saturated media environment — he composes on Instagram for a candidate who so far has refused to buy television advertising.\nA video posted in August took a clip of Barbara Bush saying her son Jeb should not run for president and that “We’ve had enough Bushes.” It ends with the message, “Mother knows best Jeb!” Another video features a woman falling asleep directly behind Bush as he speaks at a campaign event.\nThe videos have been played and written about extensively by media outlets — including a Gizmodo article hailing them as the next big thing in political media — and the Bush campaign responded with a video of its own, calling out Trump for his record of liberal positions.\nUnsurprisingly, Trump has come to love the massive social media presence he has built with McConney’s help.\n“It’s great,” he said in South Carolina in July. “It’s like owning a newspaper without the losses.”\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/09/22/exclusive-interview-justin-mcconney-trump-s-director-social-media", "https://twitter.com/20committee/status/621031805290987520/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKqCEuv5c6M", "http://gizmodo.com/donald-trumps-instagram-attack-ads-are-the-future-of-am-1727721070"], "published": "2015-10-01T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:16:20.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
