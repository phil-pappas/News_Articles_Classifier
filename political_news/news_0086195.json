Here she shares her insights into studying at Bolton and some of the support services for students 'I studied BA (Hons) Photography. I started to take photographs when I was 15. I love to take photographs as I am a very strong visual person. I am deaf and my vision is the strongest sense of all. I preferred the practical work in the modules but to be honest I thought all the modules were great. I received so much support at the university - the staff have been very helpful. I would not have graduated if it wasn't for them. I had much support from my tutors and the disability team; I had one to one support, group tutorials and a disability advisor. I received a lot of support from the disability service - they offered me exactly what I needed, for which I am very grateful. I have been on many trips including galleries, museums and locations like the countryside and different cities. I went to Toronto during my trip to Canada, it was the best experience and I would go again though there are many challenges. 'I would recommend any student to choose the University of Bolton because the tutors are very friendly and so supportive. There are lots of options for activities, trips, challenges and loads of fun! At the start I wasn't too sure whether to go to the University but when I got the offer I decided to take it because it wasn't far from my home. It was the best experience of my life and after three whole years of studying I achieved the best result. I couldn't believe it! I will never forget the memories I made here - and I promise you - if you come to Bolton, you will not regret it.' distributed by This content was issued by University of Bolton on the 2015-09-25 and was initially posted on www.bolton.ac.uk.
