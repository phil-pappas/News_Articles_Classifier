Those companies made $2.6 million in the past five months.\nWhile it’s not uncommon to have occasional conflicts, Industry’s situation is out of the ordinary, said Kathy Feng, executive director of California Common Cause, a government watchdog group.\n“In the city of Industry, for four out of five of the electeds to be employed by contracting companies is not a coincidence, it’s part of a pattern that the city has employed, where kickbacks and corruption are the name of the game,” Feng said.\nThe close ties raise questions about whether the council makes decisions to benefit the public or to benefit themselves, Feng said. Industry has so few residents and such strict control over housing that it makes it hard for a healthy democracy to exist, she said.\n“It becomes something where they can continue to milk the system with so little scrutiny,” she said. “These are very much industry towns, not unlike what we might have had centuries ago, where people feel very beholden to the city bosses, in every sense of the word.”\nCalifornia Attorney General Kamala Harris’ office declined to comment on the legality, referring only to its conflict of interest guide.\nThe guide states that a public official must disqualify himself or herself from a decision that affects their source of income. The council does recuse themselves, with each of the four members doing so monthly, according to meeting minutes.\nAdvertisement\n“The council members themselves don’t have an ownership interest in these entities, they’re employees. Their financial interest would arguably be their paycheck,” said City Attorney Jamie Casso. “They recuse themselves out of an abundance of caution should there be any conflict of interest, potential or actual.”\nA recusal doesn’t resolve the “fundamental conflict of interest,” Feng said.\n“If one person recuses themselves, there are so many people that have their fingers in the cookie jar that the conflict still exists,” she said.\nJessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School and president of the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission, said the number of council members with conflicts seemed unusual, but that she would be more worried if they didn’t recuse themselves or disclose their ties.\n“In a perfect world, you get invested, well-qualified people who don’t have any personal stake in the city other than wanting to do a good job, but no one lives in that perfect world,” Levinson said. “Some of this is bound to happen, but the number is particularly high in this case, and the relationship is particularly direct.”\nSince 2012, Parriott has worked for Historical Resources Inc, a for-profit company whose only client is the city’s Homestead Museum. Historical Resources receives more than $250,000 quarterly from Industry. The city couldn’t say how much Parriott makes, as it claims it doesn’t maintain Historical Resources’ financial records. Historical Resources, however, says it does.\nNeither could provide Parriott’s salary; his economic interest forms list only a vague $10,000 to $100,000 range.\nBoth Mayor Mark Radecki and appointed Councilman Abraham Cruz work as salaried supervisors for Square Root Golf & Landscape, which makes about $200,000 a month from Industry. It’s one of two landscaping companies paid millions each year in the 12-square-mile city. Square Root’s co-owner Bert Spivey serves on the planning commission.\nRadecki previously did work for former Mayor David Perez, who came under investigation by the district attorney and the state controller after an audit found his companies made $326 million from its contracts with Industry over the past two decades.\nPerez’s family backed Radecki in the election, along with Cory Moss and Newell Ruggles. Moss works for CNC Engineering, which collects about $400,000 from the city every month. CNC Engineering, a consultant on most of Industry’s major projects, has operated the Industry Hills Expo Center at a significant loss for years, according to the city.\nRuggles works for Haddick’s Towing and Autobody, which maintains the city’s fleet of vehicles and handles towing for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Industry station. It made about $6,000 directly from the city since June, according to check registers voted on by the council.\nOnly Ruggles responded to calls for comment.\n“Industry, it’s a very small community,” he said. “Everybody is connected in one way or another.”\nAbout the Author Reach the author at jason.henry@sgvn.com or follow Jason on Twitter: @JasonMHenry .\nFull bio and more articles by Jason Henry Back to top", "external_links": ["http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20150908/long-time-industry-city-councilman-steps-down-citing-personal-issues", "http://www.sgvtribune.com/government-and-politics/20150425/city-of-industry-pays-former-mayor-326-million-in-contracts-over-decades", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=507", "http://twitter.com/JasonMHenry", "http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/government-and-politics/20150501/city-of-industry-owned-expo-center-lost-millions-but-still-offers-friends-and-family-plan", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:07:50.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
