(CNN) Hillary Clinton will swing through California in early November for a series of star-studded fundraisers, according to invitations obtained by CNN. Christina Aguilera, the pop star and reality TV show judge, and her husband, Matthew Rutler, will host a fundraiser for Clinton at their Beverly Hills home on Nov. 4. The event will feature a \"special performance\" by Aguilera and is more expensive than other Clinton fundraisers: Attendees are being asked to raise $10,000 for four tickets to the gathering. The Golden State has been fertile ground for Clinton's fundraising. To date, she has headlined 22 fundraisers in the state, second only to the 30 that the former secretary of state has headlined in New York. Before the Aguilera event, Clinton will headline a $2,700-a-ticket fundraiser in Sacramento hosted by Eleni Tsakopoulos Kounalakis, the former ambassador to Hungary during Clinton's time as Secretary of State. Read More Clinton will then travel to the Bay Area for an event in Los Altos hosted by Anne Wojcicki, the CEO of the personal genomics company 23andMe, Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube, and Esther Wojcicki, the vice chair of the Creative Commons board of directors. Tickets for this fundraiser run between $500 and $2,700. On Nov. 5, Clinton will headline a fundraiser in Los Angeles hosted by Rob Reiner, the actor, producer and political activist. RELATED: Clinton's Golden State dash for cash Clinton last visited California in late September for a series of fundraisers ahead of the close of the third fundraising quarter. Her presidential campaign raised more than $28 million in that quarter, slightly more than the $25 million raised by Bernie Sanders. It is likely that Clinton's November trip through California will include additional fundraisers, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:07:02.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
