During this fast-paced afternoon, attendees will have an opportunity to hear from and interact with experts in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Presentation topics include the latest information on development of biomass feedstocks in Mississippi, environmental permitting for wood pellet and biomass plants, combined heat and power (CHP) potential in Mississippi, updates on the rapidly expanding solar energy installations around the state, and Rankin County school district’s push for energy efficiency. This year, the Energy Awareness Symposium will feature a special moderated panel discussion with the two candidates running for the positon of Mississippi Public Service Commissioner for the Central District – Brent Bailey (Republican) and Cecil Brown (Democrat). The Mississippi Public Service Commission is the state agency that regulates telecommunications, electric, gas, water and sewer utilities. The Commissioner is charged with assuring that rates and fees for services are just and reasonable, that the service rendered is reasonably adequate, and that any facilities constructed or acquired are required for the convenience and necessity of the public. This will be an excellent opportunity to hear from both candidates and learn more about important issues prior to the November 3 statewide election. Individual registrations are $35 and include lunch. Registration for full-time high school and college students is free. Seating is limited, please visit http://innovate.ms/events/ to register. Sponsorship opportunities are still available for this excellent networking event.

MBREC was created in 1998 and incorporated in 2000 as a nonprofit corporation with the mission to increase energy efficiency and economic opportunities for Mississippi’s biomass and renewable energy resources. MBREC is managed by Innovate Mississippi, a nonprofit organization with the mission to drive innovation and technology-based economic development for the State of Mississippi. 10/14/15 Posted October 14, 2015 - 10:20 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
