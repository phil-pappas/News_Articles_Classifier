That’s the assessment of this week’s POLITICO Caucus, our bipartisan survey of the top activists, operatives and strategists in the early states. This week, the Caucus has expanded to include South Carolina and Nevada in addition to our insiders already participating in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nThe consensus on Sanders’ need for big money was strong: 83 percent of South Carolina Democrats, 62 percent of Nevada Democrats and 54 percent of New Hampshire Democrats said he cannot beat Clinton with only small-dollar donors. Of Iowa Democrats, 40 percent said the same.\nInsiders from those states said that at best he could win a contest or two, but the big donations and unlimited contributions that a super PAC brings would be essential if his campaign stretches into the later stages of the primary season.\n\"Small donors are an important component but if the campaign drifts into the larger more expensive states he will need more dollars than he will receive from just small donors,\" said one South Carolina Democrat, who like all participants was granted anonymity in order to speak freely.\nAgreed an Iowa Democrat, \"During the caucus, absolutely. But it's difficult to go deep into the primary without the resources to back a full campaign in several states.\"\nSanders, a frequent critic of Wall Street and the Citizens United decision that ushered in the super PAC era, has repeatedly pledged not to accept super PAC support. In the second quarter of the year, he pulled in more money from the smallest of the small-dollar donors – those giving $200 or less – than any other candidate in the 2016 field. And his strength among small donors appears to have carried over into the third quarter too.\nWhile his full financial filing for the last period hasn’t been released yet, his campaign said Wednesday that he raised more than $25 million, nearing Clinton’s $28 million haul.\nIn 2008, Barack Obama also relied heavily on small-dollar donors, Caucus insiders noted. But some cautioned that that was before super PACs assumed the outsized role they now play in presidential contests, ratcheting up the costs of campaigns dramatically.\n\"Small donors might make some larger donors start to pay attention but you can't win by relying exclusively on small donors,\" a South Carolina Democrat said.\n\"Barack Obama raised millions from small donors, but his candidacy was unprecedented in doing this,\" noted another. \"Bernie Sanders does not have the same status as a candidate that Barack Obama did.\"\nRespondents from Iowa and New Hampshire, who have seen more of Sanders, and where his poll numbers have steadily increased, were more likely to say Sanders could beat Clinton relying solely on smaller-dollar contributors than were Democrats from South Carolina and Nevada. But only among Iowa Democrats did a majority -- 60 percent-- say Sanders could beat Clinton without bigger donors, while New Hampshire Democrats were closer to evenly divided, with slightly more saying that he couldn't do so.\nThat geographical divide played out on the Republican side as well: Iowa and New Hampshire Republicans said Sanders could beat Clinton without bigger donors (88 percent of New Hampshire Republicans said he could do so), while majorities of Republicans in Nevada and South Carolina said he couldn't. The caveat across the board, however, was that small-dollar donors could propel him through the first few contests but he needs more heft to get across the finish line.\n\"Certainly in NH, he can but for him to win the whole thing, he needs an ongoing and intensifying firestorm,\" a New Hampshire Republican said. \"[Were] that to really occur, all the parties in the Hamptons and the Hollywood Hills would not rescue her.\"\nAdded an Iowa Republican, \"Maybe in Iowa... but not in the long run. Ask Ron Paul how it worked for him.\"\nAnother Iowa Republican was more skeptical: \"Even a socialist has to understand math. It doesn't add up. She'll crush him.\"\n(Some insiders responded before Sanders’ announced his third-quarter haul.)\nBen Carson is building an Iowa powerhouse\nMore than one-third of Iowa Republicans say Ben Carson is building the strongest ground-game operation in the first-in-the nation caucus state -- and no one else came close.\n\"Carson has a natural grassroots network of homeschoolers,\" said one Iowa Republican. \"He can turn out a large crowd anywhere in the state, which should translate to a strong Caucus showing. He energizes the Caucus electorate, while Trump attracts people based on a celebrity status.\"\nIn establishment Republican circles, many hold the belief that Carson, who has never held political office, is a flavor-of-the-month candidate who lacks policy depth and isn't to be taken seriously. But Caucus insiders, none of whom work for Carson, made the case that he is out-organizing everyone else in Iowa, thanks in large part to the super PAC supporting him, which has been laying the groundwork for a Carson run for more than a year.\n\"The Carson Super PAC team has the state blanketed,\" an Iowa Republican said. \"You can't go to a county GOP or local community event without seeing someone in a Ben Carson shirt handing out literature and signing people up.\"\nIn other states, there were less definitive winners on the Republican side: Marco Rubio and home-state senator Lindsey Graham tied with 28 percent each in South Carolina for best ground game; Jeb Bush led in Nevada, followed closely by Rubio; and New Hampshire was jumbled, with Carly Fiorina and John Kasich barely out-polling Jeb Bush and Chris Christie.\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton had the best ground game across the board, insiders said.\nThese are the members of the POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated this week:\nIowa: Tim Albrecht, Brad Anderson, Rob Barron, Jeff Boeyink, Bonnie Campbell, Dave Caris, Sam Clovis, Sara Craig, Jerry Crawford, John Davis, Steve Deace, John Deeth, Derek Eadon, Ed Failor Jr., Karen Fesler, David Fischer, Doug Gross, Steve Grubbs, Tim Hagle, Bob Haus, Joe Henry, Drew Ivers, Jill June, Lori Jungling, Jeff Kaufmann, Brian Kennedy, Jake Ketzner, David Kochel, Chris Larimer, Chuck Larson, Jill Latham, Jeff Link, Dave Loebsack, Mark Lucas, Liz Mathis, Jan Michelson, Chad Olsen, David Oman, Matt Paul, Marlys Popma, Troy Price, Christopher Rants, Kim Reem, Craig Robinson, Sam Roecker, David Roederer, Nick Ryan, Tamara Scott, Joni Scotter, Karen Slifka, John Smith, AJ Spiker, Norm Sterzenbach, John Stineman, Matt Strawn, Phil Valenziano, Jessica Vanden Berg, Nate Willems, Eric Woolson, Grant Young\nNew Hampshire: Charlie Arlinghaus, Arnie Arnesen, Patrick Arnold, Rich Ashooh, Dean Barker, Juliana Bergeron, D.J.
