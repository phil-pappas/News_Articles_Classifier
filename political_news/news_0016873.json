(Dominick Reuter/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) By Editorial Board October 9 at 7:26 PM FOR THREE years, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has doggedly pursued a peace accord with Latin America’s oldest and most lethal insurgent group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. For much of this year, the negotiations teetered on the brink of failure. But last month Mr. Santos announced a breakthrough: an agreement on how war crimes from the decades-long conflict will be adjudicated and a six-month deadline for completing a final deal.\nLike all such peace pacts between governments and former insurgents, the tentative accord with the FARC involves a painful compromise of justice in exchange for the prospect of peace. But if Mr. Santos can complete the accord and sell it to Colombia’s voters, he could bring a generation of violence and rural disintegration in his country to a close, and accelerate its modernization.\nDesignated a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department , the FARC has evolved over a half-century from a Cuban-sponsored Communist insurgency to loosely organized gangs deeply involved in drug trafficking, abductions and other crimes. Its responsibility for massacres and press-ganging of children is well documented. That’s why the deal Mr. Santos struck is so fraught. Rank-and-file members of the group, of whom there are now about 6,000, would be amnestied, while senior commanders who confessed their crimes to special tribunals would avoid prison. Instead they would be confined to “ areas of restricted liberty ” for five to eight years. Military commanders implicated in crimes would get the same treatment.\nNot surprisingly, this leniency has been denounced by human rights groups and is opposed by many Colombians. Foremost among them is former president Álvaro Uribe, who initiated the U.S.-backed military offensive that broke the back of the FARC and forced it to negotiate, and who struck his own controversial deal to disarm Colombia’s right-wing paramilitary groups a decade ago. Mr. Uribe complains that FARC leaders who should be imprisoned for murder instead will be allowed to hold political office in Colombia’s democratic system.\nThat, however, is the essence of the peace accord: to extend the constitutional system to people, and vast areas of the countryside, that for a generation have been lawless. The result could be the rapid acceleration of development and prosperity in a country that already is pulling ahead of most of its Latin American neighbors.\nAppropriately, Colombians will ultimately decide if the trade-off is worthwhile: Mr. Santos has promised a referendum on the final accord. First he must complete the negotiations, which still involve dozens of unresolved issues. The FARC has expressed discomfort with the March completion deadline, but Mr. Santos must stick to it.\nThe Obama administration has played a significant role in the peace process, dispatching at Mr. Santos’s request", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/colombia-conflict-death-toll-commission", "http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm", "http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-colombia-peace-talks-20150925-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:56:38.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
