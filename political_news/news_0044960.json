The SAP Social Innovation Series is running consecutively in five cities this fall: New York City (10/6), San Francisco (10/8), Phoenix (10/27), Philadelphia (11/2) and Dallas (11/4).\nThe SAP Social Innovation Series is presented in partnership with health and wellness nonprofit, GENYOUth as part of an ongoing partnership between the two organizations to help scale GENYOUth's social entrepreneurship program, AdVenture Capital (AdCap), by investing in would-be student entrepreneurs who are fostering change and innovation in their local schools and communities as well as across the country.\n\"The rise of the Digital Economy has changed both the way we interact and socialize as well as the way we work. Tomorrow's leaders are going to need to be equipped with an entirely new set of skills and will have to be more creative, think differently and develop an entrepreneurial mindset,\" said Sam Alkharrat , Managing Director, West region, SAP. \"The SAP and GENYOUth partnership is helping to do exactly that. We have created the AdCap platform in order to inspire, empower and help student entrepreneurs innovate and solve problems around health and wellness issues in their own local communities.\"\n\"Fuel Up to Play 60 has provided Arizona students a fabulous outlet for their creative ideas to come to fruition. When we allow students to have a voice and play an active role in changing their school environment, we see many positive outcomes,\" said Patricia Johnson , M.S., R.D., S.N.S. Director of Nutrition Services, Dairy Council of Arizona . \"We are very excited about the opportunity and impact this workshop will have on the success of our students, our schools and our communities around health and wellness.\"\nDuring these five-hour workshops, students will have the opportunity to work closely with subject-matter experts from SAP to refine their ideas before a final group of students pitch to a panel of judges, including SAP executives and customers. Select students will receive prizes and funding for their schools, with the top three turning their pitches into videos that the public will vote on, along with SAP employees across the country. Up to $12,000 in grants will be given away at each event, and the student who receives the most votes will earn the title of 'SAP Teen Innovator' and will go on to receive an additional $10 ,000 for his/her school, and be honored at Super Bowl 50 in San Francisco, CA.\nFor more information about AdVenture Capital, the opportunities offered for students, and the SAP Social Innovation Series events visit www.AdCapYOUth.org .\nAbout AdVenture Capital\nCreated by GENYOUth and informed by students, AdVenture Capital inspires students to create and make school and community wellness changes through an online social entrepreneurship platform.
