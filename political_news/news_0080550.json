Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah speaks at the start of a hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Secret Service accountability stemming from a March 4, 2015, incident. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is the front-runner in the race to become the next speaker, but he faces two Republican opponents who are trying to draw some of his support. Chaffetz and three-term Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida both say they can bring a needed fresh perspective to GOP leadership, unlike McCarthy, who has served as majority leader under Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.
