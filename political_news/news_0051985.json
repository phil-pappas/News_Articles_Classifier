Step outside, and the streets raged as thousands of protesters gathered to express their anger and disgust at the perceived arrogance and elitism of the “Tory Scum” confined within. \nThe core message of this year’s conference was of a party striving to improve the lives of working people. Whether it was Nicky Morgan putting social equality at the heart of her education agenda, or George Osborne dubbing the Tories the “only true party of labour”, the undertones of “blue collar Conservatism” were ever-present. \nThe new philosophy was even the subject of the first big announcement: the unveiling of a new bursary for parliamentary candidates on low income. And it was there again at the closing, as David Cameron paid tribute to the party’s new MPs, taking care to pick out rising stars from working backgrounds. \nYet, amid the theatre and the grandeur of the conference, it was easy to forget this message was set against a backdrop of party plans for radical welfare reform which political opponents, charities and economists have all warned will hit some of Britain’s most vulnerable families. It was equally easy to forget about the ongoing cuts to public sector spending which have left some of the country’s most valued and critical services in a fragile condition. \nOnly on brief journeys between the corporate hubbub of Manchester Central and the swanky corridors of the Midland Hotel, would the shouts and jeers of protesters momentarily pierce the conference bubble. And that brief injection of reality stood as a reminder of the scale of resistance to the Conservative policies being celebrated inside. \nAmong the few who got a special mention in the Prime Minister’s closing speech on Wednesday were Plymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer and North Cornwall MP Scott Mann. One, a former soldier, the other a former postman, both exemplify the Conservatives’ renewed efforts to represent a broader demographic in Westminster. \nMr Mercer was unswayed by the mass protest on the doorstep, objecting to any suggestion the party still has its work cut out to convince the public it is on their side. He and many others within the party point to May’s election as evidence the people have given them a mandate to continue with their social and economic agenda. \nHowever, it remains true that the Conservatives only received 37 per cent of the popular vote on polling day, which, as the pundits like to remind them, only secured them the slimmest of majorities. And the latest YouGov results reveal Labour still has the edge when voters are asked to name which party best speaks for “ordinary working people”. \nSo with five more years’ of austerity measures to go and November bringing the results of Osborne’s spending review, the political fight for the heart of working Britain is far from over. The economy may be stabilising and unemployment levels shrinking, but Conservatives should be wary of patting themselves on the back too soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:07:33.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
