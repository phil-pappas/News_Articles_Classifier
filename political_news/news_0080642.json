Here's how one deals with the changing landscape. By Anna Medaris Miller Oct. 19, 2015 | 5:04 p.m. EDT + More Meredith Phillips once dug through the snow in a Detroit McDonald's parking lot looking for a flash drive. One of her employees at Henry Ford Health System had lost it there, and as the organization's chief information privacy and security officer, she wanted to find it and protect the encrypted information it held.\nWhile Phillips didn't find the device, her team learned a lesson: \"We have a problem with portable storage devices,\" Phillips said today at the U.S. News Hospital of Tomorrow conference in the District of Columbia. The team also found a solution: to collect all 5,000 employees' flash drives and transfer the information onto a secure system. \"That's 5,000 [prevented] breaches as far as I'm concerned,\" Phillips said.\nThe incident is just one example of how Henry Ford Health System is handling patient privacy issues in an increasingly digital health care environment. Phillips' presentation was part of a panel called \"Safeguarding Patient Privacy in a Digital Age,\" which was moderated by U.S. News' Steve Sternberg and also featured Brian P. Kalis, managing director of digital health care at Accenture.\nFrom 2010 to 2014, the number of health care data breaches in the United States has increased by 40 percent, according to Kalis. Those breaches cost the health care system both time (it takes up to 200 hours to solve a breach) and money (it costs about $13,000 per person affected) to try to resolve breaches, Kalis said. What's more, each time there's a data breach, health care systems risk alienating patients. \"A fundamental element of all of this is trust,\" he said.\nRELATED\nThe Illusion of Online Privacy\nHere's what else Henry Ford Health System is doing to prevent breaches, solve them when they occur and maintain patient trust:\nThe organization's privacy policies are structured around employee behavior, not technology. \"Technology is not the solution, it's the enabler,\" Phillips said. Cultures matters, too. \"You have to get to heart and minds of the individuals who are doing the jobs every day – not just put the technology in place,\" she added. Rather than allowing managers to investigate data breaches, Henry Ford has a special team that can do that objectively.\nEvery time there is a data breach, every employee in the affected department must undergo re-education on patient privacy – whether or not he or she was involved in the breach itself. \"What it creates now is pressure,\" Phillips said.\nHenry Ford has a code system in which a small number of trained employees are alerted via email when there is a potential breach and then again using a special symbol when the breach is confirmed. \"The more people I tell that's happening, the more they're going to communicate it to other people,\" Phillips said. That's going to put your organization in a bad light.\"\nThe organization communicates its strategy in about 25 different ways, 25 times, Phillips said. One way: the chance to win an iPad if employees complete a crossword puzzle in which the clues all relate to Henry Ford's patient privacy strategy.\nHenry Ford takes a non-punitive approach toward employees who report a potential breach. In effect, Henry Ford has seen a 30 percent increase in incident reporting every year. \"[That] tells me that the culture understands they have to report it because it's important to our patients, it's important to our organization,\" Phillips said.\nTAGS: cybersecurity patients", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecroj%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecroj%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Safeguarding%20Patient%20Privacy%20in%20a%20Digital%20Age", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecroj%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Safeguarding%20Patient%20Privacy%20in%20a%20Digital%20Age&summary=Health%20care%20systems%20aren%27t%20going%20back%20to%20pen%20and%20paper.%20Here%27s%20how%20one%20deals%20with%20the%20changing%20landscape.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecroj%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://usnewshospitaloftomorrow.com/", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecroj%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZecroj%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Safeguarding%20Patient%20Privacy%20in%20a%20Digital%20Age"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:29:35.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
