The Ningo Prampram ‘Mugabe’ as critics call him is blaming Sam George for the dwindling fortunes. \nHe said Sam George will be last in the Parliamentary primary, his position as the presidential staffer notwithstanding. \n\"He only plays his politics on radio,\" ET Mensah fired \nBut Sam George has said that ET Mensah has served his term and must honorably resign. \n\"Our dear father E.T. Mensah has done a great service for people of Ningo-Prampram. But we believe that his twenty years of service is enough for him to retire for someone like me with great ambitions to take over and continue the good work that he has done for us,\" he said. \nMeanwhile Sam George has been cleared to contest the November 7 primary. \nThere was a petition which attempted to disqualify him from contesting but after vetting today, the presidential staffer was cleared to contest the elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:41:09.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
