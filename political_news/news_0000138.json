John Kasich's presidential campaign manager Beth Hansen, resigned in July over that decision, even as the U.S. Department of Education was reviewing the grant applications.\nFederal evaluators found shortcomings in Ohio's application, but they had mostly glowing reports of Ohio's evaluation process for oversight agencies and still awarded Ohio the $71 million - the most money out of the seven states and the District of Columbia that are sharing a total of $249 million.\nEach of the other states -- Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, Nevada, South Carolina -- also will pass out the money themselves, under criteria set in each state.\nODE spokesperson Kim Norris said the department is \"proud\" to win the grant and the money will help to expand strong charter schools in the state.\nShe said the state informed the federal department about the issues with the oversight evaluations weeks ago. Ohio will keep working with the DOE about what criteria to use in selecting schools to receive grants.\n\"The actual specifics of that will be determined,\" Norris said.\nNorris said Ohio's grant lets the state \"expand high quality community (charter) schools by providing financial assistance for the planning, program design and implementation of community schools; evaluating the schools' effect on students and student achievement, staff and parents; and disseminating information about successful practices.\"\nSecretary of Education Arne Duncan said the Charter School Program grants allow high-performing charter school models to replicate in high-need communities, serving kids in need of strong educational choices.\nOhio previously received a similar grant, then was not renewed a few years ago, before winning it again.\nLyman Millard, spokesman for the Breakthrough charter school network here in Cleveland, said Breakthrough schools received money from these grants to start some of its schools several years ago.\nIt later won a grant of nearly $3.5 million directly from the federal government, in the gap when ODE was not a recipient, to help start some of its existing schools.\nStarting a new charter school, he said, costs a lot of money -- beyond the daily cost of operating. Federal grants, he said, were key to having Breakthrough expand a network that many consider the strongest in the state.\n\"It will make it easier for the high quality schools to have the startup funds they need to open more schools,\" he said.\nAnd, Millard said adding strong charter schools helps weed out weaker ones.\n\"This just allows the state to crowd out the market a little bit with high-performing schools and puts a little pressure on low performing schools -- economic pressure, enrollment pressure,\" he said.\nHe said the state had a rigorous application process for the grants in previous years.\nState Sen. Peggy Lehner , chair of the Senate Education Committee, said there are strong charter school operators in other states who don't come to Ohio, supposedly because of a lack of support with startup costs, among other reasons.\nLehner said she hoped these grants might draw some to start schools in Ohio.\nHiggins renewed calls for an outside investigation into ODE's handling of the evaluations of charter oversight agencies, known as \"sponsors\" or \"authorizers.\" She said an investigation, also sought by some state school board members and the Ohio Democratic Party, \"would help restore the public's faith that ODE is capable of acting in the best interest of Ohio's students.\"\nState Superintendent Richard Ross doesn't want an investigation , other than by the state auditor or inspector general -- both Republicans. The state school board agreed with him earlier this month, tabling a move to hire an outsider .\nWhether ODE employees involved in those sponsor evaluations will have any say in how this new federal money is awarded is unclear.\nWhile Ross has said that Hansen acted alone in his decision, several other ODE employees were involved in researching it and discussing the evaluations . Ross later revised his comments to say no one other than people working under Hansen knew of the omission.\nAnd though Hansen is gone, many of those employees, including ODE's charter school director Joni Hoffman, are still with the department. She's not talking about her involvement.", "external_links": ["http://www.breakthroughschools.org/", "http://education.ohio.gov/", "http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-contributes-improving-charter-schools-sector", "http://www.ohiosenate.gov/lehner"], "published": "2015-10-01T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:54:12.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
