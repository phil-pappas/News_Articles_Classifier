At my request, three House committees have been investigating the abortion business, but we still don’t have the full truth,” Mr. Boehner said. \nThe new committee will have the resources and subpoena power to “get to the bottom of these horrific practices, and build on our work to protect the sanctity of all human life,” Mr. Boehner said. \nThe following Republican representatives will make up the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s new investigative panel: \nRep. Marsha Blackburn, Chairman (R-TN), Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA), Rep. Diane Black (R-TN), Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-IN)Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI), Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), Rep. Vicki Hartzler (R-MO), and Rep.
