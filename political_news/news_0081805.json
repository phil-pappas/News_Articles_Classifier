INTERPOL has 190 member countries working to facilitate international police co-operation even where diplomatic relations do not exist between particular countries. \nAction is taken within the limits of existing laws in different countries and in the spirit of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \nBut the constitution of INTERPOL prohibits ‘any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character'. \nMore soon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:28:36.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
