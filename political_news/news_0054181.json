Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia with a fondness for guns and a spotless record of National Rifle Association support, led the charge. \nPolls showed that as many as 92 percent of voters supported background checks. Manchin met secretly with the NRA to work on language the rifle association could tolerate. \nThen things blew up. Word of the secret meetings leaked, and two smaller gun groups charged that the NRA was preparing to sell out. The NRA stopped talking to Manchin and retreated to the language of its longtime leader, Wayne LaPierre, that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. \nManchin's bill got 55 votes in the Senate , five short of the filibuster-proof majority needed. \nThe bill's failure epitomizes the tangled politics of guns and how difficult it is for lawmakers to reach consensus.The seeming unanimity on issues such as background checks turns out – on closer examination – to mask deeper political and cultural fissures. \nDespite the string of mass shootings that followed Sandy Hook, nothing has happened since on Capitol Hill. A national outpouring of grief after each event has not ended the congressional deadlock. \nThis isn't to say that nothing is happening. States have become a hotbed of legislative action, in both directions. Oregon is one of six states that have adopted universal background checks in the wake of Sandy Hook. But many others have loosened gun laws. \nThe activity at the state level, which are often dominated by one of the two major parties, also highlights the lack of national consensus. \n\"It's for a complex set of reasons that broad support doesn't lead to action,\" said Matt Bennett as he patiently explained the politics of guns from his think tank –Third Way – in Washington, D.C. Bennett relied on that patience when he helped shepherd Sandy Hook parents around Capitol Hill nearly three years ago. \nThe gun issue is \"constant and enormous for a small sliver of gun activists and completely episodic for everybody else,\" he said. \nGun owners passionate about their rights will flood lawmakers with emails and phone calls, show up at demonstrations and financially support the NRA and other like-minded groups. \n\"That stuff matters a lot,\" said Robert Spitzer, a political scientist at the State University of New York at Cortland who has written five books on gun control. \nBut \"it's not a top-tier issue for most Americans,\" said Spitzer, noting that it falls low on the list of concerns that most people base their vote on. \nBut observers said there's also more to the story. \nCarroll Doherty, the director of research at the Pew Research Center, said his group's polling shows the issue has become more politically polarized in the age of Obama. \nFor years, the group has been asking Americans what's more important: controlling gun ownership or protecting gun rights. \nIn the 1990s, when crime rates were higher, as many as two-thirds said controlling guns was more important. That dropped to around 60 percent during the Bush years. But since President Barack Obama took office, the question has split Americans roughly 50-50. \nAs Doherty explains it, most of the change has come on the Republican side amid growing distrust of the president among GOP voters. Even Republicans who support background checks express skepticism about whether Congress should take up the issue. \nThe gun lobby, as evidenced by the Manchin bill, has also been increasingly averse to compromise. \"The NRA is increasingly a victim of it own success\" in persuading gun owners that their rights are in danger, said Spitzer. So it can't back away from \"feeding them apocalyptic fears about the future.\" \nOn top of that, gun-rights supporters have built their own intellectual case that curbing firearms actually makes people less safe. \nEconomist John Lott Jr. argued in his influential 1998 book, \"More Guns, Less Crime,\" that the growing number of concealed handgun licensees contributed to a drop in crime. \nLott, who went on to found the Crime Prevention Research Center said that armed citizens can halt crimes the police can't get to in time. And he argued that many mass murderers deliberately use settings – whether schools or movie theaters – where guns are banned. \n\"Everybody wants to stop certain people from being able to get guns,\" Lott said in an interview. \"There's no doubt about that. The question is whether what we're doing is working.\" \nThe National Research Council extensively studied Lott's research and concluded that \"with the current evidence, it is not possible to determine\" if there is a link between lower crime and the growth of right-to-carry laws. \nIt's not only the gun-rights movement that has evolved. Supporters of gun control shy away from the term and prefer to be known as backers of gun safety or opponents of gun violence. The group once known as Handgun Control Inc. has morphed into the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence -- the Brady being a reference to wounded presidential spokesman Jim Brady and his wife, Sarah. \nTed Alcorn, the research director for Everytown for Gun Safety , said on C-SPAN this year that the \"NRA has done a great job ensuring that the gun rights of Americans are protected\" and that he didn't see that as incompatible with Everytown's work to \"keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people.\" \nEverytown has played a big role in changing gun laws, at least in blue states. The group's chief backer, New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg, said last year that he'd spend $50 million fighting for tighter gun laws. He's trying to capture some of the grass-roots fervor that fuels the NRA. \nEverytown helped fund the initiative that expanded background checks in Washington state last year. The group also helped expand the Democratic majority in the Oregon Senate –giving supporters the votes needed to pass a similar bill here this year. \nAttention to the issue rises with each incident. The Oregon shooting – with its images of school buildings and distraught young people being led away –held echoes of Sandy Hook. In its wake, presidential candidates are being quizzed on the issue, and Democrats are trying once again to push for a Manchin-like background check bill in Congress. \nThe NRA, in a statement Thursday, charged that Obama and congressional Democrats seek to \"politicize these horrific events\" to push a \"gun-control agenda.\" \nWith all the activity, said Doherty, the polling expert, this could become a major issue in the 2016 presidential race – the first in the post-Sandy Hook era. \"But,\" he added, \"it's not yet.\" \n-- Jeff Mapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:22:52.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
