The petition requires the bill to be placed on the House floor, where it has the votes to pass.\n\nStivers, an ally of House Speaker John Boehner, R-West Chester, said “the Export Import Bank is critical for protecting and growing U.S. jobs, and it generates a profit for our government.”\n\n“There is overwhelming, bipartisan support for reforming and reauthorizing the bank,” Stivers said.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said “thanks to this discharge petition, the House is able to work its will, I am confident that it will join the Senate in expressing its overwhelming bipartisan support to reopen” the bank.\n\nMichael Needham, chief executive officer for the conservative non-profit organization Heritage Action Fund — which opposes the bank — accused Boehner and “a few dozen GOP pawns” of corporate lobbyists of working with House Democrats to save the bank.\n\nEven though the Senate overwhelmingly voted to re-authorize the bank earlier this year, the Senate will have to give its approval again once the House passes the measure.\n\nThe House’s failure to renew the bank has appalled large and small U.S. companies whose executives contend they rely on the bank’s credit and insurance to help them sell their goods abroad. GE Aviation in suburban Cincinnati has been particularly critical of Jordan and Gov. John Kasich for opposing renewal of the bank.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2014, more than 360 Ohio companies relied on credit guarantees provided by the bank to export $3 billion worth of products.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:00:37.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
