An earlier poll in September had Trump leading Carson by six points, according to Politico .\nCarson's surge is attributed in part to his support from 33 percent of women in the poll. By comparison, Trump, who has been criticized for insulting comments about women , only has 13 percent support from women voters.\nCarson also enjoys high favorability numbers, Quinnipiac polling assistant director Peter Brown told Politico.\n\"Those who know Carson seem to like him. He has an almost unheard of 84 – 10 percent favorability rating among likely Republican Caucus-goers, compared to Trump's 53 – 43 percent rating,\" Brown said.\nVoters also see Carson as someone who shares their values, is honest and cares about voters, according to the poll.\nThe poll marks the first time Trump has fallen out of first place in Iowa in more than three months. Carson has tied him twice before, but never led prior to this latest poll, according to CBS News .\nTrump still scores higher than Carson in leadership qualities (80 percent to Carson's 76), but falls below Carson in a contest of who has the right experience to lead (56 percent to Carson's 57).\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio also saw a boost up to 13 percent, and is now placing third ahead of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (10 percent), Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (6 percent), and Carly Fiorina and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (both 5 percent). Remaining candidates all polled below 3 percent.\nQuinnipiac contacted 574 Iowa Republican caucus voters between Oct. 14 and 20 via phone. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.1 percent.\nThe next 2016 Republican Primary debate will be Wednesday, October 28 in Colorado.", "external_links": ["http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/carson-trump-iowa-quinnipiac-gop-poll-1022-215029", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/iowa-poll-shows-ben-carson-overtaking-donald-trump-for-the-first-time/", "http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/iowa/release-detail?ReleaseID=2291"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:35:10.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
