Bernie Sanders is California-bound. \nSanders will head to Los Angeles for a fundraising reception Wednesday evening at the Avalon Hollywood nightclub, where he’ll “discuss a wide range of issues including income and wealth inequality and the disappearing middle class, immigration reform, getting big money out of politics, criminal justice reform, and his college affordability plan.” Tickets cost $25, $50 or $100 . \nSanders trails Hillary Clinton by 16 points in an average of nine recent national polls compiled by Real Clear Politics; he trailers her by six points in Iowa, but leads her by 11 points in New Hampshire. \n  Elwood \nGee, Bernie’s visit sure seems to have caused a lot of excitement on here! JohnW \nAssuming anybody watches, it will be interesting to see if the debate stirs things up a bit on the Democratic side. The “others” (besides Hillary) aren’t exactly nobodies. Agree with him or not, Bernie says what’s on his mind, is a very good speaker and draws crowds. Jim Webb is a decorated Vietnam USMC veteran, Secretary of the Navy under Reagan and the guy who knocked off a household name conservative US Senator in Virginia. Martin O’Malley is the youngest of the group but both a former Mayor of Baltimore and Governor or Maryland. Elwood \nThis election is as simple as ABC. \nAnybody But Clinton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:37:10.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
