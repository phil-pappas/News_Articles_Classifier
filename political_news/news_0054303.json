Elizabeth Warren and Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday laid the blame for the nation’s crumbling roads and bridges squarely on Republicans in Congress, whom they say have shortchanged investments in the nation’s infrastructure systems. The two Democrats spoke back to back at a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace conference on infrastructure held in Georgetown on Thursday. Warren spoke for nearly 15 minutes laying out her views on the importance of government investment in transportation, energy and communication systems — and why it is now falling behind other nations. “There’s not really much dispute over the importance of infrastructure, but our transportation system is falling apart, our power grid is outdated, and basic communication technology in parts of this country are slow or nonexistent. This isn’t a one-time blip. We have systematically underinvested in infrastructure for 30 years now,” she said. It began, the Massachusetts senator said, when Republicans embraced “trickle-down economics”— pushing tax cuts for the wealthy with the expectation that this would result in gains for the middle class. Those tax cuts, however, were offset by budget cuts. Today, she said, the United States is spending 2 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on infrastructure while China spends 9 percent and Japan 5 percent. “Underspending on infrastructure is about choices. When there’s not enough money to fix our transportation system then it’s because this government made other choices —choices, for example, to spend money on subsidies for Big Oil and Big Agriculture and choices to maintain tax loopholes for giant companies that are highly profitable instead of collecting those revenues and spending them on infrastructure,” Warren said. Biden, who did not hear Warren’s address, followed with a similar theme — but focused the blame on Tea Party conservatives. Through most of his political life, Biden said government leaders embraced the need for ambitious and long-term investments in infrastructure but that is not the case anymore. “This is a new Congress. This is a new Republican Party — a different Republican Party,” he said. “I can understand why there is debate on how we pay for infrastructure but I don’t understand how there can be a debate on whether we need to invest. That’s the debate going on — not how to pay but do we even need to pay for infrastructure. I’ve never seen that before.” Biden noted that President Obama has submitted a six-year highway transportation plan that would rely on corporate profits held overseas to avoid high income taxes at home. Under the plan, the estimated $2 trillion in profits could be brought home at a lower-tax rate — generating savings for the companies and funds to rebuild roads and bridges. “It’s a win, win,” he said. Congress has not taken up the bill and Republicans have yet to come up with an alternative way to keep the Highway Trust fund solvent, he said. Warren said that investments would pay dividends for the middle class and business. “Our roads are crumbling, our bridges are falling down, our power grids are outdated, and our communications network is spotty. China is building a future while America is stuck in political quicksand. Building infrastructure is building opportunity. And yes, that opportunity isn’t free. It’s time to belly up to our responsibilities as a country and make the investments we need,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:35:56.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
