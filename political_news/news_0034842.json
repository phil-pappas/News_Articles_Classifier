Today, tens of thousands gathered in Germany, while their Chancellor stepped and fetched for the Islamic authoritarian Turkish President Erdogan. She has sold her nation down the river.\nSome truth emerges in the little coverage these major rallies garner: NBC News reported that “only one-fifth characterized as far-right extremists.” Far right extremists — absurd. Funny how the mainstream media never denigrates or labels jihadists who are chopping off heads and hands.\nThe German government’s response is to crack down on those standing in the breach. From AM590:\nGerman officials accuse the group of trying to capitalize on fears of immigration amid an unprecedented influx of refugees to the country over the past months.\nMany in the crowd held banners with slogans such as “refugees not welcome.” Speakers who touched on the issue of migration elicited chants of “send them back.”\nInterior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told public broadcaster ARD late Sunday that the domestic intelligence service was monitoring PEGIDA and called its leaders “hard far-right extremists.”\nMonday’s protest drew a bigger crowd than the previous week, when some 9,000 joined the rally. Organizers claimed almost 40,000 attended.\n[…]\nMany appeared older and claimed to be unaffiliated to any political movements.\n“What the government is doing, throwing open the doors to immigrants, is wrong. Most of them aren’t true refugees, they’re economic migrants,” said one man, who would give only his first name, Eckart, claiming he could lose his government job for speaking out against immigrants.\nGermany’s vice chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, said the tone of debate in Germany was becoming increasingly raw because of PEGIDA and like-minded groups.\n“This is the soil from which ultimately individual crackpots and fanatics grow who consider themselves the executors of the people’s will and then carry out knife attacks on political candidates such as in Cologne,” Gabriel told a labor union conference in Frankfurt “They are the real arsonists in this country.”", "external_links": ["http://pamelageller.com/?p=71962", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/migrant-demo-germany.jpeg", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/anti-migrant-protest-Germany-800x433.jpeg", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pg21-merkelgermany-800x600.jpg", "http://www.nbcnews.com/video/germanys-anti-islam-pegida-movement-marks-first-anniversary-547085891734", "http://www.am590theanswer.com/news/articles/german-government-steps-up-criticism-of-anti-islam-group", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/germany-anti-migrant-demo.jpeg"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:49:13.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
