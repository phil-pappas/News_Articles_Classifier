Photo: Andrew Meares\nBut, in almost equal measure, there was denial, delusion and maybe a hint that Hockey has not forgiven those who destroyed Tony Abbott's prime ministership and brought about his own demise.\nAdvertisement The denial came when Hockey confessed that the Abbott government was good at policy, but struggled with politics, and asserted that he always preferred \"to do what was right (rather) than what was popular\".\nThe 2014 budget that was a catalyst for Abbott's downfall, and his own, was simply a case, he maintained, of the government having more courage than the Parliament.\nMr Hockey receives a standing ovation from colleagues. Photo: Andrew Meares\nSorry, Joe, but it just ain't so. The problem was that so much in that budget broke solemn undertakings delivered by Abbott before he won office and was seen by the voters as blatantly unfair.\nThe understatement of the valedictory came when Hockey confessed \"we could have done more to win over the Australian people\".\nThere was also the concession that the government tried to do too much, too soon, and underestimated how much time would be taken up by chairing the G20 and dealing with national security.\nClick for more photos The political life and times of Joe Hockey Joe Hockey is leaving Parliament after a federal political career spanning two decades. Photo: Andrew Taylor\nView all 15 photos The delusion came when Hockey challenged \"all and sundry\" to name a speech more influential on the national conversation than his address to an audience of just 40 people in London about the need to end the age of entitlement.\nHe might have a case if, in government, he had been able to articulate how he intended to achieve this objective, had won the confidence of the electorate, had built a bipartisan consensus on the way forward and embedded enduring reforms.\nThe most jarring line came amidst a nostalgic reflection on his growing up in a house \"full of integrity\", where \"there was no back door you could sneak out of with a temporary leave pass to be disloyal or dishonest for just a few days\".\nIf those in the chamber, or the public galleries, thought less of the speech for these asides, it didn't show. This, after all, was a time to be generous and no speaker was more generous or eloquent than Labor leader Bill Shorten.\nShorten Quote: d the Theodore Roosevelt, the American president he and Hockey admire, saying Roosevelt never envied a human being who led an easy life, and did envy \"a great many people who led difficult lives and led then well\".\nHe then turned to Hockey and said: \"I envy the parliamentary life you have lived, envy the distinction and decency with which you have lived your parliamentary life. On behalf of the opposition, I wish you and your family well in everything you do from this day forward.\"\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-national-news/congested-level-crossings-not-on-labors-removal-list-6958636.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2015/JohnShakespeare/JoeHockey/", "http://images.smh.com.au/2013/02/13/4028104/fashweek9_1024-620x414.jpg", "https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax", "http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/joe-hockey-stands-by-first-budget-and-urges-further-radical-reform-including-ending-free-healthcare-for-the-rich-20151021-gkej3b.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/now-joe-hockey-says-he-wanted-to-tax-the-rich-all-along-20151021-gkeqpc.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/joe-says-funny-things-sometimes-doesnt-he-20151013-gk7m44.html", "http://www.theage.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/joe-hockeys-final-speech-to-parliament-20151021-gkekqs.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:57:11.499+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
