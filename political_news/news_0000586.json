(AP) - The latest on the start of recreational marijuana sales in Oregon (all times local):\n10:15 a.m.\nMarijuana shops are reporting brisk business on the first day of legal recreational sales in Oregon.\nBrad Zusman, co-owner of Canna Daddy's, a store in Portland, said Thursday that pot was sold to more than 90 customers in the first two hours after the store opened its doors.\nHe says customers have told him they've been waiting all their lives for a moment like this.\nHe expects to sell $60,000 worth of pot throughout the day.\nKen Martin at Foster Buds PDX in Portland says he's had a couple hundred customers since opening just after midnight.\nMartin says employees have to keep filling jars to meet customer demand.\nHe says two customers who came in had just turned 21, the legal age for buying recreational pot.\n8:05 a.m.\nThere have been no reports of trouble stemming from some Oregon pot shops opening just after midnight to sell marijuana to recreational users for the first time.\nEager night owls lined up as the sales started early Thursday, although most stores are opening at a more reasonable hour. Many shops are trying to lure customers with extended hours, food giveaways and discounted marijuana.\nBut the drug is for not sale in a big chunk of the state.\nThe state Legislature allowed local governments to prohibit the manufacture or sale of recreational marijuana, depending on how their residents voted last year on Measure 91.\nAt least nine counties and two dozen cities have submitted paperwork to prohibit licensed marijuana producers, processors, wholesalers and retailers.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:31:18.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
