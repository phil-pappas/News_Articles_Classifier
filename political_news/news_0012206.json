Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a smaller decline to 6.9.\nThe current conditions index fell to 55.2 in October from 67.5 in September.\n\"The exhaust gas scandal of Volkswagen and the weak growth of emerging markets has dampened economic outlook for Germany,\" said ZEW President Clemens Fuest.\n\"However, the performance of the domestic economy is still good and the euro area economy continues to recover. This makes it rather unlikely that the German economy will slide into recession,\" he said.\nBecause the ZEW index is based on a survey of financial analysts, it is heavily influenced by conditions in financial markets. Economic forecasters typically rely on surveys of businesses such as the purchasing managers index and Ifo business survey to gauge the underlying strength or weakness of the economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:17:47.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
