George E. Pataki and then-U.S. Sen. Alfonse D’Amato, did not come without controversy. Bruno, like other New York politicians facing legal problems, dipped mightily into his campaign accounts to pay legal fees during his two court trials. After being acquitted in a second trial, Bruno last year got approval for a request that state taxpayers reimburse him and his campaign account for more than $2 million in legal bills. \nMike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate Democratic conference, called the $1.4 million donation by Bruno to his former Senate Republican colleagues a “payoff” that is a “glaring example of the desperate need to reform New York state election law.’’ Senate Democrats called on the Republicans to turn over the Bruno money to taxpayers and support a stalled Senate Democratic bill banning reimbursement of campaign and legal defense accounts by politicians caught up in criminal cases. \nBruno’s old Senate account, which had been empty in July, reported a $1.5 million payment from an Albany law firm, which got its legal work on Bruno’s behalf paid for by the government this year and which then reimbursed Bruno’s account for payments it already made to the firm. Bruno in June gave $500,000 to a political action committee he founded called Creating New York Jobs Now. In the middle of July, his campaign reported a balance of $1 million. \nIn all, Bruno said he had $1.5 million left between the campaign account, political group and a separate legal defense fund. Besides the $1.4 million going to the Senate Republicans, Bruno said he is donating $100,000 for a scholarship at the Tech Valley High School Foundation in the Albany area, one of the beneficiaries of billions of dollars he drove to the Capital Region – from a sprawling new Amtrak station and minor league baseball complex to YMCA organizations and a massive computer chip facility – while he served as part of Albany’s three-men-in-a-room system of government. Remaining funds from his legal defense account will go to local charities; he did not elaborate. \nA statement distributed by one of his former aides, John McArdle, said the money raised by Bruno over the years came from individuals, companies and groups supporting Bruno as Senate Majority Leader “and he decided they should be put to use as originally intended” by bolstering the Senate GOP campaign account. \nThe most recent Senate Republican financial report with the state Board of Elections earlier this month showed the group having $1.3 million on hand, while the Democrats reported having $670,000 in the bank. The two sides are spending heavily in a general election race this fall to fill the Binghamton-area seat held until July by former Sen. Thomas Libous, a Republican convicted of lying to the FBI. \nBruno said he believes it is “more important than ever” to maintain a political balance in Albany by keeping Republicans in charge of the Senate while the Assembly is led by Democrats. Republicans are facing potentially stiff winds in 2016 when a presidential campaign season could hurt some GOP re-election efforts in a state dominated by Democratic voters. \nOf the well-timed Bruno donation, current Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, a Suffolk County Republican, said the GOP is “extremely grateful” to Bruno.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:55:08.331+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
