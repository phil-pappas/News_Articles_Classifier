Photo: Getty Images\nThe world of politics is powerfully overrun with people who did embarrassing things when they were at university.\nTony Abbott punched Joe Hockey. Anthony Albanese was, it's said, once biffed by Belinda Neal. Christopher Pyne was exactly like he is today. Bill Shorten mounted an abortive takeover of the Australian Theatrical and Amusement Employees' Association by sending his mates out to get casual jobs clipping tickets at the dishlickers. Malcolm Turnbull wrote poetry, and was friends with Bob Ellis. Julia Gillard was a socialist. Penny Wong had a boyfriend. It's all childish experimental stuff that you can pretty much laugh off these days.\nBut the tinkling nostalgia-soundtrack ground to a crazed, scratchy halt in Britain last week with the awkward allegation – published in a new and unfriendly biography – that British PM David Cameron had, as an Oxford undergraduate, experienced a brief but erotically-tinged physical interaction with a pig's head.\nThere are a number of points to be made about this parable, beyond the obvious grudging nod to Cory Bernardi, whose dark warnings about what comes next when you support gay marriage seem on this occasion to have been at least thematically vindicated.\nAdvertisement An encounter of this kind with the animal kingdom is a fabled benchmark in political electability. It's an extension of that immortal 1980s joke from Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards: \"The only way I can lose this election is if I'm caught in bed with either a dead girl, or a live boy.\"\nEdwards spent 16 years in the gubernatorial mansion. He then spent a further eight in prison for racketeering, which gives you an idea of the man's genuine taste for adventure. But I digress.\nCameron's alleged indiscretion was reported in a biography by Lord Ashcroft, a Conservative Party donor who has despised the British PM ever since he declined to honour the ancient motherland tradition whereby people arrange for millions of pounds to be funnelled into a political party and are then rewarded by positions of public influence.\n(Fun fact: Ashcroft donated $1 million to the Australian Liberal Party in advance of the 2004 election, and a further $250,000 before each of the 2010 and 2013 elections. Given he didn't even get an Aussie knighthood out of it, you may want to stay tuned for some revealing retrospective material involving Tony Abbott and the 1980s Oxbridge badger set.)\nThe browned-off peer has now set his talents and resources to work undermining Cameron, and the biography, of which the pig story is merely the most hair-raising element, forms part of that campaign.\nWho knows whether the pig story – now whoopingly immortalised as #piggate – is true? Number 10 is stepping around it. The pig is – self-evidently – not available for interview.\nThe fascinating thing, though, is that the incident is supposed to have taken place as part of Cameron's initiation into a men-only Oxford dining club called the Piers Gaveston Society, established in 1977 to enable young men of quality to pursue intellectual excellence and forge social links with their peers.\nFellow members are said to have included Boris Johnson, Hugh Grant and the late, notorious Gottfried von Bismarck, the great-great-grandson of Otto von Bismarck.\nAshcroft's revelation has created a pleasurable opportunity for bored journalists to comb anew the exotic range of exclusive clubs through which future world leaders attending posh universities seem to launder themselves with statistically-significant regularity.\nThe Piers Gaveston Society joins the Bullingdon Club (in which Oxford undergraduates kit themselves out in bespoke white tie and trash the restaurants of the catering classes) and Yale's shadowy Skull and Bones, a secret society which boasts George Bushes senior and junior as alumni, as well as current US Secretary of State John Kerry. (Sadly, there is no evidence to suggest that either Malcolm Turnbull or Tony Abbott fraternised with any such organisations, despite being in the right place at the right time.)\nEvelyn Waugh sketched the Bullingdon with an Italianate hand in his novel Decline and Fall , as a gathering of \"epileptic royalty from their villas of exile; uncouth peers from crumbling country seats; smooth young men of uncertain tastes from embassies and legations; illiterate lairds from wet granite hovels in the Highlands; ambitious young barristers and Conservative candidates torn from the London season and the indelicate advances of debutantes; all that was most sonorous of name and title\".\nWhat a quaint anomaly it is that men whose ambition is one day to lead the masses should during their education go to such extraordinary lengths to seclude themselves far from them in these eccentric hidey-holes of the rich and mad.\nAnd how ironic it is that their rituals – performed in order to gain admission to a disinhibited and exclusive circle – should many years down the track serve to estrange them from hoi polloi, who now are their employers.\nAnnabel Crabb is an ABC writer and broadcaster.\nTwitter: @annabelcrabb", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:25:17.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
