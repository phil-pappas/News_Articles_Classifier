(AP) â€” A 19-year-old Washington state man has been charged with criminal sexual conduct after authorities say he used the Internet to keep a 13-year-old Minnesota girl as his sex slave.\nAccording to the complaint, Cheyenne Cody Vedaa Foster of Arlington, Washington, ordered the girl to wear a collar to prove her commitment to him.\nThe Star Tribune reports ( http://strib.mn/1N33gTd ) the man called himself \"Hero\" and the Stillwater girl was \"Kitten.\" The complaint says Foster told the girl to abuse herself sexually and commit sex acts while suffocating herself. At one point, Foster told her she'd \"almost commit suicide\" when they spoke over FaceTime.\nPolice are investigating whether others followed Foster's demands.\nFoster's extradition to Minnesota is pending. It's unclear if he has an attorney to comment on his behalf.\n___\nInformation from: Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://strib.mn/1N33gTd", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:56.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
