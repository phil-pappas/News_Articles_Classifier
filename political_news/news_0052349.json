(NEWS RELEASE) – Governor Steve Beshear announced on Oct. 26 the launch of Kentucky's Yellow Dot program, designed to improve emergency care to motorists involved in a vehicle crash. \nThe “dot”--a circular yellow sticker on the lower left corner of the driver’s side rear window--alerts emergency responders that a pamphlet with identification and medical information about the motorist is in the glove box. Smaller yellow stickers are available for placement on motorcycle license plates. \n“We are always looking for ways to improve safety on Kentucky roadways, and the Yellow Dot program could truly be a lifesaver,” Gov. Beshear said. “If a motorist is unconscious after a crash, every minute matters, and I believe this program could mean the difference between life and death.” \nThe all-important pamphlet includes the participant’s name, photo, medical conditions, recent surgeries, current medications, allergies, physical information and emergency contact information. \nKentucky’s program will be administered through the Kentucky Office of Highway Safety (KOHS). The Yellow Dot program originated in Connecticut in 2002 and now has spread to 15 other states. \n“This program is growing nationwide,” Gov. Beshear said. “Not only will it help our residents, but with major interstates bringing out-of-state travelers through the Commonwealth every day, we knew Kentucky needed to be on board.” \nYellow Dot users are encouraged to periodically review and update their pamphlet. \n“Current information is especially important when dealing with medical conditions and prescriptions,” KOHS Executive Director Bill Bell said. “It determines the type of treatment emergency responders can or cannot safely provide.” \nFunding for the Yellow Dot program in Kentucky is provided by a grant through the Federal Highway Safety Administration. \nEmail yellowdotky@ky.gov to request a packet or pick up a packet at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) central office, any KYTC district office or Kentucky State Police (KSP) Post. \nPackets are also available at various hospitals throughout the state. \n\"The Kentucky Hospital Association is pleased to work with the Governor's Office and the Office of Highway Safety on this important health initiative that will be so valuable to the citizens of the Commonwealth,\" Michael T. Rust, president of the association, said. \nFor more information, visit http://yellowdot.ky.gov . As distribution locations are added, the list will be updated on the website. \nKYTC Central Office and District Offices: Frankfort KYTC Central Office, 200 Mero St.; 502-564-4890 \nPaducah KYTC District 1 Office, 5501 Kentucky Dam Road; 270-898-2431 \nMadisonville KYTC District 2 Office, 1840 North Main St.; 270-824-7080 \nBowling Green KYTC District 3 Office, 900 Morgantown Road; 270-746-7898 \nElizabethtown KYTC District 4 Office, 634 East Dixie Highway; 270-766-5066 \nLouisville KYTC District 5 Office, 8310 8310 Westport Road; 502-210-5400 \nCovington KYTC District 6 Office, 421 Buttermilk Pike; 859-341-2700 \nLexington KYTC District 7 Office, 763 West New Circle Road, Bldg. 2; 859-246-2355 \nSomerset KYTC District 8 Office, 1660 South Highway 27; 606-677-4017 \nFlemingsburg KYTC District 9 Office, 822 Elizaville Ave.; 606-845-2551 \nJackson KYTC District 10 Office, 473 Highway 15 South; 606-666-8841 \nManchester KYTC District 11 Office, 603 Railroad Ave.; 606-598-2145 \nPikeville KYTC District 12 Office, 109 Loraine St.; 606-433-7791 \nKSP Posts: KSP Post 1, 8366 State Route 45 North Hickory; 270-856-3721 \nMadisonville KSP Post 2, 100 Western Kentucky Parkway; 270-676-3313 \nBowling Green KSP Post 3, 3118 Nashville Road; 270-782-2010 \nElizabethtown KSP Post 4, 1055 North Mulberry; 270-766-5078 \nCampbellsburg KSP Post 5, 160 Citation Lane; 502-532-6363 \nDry Ridge KSP Post 6, 4265 U.S. Highway 25; 859-428-1212 \nRichmond KSP Post 7, 699 Eastern Bypass; 859-623-2404 \nMorehead KSP Post 8, 1595 Flemingsburg Road; 606-784-4127 \nPikeville KSP Post 9, 3499 North Mayo Trail; 606-433-7711 \nHarlan KSP Post 10, 3319 South U.S. 421; 606-573-3131 \nLondon KSP Post 11, 11 State Police Road; 606-878-6622 \nFrankfort KSP Post 12, 1250 Louisville Road; 502-227-2221 KSP Headquarters, 919 Versailles Road; 502-782-1800 \nHazard KSP Post 13, 100 Justice Drive; 606-435-6069 \nAshland KSP Post 14, 5975 State Route U.S. 60; 606-928-6421 \nColumbia KSP Post 15, 1118 Jamestown St.; 270-384-4796 \nHenderson KSP Post 16, 8415 U.S. Highway 41 South; 270-826-3312 \nKentucky Hospitals: Taylor Regional Hospital, 1700 Old Lebanon Road; 270-465-3561 \nCynthiana Harrison Memorial Hospital, 1210 KY-36 East; 859-234-2300 \nDanville Ephraim McDowell Regional Hospital, 217 S. 3rd St.; 859-239-1000 \nFrankfort Frankfort Regional Medical Center, 299 King's Daughter Drive; 502-875-5240 \nHarrodsburg James B.
