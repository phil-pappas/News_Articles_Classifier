(Published Friday, Oct. 23, 2015) For those who thought Hillary Clinton's testimony before the House Committee on Benghazi would be her undoing, it appears to have had the opposite effect. Steve Grossman was the Massachusetts State Party Chair in 1992 when he began to get to know Bill and Hillary Clinton. He went on to chair the Democratic National Committee in 1997 and has been a loyal Hillary Clinton stalwart ever since, even during the tough times, like this past summer when Bernie Sanders was surging, Benghazi hearings were looming and poll numbers were dropping. Teen Accused of Bringing Loaded Gun to School \"You saw Hillary Clinton go through the political equivalent of an El Niño,\" Grossman said. But the former Massachusetts treasurer believes the events of the past couple of weeks have turned the tide for Clinton, beginning with her Saturday Night Live appearance. John Farrell's Cancer in Remission \"She's become more looser, more open, more natural and a better candidate,\" said Grossman. Then there was the Democratic presidential debate, in which Clinton got a pass on the email controversy, thanks to her closest competitor, Sanders. Legislator Charged With DUI After Crash \"The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails,\" he said during the debate. \"She was the only person on that stage in the first debate who is clearly ready to be president of the United States,\" said Grossman. Joe Biden deciding this week not to get into the race was the next big break for Clinton, but perhaps nothing has helped to elevate her candidacy more, ironically, than Thursday's 11-hour appearance before the Republican-led Benghazi hearing. She referenced the hearing at a Friday morning DNC Women's Forum.

Clinton is speaking to a major gathering of Iowa Democrats on Saturday night. Then, it's on to New Hampshire on Wednesday.
