(AP) - Gov. Chris Christie has pardoned three people who faced gun possession charges in New Jersey.\nChristie on Wednesday pardoned Todd Doering, Brian Fletcher and Elizabeth Griffith whose charges stemmed from separate incidents.\nDoering was arrested in July 2010 in Logan Township and later convicted of unlawful possession. Fletcher was arrested in June 2015 in Hamilton Township and later charged. Griffith was arrested on an unlawful possession summons in Jersey City in July 2015.\nThe pardons come after Christie cleared the records earlier this year of Steffon Josey-Davis and Shaneen Allen who were charged with unlawful possession.\nThe Republican presidential hopeful has pointed to the gun-related pardons as evidence of his support for the Second Amendment as he's tried to make his case to skeptical conservative voters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:45:07.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
