The sources, however, said that the Prime Minister should avoid referring to the Bihar elections or make political statements in the programme as the state is going through Assembly polls and it would be a violation of the model code.\nThe Election Commission had in September given the go-ahead to the airing of Modi's 'Mann ki Baat' programme on September 20 provided nothing is said that may be construed as inducement to voters or having an impact on poll-bound Bihar where model code of conduct is in force.\nRepresentatives of the 'grand alliance,' including RJD and JD(U), had approached the EC seeking suspension of the programme till Bihar polls were in progress, raising doubts that it might be used it to influence voters.\nThe programme was aired even during Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi Assembly polls.\nThe Congress had accused the PM of violating the model code in his October 3, 2014 episode. But the Commission \"did not find anything\" in the broadcast which constituted violation of the model code of conduct.\n Election Commission Narendra Modi Mann ki Baat Also Read Nanavati panel report on 2002 Gujarat riots not tabled before state assembly Beni Prasad Verma strikes again, calls Narendra Modi a ‘monster’ Suddenly Sardar: A political game begins Five states object to special status to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/nation-current-affairs/article/no-red-flag-election-commission-modi-go-ahead-mann-ki-baat", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/modi%20radio_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/modi%20radio_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:44:26.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
