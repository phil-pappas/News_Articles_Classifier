The first group of 59 prisoners from the region will be released at the end of the month, according to federal probation officials. (Thinkstock photo) Comments \nWASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ The U.S. Justice Department has granted early release to 167 inmates from Upstate New York as part of a new effort aimed at cutting harsh drug sentences and reducing prison overcrowding, according to federal officials. \nThe Upstate prisoners are part of a group of 6,000 inmates nationwide who will leave prison early at the end of the month in the largest one-time release of federal prisoners in U.S. history. \nThe first wave of 59 Upstate prisoners granted reduced sentences are due to be released the weekend of Oct. 30 to Nov 1, said Matthew L. Brown, chief U.S. probation officer for the Northern District of New York. \nMost of the 59 inmates are from the Syracuse and Albany areas, Brown said. He declined to release their names, citing his department's policy. \nThe Justice Department in Washington did not reply to several requests for the names of the Upstate prisoners who were granted early release. \nAll told, more than 40,000 drug offenders in federal prison could see their sentences reduced by an average of 25 months, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. \nThe commission voted unanimously in April 2014 to reduce sentencing guidelines for most federal drug trafficking offenders. Those offenders will still serve an average of 108 months in prison. \nThe Justice Department said about one-third of those who will be released early are foreign citizens who will be deported. The remaining two-thirds will go to halfway houses or placed in home confinement before they are granted supervised release. \nU.S. Rep. John Katko, a former federal organized crime prosecutor in Syracuse, said he's concerned about the change in policy that could allow violent drug offenders back on the streets. \nKatko, R-Camillus, developed a reputation over more than a decade for breaking up violent gangs in Syracuse through innovative federal prosecution. \n\"There's a misnomer in the federal system that we prosecute drug users,\" Katko said in an interview. \"But what we're talking about is reducing the sentences of some pretty significant drug dealers.\" \nKatko said he has not been informed whether any of the drug dealers he convicted will be granted early release. \n\"These same individuals have benefited from prior sentencing reductions,\" Katko, referring to reductions ordered in 2008 and 2011 for crack cocaine or cocaine base dealers. \n\"I'm not sure if that is good because a lot of the guys I prosecuted were violent and pretty significant drug dealers,\" Katko said. He added, \"I'm going to give them every benefit of the doubt and hope they move forward and live productive lives.\" \nIn the Northern District of New York, which stretches across 32 counties from the Canadian border to Ulster County, federal officials reviewed the cases of 294 inmates and found 167 are eligible for early release, Brown said. \nThe U.S. Attorney's Office worked with federal probation officers and the federal public defender's office to review the eligible cases. \nAll told, the three parties agreed on early release in the cases of all but five inmates whose cases the reviewed, said Lisa Peebles, the federal public defender in Syracuse. \nThose five cases are being argued in court, and so far three of the inmates have been granted early release, Peebles said. \nUltimately, each case had to be reviewed and approved by the U.S. District Court judge who sentenced the inmates. Brown said the early release dates for the 167 inmates vary widely, with some due to remain in prison until 2028 serving their reduced sentences. \nA report by The Marshall Project found the prisoners granted early release are mostly black and Hispanic men, with an average age in the mid-30's. Most of the prisoners are likely to return to southern states, led by Texas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:01:43.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
