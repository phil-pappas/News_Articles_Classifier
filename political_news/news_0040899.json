'I told him he was loved' \nNext to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a group of six people who were nearby tried to keep Cirillo alive. Lawyer Barbara Winters was one of them. \nWhile the others performed CPR and put pressure on his wounds, Winters spoke to Cirillo . \n\"I told him he was loved, and that he was brave, and that he was a good man,\" Winters told CBC News. \n\"Your military family loves you,\" she remembered telling him. \"Look at these people, we're all here helping you. We're all trying to do what we can for you. We all love you.\" Police ran through the streets with their weapons drawn shortly after the shooting to establish a security perimeter downtown as investigators tried to determine if there were any other gunmen. (Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press) \nCirillo was taken to hospital but died of his injuries. \nAs the group of six — who still meet, connected even now by that day's ordeal — tried to save Cirillo's life, a still armed Zehaf-Bibeau drove to Parliament Hill, commandeered another vehicle and ran inside Centre Block. \nAfter a standoff with security staff in the Hall of Honour, outside the Library of Parliament, Zehaf-Bibeau was shot 31 times and died. \nThen sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers, now Canada's ambassador to Ireland, and RCMP Const. Curtis Barrett fired the fatal shots. \nIt was over within five minutes. Confusion reigned for hours \nWhile the attack took just minutes to unfold and the lone gunman was killed, confusion reigned for hours in downtown Ottawa as police worked to determine whether anyone else was involved. People within the downtown Ottawa security perimeter were told to leave hours after the shooting took place. The perimeter was lifted 10 hours after the shooter was gunned down. (Blair Gable/Reuters) \nThousands of workers were told to stay inside their buildings as hundreds of Ottawa police, RCMP and other officers responded , fanning out on downtown streets with their handguns and assault rifles drawn to establish a security perimeter. \nAt an afternoon news conference more than four hours later, police still weren't able to say whether there were any other shooters or suspects at large. \nThe downtown security perimeter was lifted that night, more than 10 hours after Cirillo was gunned down, but with still no confirmation about any other suspects, Ottawans went to sleep unsure if the threat had been eliminated. Hill security forces unified \nToday, security efforts on Parliament Hill and at the National War Memorial have changed. Armed Ottawa police officers have been keeping a watchful eye on the sentries guarding the National War Memorial in Ottawa since the guards returned to duty on Oct. 25, 2014, three days after a reservist was killed. (Canadian Press) \nAt the memorial, where an unarmed Cirillo was shot three times in the back, ceremonial guards remain unarmed on duty but are now closely watched by pairs of Ottawa police officers working in shifts, paid for by the Department of National Defence. \nAs for Hill security, OPP, RCMP and Ottawa police reports on the law enforcement response to the shooting all identified a need for improvement after the confusion experienced that day, created in part by the sheer scale of the response and the fact that Hill security at the time was the responsibility of three separate bodies: the RCMP and House of Commons and Senate forces. \nA newly created Parliamentary Protective Service officially took control of security throughout the parliamentary precinct in June of this year. It's directed by RCMP Chief Supt. Michael Duheme, reports to the RCMP's national division and is accountable to the Speakers of the House of Commons and the Senate. 'We're always at risk now' \nBut while the Hill security changes are good they're not enough, according to Senator Vern White, Ottawa's former chief of police. \nHis main point of contention is pedestrian access to the Parliament Hill lawn. The entry points to the lawn should be reduced from five to three with officers stationed at each point not to conduct searches, but to talk to people about the reasons for their visits and about what's inside any backpacks they're carrying. \n\"I think there is a naiveté on the Hill as to the real potential for something bad to happen and how quick it could happen,\" White said in an interview this week. \n\"You go through more of a security protocol getting in to watch the Senators play hockey than you do to walk up onto Parliament Hill.\" \nPeople inside Centre Block were fortunate there was only one person with one weapon and not much of a plan involved in the Oct. 22 attack, White said. \n\"I think if it had been more than one … it would have been much more tragic and much more difficult for us to get past,\" he said. \n\"This is a bit of our new normal. I'm not going to suggest what will happen tomorrow, but I do think we're always at risk now.\" With a file from Judy Trinh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:53:36.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
