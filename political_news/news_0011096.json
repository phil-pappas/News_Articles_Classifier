Israeli security forces conduct a search in the mixed French Hill neighborhood in mostly-Arab east Jerusalem on Tuesday.\nBy Teresa Welsh Oct. 13, 2015 | 6:43 p.m. EDT + More Israel is experiencing the most sustained campaign of violence it has seen since last summer's Gaza War, with near daily lone-wolf attacks and retaliations. But while Israeli and Palestinian leaders appear unable to stop the increasing intensity of stabbings and shootings, analysts say the violence is unlikely to escalate into a third intifada.\nThe problem is that ending the spate of smaller attacks could be more challenging for authorities on both sides than halting the uprisings that in the past have brought bombings and violence on a wide scale .\nRELATED\n3 Dead in Terror Attacks in Israel \"When I hear people talk about 'Is this the third intifada?' and then when you say, 'No,' they sort of breathe a sigh of relief. They shouldn't be relieved,\" says Khaled Elgindy, a former adviser to the Palestinians in the peace process and a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nElgindy says the previous intifadas, in 1988 and 2000, saw political leadership organizing and driving the insurrection.\n\"When you've got individualized, ad hoc violence that has no political address, it's a much bigger challenge from a security standpoint. Who do you negotiate with and/or pressure?\"\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas have called for restraint, but Tuesday alone saw five attacks across Israel , with three dead in Jerusalem. Netanyahu convened a meeting of his security cabinet to discuss further measures to restore calm, including a possible relaxation of firearms laws.\n\"This is not Netanyahu's fault, this is not Abbas' fault, necessarily,\" says Ilan Goldenberg, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a former chief of staff to the State Department's special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. \"I'm not sure either of them really want this, but neither of them are doing enough to restrain the elements in their society which cause these types of issues, and both could be doing more.\"\nIt's challenging for the Palestinian Authority in particular to stem the attacks because many of them are perpetrated in Jerusalem, where the PA has no jurisdiction. Elgindy says that if the death count continues to be so lopsided – currently eight Israelis have died but at least 27 Palestinians have lost their lives – even more Palestinians will retaliate.\nIsraeli Zaka volunteers stand next to the body of an Israeli victim after a Palestinian man drove into a bus stop and carried out a stabbing attack in a Jerusalem ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood on Tuesday.\nBut even the militant terrorist organization Hamas doesn't want things to get too far out of hand. Elgindy characterized Hamas' response to the violence as \"reserved,\" saying it isn't eager for another war like the one that exhausted the group last year.\n\"Hamas and Gazans in general are not in any hurry to trigger another confrontation in Gaza, certainly. Nobody wants to see that,\" Elgindy says. \"Even the Israeli leadership is very reticent of another go-round because the Israelis took some casualties last time around. I don't think anybody has the stomach for another round like that.\"\nBut even though Hamas doesn't want to get embroiled in another war, it doesn't stop them from encouraging violence in PA territory of the West Bank.\nRELATED\nIsraeli and Palestinian 'Brothers' Push for Dialogue to Solve Conflict \"Hamas are very happy to have violence flare up completely in the West Bank,\" says Ghaith al Omari, a former Palestinian peace negotiator. \"But they're doing everything in their power to make sure that it doesn't touch Gaza, so they're trying to prevent other organizations from firing missiles at Israel. So they want this to become a problem for the Palestinian Authority and Israel, but they don't want this to become a problem for their rule in Gaza.\"\nThe U.S. said Tuesday that it was in regular contact with the Israeli government and the Palestinian government regarding the incidents.\n\"We continue to stress the importance of condemning violence and combating incitement,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said. \"We remain deeply concerned about escalating tensions and urge all sides to take affirmative steps to restore calm and prevent actions that would further escalate tensions.\"\nGoldenberg says the U.S. could possibly take a more active role in urging restraint, similar to a meeting held last year between Secretary of State John Kerry , Netanyahu and Jordanian King Abdullah II in Amman. At their November meeting, the three leaders agreed to steps that ultimately succeeded in ending a rash of similar attacks.\n[ READ: Haifa Is an Island of Sanity as Violence Increases in Israel ]\n\"I would hope we can get to a similar situation now where the two sides can agree to de-escalate and find a way to take steps to de-escalate, as opposed to both sort of coming through with really hard-line statements that appeal to their base constituencies that only risk making situation worse,\" Goldenberg says.\nAs it is now, tension simmered last fall over access to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, which both Jews and Muslims hold to be scared. The site is currently administered by a Jordanian trust, and under that agreement only Muslims are allowed to pray there. Clashes frequently occur when Jews try to gain access to the site to worship, and Palestinians fear that Israel will abandon the current status quo agreement.\nAlthough signs don't point to a third intifada at this point, al Omari says everyone must remember how quickly things can change.\n\"Things are dictated right now by events on the ground, so it's very, very hard to predict how they're going to go,\" al Omari says. \"They're so volatile that unexpected events, terror attacks, what not, could ignite the entire situation into a higher intensity.\"\nTAGS: Israel Palestine", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe613m%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe613m%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Violence%20in%20Israel%20Won%27t%20Lead%20To%20a%20Third%20Intifada", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe613m%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe613m%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Violence%20in%20Israel%20Won%27t%20Lead%20To%20a%20Third%20Intifada&summary=The%20nature%20of%20the%20attacks%20is%20distinct%20from%20past%20uprisings.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe613m%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe613m%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Violence%20in%20Israel%20Won%27t%20Lead%20To%20a%20Third%20Intifada"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:07:31.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
