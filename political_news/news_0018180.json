Maarten Holl Share on twitter by James Frost New Zealand's sovereign wealth fund, which has outperformed its Australia counterpart, is going bullish on shares.\nDespite similar aims, mandates and investment horizons, the funds maintain vastly different allocations. While NZ Super is busy adding more listed equity exposure, the Future Fund has sold shares, adding to its private equity and cash holdings.\nAn update from NZ Super Fund shows twice the investments in shares than the Future Fund and no cash, a strategy that makes the $117 billion Future Fund look conservative.\nNZ Super Fund CEO Adrian Orr said that shares in some markets were attractively priced and that NZ$29.5 billion ($27 billion) fund could invest even more heavily in shares in coming months.\n\"Aggressive is the wrong word to describe the fund,\" he said. \"I could mount an argument that it's not aggressive enough more easily that I could an argument that it is too aggressive.\"\nOver the last one, three and five years NZ Super Fund has delivered returns of 14.64 per cent, 19.86 per cent and 16.85 per cent. Over the same period the Future Fund has delivered 15.4 per cent, 15 per cent and 11.9 per cent.\nThese differences appear destined to change the respective return profiles of each fund.\nNZ Super reported that the fund had a 65 per cent allocation to equities and zero exposure to cash last financial year. It says it has increased its share holdings to 67 per cent in the months since.\n The Future Fund had a comparatively defensive positioning of 33.8 per cent shares and 19.5 per cent cash. The next quarterly update is likely to show little change.\nRobust investment Future Fund managing director David Neal said its investments were robust and appropriate given the environment.\n\"Our portfolio is riskier than it looks. But it's materially less risky than NZ Super,\" he said.\n\"We made $17 billion last year and you don't deliver returns like that without a reasonable amount of risk. But this is taxpayer's money and there should be some prudence around the risk-taking.\"\nMr Neal said none of the concerns that have weighed on financial markets this year, including the impact of rising rates in the US and uncertainty around the Chinese economy, have been resolved.\n\"There are risks in a lot of places and what strikes us is that these are structural risks and not cyclical risks,\" he said.\nThe Future Fund has a significant allocation of 12.7 per cent to alternative investments or strategies that are uncorrelated with market returns in order to mitigate these risks. This has also informed the large cash position.\nMr Orr said that it was the responsibility of sovereign wealth funds to ensure they were taking enough calculated risk and that those funds who were overweight fixed income should hand the money back to the government.\n\"Standing still is not going to win anything\" he said. \"We are long-term confident in emerging markets and we are long-term confident in the European recovery.\"\nSmart Investor magazine inside Friday's Australian Financial Review", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/jamesafrost"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:54:18.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
