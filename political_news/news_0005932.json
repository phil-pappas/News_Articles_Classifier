(AP Photo/Steve Helber, File) Sponsored Links The Associated Press WASHINGTON â€” \nOhio Gov. John Kasich (KAY'-sik) has raised $4.4 million in his first two-and-a-half months as a Republican presidential candidate. \nThat's according to a campaign aide who shared the fundraising numbers ahead of midnight reporting deadline to federal regulators. \nKasich rose in some preference polls over the summer, particularly in the early voting state of New Hampshire. His fundraising report covers July through Sept. 30. So far Ben Carson, a political newcomer, leads in summertime fundraising with a $20 million haul. On the other end of the spectrum, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul raised $2.5 million in that time. \nKasich was the last to enter the Republican contest, which includes 14 other candidates. He had about $2.7 million in cash as of Sept. 30.
