During 2013 and 2014 combined, the state recorded 916 cougar fatalities, which represented 59 percent of the total quota for those two years. And of those 916 cats, only 501 were killed by hunters, who, it turns out, aren't very good at finding cougars. Actually, they're absolutely terrible at it. The state issued 56,000 cougar tags in 2014, and hunters killed 209. \nThe problem, as many people on the rural half of Oregon's Great Divide know, is Measure 18, which, among other things, banned the use of dogs to hunt cougars. Prior to the measure's passage in 1994, the state issued a small number of cougar tags every year – fewer than 1,000 – and hunters experienced a high rate of success. These days, hunters usually take cougars when they're looking for something else – deer and elk, for instance. The explosion of cougar tags can be explained, in part, by their inclusion in Sport Pacs, which bundle fishing licenses and tags for various game animals. \nIronically, wildlife managers who kill nuisance cougars often find them with the assistance of dogs. Plenty of cats are being hunted just as they were before 1994, then, but not by people paying to do it. \nOne way to address the problems associated with Oregon's booming cougar population is to allow hunters to use dogs as well, notwithstanding Measure 18. Rural lawmakers know this, which is why they routinely sponsor legislation to that effect. One particularly intriguing proposal floated during the 2015 session, sponsored by Sen. Bill Hansell, D-Athena , would have allowed voters in individual counties to overturn the ban on hunting with dogs. Senate Bill 126 went nowhere.

Individual counties don't get to exempt themselves from state laws simply because they don't like them. Besides, the thinking went, legislators have no business second-guessing voters by rewriting initiatives this extensively. \nAnd then marijuana happened. \nVoters last November approved Measure 91 , which legalized the sale and consumption of recreational marijuana. Like Measure 18 two decades ago, it applies statewide, emphasis on state. Yet the Legislature this year decided to give some local governments the authority to ban pot sales . The reasons for this decision were complicated and, on balance, reasonable. Still, the Legislature set a significant precedent and in doing so laid bare its own inconsistency. If it's OK for local governments to opt out of a measure that passed by a statewide vote last year, then surely it's not unreasonable to let counties opt out of a measure approved by statewide vote more than two decades ago. The exploding cougar population, in fact, argues in favor of such flexibility. \nBut there's still the divide to deal with. Oregonians in rural communities are more likely to experience the drawbacks of the state's rising cougar population than those in and around Multnomah County. They're also more likely to support the use of dogs, at least if the results of 1994's vote are any indication. Twenty seven of Oregon's 36 counties voted against Measure 18 in 1994 , but the nine supportive counties, thanks to their larger populations, prevailed. Without Multnomah County, in fact, Measure 18 would have failed. Oregon's center of political power is decidedly urban. \nIf Oregon's urban legislators are truly concerned with the state's urban-rural divide, they should pass Measure 18 opt-out legislation next year. Otherwise, they should be prepared to explain why deviating from the will of voters is OK when it comes to getting high (or keeping people from getting high), but not when it comes to managing a boom in the population of predators that eat pets and livestock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:00:48.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
