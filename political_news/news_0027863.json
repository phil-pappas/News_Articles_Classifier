But those close to the vice president caution that Biden still has not decided on whether he will jump in, and that the meeting was part of an effort by his team that has been ongoing for weeks to prepare in case Biden chooses to run. Members of Biden's team met this week with DNC staffers to discuss the details of what a run would entail, including the details on state filing deadlines, a Democratic official told CNN. The meeting was the latest in an effort over the past weeks by people close to the vice president to gather state-by-state details on ballot access in order to be prepared should the vice president decide he is going to enter the presidential race. RELATED: Biden navigates politics of son's death Read More A source close to the vice president told CNN earlier this week that a family meeting is planned for this weekend to discuss the possibility. The DNC meeting was first reported by The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza. Biden has been openly contemplating whether to enter the Democratic 2016 primary for weeks. He has spoken about it in interviews, including the emotional toll it could take on his family. Biden has been doing well in polls even as an undeclared candidate, though his former administration colleague Hillary Clinton continues to be the front-runner even with him in contention. He faces a number of hurdles should he enter the race, including the calendar, being behind on organization and fundraising, and the harsh spotlight of being a declared candidate as opposed to a sympathetic, grieving public official. Biden has said repeatedly he has not made a decision and doesn't lean either way.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:44:33.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
