The hearings that began in 2013, stretched into 2014 and then went on a long hiatus, resume next Tuesday. MacBeth, D-Cumberland, anticipates at least 5 meetings of the House Oversight Committee to probe \"who-knew-what -when, what can we put in place as a legislative body,to protect the state..[and] to make sure this never happens again.\" But MacBeth is not sure even this will be enough, and she agrees with the citizens' advocacy groups urging Governor Raimondo to initiate an \"independent investigation.\" \"How many years have we been going on with this?'' she asked rhetorically, during a telephone interview on Thursday. \"For some reason it is always a political issue when somebody's is running for governor, then they get in and they do nothing.\" \"So, if an independent investigation is going to hold people accountable...[then] absolutely,'' said MacBeth, citing as an example, then-House Finance Committee Chairman Steven Costantino, who withheld the information that the 2010 loan-guaranty legislation had been crafted to meet 38 Studios' financial needs when the bill reached the house floor. \"And that's what's difficult as the Oversight Committee,'' MacBeth said. \"Costantino - it's been shown, on the tape, that we were lied to, and specifically I was lied to ... He's no longer in office so we can't take a vote to remove him, and if an independent investigation can gather information to hold him or others accountable, then absolutely.'' It remains unclear where the State Police investigation stands, and whether the inquiry will result in a report on what the inquiry found - even if it does not result in criminal charges. In response to a Journal inquiry on September 25, after the Superior Court released a cascade of previously-unseen depositions taken in connection with the 38 Studios civil litigation, State Police Col. Steven G. O'Donnell said: \"We are reviewing all the documents from the depositions that were released to see if there are any new revelations that we are not aware of and or any inconsistencies from what we have already uncovered.'' Asked who was on the case at that point, he said: \"We have several detectives assigned to this from our Major Crimes and Financial Crime Unit. As you know, we have been investigating all aspects of this for several years. Any other details on what or how we investigate would be inappropriate to discuss...[But] we share all our investigative finds with the Attorney General's office.'' Asked as recently as Monday if the State Police, regardless of whether their inquiry results in criminal charges, would issue a report as they did after a deep dive into the Cranston Police Department, O'Donnell said: \"You asked me before about a report at the end of the investigation and my response would vary depending on the outcome.'' Bottom line: \"It's a question that can't be answered until we conclude our investigation,''he said. Asked if that was imminent, he said: \"We are still reviewing and analyzing the volumes of documents made available to us.'' For MacBeth, the unanswered questions she would like investigated go deep and wide. She remains frustrated, for example, by the many unanswered questions, including: the reasons then-Governor Chafee's 2012 cancelled the forensic audit he initiated of how 38 Studios spent the state-backed loan, and why the state not produced any evidence of what the auditors from deloitte LLP found before they were taken off the case. \"I can get no documents from them. Why not?'' she said Thursday. \"They started the audit. Did they find something? My gut is telling me there is something there.'' As a starting point, MacBeth said she sent ex-Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling a message on Facebook last week. In her message, she said, she offered the oft-maligned founder of the failed company that left taxpayers on the hook for a $75 million loan guaranty, \"the opportunity to come forward'' and tell his side of the story. As of mid-day Thursday, she had not heard back. But with House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello's backing, MacBeth said it will be implicit in each of the more formal invitations-to-testify that go out, that refusal to appear voluntarily may result in a subpoena. Aside from Schilling, her list of potential invitees includes former Governors Chafee and his predecessor, Donald Carcieri; Costantino; 38 Studios deal-maker Michael Corso, and if it can be arranged, then-House Speaker Gordon D. Fox, now in a federal prison in Pennsylvania on unrelated corruption charges. The re-opening of the House oversight hearings led a coalition of \"five good government groups,'' including one led by two-time gubernatorial candidate Ken Block and the Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity, to take credit for the \"re-invigorated 38 Studios investigation'' and other developments. \"Clearly, the pressure our coalition has put on legislative leaders has had an impact in the General Assembly,\" said Republican Block, speaking on behalf of Watchdog RI. Now it is time for the Governor to do her part to fulfill her campaign obligation; she needs to recognize that the people of Rhode Island are owed this independent investigation.\" There was no immediate response on Thursday from Democrat Raimondo to the groups' demand that she initiate a simultaneous - but independent investigation which Block recalled her promising during the 2014 campaign for governor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:27:57.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
