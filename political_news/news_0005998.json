Could not subscribe, try again later Gareth Chaney Collins Taoiseach Enda Kenny TD \nThe Taoiseach has insisted there will be no “footsie” with Fianna Fail if his party is voted back into power. \nEnda Kenny ruled out forming a coalition with the opposition party and believes that nobody will “do business” with them. \nAsked by Newstalk’s Pat Kenny about a possible united Government, he replied: “There will be no footsie with Fianna Fail. Fianna Fail have ruled themselves out of doing business with anybody. \n“They must be looking for an aspirational overall majority. I don’t think that’s going to happen.” \nMr Kenny said he would serve again as leader if that is what the people decide they want. \nHe added he thinks it is unlikely the party will win an overall majority giving them the mandate to lead a government themselves. \nThe Taoiseach also reaffirmed his support for Labour , repeating his view that the party and Fine Gael provide stability, an opportunity to fix the economy and get people back to work. \nHe said: “That’s our core message and we’ve stuck with that for four and half years. \n“We haven’t done everything but we’ve worked with the people to pull our country out of an economic swamp, wash it down, fill the engine with fuel.” \nMr Kenny also definitively ruled out a General Election this side of Christmas. \nMeanwhile, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin has repeatedly insisted he too has no interest in joining forces with Fine Gael, or Sinn Fein . \nAnd former minister Willie O’Dea has said that entering government with Mr Kenny’s party as the junior coalition partner would “be the end of Fianna Fail as we know it”. \nThe Limerick TD added he would refuse to support such a move, claiming Fine Gael is responsible for right-wing policies that hurt vulnerable people. \nHe said: “Am I going to tell the people I meet who say they want to get rid of Enda Kenny that I will actually put him back in?” \nIt has been widely speculated that the Taoiseach will call a snap election next month. \nBut the Mr Kenny is adamant that his party will go full term into the spring before the country is called to the polls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:20:46.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
