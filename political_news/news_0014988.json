Being given the green light to go ahead protects companies from punishment if a transaction later turns out to be criminal. \nHowever, Mr Kirby said the requirement on the NCA to respond to these consent requests within seven days was placing a bigger burden on limited personnel and that he was concerned by the “the abuse, or potential abuse” of the Sars system. He called for the rules to be changed to stop the practice. \n“The number of consent Sars is moving up,” he said. “We are then forced, if you like, to put quite a lot of resources into that . . . and that does provide a due diligence function for some institutions. \n“It does not seem right to me that it is the industry deciding what law enforcement looks at and does not look at,” Mr Kirby added. “What they put in for consent, rather than law enforcement actually having a say . . . the proposals we are examining would be that the consent regime ceases to exist.” \nDavid Cameron, prime minister, promised this summer to act against corrupt foreigners using secretive holding companies and “dirty money” to make property investments in Britain. As part of the government’s wider mission to make sure London is not a “safe haven” for laundered assets, the Home Office is conducting a review into the Sars regime and is expected to publish an action plan by the end of the year. \nThe government is likely to draw on proposals from the charity Transparency International, which has already called for a complete overhaul of the Sars system. The organisation revealed this summer that only seven suspicious transactions, worth £113m, were blocked from going ahead in 2014, and concluded that the UK’s framework for seizing corrupt assets was “not fit for purpose”. \nIt has suggested the implementation of new legal orders that would make it incumbent on customers requesting suspicious transaction investigations to prove the legitimacy of their funds. \nNick Maxwell, head of advocacy and research at Transparency International, said the main problem with Sars was that the seven-day turnround time was unrealistic for identifying cases of international corruption. As a result of that deadline, he said, the authorities ended up granting permission for 83 per cent of potentially corrupt deals for which a report had been requested. \n“Everyone involved in that transaction gets a de facto rubber stamp from law enforcement that, yes they did report, so they did their duty as professionals involved in the issue and law enforcement raised no objection,” Mr Maxwell said. \n“So not only do they not have any liability for . . . money-laundering that may or may not have taken place, but . . . the rubber stamp means these professionals are then legally obliged to continue the transaction and not provide any barrier to the customer.” \nHe said this abuse of the system was “undermining, not only for justice but also for due diligence professionals who put a lot of work into filing high quality reports”. \nThe NCA is attempting to increase the scope of its operations against money launderers by employing tactics normally used against drug-smuggling gangs, such as undercover officers, informants and covert surveillance. \n“These all need to be properly authorised at the appropriate levels, and are traditionally used in drugs or firearms trafficking,” Mr Kirby said. “Money-laundering is a serious crime and it is appropriate, necessary and proportionate to use those tools against this and against other forms of economic crime, including bribery and corruption.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:33:12.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
