I am for that. That’s a big economic development.” \nPushed by Wallace on his own attempted use of eminent domain in Atlantic City the 1990s, Trump said that situation was “economic development,” but the woman who refused to sell him her property for expansion of his Trump Plaza Hotel actually saved him a lot of money by not taking his offer. \n“Because I have a hotel,” said Trump, “And in order to expand the hotel and add 2,000 rooms, I would have had to take her thing. Now, the 2,000 rooms would have provided about 2,500 jobs. I ultimately offered a lot of money, she didn’t take it, I didn’t build the hotel. I didn’t do it. Saved me a lot of money because Atlantic City, you know, I had the good sense to leave 7 years ago. I got very lucky. Yeah, I think that would have been a good eminent domain because it would have provided thousands of jobs. And this is a woman who couldn’t have cared less about her house. All she wanted was money.” \nThe only problem with the statement Trump made is, that if for every other town that wants to use eminent domain the site must provide 7000 jobs, and when the Donald wants a site 2500 jobs is enough to call for eminent domain, Does the Donald have different standards for him then for the rest of the country?, the voters have a right to know.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:58:06.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
