Rep. Kevin McCarthy speaks about his decision to drop out of the election for House speaker in the Longworth House Office Building on Oct. 8, 2015.\nBy Sean Froelich Oct. 8, 2015 | 6:01 p.m. EDT + More WASHINGTON – Rep. Mike Conaway entered the Capitol building Thursday morning prepared for Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's ascension to top House leadership, until an unimaginable announcement shook the Hill.\n\"I'm stunned quite frankly,\" said Conaway, R-Texas. \"I sent him a note earlier in the day calling him 'Mr. Speaker,' so I had no warning other than when the room was being set up. He was sitting at the front, which would have been an odd place for him to sit as a candidate.\"\nRELATED\nMcCarthy Leaves Speaker Race, So What's Next for Republicans? Similar shock and awe roared through Capitol Hill after the bombshell announcement that McCarthy, R-Calif., had dropped out of the race for speaker of the House . Only hours earlier, McCarthy appeared the overwhelming favorite to replace the current speaker, John Boehner .\nAfter learning the news, lawmakers filled the corridors of House office buildings and mixed with reporter scrums, expressing their disbelief. Conaway said McCarthy unexpectedly took the floor in an earlier meeting to make his unforeseen plans known.\n\"It was one of those circumstances where something was out of whack, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it,\" Conaway said.\nMcCarthy later said in a news conference that the House needed a fresh face to lead.\n\"If we're going to unite and be strong, we need a new face to do that,\" he said.\nThursday's reveal was only the latest surprise announcement coming from a fractured Republican conference this fall, after Boehner, R-Ohio, said late last month that he would be stepping down from his position at the end of October.\nWith McCarthy gone, some Republicans predicted many new candidates will soon surface. And across the aisle on the Democratic side of the House, there was more worry than celebration at the majority's misfortune.\nCongress faces upcoming fiscal deadlines , and a contentious leadership fight could stall progress.\n\"No one saw this coming,\" said Rep. Bill Foster, D-Ill. \"I'm personally very worried that this is a bad time for this to happen to our country … we need coherent leadership.\"\nRep. Charles Boustany, R-La., also shared deep concern about the timing of the leadership vacuum.\nRELATED\nKevin McCarthy Drops Out of House Speaker Race, Pundits React\n\"I think it's very destructive,\" he said. \"It's harmful to the constitutional order. It's bad for the institution. It's bad for the country. We need to settle it.\"\nFollowing McCarthy's move, Reps. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and Daniel Webster, R-Fla., were the two remaining declared candidates for speaker.\nBut whether one of them – or someone else – will take up the gavel remains murky.\n\"I would not have predicted today's happenings,\" said Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va. \"So I dare not predict what will happen next.\"\nTAGS: politics McCarthy, Kevin", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0sk3%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Kevin%20McCarthy%20Shocks%20the%20Hill%20by%20Bowing%20Out%20of%20Speaker%27s%20Race&summary=The%20front-runner%20to%20be%20the%20next%20House%20speaker%20unexpectedly%20took%20himself%20out%20of%20the%20running%20Thursday.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0sk3%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Kevin%20McCarthy%20Shocks%20the%20Hill%20by%20Bowing%20Out%20of%20Speaker%27s%20Race", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0sk3%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0sk3%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Kevin%20McCarthy%20Shocks%20the%20Hill%20by%20Bowing%20Out%20of%20Speaker%27s%20Race", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0sk3%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0sk3%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:31:23.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
