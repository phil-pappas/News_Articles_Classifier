It is unclear if she clicked on any attachments and exposed her account.\nClinton received the infected emails, disguised as speeding tickets from New York, over four hours early the morning of Aug. 3, 2011. The emails instructed recipients to print the attached tickets. Opening an attachment would have allowed hackers to take over control of a victim's computer.\nSecurity researchers who analyzed the malicious software in September 2011 said that infected computers would transmit information from victims to at least three server computers overseas, including one in Russia. That doesn't necessarily mean Russian intelligence or citizens were responsible.\nNick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton's Democratic presidential campaign, said: \"We have no evidence to suggest she replied to this email or that she opened the attachment. As we have said before, there is no evidence that the system was ever breached. All these emails show is that, like millions of other Americans, she received spam.\"\nPractically every Internet user is inundated with spam or virus-riddled messages daily. But these messages show hackers had Clinton's email address, which was not public, and sent her a fake traffic ticket from New York state, where she lives. Most commercial antivirus software at the time would have detected the software and blocked it.\nThe phishing attempts highlight the risk of Clinton's unsecure email being pried open by foreign intelligence agencies, even if others also received the virus concealed as a speeding ticket from Chatham, New York. The email misspelled the name of the city, came from a supposed New York City government account and contained a \"Ticket.zip\" file that would have been a red flag.\nClinton has faced increasing questions over whether her unusual email setup offered proper secrecy protection and records retention. The emails themselves — many redacted heavily before public release — have provided no shocking disclosures thus far and Clinton has insisted the server was secure.\nDuring Clinton's tenure, the State Department and other U.S. government agencies faced their own series of hacking attacks. U.S. counterterrorism officials have linked them to China and Russia. But the government has a large staff of information technology experts, whereas Clinton has yet to provide any information on who maintained her server and how well it was secured.\nThe emails released Wednesday also show a Clinton confidant urging her boss and others in June 2011 not to \"telegraph\" how often senior officials at the State Department relied on their private email accounts to do government business because it could inspire hackers to steal information. The discussion never mentioned Clinton's own usage of a private email account and server.\nThe exchange begins with policy chief Anne-Marie Slaughter lamenting that the State Department's technology is \"so antiquated that NO ONE uses a State-issued laptop and even high officials routinely end up using their home email accounts to be able to get their work done quickly and effectively.\" She said more funds were needed and said an opinion piece might make the point to legislators.\nClinton said the idea \"makes good sense,\" but her chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, disagreed: \"As someone who attempted to be hacked (yes I was one), I am not sure we want to telegraph how much folks do or don't do off state mail b/c it may encourage others who are out there.\"\nThe hacking attempts were included in the 6,300 pages the State Department released, covering a period when U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden and the Arab Spring rocked American diplomacy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:21:18.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
