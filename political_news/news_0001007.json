In addition to hundreds of events in the United States , Unity Day is now recognized around the world with students and organizations doing numerous activities. Last year, a middle school in Mexico held the first international Run, Walk, Roll Against Bullying event, students in New Zealand decorated bullying prevention cookies, and corporate employees in Argentina wore orange and shared about their event on social media.\nThis year, schools and communities are planning more ways to join together against bullying: A dentist office in Minnesota is using orange rubber bands for braces, an entire community in Colorado is placing orange ribbons on every tree, and a school in Illinois is handing out orange \"kudos\" to kids caught doing random acts of kindness.\nThere are many ways to show support on Unity Day and throughout October:\nWear orange: People can send a message of unity and support by wearing orange items, such as a T-shirt, socks, hat, tie, wristband, or shoelaces.\nUnite on social media: PACER has created a Unity Day Facebook event that people can \"Attend\" and \"Share,\" as well as a cover photo that individuals can post on their personal Facebook pages. Unity Day updates, photos, and videos can be shared on Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag #UnityDay2015.\nDonate: Show your support by making a donation to the Together Against Bullying (TAG) campaign, inspired by Carrot Top. After making a donation at togetheragainst.org , a person will receive real or virtual stickers which they can use to TAG their friends and share on social media using the hashtags #TogetherAgainst and #TagItForward.\nDiscuss Unity in the classroom and community: The YOU'RE NOT ALONE, WE'RE HERE FOR YOU campaign provides resources to educate students, adults and community members on ways to be there for someone who is experiencing bullying.\nVisit PACER's websites: PACER offers an array of tools on its three websites: PACER.org/bullying , PACERKidsAgainstBullying.org , and PACERTeensAgainstBullying.org .\nBecome a champion against bullying: Many nonprofits, schools, and community groups collaborate with PACER during National Bullying Prevention Month, including National Education Association, American Federation for Teachers, and the National PTA.\nAbout PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center: Founded in 2006, PACER's National Bullying Prevention Center, actively leads social change, so that bullying is no longer considered an accepted childhood rite of passage.
