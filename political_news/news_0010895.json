The two had faced a retrial after an earlier jury failed to reach a verdict on their case earlier this year. \nAfter the verdicts came through, the two men spoke of their four-year long Elveden \"nightmare\" and questioned why £30m of taxpayers' money had been spent on prosecuting people for \"doing their job\". \nMr Pyatt's defence lawyer Nigel Rumfitt QC told the court there had been a \"monumental error of judgment in pursuing the case\". \nMr Pharo called it “the end of a four-year long nightmare” and said: “..how could anyone imagine spending more than £30m over four years prosecuting journalists for doing their job was remotely in the public interest?” \nOperation Elveden has faced wide ranging criticism after trials of more than 20 journalists have resulted in acquittals and hung juries, with only two convictions of journalists by a jury. One of those convictions was later quashed. Fifteen journalists have been investigated but told they face no further action. \nAmong those acquitted of Elveden charges are the former Sun editor Rebekah Brooks, who has now returned to her job as chief executive of News Corp’s UK division. \nThe Crown Prosecution Service has come under pressure this year for pursuing the cases against journalists and also for its decision — which was later overturned — that the Labour peer Lord Janner should not face child sex abuse charges because the severity of his dementia made him unfit to stand trial. \nThe alleged offences investigated in Operation Elveden precede the 2012 implementation of the Bribery Act 2010. In a bribery case the person paying a bribe and the person receiving the bribe are treated in the same way. \nHowever in many of the trials, the CPS relied on the complex and ancient common law offence of “misconduct in a public office”, which dates back to the 13th century, to prosecute the journalists. \nA ruling in March by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas on two appeals in Elveden cases emphasised the high threshold of seriousness needed to prosecute the offence for journalists and made it clear that journalists and their public official sources were not to be regarded as equally culpable. \nLord Thomas said more consideration should be given to the potential harm, or lack of it, to the public interest in the disclosure of information. \nThe Elveden investigation has been more successful in convicting public officials. Some 29 public officials have been found guilty after receiving corrupt payments totalling £180,000. \nThe CPS defended the decision to retry the two journalists. “It is right that a jury, rather than the CPS, decides whether a defendant is guilty or not. The CPS is duty-bound to prosecute cases which provide a realistic prospect of conviction and are in the public interest,” it said. \n“This test is significantly different to that of a jury, which must only convict if they are assured of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. The case was allowed by the judge to progress to a full trial and we respect the verdict of the jury today.” it added. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
