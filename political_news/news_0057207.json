Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said yesterday that legal amendment would redefine the term national security, which would be extended to cover modern economic and technological challenges. This would result in a major revamp of the NSC's executive structure, which would include economic and ICT officials, plus a sprinkling of academics to facilitate the organisation's strategic planning. The deputy PM said the act has not been amended for more than 50 years, since Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat's government, which looked at security merely from a military perspective. Besides the change in the organisation's structure, the revamp would result in changes in roles and authority of the NSC as well, Wissanu said. \"This is a major structural revamp of the NSC for the first time in 56 years,\" said Wissanu. 643 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:11:41.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
