Key House GOP groups endorse Ryan for... \nWhile the bill does a number of good things, it falls short in other areas, Obama said. \"It resorts to gimmicks,\" he said. \nReporters and photographers were invited to watch the president veto the measure in the Oval Office, the AP said. The president said the bill boosts defense spending by $38 billion without increasing domestic spending. He wants higher spending for both, the wire service said. Another provision Obama doesn't like would make it harder to close Guantanamo Bay. When Congress passed the bill earlier this month, The AP reported that, if it's vetoed, it would be only the fifth time such a measure has been blocked by a president in more than 50 years. If the veto is sustained, Congress would be forced to rewrite the bill or try to settle a larger budget dispute, AP said. \nWhen the bill was passed, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said that he expected to prevent Republicans from overriding a presidential veto, which needs 67 votes. \n\"Our Democrats have stated without any question that if it comes time to sustain a presidential veto, that will be done,\" Reid told CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:34:19.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
