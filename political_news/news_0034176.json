(Darren McCollester/Getty Images) By Patrick J. Kennedy October 23 at 7:49 PM Patrick J. Kennedy, a Democrat, represented Rhode Island’s 9th Congressional District in the House from 1995 to 2011, and is co-founder of the Kennedy Forum on mental health and addiction and co-author the new book “ A Common Struggle: A Personal Journey Through the Past and Future of Mental Illness and Addiction .”\nLast week, President Obama announced a multipronged effort to address the epidemic of addiction to prescription opiate painkillers in this country. This is long overdue and, unfortunately, like most action on addiction and mental illness, comes after the problem has reached Stage 4 — and is that much harder to treat — when it could have been diagnosed and treated at Stage 1, or perhaps even prevented altogether.\nI bring a unique perspective to this issue, one I would prefer I did not have. For 10 years, I sat on the House Appropriations Committee, overseeing every federal agency charged with addressing this subject. And during much of that time, I was addicted to prescription opiate painkillers myself. I would keep them in an aspirin bottle in my jacket so nobody would think it was strange when I popped one during an appropriations hearing.\nI was one of those people you read about. I started taking OxyContin for back pain and then started seeking it for other, psychic pain. And when the original prescribing doctor wouldn’t give me more — after I explained that I lost my pills in my luggage, down the sink, the dog ate them, whatever — I could always find another who would write a prescription. You don’t have to be a congressman or a Kennedy to do this. All drug-seeking behavior is pretty much the same, as is society’s response to it: Mostly we ignore it, and when we decide to do something, our approach is usually limited and focused on impeding supply and shaming users rather than treating substance-use disorders and other mental illnesses as medical problems.\nNow that I have been sober and well for more than four years, I can see the cycles of my illness. There were too many times when I went away to be medically detoxed from opiates but refused to look at the bigger picture: that if I wasn’t treated for my underlying mental illness as well as my addiction, and if I wasn’t treated as if both conditions were chronic illnesses instead of passing emergencies, I would never be truly healthy and sober.\nMy worry about what Obama has proposed — and about what his and previous administrations have done to try to address prescription opiate addiction — is that it focuses primarily on restricting and regulating supply and on medical detoxification. In reality, we need to face opiate addiction as part of a wider revolution in the way that we diagnose, treat and insure against mental illness and addiction. When patients are flagged for gaming the system while seeking Oxys, as I was many times, we need to view their situation as a cry for fully integrated medical care, not just a case for opiate detox.\nOn paper, the president has presided over the greatest expansion of mental-health and substance-use-disorder benefits in American history. My father, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), and I were proud to have been part of that effort,", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399173323"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:11:58.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
