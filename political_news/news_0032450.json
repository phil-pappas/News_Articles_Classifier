He also added that his solutions to issues come about thanks to \"logic\" and \"evidence.\"\nThe former neurosurgeon initially responded to comments made by Trump last week, saying he would support allowing Russian President Vladimir Putin into Syria to fight the Islamic State, even though their main reasoning seems to be propping up the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\"I do not want to allow Vladimir Putin to expand his influence,\" said Carson, who sits third in the Washington Examiner 's latest power rankings . \"That's been his goal for quite some time now.
