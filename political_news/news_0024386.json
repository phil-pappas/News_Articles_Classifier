In August, the president announced in a White House ceremony that the E.P.A. rules had been completed, but they had not yet been published in the government’s Federal Register . Within hours of the rules’ official publication on Friday, a legal battle will begin, pitting the states against the federal government. It is widely expected to end up before the Supreme Court. “I predict there will be a very long line of people at the federal courthouse tomorrow morning, eagerly waiting to file their suits on this case,” said Jeffrey R. Holmstead, a lawyer for the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, who represents several companies that are expected to file such suits. AUG. 31, 2015 While the legal brawls could drag on for years, many states and companies — including those that are suing the administration — have also started drafting plans to comply with the rules. That strategy reflects the uncertainty of the ultimate legal outcome — and also means that many states could be well on the way to implementing Mr. Obama’s climate plan by the time the case reaches the Supreme Court. The Environmental Protection Agency’s climate change rules are at the heart of Mr. Obama’s ambitious agenda to counter global warming by cutting emissions of planet-warming carbon pollution. If they withstand the legal challenges, the rules could shutter hundreds of polluting, coal-fired power plants and freeze construction of such plants in the future, while leading to a transformation of the nation’s power sector, from reliance on fossil fuels to wind, solar and nuclear power. Mr. Obama has also used the rules as leverage in his negotiations to reach a global climate change accord in Paris in December. He hopes to broker a deal committing every country to enacting domestic climate change policies. The official publication of the rules will also spur legislative pushback on Capitol Hill, where Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will introduce two resolutions to block the rules. The legislation will be introduced under the rarely used Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to block an executive branch rule within 60 legislative days of its publication. While the resolutions are likely to pass the Republican-controlled Congress, Mr. Obama would be expected to veto them. But by introducing the resolutions, Mr. McConnell hopes to telegraph to the world that Congress does not support the Obama regulations — a message that could be amplified if the Senate votes on the resolutions before or during the Paris summit meeting. The Obama administration has sought to ensure that the rules will not come under question before that meeting. By delaying the official publication of the rules until nearly three months after they were announced, for example, the administration appeared to be trying to ensure that no major legal decisions to weaken them would be issued before the Paris meeting. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story A broad and powerful coalition of governors, attorneys general, coal companies, electric utilities and business groups such as the United States Chamber of Commerce will file suits contending that the rules, put forth under the 1970 Clean Air Act , represent an illegal interpretation of the law. They will also petition to delay implementation of the rule until the case is argued before federal court. “The president’s illegal rule will have devastating impacts on West Virginia families, and families across the country,” Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia said in a statement. Mr. Morrisey, whose home state’s economy is heavily dependent on coal mining, is expected to play a lead role in the multistate lawsuit. States and companies may be hedging their bets. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal’s administration plans to sue the E.P.A. At the same time, the governor, a Republican, has also instructed his director of environmental protection, Judson H. Turner, to begin crafting a plan to comply with the rules. “The governor of Georgia said to me, whatever action may be taken on the legal front, we’ll need to develop a plan that works for Georgia,” Mr. Turner said. If Mr. Obama’s plan survives the legal challenge, Mr. Turner added, “we’ll have the confidence that we’ll put a plan for Georgia together that’s better than a federal plan.” Similar dynamics are playing out in many other states that are suing over the rules, said Vicki Arroyo, the executive director of the Georgetown University Climate Center, which focuses on state-level climate policies. “It’s really rare to find a state that just says, ‘hell no,’” she said. The rules assign each state a target for reducing its carbon pollution from power plants, but allows states to create their own custom plans for doing so. That rule is designed to encourage states to make major changes in their electric power sector — for example, to shut down coal-fired power plants and replace them with wind and solar power . It is also designed to encourage states to enact so-called cap-and-trade systems, under which they would place a cap on carbon emissions and create a market for buying and selling carbon pollution credits. States have to submit an initial version of their plans by 2016 and final versions by 2018. States that refuse to submit a plan will be forced to comply with a plan developed by the federal government. Republican governors have denounced the rule, particularly its emphasis on pushing cap-and-trade systems — in his first term, Mr. Obama tried but failed to send a cap-and-trade bill through Congress. Since then, the term has become politically toxic: Republicans have attacked the idea as “cap-and-tax.” The governors of five states — Texas, Indiana, Wisconsin, Louisiana andOklahoma — have threatened to refuse to submit a plan of any kind. But economists and many industry leaders have found that in many cases, the easiest and cheapest way for states to comply would be by adopting cap-and-trade systems. American Electric Power, an electric utility that operates in 11 states, is among the companies that intends to sue the administration over the rule. At the same time, the company’s vice president, John McManus, said, “We think it makes sense for states to at least start developing a plan. The alternative of having a federal plan has risks.” And he said that his company could support a cap-and-trade plan. “The initial read is that a market-based approach is more workable,” he said. \nFollow the New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .
