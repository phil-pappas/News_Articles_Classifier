JOHNNY WAS is honored to support the American Cancer Society in its important work against breast cancer, the most common cancer among women in the United States . For more information, please visit www.johnnywas.com/shop-for-a-cause .\nABOUT THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY\nThe American Cancer Society's Discovery Shops were founded by a volunteer fifty years ago, with the mission to create a thrift store that sold only the best gently used clothing, furniture, and collectibles with net proceeds benefitting the ACS. To date, the 40+ Discovery Shops across California have raised over $308,000,000 to benefit the American Cancer Society.\nThe American Cancer Society is fighting breast cancer by supporting women affected by the disease as well as working tirelessly to find cures. The organization has developed screening guidelines and helps provide mammograms in order to find breast cancer early, when it is easiest to treat. The Society also provides 24/7 access to information and resources for individuals facing breast cancer - and all cancers - via our toll-free number 1-800-227-2345 or cancer.org. Additionally, the ACS invests more in research to find, prevent, treat, and cure cancer than any other non-governmental organization.\nABOUT JOHNNY WAS\nSince its inception in 1987, JOHNNY WAS has been embraced by free-spirited and confident women who are drawn to the brand's unique signature aesthetic: a juxtaposition between vintage and modern, reserved and unrestrained, traditional and innovative. Inspired by world cultures, the arts, and historical dressmaker techniques, the JOHNNY WAS brand transcends fashion trends with its beautifully-crafted boho clothing and accessories. Embracing the quintessential California lifestyle, JOHNNY WAS appeals to the modern bohemian.\nABOUT LOOP COMMERCE\nLoop Commerce is driving a paradigm shift in commerce by removing the obstacles consumers face when trying to buy, deliver and receive a physical product as a gift. Used by the world's top retailers, Loop is the first and only enterprise-grade, product-based e-gifting solution that offers checkout, delivery and redemption of products as real gifts â€“ not gift cards.\n releases/johnny-was-to-partner-with-the-american-cancer-society-for-breast-cancer-awareness-month-300162341.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY32499&Transmission_Id=201510191738PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY32499&DateId=20151019", "http://www.johnnywas.com/shop-for-a-cause", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/johnny-was-to-partner-with-the-american-cancer-society-for-breast-cancer-awareness-month-300162341.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:25:44.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
