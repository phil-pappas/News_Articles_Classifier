Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the panel's top Democrat, said the report shows that no witness has substantiated what he called \"wild Republican conspiracy theories about Secretary Clinton and Benghazi,\" including a widely debunked claim that Clinton or other top officials issued a \"stand down\" order during the September 2012 attacks. \nClinton, a Democratic candidate for president, is set to testify Thursday at a public hearing.
