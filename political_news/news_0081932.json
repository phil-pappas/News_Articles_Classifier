Allen tried the same switch, but was eventually traded so he could return to his familiar end spot.\nCould that happen to Young, too?\nA report Sunday night indicated that, once Allen was dealt, Young asked the Bears for a trade. Asked to clarify Wednesday, Young didn’t.\n“Really just no comment on it, for real,” he said. ”I’m just here to be a player, man, and do whatever my coaches ask.\n“It’s all good. I’m just here to do what my coach is asking me and to be a professional.”\nYoung had three tackles and two quarterback hurries against the Raiders, but has yet to record a sack. He set a career high last season with 10.\nThe Chiefs, though, have allowed an NFL-high 19 sacks. Coach Andy Reid shouldered some of the blame, saying that he needed to scheme his way around the pressure.\n“Just making sure that I’m giving him plays that he can get the ball out on time,” he said. “That’s the No. 1 thing. I’ve got to do a better job with that.”\nIf anyone can use the sack, it’s Young.\n“That’s definitely not bad news,” Young said. “It just means we gotta be sharp. If you come out and lay down for anybody they’re going to run you over.\n“We still have to come to play, week in and week out.”\nFollow me on Twitter @patrickfinley\nEmail: pfinley@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:14:01.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
