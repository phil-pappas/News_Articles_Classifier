FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — The Broward County Commission on Oct. 13 voted unanimously to expand the jurisdiction’s domestic partner registry. Equality Florida, a statewide LGBT advocacy group, in a press release said the expanded registry will, among other things, ensure the county will recognize same-sex partnerships that are registered outside its jurisdiction. “Today’s vote is an affirmation of the enduring value of domestic partnership policies and ensures that thousands of unmarried, committed couples in Broward County will continue to have vital protections for their families,” said Equality Florida Deputy Director Stratton Pollitzer in a statement. Gays and lesbians have been able to legally marry in Florida since January. “Even as we celebrate marriage equality, it is important to understand that some couples do not marry for reasons both personal and practical but that these families are just as deserving of health care and other protections,” said Pollitzer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:09:58.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
