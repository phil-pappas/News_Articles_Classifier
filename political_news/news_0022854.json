Diabetes increases risk for heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and nerve damage. ADA estimates indicate that as many as 1 in 3 American adults will have diabetes by 2050 unless we take action.\nThe International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reports 387 million people living with diabetes worldwide (8.3 percent prevalence). The disease caused 4.9 million deaths in 2014, and every 7 seconds it claims another life.\nThe IDF represents over 230 national diabetes associations, including the ADA, in 170 countries and territories. In 1991, IDF and the World Health Organization created World Diabetes Day (WDD), a year-round campaign observed November 14 , to unite the global diabetes community, increase awareness and support advocacy on a global scale.\nA healthy diet and regular exercise are essential to preventing and managing diabetes. Therefore, BHG plans to observe WDD by encouraging its employees to take advantage of their workout break, one of BHG's employee benefits. For each individual that uses the onsite gym or participates in a group fitness class on Friday, November 13 , the company will donate $5 to the IDF.\nThroughout the month, BHG will publish sharable content on its blog, BHG360, and promote awareness on social media using #bhgtakesactiOn . BHG will also adopt the WDD blue circle logo, which signifies the unity of the global diabetes community. The symbol was adopted in 2007 after the U.N. Resolution on diabetes was passed.\nFor more information about diabetes in the U.S. and around the world, visit other ADA resources or explore the IDF Diabetes Atlas .\nAbout the American Diabetes Association\nThe American Diabetes Association is leading the fight to Stop Diabetes and its deadly consequences and fighting for those affected by diabetes.
