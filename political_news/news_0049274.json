But now according to a leading television channel on Wednesday, Mishra wasn’t in the hotel room at the time the woman alleged he assaulted him, a source close to the cricketer said.\n“She is not his girlfriend. He (Amit Mishra) didn’t even know that she was in his room. She picked up the access card from the hotel staff and entered the room without Amit’s knowledge,” the source claimed.\n“The time she has claimed to have been assaulted by Amit, he had gone out to have dinner with friends. Then how can he abuse or assault her. There was no fight. He didn’t assault her,” he added.\nRead: Amit Mishra to 'co-operate' with police after ODI series, says his brother\nAccording to the FIR, the woman pointed out that Mishra assaulted her in his room on September 25 and hit her with his fists and threw a kettle at her face.\n\"We have shot off a notice, summoning India cricketer Amit Mishra for allegedly physically assaulting and physically abusing a woman in his hotel room last month, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central, Sandeep Patil told reporters.\nAccording to the sources, Mishra has \"agreed\" to co-operate with the investigations and will appear before the police after the Mumbai ODI against South Africa is played on October 25.
