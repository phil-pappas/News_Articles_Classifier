Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Defense Minister Marise Payne are expected to attend the meeting. \nBut the talks could be pushed back to December if circumstances do not allow, the source said. \nJapan is fiercely competing with France and Germany to be selected by Australia as a partner to develop submarines for its navy, with each country urged to submit proposals required for the competitive evaluation process by the end of November. \nTo win its bid for what Australia calls the “largest defense procurement program in its history,” Japanese defense and foreign ministers are likely to pitch the advantages of partnering with Japan on the issue. \nJapan is crafting a proposal based on its Maritime Self-Defense Force’s Soryu-class diesel-electric submarines, seen as highly advanced with their stealth capabilities. \nJapan and Australian ministers are also likely to discuss ways to promote security cooperation and how to deal with China’s growing maritime assertiveness. \nTurnbull, who won a sudden party leadership challenge, is labeled by Chinese media as pro-China. Final adjustments are being made for the Australian prime minister to visit Japan in December. © KYODO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:44:40.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
