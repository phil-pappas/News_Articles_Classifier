Most normal people would have done all of the same things she did: sighing, choking back angry retorts, shaking a head in disbelief at times, even laughing at the absurdity of it all.” \n“Actually many people would have lost it early on and grabbed Gowdy by his goofy silver fro-hawk somewhere in hour six or seven, a fact that made Hillary by contrast look patient and presidential, in ways her campaign had been unable to achieve all year.” Related Posts Never miss a Political Wire post Your email address: * Please enter all required fields Correct invalid entries  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:10:43.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
