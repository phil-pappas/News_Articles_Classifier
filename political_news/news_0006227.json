He's lost three of his four fumbles this year.\nGordon said during the week that he looked forward to getting back into action.\nBut on Sunday, his powder blue throwback jersey didn't have a hint of a grass on it.\n— Bernie Wilson reporting from San Diego\n___\n4:40 p.m.\nUnbeaten New England didn't have to worry about a final attempt at a rally by the New York Jets.\nThe Washington Redskins took advantage of their last chance to finish off the biggest comeback in franchise history.\nTom Brady threw for 355 yards and two fourth-quarter touchdowns, and the Patriots took a two-game lead in the AFC East with a 30-23 win over the Jets.\nNew York was down 10 in the fourth quarter but recovered an onside kick after a field goal in the final seconds. A false start penalty when Ryan Fitzpatrick was trying to spike the ball after a completion ended the game with 1 second remaining, preventing a final play 37 yards from the end zone.\nKirk Cousins' third touchdown pass of the game with 24 seconds remaining finished off a 31-30 win over Tampa Bay after the Buccaneers led 24-0 in the second quarter.\nMatt Ryan had 251 yards passing and a touchdown, and Devonta Freeman ran for 116 yards to help Atlanta bounce back from its only loss in a 10-7 victory over Tennessee.\nMiami broke a franchise record for points in a half with 41 in the first half of a 44-26 win over Houston.\nSt. Louis rookie Todd Gurley had his third straight 100-yard game, rushing for 128 and his first two touchdowns in a 24-6 win over Cleveland.\nIn other early finals Sunday, Jacksonville beat Buffalo 34-31 in London, Kansas City topped Pittsburgh 23-13, Minnesota rallied past Detroit 28-19 and New Orleans held off Indianapolis 27-21.\n___\n4:00 p.m.\nJohnny Manziel has replaced an apparently injured Josh McCown late in Cleveland's game at St. Louis.\nMcCown left favoring his right arm with just under 4 minutes remaining. He had been sacked four times and lost two fumbles.\nIt's the first appearance for Manziel since he was questioned Oct. 12 by police in Avon, Ohio, after the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner argued with his girlfriend while driving on a highway. The league has said it is investigating the incident.\nThere was little fan reaction when Manziel entered the game, but the public address announcer incorrectly credited McCown with the first of three straight completions by Manziel before the 2-minute warning.\n___\n3:35 p.m.\nThe Redskins finally did something positive during a third quarter.
