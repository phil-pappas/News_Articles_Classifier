But Carson's commentary on gun policy is emblematic of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. The retired neurosurgeon is a political rookie who prefers to muse on the news of the day and make academic arguments, rather than offer a clear picture of what policies he'd pursue if elected. The freewheeling approach has put Carson at the top of many preference polls. Yet some Republicans question how long he will be able to stick with his style, even in an election year with such high discontent among conservatives with anyone in elected office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:15:18.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
