The lie that it is immigrants or refugees or asylum seekers that put pressure on our public services and infrastructure. What an outright despicable lie.\nPromoted stories “It is the UK Government themselves, by undermining those services and robbing the country of investment, that is putting pressure on them.\"\nDelegates later backed a motion on Israel-Palestine condemning \"Zionism as a racist ideology based on Jewish supremacy in Palestine\" and calling Israel's policy towards Palestinians \"apartheid\".\nIt also called for a separate Palestinian state, Israel shrunk to its 1967 borders, a boycott of Israeli goods and services, an end to Hamas being described as a terrorist organisation, and the release of all Palestinian political prisoners from Israeli jails.\nHis party’s co-convener and its longest serving parliamentarian, Harvie said he wanted the Greens to have more MSPs than ever next May, exceeding the seven returned in 2003.\nAddressing 700 delegates at the Clyde Auditorium, Harvie said the party had been through an extraordinary year - its membership up from 1200 to 9000 since the referendum - and now had an equally extraordinary opportunity to advance its policies at Holyrood.\nThe Greens hope to secure a list MSP from each of the eight Holyrood regions, with Harvie and Lothians MSP Alison Johnstone also standing in constituencies in Glasgow and Edinburgh.\nHarvie said the SNP had a “mixed” record, praising their policy in free university tuition, but warning they remained wedded to oil and gas technologies contributing to climate change.\nHe welcomed the SNP extending its fracking moratorium to underground coal gasification but said this had only come about through “Green pressure”.\nCaroline Lucas, the sole Green MP, also attacked May’s speech as “truly shocking”.\nShe said: \"Now, apparently, very conveniently, the economic crisis is the fault of refugees and those seeking a better life. It’s not asylum seekers or low paid migrants who traded in credit default swaps, or were bailed out with billions of pounds of taxpayers’ funds, or who are now back to business as usual collecting huge bonuses as though nothing ever happened - that was her own Tory party backers.”\nShe also thanked delegates for an \"inspiring example of positive politics” during the referendum.\nShare article The conference later voted to launch a distinctive Green campaign to remain in the EU and “non-compliance” to resist controversial Tory trade unions reforms.\nA Scottish Conservative spokesman said: \"Given some of the crazy motions being passed at their conference, the Greens are hardly in a position to criticise anyone on policy.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-11T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:35:01.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
