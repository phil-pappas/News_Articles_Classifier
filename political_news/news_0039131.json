More Western alarm grows over Aleppo \nWhat this means has divided rebels. Some fear that the ground is being laid for a push that will threaten the survival of moderate opposition forces. Others say the lack of a definitive victory shows the success of their tactics to stall ground advances by the army and the Shia Lebanese and Iraqi militia backers. \n“The battle is better than excellent for the rebels, even though for the civilians the price has been terrible,” said Wassim Saadeddine, an activist from the city of Rastan in Syria’s Homs province — one of the areas targeted by the Russian-backed campaign in an attempt to protect Mr Assad’s hold on central Syria and his stronghold on the coast. \n“Russia pounds us with air strikes and opens the way for Assad forces, but as soon as they advance they come into an area heavily mined by the rebels. They come with tanks, but the rebels push them back with Konkurs and TOW [anti-tank] missiles,” he said. \nPessimists fear that the worst is yet to come and point out the attacks have been focused on strategic targets. Activists say large hospitals have been bombed in northern Aleppo, which Mr Assad has set his sights on winning back. Strikes have also killed several rebel leaders. \nOpposition headquarters have been flattened in raids that have killed at least 370 civilians and sent tens of thousands fleeing. Finally, regime forces have been able to retake strategic hilltops near the coastal region. \nSuch strikes weaken the infrastructure and leadership that opposition forces rely on. \nEmile Hokayem, an analyst of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain, said: “The effect of Russia’s bombing campaign will be delayed. Rebel forces are not paying the price immediately on the front lines, but [will] later, as supply rooms, command posts and fallback positions are needed but destroyed.” \nAs it asserts itself militarily in the Middle East more than at any time since the cold war, the Kremlin is also keen to capitalise on perceived US inaction and to extend its own influence in the region. \nOn Friday, Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, announced that Moscow had agreed to co-ordinate its military actions on Syria with Jordan, a country that receives about $1bn in US aid each year. Jordan confirmed the military co-ordination, which it said was intended to secure its northern borders. \nIn Syria itself, the five-year-old civil war has become a convoluted struggle between the regime, the rebels seeking to end four decades of Assad family rule, and Isis , the militant Islamist group aiming to build a caliphate. \nRussia says it is intervening to stop Isis, which has now taken nearly half of Syria’s territory, though much of that is desert. But more than 80 per cent of the areas it has targeted are held by other rebels, according to a Reuters news agency analysis of Russian defence ministry data. The report bolsters arguments that Russia’s objective is to shore up Mr Assad after a string of blows from both the rebels and Isis that left his remaining territory increasingly vulnerable. \nMany observers say Russia has largely achieved those objectives and may have little interest in or capability to achieve further ground advances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:23:36.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
