NFL.com via YouTube If the average person had looked at Twitter during or after the Broncos' game against the Minnesota Vikings yesterday, he might have assumed the team was 0-4 instead of 4-0 — because the attacks on Peyton Manning were coming fast and furious.\nGranted, the 23-20 Denver win wasn't pretty. Manning threw two embarrassing interceptions and continued to look considerably less than invincible.\nYet Manning managed to engineer just enough drives to keep Denver on top, aided immeasurably by a defense that continues to blow minds — and blow up opposing quarterbacks such as the Vikes' Teddy Bridgewater.\nEven so, Twitter Nation let Peyton have it with both barrels, suggesting that his consistently incredible play over a long and storied career has spoiled fans — especially those who drafted him on their fantasy teams.\nCheck out the twenty most memorable hatin'-on-Peyton tweets we found, illustrated with photos from the game and topped by an appropriate last word.\nNFL.com via YouTube Number 20:\nPeyton Manning playing like he's 80 years old\nNumber 19:\npeyton manning you old rusty fuck you're getting benched with your big forehead ass\n— Zach Stepp (@Zaka757) October 4, 2015 Number 18:\nPeyton Manning is a trash fantasy QB, think I'm done with him this season.
