The mayor called the series’ return to L.A. \"a prime example\" of the tax credits’ success and said it was the first of 10 shows being filmed out of state that have applied for the tax breaks so they can return to Los Angeles. \nAccording to Garcetti, the program recaptured $1.07 billion in less than a year and helped restore local film and television production to its highest level in five years. American Horror Story alone has so far generated $55 million in directing spending and created 4,000 in new paychecks. \n\"This is an incredible lift for our economy,\" Garcetti said, \"and shows the program is working. We have the most talented workers, the most beautiful sets and the most creative people anywhere. We are grateful they’re here and their presence shows the tax credits work.\" \nAccording to the Film L.A. agency, third quarter production in greater Los Angeles also is up 3.8%, which amounts to a record 4,308 days of TV production in L.A. So far, the program has dispensed $330 million in tax credits. A total of 22 projects have received tax credits in the first two application periods, including Veep , Westworld , and Twin Peaks . \nState Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Leon , who took the lead in pushing the credits through the State Legislature, joined Garcetti for the announcement. \n\"These are major jobs,\" de Leon told THR . \"The goal was to bring jobs back to California, to bring people who were separated from their families back to California. So far it’s proven to be a success.\" \n\"The reviews are in and everyone is raving about the film and TV tax credit,\" he said. \"California, especially Southern California and Los Angeles were well known worldwide for its film and TV history. The sad reality was a lot of production was taking place elsewhere. We made a decision to put our foot down and to incentivize these jobs to come back home to California.\" \nAlso attending Friday’s events were 21st Century Fox chief executive James Murdoch , Los Angeles film czar Ken Ziffren , State Sen.
