A single, dusty field is all that separates Matheny Tract’s mostly African American and Latino residents from Tulare’s recently expanded wastewater-treatment plant. Though Tulare’s sewer system is more robust than ever, Matheny Tract residents must use septic tanks, since they are not part of the city. For a dense settlement, this spells trouble.\nRelated Story The Economics of California's Drought\n“People can’t always afford to pump out their tanks, so sometimes they overflow,” says Vance McKinney, a 59-year-old truck driver and community leader. “I’ve watched children jump over ponds of sewage to get to school in the morning.”\nThe leaching tanks are likely responsible for the fecal bacteria that’s been found in the shallow community wells from which Matheny Tract gets its water. Nitrates, probably from fertilizer runoff from surrounding farms, have also been an issue. Right now, the biggest problem is naturally occurring arsenic, exacerbated by an ever-shrinking volume of groundwater —partly a result of excessive pumping by farmers in the midst of California’s record-breaking drought.", "external_links": ["http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4693"], "published": "2015-10-10T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:28:24.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
