(AP) — Authorities are investigating after they say a preschool and child care facility left a 5-year-old boy alone on a bus for five hours.\nOrange County Sheriff's officials said someone was walking through the parking lot at 1 p.m. Friday when they spotted the boy and called 911. Authorities said he had been in the bus since about 8 a.m. Sheriff's spokesman Jane Watrel told the Orlando Sentinel (http://tinyurl.com/osseqgy) that the bus driver and two employees at Winner's Preschool and Child Care on North Powers Drive could face neglect charges.\nThe facility declined comment.\nThe National Weather Service reported temperatures climbed to 86 degrees during that time with a heat index of 94 degrees.\nThe boy was returned to his parents in good condition.\n———\nInformation from: Orlando Sentinel, http://www.orlandosentinel.com/\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://tinyurl.com/osseqgy)", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/"], "published": "2015-10-10T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:02:16.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
