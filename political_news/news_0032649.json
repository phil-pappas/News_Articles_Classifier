Related College shooting raises awareness in... \nSome of the presidential candidates are talking about guns, but maybe not the way Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake wants them to. As president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, she's hoping for a different dialogue. \nHosting more than 30 mayors from New York City to Plano, Texas, this weekend, Rawlings-Blake said the group should call for the presidential candidates to support what she calls common sense gun legislation. \n\"One of the things we are talking about is when someone applies to get a gun and is rejected that that information is shared with the city, the state and the federal governments,\" Rawlings-Blake said. \nIn Iowa on Friday, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said the gun debate needs to include more analytics of the person who commits the crime. \n\"That's the way to handle it. You're not going to handle it with more gun control, because gun control only works for normal, law-abiding citizens. It doesn't work for crazies,\" Carson said. \nWhile speaking Friday about the community college shooting in Oregon, President Barack Obama was visibly frustrated and seemed pessimistic about Congress passing tougher gun laws during his time in office. \n\"So the main thing I'm going to do is talk about it and hope that over time that we'll finally see some action,\" Obama said. \n\"There has to be something that we can do with our federal partners to cut down on that pipeline of illegal guns in our city,\" Rawlings-Blake said. \nAnother hot topic the mayors hope gets more attention by national politicians is infrastructure and crumbling roads and bridges.
