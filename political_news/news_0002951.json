(AP Photo/Nati Harnik)\nAssociated Press Oct. 26, 2015 | 3:07 p.m. EDT + More By ANDREW SELIGMAN, AP Sports Writer\nCHICAGO (AP) â€” The Chicago Bulls will open a new era under coach Fred Hoiberg with Derrick Rose in the lineup.\nThe former MVP point guard is set to start without any minute restrictions when the Bulls meet LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in Tuesday's opener.\nHoiberg says the Bulls will still be careful with Rose's playing time given that he missed most of the preseason with an injury he suffered on the first day of practice.\nRose had surgery to repair a broken left orbital and missed the first seven preseason games. But he also showed that familiar explosiveness in his lone exhibition against Dallas on Friday.\nRose, who has been wearing a protective mask, still has some blurred vision and swelling beneath his left eye.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
