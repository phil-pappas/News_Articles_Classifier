mostly fleeing war in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - travelling via Turkey, Greece and through the western Balkans, hoping to seek safe haven in Germany and other EU states.\nA new surge entered Macedonia from Greece at the weekend, with 10,000 crossing in just 24 hours, police said.\nBut tensions have built further along the migrant trail after Hungary shut its borders with razor wire, diverting the flow west to Slovenia, which in turn also limited arrivals.\nOn Monday, Slovenia refused to let in more than 1000 migrants arriving from Croatia, saying a daily quota had been reached.\nThe move stoked fears of a new human bottleneck, as a train carrying 1800 people arrived overnight on the Croatian side of the border, but only 500 of the \"most vulnerable\", mostly women and children, were allowed to cross, police said.\nLong lines also formed on the Serbia-Croatia border, where hundreds spent the night in rain and freezing temperatures.\nThe goal for many of the migrants has been the EU's biggest economy, Germany, which expects to take in around one million refugees this year, and where Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy has sparked a dangerous backlash.\nTwo days after a man with a neo-Nazi background stabbed a pro-refugee politician in the neck, badly wounding her, Germany's anti-refugee PEGIDA movement was planning a mass rally to mark its first anniversary.\nPolice expect thousands to join the march of the \"Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the Occident\" in Dresden in the former communist East, as well as a large antifascist counter-protests.\nThe movement had all but vanished after pictures surfaced in January showing its co-founder Lutz Bachmann sporting a Hitler moustache, but it has made a comeback since September, when Merkel opened the doors to a surge of asylum seekers.\nAnti-foreigner sentiment motivated a bloody attack in the western city of Cologne on Saturday when a man used a hunting knife to stab independent mayoral candidate Henriette Reker, 58, who is active in helping refugees.\nReker, who was seriously wounded in the neck, went on to win Sunday's election with an absolute majority.\nThe migrant influx has boosted support for populist right-wing parties in other European countries, including Austria.\nA Swiss populist party known for its virulent campaigns against immigration, the EU and Islam won a record number of seats in parliamentary elections on Sunday.\nIn Germany, Merkel has faced a dip in opinion polls and a rebellion in her own conservative ranks, especially in the southern state of Bavaria, the main gateway for migrants.\nMerkel, hoping for Turkey's help in slowing the migrant influx, held talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul.\nThe EU wants Turkey to tighten border security and house more refugees in return for billions in financial help, visa liberalisation for Turkish citizens and an acceleration of its stuttering drive for EU membership.\nBut Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu on Monday said his country would not host migrants permanently to appease the European Union.\n\"We cannot accept an understanding like 'give us the money and they stay in Turkey',\" he said in a television interview. \"Turkey is not a concentration camp.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:35:44.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
