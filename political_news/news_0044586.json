(AP) - A member of Wisconsin’s embattled nonpartisan elections board said Tuesday it is “mind-boggling” that Republicans who control the Legislature are moving so quickly to pass a rewrite of the state’s complex campaign finance laws. \nThat bill, along with another measure that would dissolve the nonpartisan Government Accountability Board that oversees elections, campaign finance, ethics and lobbying laws, are slated for approval Wednesday in the Assembly. \nThe board discussed both proposals at its meeting Tuesday. \n“It’s mind-boggling to me that we were rushed to get a new complicated law in place without careful deliberation about whether this law is going to present difficult enforcement problems,” board member John Franke said of the campaign finance measure. \nThe bill is a response to a series of court rulings striking down major portions of Wisconsin’s campaign finance law, including a July state Supreme Court decision that ended the investigation into Gov. Scott Walker and conservative groups. \nWalker, speaking in Neenah, said lawmakers were merely debating whether to codify “what the courts have already said the law is, according to the First Amendment.” He wouldn’t say whether he agreed with the decisions. \n“I believe in the First Amendment,” he said. “And if that’s the way the courts interpret the First Amendment, then we have to abide by that.” \nIn accordance with the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling, the bill would change state law to say that candidates can coordinate with issue advocacy groups that don’t directly call for the election or defeat of a particular candidate. It would also allow unlimited donations to political parties and legislative committees, while doubling how much can be given to individual candidates. \nDoubling the individual limits from $10,000 to $20,000 is a good idea, said Jonathan Becker, director of the board’s division that handles those issues. Those moves will increase the powers of the political parties, he said, recognizing the changed campaign finance landscape caused by recent court rulings. \n“It’s not a bad bill,” Becker said. \nDemocrats and other opponents have said the measure will open the door to more unregulated money coming into elections, particularly through issue advocacy groups that don’t have to disclose their donors and who can coordinate their message and work with candidates. \nDemocrats don’t have enough votes to stop the campaign finance bill or the measure dissolving the GAB. That proposal would replace the board comprised of nonpartisan judges with a pair of commissions to oversee ethics and elections with partisan appointees. \nWalker said, “having a bipartisan panel, with an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, that includes clerks from the local level - that actually run elections - is the best way to have an oversight panel.” \nRepublican backers of moving back to partisan boards say it will create a more transparent process, while Democratic opponents say it will only lead to gridlock and the opportunity for more political corruption. \n“Power never likes to be checked, and that’s what we’re seeing now,” said Dane County clerk Scott McDonell, who spoke in support of the board at its meeting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:49:43.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
