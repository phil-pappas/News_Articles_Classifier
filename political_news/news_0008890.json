A flurry of new TV ads popped up on Tuesday in the run-up to the first of six debates featuring Clinton and her Democratic rivals. One of them is an effort to bolster support for Vice President Biden, who won’t be on stage but is reportedly still considering a run.\nDraft Biden, the super PAC urging the veep to challenge Clinton, released that spot , titled “Never Quit,” which is part of a $250,000 national cable ad buy. The spot features the vice president's own words from a speech about the resilience of America.\nIt replaces another more emotional ad the group cut last week that featured the story of Biden's personal experience following the death of his first wife, Neilia, and 1-year-old daughter Naomi in a 1972 car crash. It was pulled at Biden’s request.\nThe new ad ends with two words appearing on the screen, pleading to an audience of one: “Joe, Run.”\nClinton’s super PAC, meanwhile, is positioning her in contrast not to Biden but to a host of Republican presidential candidates. An ad released by Priorities USA Tuesday, features clips of Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson that are selected to upset pro-choice voters—including Bush’s botched statement that “women’s health issues” are overfunded, which he quickly attempted to correct.\nThe ad itself is a play to bolster Clinton’s support with women and millennials.\nBiden to be a no-show By Sarah Wheaton\nThe clips are shown on a smart phone; one by one, as they play, a person’s finger swipes the screen to the left, a signal familiar to millennials and social media aficionados connoting disinterest. When Clinton appears and declares herself “a proud, lifelong fighter for women’s issues,” the finger swipes right, an indication of approval.\nIn stark contrast to that spot, the Stop Hillary PAC is up with an ad focused on Clinton’s handling of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. The inflammatory 30-second spot features male voiceovers purporting to be the voices of the four Americans killed in the attack, whose faces appear on screen one by one.\n“Dear Hillary Clinton,” the first voice begins. “I’d like to ask you why you ignored calls for help in Benghazi and then four Americans were murdered.”\nAfter three voices pose the questions they’d like to ask, the final face shown is that of now-deceased Ambassador Christopher Stevens. “But, Mrs. Clinton, I can’t,” the voiceover says as the image of Stevens dissolves into a picture of his grave. “What difference does it make?”\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8iEiBRmpK0", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RUNxejHftA", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCEtJowiJa4", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7e6mzH0Y4G8"], "published": "2015-10-13T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:57:41.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
