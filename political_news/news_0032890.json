That number expands on Jan. 1 to 100. \nUnder the law, companies considered small businesses must offer certain required benefits. Business groups complained that that would increase many employers' health care costs. \nThe bill approved Thursday would keep the small business definition at 50 workers but let states increase the number if they choose. \nThe Senate sent the bill to Obama for his expected signature by a voice vote. It was sponsored by Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina.
