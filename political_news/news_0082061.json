House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California pauses during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Oct. 8, 2015 | 12:43 p.m. EDT + More After seeing support for his speaker bid crumble, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made a surprise announcement Thursday that he was withdrawing from consideration.\nMcCarthy shocked his fellow lawmakers when he stood up at the GOP caucus election meeting, announcing his decision instead of making a campaign speech.\nDuring brief remarks Thursday afternoon, he said the best thing for the party was to be \"100 percent united\" and that he wanted to avoid a contentious floor fight.\nRELATED\nSpeaker Race Turning into Headache for GOP \"If we are going to unite and be strong, we need a new face to help do that,\" he said, adding that he would remain on the job as majority leader.\nRep. Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania said McCarthy carried a similar message into the caucus meeting, telling Republicans he had decided he was not the right person to unify the party at this time. Resigning Speaker John Boehner of Ohio then said the election was postponed and abruptly ended the meeting.\nMcCarthy found himself under fire in recent days for comments linking the ongoing Benghazi probe to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's falling poll numbers. The conservative Freedom Caucus aligned behind Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida on Wednesday, potentially complicating McCarthy's path.\nRep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah on Sunday announced a bid to challenge McCarthy amid GOP criticism of the gaffe. Chaffetz on Thursday said he would continue to campaign for the speaker's job.\n\"I really do believe it's time for a fresh start,\" he said. \" Our conference is going to have to do a lot of soul searching.\"\nThe majority leader's withdrawal from the race set off a frenzy of speculation among lawmakers over who could assemble the coalition necessary to collect the 218 votes to be elected speaker in the full House.\nRep. Darrell Issa of California openly questioned whether Chaffetz or Webster has the support to win the job.\n\"I don't believe there is any candidate today that has declared that could get to 218,\" he said.\nRep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who would have broad support in a bid for speaker, has repeatedly declared he has no intention of running and reiterated that sentiment minutes after McCarthy's announcement.\n\"Kevin McCarthy is best person to lead the House, and so I'm disappointed in this decision,\" he said.\nTAGS: Republican Party Congress McCarthy, Kevin politics", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0hde%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0hde%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=McCarthy%20Drops%20Out%20of%20Speaker%20Race&summary=The%20unexpected%20development%20threw%20the%20contest%20to%20replace%20John%20Boehner%20as%20House%20speaker%20into%20disarray.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0hde%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0hde%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=McCarthy%20Drops%20Out%20of%20Speaker%20Race", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0hde%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=McCarthy%20Drops%20Out%20of%20Speaker%20Race", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0hde%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:48:16.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
