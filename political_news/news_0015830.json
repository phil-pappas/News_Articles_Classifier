But Mr Munya said this was dictatorship. Prof Kindiki said Mr Munya, the chairman of the Council of Governors, would be a lone ranger as all leaders in the region would join Jubilee. Advertisement More by this Author \nMeru Senator Kiraitu Murungi, Tharaka-Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki and Meru Peter Munya Friday clashed over the formation of the Jubilee Alliance Party. \nMr Murungi and Prof Kindiki support the party, saying all Jubilee Alliance affiliates should wind up in readiness for the 2017 elections. But Mr Munya said this was dictatorship. \nThe governor said this would be unfair for aspirants denied tickets during nominations. \n“We cannot have one party like a club. It is the people who vote and they should be allowed to choose whoever they want,” said Mr Munya. \nProf Kindiki, the Senate Majority Leader, belittled Mr Munya’s plans to form his own party following a declaration by Mr Murungi that Alliance Party of Kenya would be dissolved. \nHe said: “My brother, how can you form a party with only one or two people?” \nThe leaders spoke at Githongo Boys School in Meru during the funeral of the region’s first post-independence Senator Julius Muthamia. \n“If President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto have resolved to wind up their parties, who am I to stick with mine? said Mr Murungi. \nProf Kindiki said Mr Munya, the chairman of the Council of Governors, would be a lone ranger as all leaders in the region would join Jubilee. \nProf Kindiki, who represented President Kenyatta at the service, travelled in the same chopper with Mr Murungi. \nMr Muthamia was eulogised as a hero, development conscious, industrious, peacemaker and unifying factor. \nAt the same time, Mr Munya will today (Saturday) hold a delegates’ meeting for the Alliance Party of Kenya at Meru Sports Club to deliberate on formation of a new party. \nMr Murungi has warned delegates not to attend. \nMr Munya, who is APK’s director of elections is engaged in major tussle with party leader Mr Murungi over its control. \nThe former close allies’ relationship has further been soured by the push by some elected MPs from Meru for Mr Murungi to run for the gubernatorial seat. \nMr Murungi is said to have played a key role in ensuring Mr Munya won the seat. The latter’s supporters have trashed the claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:03:55.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
