Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Monday it was a mistake. He said that the Afghan vehicle carrying U.S. personnel drove through the closed gate last Thursday to gain access to the compound run by an international charity called Doctors Without Borders.\nDavis said they believed incorrectly that none of the charity's personnel were present. He said the visit was to assess the \"structural integrity\" of the building damaged in the Oct. 3 attack.\nDavis said the U.S. is working with the charity group to repair damage to the gate.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
