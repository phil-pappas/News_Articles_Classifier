Both concluded patrolman Timothy Loehmann had reason to perceive Tamir Rice as a threat before shooting him last November.\nRetired FBI agent Kimberly A. Crawford concluded that Loehmann had reason to perceive the boy as a serious threat when he shot him two seconds after his cruiser pulled up.\nThe prosecutor's office says a grand jury will ultimately decide if Loehmann should face criminal charges, but hasn't said when.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe300n%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=2%20reports%20say%20officer%27s%20shooting%20of%20Ohio%20boy%20justified", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe300n%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=2%20reports%20say%20officer%27s%20shooting%20of%20Ohio%20boy%20justified&summary=&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe300n%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=2%20reports%20say%20officer%27s%20shooting%20of%20Ohio%20boy%20justified", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe300n%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe300n%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe300n%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:11:41.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
