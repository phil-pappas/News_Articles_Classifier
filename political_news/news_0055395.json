Promoted stories \nThere would be an additional nursery ski slope costing £100,000, a new Alpine Lodge with a foyer and kit area costing £500,000, improvement work to pitches costing £350,000 to £500,000 and a new 18-hole crazy golf course costing up to £325,000. \nThere are options for a pavilion, with one option to include a four court badminton sports hall or two Futsall courts, with costs ranging from £3.3m up to £15.7m. \nThe existing trim trail would be relocated and adding interpretation boards of the site history and nature to current trails along with route signage costing £500,000. \nThere are a number of options to expand or create new car parking which would cost between £50,000 and £1.3m. \nPossible sources for investment highlighted in council documents include facility operator Places for People, capital funding from outside bodies such as the Football Association, British Cycling, the Saints Foundation, Solent University and Sport England. \nThe council states that the FA has indicated it was keen to work with Southampton on the provision of a 3G pitch or pitches and see Southampton as a priority. \nIt says the Saints Foundation is keen to establish an education centre with possible plans including indoor Futsall courts and classrooms while Sport England has indicated facility improvements at the sports centre is a priority in the city. \nDetailed plans and a strategy for how to fund such work will be developed in the next year. \nThis comes after the chairman of Southampton Athletics Club Richie Pearson criticised the facilities to the Echo back in July, describing them as \"appalling” and \"a disgrace\" and that he believed they were putting off the stars of the future. \nIn his opinion the cold and ageing buildings made the sports provision in the city the worst in the UK. \nThe facility, which opened in 1938, has trained the likes of athletics stars Kriss Akabusi, Todd Bennett, Iwan Thomas and Roger Black. \nThe council document acknowledges that \"many of the buildings, features and infrastructure at Southampton Sports Centre are original; heavy usage, time and lack of investment has taken its toll\". \nIt adds: \"Developments in a number of areas are beyond their expected lifespan and are no longer fit for purpose.\" \nIt highlighted facilities considered to be in a poor or outdated state, which included the changing and toilet areas, storage and extra facilities at the athletics track, the hard court surfaces, the alpine lodge, the boating lake and the insufficient car parking. \nCllr Satvir Kaur, Southampton City Council ’s cabinet member for Communities and Leisure, said, although much-loved, the centre was \"showing signs of age and it’s crucial that we establish and agree a vision for its future to enable us to attract the funding we need to make it fit for the 21st Century\". \nShe said the consultation was about prioritising what people in the city wanted to see and that not all the ideas put forward could be achieved due to practical reasons where some projects used the same sites. \nCllr Kaur added that she approved the possible indoor facilities and that this was about widening participation in sport rather than increasing income. Share article \nShe was unable to say whether or how much the council would be able to put any funding towards the improvements, but said she was \"hopeful\" that outside funding would be found \"The priority will be obviously getting external funding,\" she added. \n\"In order to see the improvement we would need external funding and to work in partnership.\" Promoted Stories Southampton Outdoor Sports Centre could be set for a £27.4m revamp Sorry, an error occurred.
