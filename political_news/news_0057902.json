In its inaugural edition of 2015 Report Card for New York’s Infrastructure, the organization graded the state on several key infrastructure items including aviation, bridges, drinking water, roads and transit, among other things. The state earned an overall grade of C-. The state’s 17,456 bridges received a grade of D+. More than 2,000 bridges statewide are considered structurally deficient. More than 50 percent of New York’s bridges are 75 years old, and more than 400 are 100 years old, the report states. New York’s roads earned a grade of D-. One-third of New York’s major highways are considered to be in poor or fair condition. The report notes that miles driven by New York’s residents are on the rise, “creating crippling congestion and climbing operating costs.”“This report card is the latest example of why New York State must commit the significant resources required to meet our infrastructure needs,” said Mike Elmendorf, president and CEO of the Associated General Contractors of New York State, in a statement. “As these needs have outpaced investment for decades, our failing infrastructure threatens our communities and economic opportunity.” New York’s highest grade was a B-, in the categories of parks and solid waste. The report noted that New York is home to the first state park in the nation, Niagara Falls State Park, and the largest public park in the U.S., Adirondack Park. New York has 179 other state parks, 35 state historical sites and nearly 335,000 acres of land. A team of professional engineers from across the state assessed the nine categories of infrastructure to reach the cumulative grade. Other grades included a C in aviation, a C- in dams, a C in water, a C- in transit and a D in wastewater. The report includes recommendations for improving New York’s grade, including the creation of a prioritization program to assess the state’s transportation infrastructure needs starting with existing bridge management, developing more consistent funding sources for dams and making rebuilt infrastructure more resilient and sustainable.“With grades like these, it’s no wonder why New York struggles to remain competitive and continues to lead the nation in outmigration,” Elmendorf said in the statement. “New York can’t be open for business if its roads and bridges are closed. We must do better.”   What You're Saying  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:56:44.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
