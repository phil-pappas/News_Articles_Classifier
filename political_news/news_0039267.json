More Carson steals Trump show with true tale \nMrs Clinton said she would seek to work with Congress to change laws but added that she would pursue regulations through executive action if legislative efforts stalled, as is likely to be the case in the Republican-controlled Congress. \n“I am determined to do something about it, and I will try in every way I can to get those guns out of the hands of people who should not have them,” she told a town-hall meeting in New Hampshire on Monday. \nGun control has become a more prominent theme in Mrs Clinton’s campaign since June’s mass shooting in Charleston , South Carolina, which left nine people dead. \nAmong the proposals she laid out on Monday was an effort to close the so-called “Charleston loophole” that allows gun sales to proceed without a background check if the check is not completed in three days — a policy that enabled the shooter in Charleston to buy a gun despite having a federal criminal record. \nShe also called for tightening background checks for sales at gun shows and over the internet. If Congress “refuses to act”, Mrs Clinton said she would use executive authority to deem any person selling “a significant number of guns” to be “in the business” of selling firearms — meaning they would have to follow the same regulations as retailers, including conducting background checks. \nUS mass shootings prompt surge in weapons sales \nFears that killings could prompt tighter arms laws lead to higher demand for weapons \nRead more \nMost Republicans and some Democrats in Congress, as well as the Republican party’s contenders for the presidential nomination, strongly oppose tighter restrictions on guns. \nThat opposition has stymied President Barack Obama’s attempts to change laws since the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut, and it is unclear that Mrs Clinton’s plan would fare any better. \nMrs Clinton’s proposals also put her in the unusual position of being more liberal on an issue than Bernie Sanders , the Vermont senator and self-declared socialist who is challenging her for the Democratic nomination. \nMr Sanders supported a 2005 law that prevents victims of gun violence from suing firearm manufacturers — a bill that Mrs Clinton voted against when she was a senator and which she said on Monday she would “lead the charge” to repeal. \nMr Sanders also voted against the 1993 Brady Bill, which established mandatory background checks for gun sales. But the senator, who represents a state where hunting and gun ownership are common, supported Mr Obama’s unsuccessful efforts to expand background checks, ban certain assault weapons and limit the size of ammunition magazines. \nLast week he told MSNBC he supported banning assault weapons and closing the loophole that exempts gun show sales from background checks.
