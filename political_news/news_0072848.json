Defense Minister Chang exchanged views with his Mongolian counterpart, Ts.Tsolmon, on cooperation between the Chinese and Mongolian militaries and regional and international issues of common concern on October 8. According to a China Military Online report, the Chinese military is willing to work with Mongolia to implement the consensus reached by the leaders of both countries, Chang said during his talks with Ts.Tsolmon. He said that China hopes to continue high-level military contacts; strengthen strategic communication and coordination; promote pragmatic cooperation in the fields of personnel training, joint military exercises, international peacekeeping and military technology; and enhance mutual trust and friendship. In turn, Defense Minister Ts.Tsolmon said that China is an important neighboring country to Mongolia and Mongolia puts much emphasis on Sino-Mongolian relations and adheres to the one-China principle. Mongolia supports China’s efforts in safeguarding regional peace and stability, he added. On the next day, the visiting Chinese military delegation headed by Chang Wanquan called on Mongolian President Ts.Elbegdorj and Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg. President Ts.Elbegdorj first congratulated China on the successful commemoration activities for the 70th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression and the victory of World War II. Mentioning that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have met four times in recent years and reached a series of important consensuses on deepening bilateral relations and enhancing pragmatic cooperation in multiple fields, Ts.Elbegdorj expressed his hope that the defense departments and militaries of the two countries will intensify communication and cooperation and keep strengthening their mutual trust, so as to advance the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. Prime Minister Ch.Saikhanbileg said that Mongolia attaches great importance to friendly cooperation with China and makes China a priority in its foreign policies. He vowed that Mongolia is willing to strengthen exchange and cooperation with China in the political, economic, trade, cultural, and other areas. In turn, Chang Wanquan noted that as friendly neighbors, China and Mongolia have deepened their bilateral and mil-to-mil relationship in recent years. In August last year, President Xi Jinping and President Ts.Elbegdorj announced the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, pointing out the direction for the development of China-Mongolia relations in the new historical period. China appreciates Mongolia’s stance of upholding the “one China” principle and stands ready to work with Mongolia to boost multi-level exchange and cooperation in all fields, including defense and security, making positive efforts to enrich the connotations of the China-Mongolia comprehensive strategic partnership, and safeguard regional peace and stability, the Chinese Defense Minister added. \nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16493   11  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:09:10.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
