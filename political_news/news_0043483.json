That is a basic moral principle. \n\"Anne Tolley has said today the Government couldn’t change the rules for people with cancer in case other groups started wanting ‘special consideration’ as well. \n\"John Key should be overruling her. She has clearly lost the plot on this issue. \n\"He should show some moral leadership and compassion. These people deserve the space and time to focus on getting well, not added stress. The Prime Minister should be standing up for people in tough times, not making things worse,\" says Andrew Little. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
