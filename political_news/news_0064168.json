Using nothing but what was immediately available, Dr. Khurshid Guru, director of robotic surgery at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, neutralized a situation that was potentially life-threatening for the 2-year-old – a situation that may not have been necessary if the child's family had packed the right medication in their carry-on luggage.\nWhat if it was you? Is there always a doctor on board? You shouldn’t assume there will be, says Dr. William Brady, a professor of emergency medicine and internal medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville.\n“Before you get on a plane, you need to ask yourself the question: Is it appropriate for me to get on this plane based on my current health situation?” says Brady, co-author of a New England Journal of Medicine article highlighting how doctors can respond to the most common in-flight medical emergencies during commercial air travel.\nCheck out how often medical emergencies occur, the most common symptoms and what professionals have at their disposal during travel. That’s why it’s important to plan as much as possible. If you know you have a chronic illness , keep all your medications in your carry-on luggage, Brady says. If you’ve just had surgery and it’s only been a few days, it’s not appropriate to get on an aircraft for a six-hour flight, he adds. If you have lung or heart disease, ask your doctor if you’ll need oxygen on the plane.\n“Pay attention to your doctor’s advice and do what your doctor says, because [he or she is] making a recommendation in your best interest,” Brady says.\nStill, despite the best of preparations, some medical emergencies come without warning.\nA 2013 study, also published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that there were 11,920 in-flight medical emergencies – or one emergency per 604 flights – resulting in calls to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s 24-hour, physician-directed medical communications center from January 2008 through October 2010.\nDr. Christian Martin-Gill, co-author of the study and a physician at UPMC, says the medical center is one of two primary sites that provide 9,000 airline medical consultations for in-flight medical emergencies every year – such as fainting, stroke and food allergy incidents. The most common medical emergencies reported in the study included 37.4 percent cases of syncope or presyncope, also known as fainting or lightheadedness; 12.1 percent cases of respiratory symptoms; and 9.5 percent cases of nausea and vomiting.​\nFainting\nDaniella Knell, 47, of Boise, Idaho, who's​ been a Delta Air Lines flight attendant for nearly 25 years, says she’s seen her fair share of passengers who faint. “Quite often, I fly coast-to-coast flights, from New York to Los Angeles, or Seattle to Amsterdam. People have been up all day, they’re not eating right, they’re on the road and they’re exhausted,” Knell says, adding that the sudden movement often causes people to faint.\nMartin-Gill advises alerting a flight attendant if you notice another passenger has fainted or is complaining about feeling lightheaded or dizzy. In this situation, the flight attendant might tell the person at risk for a medical issue ​to breathe slowly and deeply, or ask the person to step out into the aisle or raise his or her legs.​\n“If you’re awake and alert and able to do so, they’ll probably have you drink some liquids,\" Martin-Gill says. \"It turns out for these common situations, just those simple interventions of laying down​ [in the galley], giving yourself some time and trying to rehydrate yourself actually leads the vast majority back to normal.”\nHe says the simplest way to avoid dehydration ​​is to drink plenty of water before boarding an airplane.", "external_links": ["http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1212052", "http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1409213"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:43:15.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
