But we always have to ask ourselves: What would we want to wear? Throughout Milan and Paris fashion weeks, the Cut brings you editors' picks, rounding up items from the runways we'd actually buy.\n1. The finale looks at Chanel are just crying out to be photographed: shimmering silver beadwork against graphic black.\n2. One of my favorite dresses of the spring collections was actually one of the simplest dresses at the Valentino show: a deep-V gown in hunter green (a color so dark that it almost appeared black on the runway) with a detachable train that flowed behind. In a show that featured so much impeccable beadwork, leather techniques, and feathers, it quietly stood out.\n3. The footwear at Louis Vuitton warranted a moment of admiration: flat Beatle boots, chunky platform sandals decked with chains, and these great pointed python booties .\n4. We saw a lot of sheer layers in Paris. Miu Miu in particular had great embellished dresses worn underneath neat little jackets — a great look now, and just as cool once the weather improves and you can pull away pieces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:18:24.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
