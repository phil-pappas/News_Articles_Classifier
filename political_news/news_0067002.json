(AP) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is calling on super political action committees supporting his candidacy to return all the money they've collected. He's also calling on his opponents to demand the same.\nTrump's campaign said Friday that it sent legal notices disavowing what it describes as nine \"unauthorized\" super PACs supporting his bid.\nThe campaign says the groups are not authorized to use Trump's name and likeness in their fundraising efforts.\nSuper PACs can raise unlimited contributions, but they must disclose their donors and are barred from coordinating with campaigns.\nThe billionaire businessman has repeatedly boasted about turning down big-dollar contributions and said he is self-funding his campaign.\nBut financial disclosures released this month show the majority of Trump's expenses in recent months have been covered by contributions.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:49:51.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
