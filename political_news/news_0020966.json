Sport Clips in local communities across the country will share the overall goal of raising $750,000 for the company's annual fundraising program, Help A Hero, that provides scholarships to active-duty military and veterans. Sport Clips has partnered with the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) since 2007, creating the VFW's \" Sport Clips Help A Hero Scholarship\" program in 2013 to help service members and veterans in the next chapter of their lives. Each scholarship provides up to $5,000 of assistance to qualified individuals who have served in the military, are in need of financial assistance, and are pursuing an education at post-secondary institutions, including trade schools.\nDonations to Help A Hero will be collected by Sport Clips stylists and other team members in-store and at local fundraising events. Sport Clips will also hold \"The Biggest Haircut Day of the Year\" on Veterans Day , when each store will donate a dollar from every haircut service to the VFW-administered scholarship program.\n\"Sport Clips and the VFW have awarded almost $1.2 million in Help A Hero scholarships to our nation's heroes who are going to school to further their civilian careers,\" says Sport Clips founder and CEO Gordon Logan , who is a U.S. Air Force veteran and lifetime member of the VFW. \"Their time in the service was a sacrifice we can never really repay, but our gratitude and support through these scholarships is one way we can say 'thank you.' We appreciate the Sport Clips team members across the country who work hard every year to honor our military. And, we are grateful to our clients who make donations during their haircut service.\"\nU.S. Army Soldier Synovia Fairell says of her Sport Clips Help A Hero Scholarship, \"As I transition into the civilian world, it is greatly appreciated to know that my sacrifices for the betterment of our country have not gone unrecognized. Being selected to receive this scholarship has encouraged me to diligently strive to complete my goals. Thanks to Sport Clips Haircuts and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, my load has just become a bit lighter.\"\n\"America's service members are sacrificing time apart from their loved ones, only to be faced with a tough job market and the harsh reality of unemployment when they return home,\" said VFW National Commander John A. Biedrzycki Jr. , a former educator and University of Pittsburgh graduate. \"The Help A Hero Scholarship is essential to helping the VFW ensure returning servicemen and women have the necessary tools available to successfully transition to civilian life, ultimately achieving their educational and career goals.\"\nSport Clips is the official haircutter of the VFW, and its Help A Hero program is just one of the many ways it supports active-duty military and veterans.
