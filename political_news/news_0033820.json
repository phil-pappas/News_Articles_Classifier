ADVERTISEMENT Gecker, Sturtevant trade barbs in pivotal Senate race By MICHAEL MARTZ Richmond Times-Dispatch Richmond Times-Dispatch \nA new political ad superimposes the head of Democratic state Senate candidate Daniel A. Gecker on a bicyclist and faults him for “his race to raise taxes” on Chesterfield County residents as a member of the Board of Supervisors. \nA campaign mailer says Republican state Senate candidate Glen H. Sturtevant, as a member of the Richmond School Board, voted against a budget that reduced class sizes and spoke in favor of vouchers to send students to private schools. \nEach candidate says the other’s ad is misleading, but the tone is growing harsh in the political battle to fill the 10th District seat of retiring Sen. John Watkins, R-Powhatan, about a month before an election that could determine whether Republicans or Democrats control the Virginia Senate. \nAll 140 legislative seats are on the ballot Nov. 3, but the focus is on the fight for control of the Senate, in which Republicans hold a 21-19 edge. \nThe intensifying partisanship of the 10th District campaign proves a point, says Marleen K. Durfee, an independent candidate who, along with Libertarian Carl R. Loser, is struggling to be heard in her campaign for the seat. \n“I don’t see it as a Democratic seat or a Republican seat,” said Durfee, 56, who represented the Matoaca District for one term on the Chesterfield board. “I see it as the people’s seat.” \nBut make no mistake — the 10th District race is shaping up as the Gettysburg of the Senate elections, with more than $1.1 million already raised, almost all of it by the Democratic and Republican candidates. \n“The 10th District, that’s sort of the head of the spear in this election,” said Craig DiSesa, director of Middle Resolution, a conservative political action committee that has put $82,000 into Sturtevant’s campaign, more than any other legislative election, in its effort to secure Republican control of the Senate. \nIn the past month, the Republican State Leadership Committee has poured $180,000 into the campaign of Sturtevant, a 33-year-old lawyer who says he is the only Republican on the Richmond School Board, whose members do not run on party labels. \nHe has cast himself as a moderate Republican in Watkins’ mold, but he also has adopted the positions of Middle Resolution in opposition to Medicaid expansion and in favor of education savings accounts that would give state education money to the parents of children with disabilities that they could use for private school tuition. \n“There is a groundswell of support from people of all different political backgrounds,” said Sturtevant, who also cited his recent endorsements by Watkins and former Del. Alex B. McMurtrie Jr., who finished third in a three-way Democratic primary Gecker won in June. \n*** \nGecker, 58 , maintains a sizable lead in fundraising. He has amassed $679,427, compared with $420,250 for Sturtevant, $7,068 for Durfee and $4,648 for Loser. He shrugs off Sturtevant’s endorsements by Watkins, a Republican, and McMurtrie, a Democrat who has supported Republican candidates at the state and national levels. Instead, Gecker emphasizes his endorsement by the Virginia Education Association, since education is a key issue in the race. \nA developer who has made a specialty of redeveloping historic properties in Richmond, Gecker and associated companies have contributed much of the money he has raised. He said most of those big donations and loans were made during the Democratic primary, in which he held off a spirited challenge by environmental advocate Emily Francis, who is now campaigning for him. \nGecker, Sturtevant and Durfee focused on economic growth, jobs and education in a forum Thursday sponsored by the Midlothian Business Alliance. Loser, 24, a paralegal from Powhatan County, did not attend the forum, but he has staked out provocative positions, such as decriminalizing marijuana possession, and has called for cutting government programs. \nThe district is expected to go Democratic in Richmond, Republican in Powhatan and be up for grabs in Chesterfield, where Gecker is completing his second term as an independent on the Board of Supervisors after two terms on the county’s Planning Commission. \nBut anything can happen in a nonpresidential election year, he said. “The key to these off-year elections is you have to maximize turnout.” \nAnd that is why Gecker and Sturtevant have begun to go after each other in television ads and mailers, said Robert D. Holsworth, a longtime political analyst who will moderate a 10th District forum sponsored by the Greater Richmond Chamber on Oct. 13. \n“These are ads that are looking to mobilize core supporters,” Holsworth said. \n“How do you do it?” he asked. “You basically demonize the other.” \nHolsworth suggested that Sturtevant, who lives in Richmond’s West End, also is trying to reach out to Chesterfield voters on their taxes, which the board increased last year by a penny per $100 on the real estate rate, along with other fees, including doubling one for vehicle registration to raise money for roads. \nThe ad says Gecker voted for all the increases, including the vehicle registration fee, but the meeting minutes show he was one of two supervisors to vote against the fee increase on an item-by-item basis. In the end, Gecker supported the final budget that included the higher registration fees. \n“Then he voted for it,” Sturtevant said. \nSturtevant said the trick photography in the bicycle race ad was not intended to link Gecker to the UCI Road World Championships in Richmond, which Chesterfield did not support financially. “It was simply intended as a lighthearted reference to the bike races,” he said. \nGecker said the ad reflects Sturtevant’s misunderstanding of the legislative process, which requires elected officials to vote on the whole budget after battling over specific items in it. \n“There are always compromises in the state budget,” he said. “You want people there who understand the art of the compromise.” \n*** \nIn contrast , Gecker’s mailer said Sturtevant voted against money for smaller class sizes in the $271.5 million budget the Richmond School Board approved in May. Sturtevant cast the only vote against the budget because he said he wanted a 2 percent pay raise for teachers instead of 1.7 percent, and he opposed a requirement that teachers attend three additional days each year for professional development. \n“It was a vote on principle,” said Sturtevant, who called the Gecker campaign mailer “knowingly misleading.” \nHe also objected to Gecker’s accusation that he supports private school vouchers, which he said are not constitutional in Virginia. The mailer referred to a newspaper story in which Sturtevant said he supported “school choice” to help parents get their children out of failing schools. He said he meant charter schools, not vouchers. \nBut the Gecker campaign subsequently cited Sturtevant’s testimony to a Senate committee this year on behalf of a bill that would have given the per-pupil state share of education funding to parents of children with disabilities for education savings accounts to help pay for their educational needs, including private school tuition. \n“I testified in favor of it because it was a narrowly tailored bill to help kids with special needs,” Sturtevant said. “People shouldn’t play politics when there’s an opportunity for parents to get their kids help that they’re otherwise not getting from the school system.” \nGecker said, “If we’re going to build back the public education system, you’re not going to get to do that if you take money away from it. The underlying issue with vouchers is they take money away from the public school system.” \nSturtevant and DiSesa, who lobbied for the bill, said the savings accounts are not vouchers. “It’s not giving money from the state to a private institution,” DiSesa said. “It’s money going to parents.” \nThe Virginia State Conference NAACP initially backed the bill but then withdrew support the same day because of opposition by its national parent organization. “It looked like vouchers to them, and they pulled it back,” said NAACP lobbyist Rodney Thomas. \nThe bill died on a tie vote in the Senate that was then decided by Lt. Gov. Ralph S. Northam, a Democrat, who voted against it. \nHolsworth suggested last week that Gecker, who lives in Chesterfield, is using the ads to appeal to Democratic voters in Richmond, which he lost to Francis in the primary. \nGecker’s campaign started airing a television ad Friday that challenged Sturtevant’s transparency in advancing a school redistricting plan three years ago that closed Clark Springs Elementary School. \nThe redistricting plan is the subject of a pending lawsuit against the School Board that alleges the plan protected schools in affluent, predominantly white areas at the expense of schools in poor, predominantly minority areas. \nSturtevant said the ad “just repeats meritless allegations from a lawsuit that hasn’t even been heard.” \n“I know that Richmond parents know the truth about the good work we’ve done to improve our schools for all our students and teachers,” he said Friday. \nDurfee said the barrage of increasingly negative advertising represents the kind of party politics that caused her to declare her candidacy as an independent. \n“You have the parties and the back and forth, and what gets lost is the people,” she said. \nmmartz@timesdispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:30:40.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
