File photograph: Cyril Byrne/The Irish Times \nFri, Oct 2, 2015, 20:33 \n  20:29 Former minister for justice Alan Shatter was on Friday night facing a battle at the Fine Gael selection convention to retain the nomination to run again for the Dáil in the new three-seat Dublin Rathdown constituency. Mr Shatter faced a head-to-head contest against Ballinteer-based Cllr Neale Richmond, a former parliamentary assistant to Fine Gael TD Olivia Mitchell, who is retiring from the Dáil. Cllr Richmond currently works with the European Movement and was an adviser to former MEP Gay Mitchell. Minister orders byelection to fill Seanad vacancy The former Dublin South constituency was a five-seater, with Fine Gael holding three seats - Mr Shatter, Ms Mitchell and former party TD Peter Mathews. About 250 delegates were eligible to vote at the convention, being held at the Goat Bar in Goatstown, south Dublin. Gender quota Party headquarters confirmed just hours before the selection convention that two people would go forward, one a woman, to fill the gender quota requirement that one third of all the party’s candidates be women. Stillorgan-based Cllr Josepha Madigan , a family law solicitor and mediator and author of a book on dispute resolution, was the only female candidate on the ticket, which also included community activist John Kennedy, a local election candidate who also contested the NUI panel in the 2007 and 2011 Seanad elections. Mr Shatter, a solicitor and author of legal books as well as a novel, was first elected to the Dáil in 1981, lost his seat in 2002 and was re-elected in 2007. In 2011 he was appointed minister for justice, until his resignation last year in the wake of Garda controversies. The Fine Gael convention was one of a number taking place over the weekend including the Fianna Fáil convention for the new five-seat Donegal constituency, a merger of the two three-seat Donegal North East and Donegal South West constituencies. Former MEP and minister of state Pat “The Cope” Gallagher is expected to be selected at Sunday’s convention in Letterkenny along with the party’s sole Donegal TD Charlie McConalogue in the North East constituency. Mr Gallagher lost his seat in the 2014 European elections. Five candidates are running and also include Claudia Kennedy, Cllr James Pat McDaid and Cllr Séamus O’Dómhnaill. No contest At a Labour party convention on Friday night in Thurles, Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly was selected without contest as the party’s Tipperary candidate. Meanwhile it has emerged that former Fianna Fáil minister of state Conor Lenihan will not be a candidate for the Dáil in the new Roscommon-Galway constituency. Brother of the former late finance minister, he said two months ago he had been approached by senior Fianna Fáil members in Roscommon with a view to putting his name forward. His name was however not among the contenders when nominations formally closed. Strongly fancied Castlerea Cllr Paschal Fitzmaurice withdrew his nomination, but Cllr Rachel Doherty , daughter of the late former minister Sean Doherty and Cllr Orla Leyden , daughter of Senator Terry Leyden, are among those competing. A date for the convention has not yet been set.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:49:18.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
