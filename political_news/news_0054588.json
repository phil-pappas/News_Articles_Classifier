The new lime kiln in Kruszwica Sugar Plant has the capacity of 300m3 and is the largest one in the Polish sugar production sector. This investment will result in reduced consumption of limestone and coke used for its calcination and, consequently, in lower sugar production costs, as well as in improved technological process and quality of sugar, said Cezary Gabryjączyk during the ceremony of handing over the kiln in Kruszwica Sugar Plant. The kiln parameters guarantee sufficient lime production not only with 9,000 - 10,000 tones processed a day, but also with a higher daily throughput. The Deputy Minister reminded that the investment in the new lime kiln started in January this year and its cost was 7 million PLN. The previous lime kiln, constructed in 1983, had the capacity of 129m3. It enabled to obtain up to 80 per cent of lime required for production, with the throughput of about 9,000 t/day. The remaining lime was delivered from other branches. This involved transport costs. The lime obtained in the old kiln, due to the short calcination duration, was not of the utmost quality which is why its consumption was above-standard. KSC SA is the largest sugar manufacturer on the Polish market. The production quota for KSC is 549.6 tones a year which is 39.1 per cent of the Polish production quota. In Poland, the demand for sugar exceeds its supply within the ascribed production limits. To satisfy the demand, the white, sugar-cane and refined sugar is imported.
