EXPERT ALERTS:\nNew EPA Limits on Smog-Related Pollution\nPhilip Stevens\nEnvironmental Science Faculty Chair\nIndiana University School of Public & Environmental Affairs\n\"The EPA's new standard of 70ppb was expected. However, 70ppb doesn't leave much of a margin for safety for protecting public health. While the EPA Science Advisory Panel recommended a standard between 60-70ppb, industry lobbied hard to keep it at its current level of 75ppb. Lowering it to 70pbb, may be seen as a compromise.\"\nWebsite: https://spea.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/stevens-philip.html\nContact: Agata Porter , agata.porter@finnpartners.com\nBreast Cancer: Dense Breasts and Detection\nDr. Robin Shermis , M.D., M.P.H, F.A.C.R.\nSenior Managing Partner\nToledo Radiological Associates\n\"If I'm looking at your mammogram and you have dense breast tissue, I'm going to recommend you get an MBI (molecular breast imaging). In terms of detection, we're at a state now where we're finding very small cancers, and our goal is to find these invasive cancers before they spread. MBI is fighting breast cancer by catching small lesions in dense breast tissue before they spread.\"\nDr. Shermis graduated from the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1986, and did his residency at University of Michigan Hospitals. He has almost 25 years of experience at ProMedica Breast Care, and has overseen the addition of a variety of new screening technologies into the Northwest Ohio area, including breast MRI, digital mammography, tomosynthesis and molecular breast imaging. Dr. Shermis' radiology practice staffs three hospitals, a large breast care center and an outpatient imaging center. Since 1991, he has served as medical director of breast imaging for ProMedica Breast Care, which manages all breast imaging and procedures in the Toledo Metro area for ProMedica. He is responsible for the breast ultrasound division, percutaneous breast biopsies, and breast cryoablation. Finally, he serves on the executive board for the Toledo Hospital Foundation, and previously served on the board for Susan G. Komen for the Cure's Northwest Ohio chapter. He is very active as a breast imaging advocate in the Toledo Ohio community and has given multiple local, regional and national presentations. He is available for telephone and email interviews. Also, one of his patients, Dianne (55 years old), a breast cancer survivor, is available for interviews.\nWebsite: http://www.toledoxray.com/Doctors.html\nContact: lauren.lewow@inventivhealth.com\nLow Levels of Face-to-Face Social Contact Can Double Depression Risk\nDr. Frieda Birnbaum\nResearch Psychologist, Psychoanalyst\n\"For Millennials, face-to-face interaction may seem like the 'old way' of doing things; however, this kind of interaction is crucial for a person's well-being. Face-to-face interaction allows individuals to see each other for who they are without the false photographic and profile enhancements found on social media. Today, our culture is over stimulated and more isolated than ever before, despite all the ways that people can connect through technology. People should get out more, meet other people and embrace each other's company for that is a staple mark of the human experience.\"\nDr. Birnbaum is author of \"What Price Power: An In-Depth Study of the Professional Woman in a Relationship.\" She's an expert on depression, women's issues, and attaining happiness, and has been featured on \"Oprah\" and \"20/20\" as the oldest woman in the U.S. to have twins.\nContact: Ryan McCormick , ryan@goldmanmccormick.com\nNew, Cutting-Edge Technologies in Brain Surgery\nJames Robinson , M.D.\nNeurosurgeon\n\"There are new, cutting-edge technologies that are allowing brain surgery to be safer than ever in the hands of a highly skilled surgeon.\"\nDr. Robinson is a board certified and nationally recognized neurosurgeon providing the most leading-edge neurosurgery. The hallmark of his expertise includes cranial microsurgery, gamma knife radiosurgery and endoscopic cranial surgery. His outcomes dramatically exceed the national average.

The recent scandal about the Louisville basketball team's alleged use of prostituted girls is just one sad illustration of this massive problem. Unfortunately, discussion of the scandal coverage largely continues to ignore these victims, and also gives a pass to some of the alleged perpetrators -- there has been no talk of prosecuting the players or recruits that had sex with these young girls.\"\nGodsoe teaches courses in family law, criminal law, children and the law, professional responsibility and public interest lawyering. Her scholarship centers on the regulation of intimate behavior and gender roles through family and criminal law, encompassing topics including the path to marriage equality, the designation of victims and offenders in intimate violence, the public vs. private family law systems, and the criminalization of non-conforming girls. Articles include \"Punishment as Protection,\" Houston Law Review (2015); and \"Give Restitution to Victims of Child Pornography, But Also Recognize All Child Victims of Sexual Exploitation,\" Huffington Post, ( March 2015 ).\nWebsite: http://www.brooklaw.edu\nContact: John Mackin , john.mackin@brooklaw.edu\nDraftKings/FanDuel Fantasy Sports Scandal Exposes Threat to Integrity of Sports\nJodi Balsam\nProfessor of Law\nBrooklyn Law School\n\"The DraftKings/FanDuel scandal invites closer scrutiny of the daily fantasy phenomenon and its threat to the integrity of sports. While sports entities line up to take stakes in fantasy games, no one appears to be focusing on the long-term threat they pose to the values that undergird sports' popularity. On the list of short-term profit seekers who have invested in fantasy are most of the pro leagues and the biggest sports networks. More ominously, the NFL Players Association just struck a deal with DraftKings to earn fees from the company's use of player images in its ads. The concern here is less with the integrity of fantasy sports games -- that ship has sailed despite DraftKings and FanDuels' new ban on employee participation in any fantasy games -- but rather the integrity of the underlying sports competition. No one is going to watch, much less bet on, a contest infested with point-shaving and other forms of performance manipulation.\"\nBalsam is a former attorney for the NFL, where she managed litigation in all areas of law, oversaw a variety of policy and operational matters, negotiated contracts for League special events, and administered the League's internal dispute resolution processes and compliance program. She is frequently Quote: d in media (including USA Today and The New York Times ) on NFL legal matters.\nWebsite: www.brooklaw.edu\nContact: John Mackin , john.mackin@brooklaw.edu\nYoga and Copyright Protection\nBarbara Dobberthien\nCOO\nYoga Alliance\nOn Oct. 8, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California affirmed a previous ruling by a federal district court that Bikram Choudhury's sequence of 26 yoga poses is not entitled to copyright protection.

For any species, understanding how much energy that animal has is important. Make sure you and your family can fit the needs of the animal. Another thing to consider is the health of the family. If you have individuals with allergies, there are different breeds that are better for people with allergies…even dogs that are hypo-allergenic. Take into consideration the demands of the animal, the husbandry and the expenses associated with that breed.\"\nOctober is Adopt a Dog Month, and Heyder-Kitching can share her expert tips on choosing the right dog for your family.

Giampolo\nFounder\nPhillyGayLawyer.com and Giampolo Law Group\n\"Smithers' infatuation with his billionaire boss has been hinted at in many episodes of the iconic show, which began airing in 1989 and is the longest running primetime sitcom in the U.S. It's only fitting that, like 'Ellen,' there be a proper coming out on the most influential show to a majority of kids and most adults. Rosie O'Donnell said she came out so people could never say they didn't know a gay person -- adding Smithers, you can definitely say that now!\"\nGiampolo's practice focuses on LGBT law, corporate transactions, civil rights, employment discrimination, real estate, domestic and international adoptions, and estates. She is an advocate for gay people everywhere.\nContact: Mark Goldman , markgoldman73@gmail.com\nMEDIA JOBS:\nFollowing are links to job listings for staff and freelance writers, editors and producers.
