Rob Portman on Friday said all sides of the House Republican caucus would be behind U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan if the Wisconsin lawmaker runs for House speaker.\n\"I understand that all factions of the conference are supportive of him,\" Portman, a Cincinnati-area Republican, told reporters at Ohio State University, where the senator spoke at a forum with business leaders. Portman said he's a \"big fan\" of Ryan, who ran for vice president in 2012.\nPortman added that he thinks \"it's very possible\" that House Republicans will find a candidate who is a relatively senior lawmaker who is \"maybe not in leadership now.\"\nRyan has so far resisted pressure to seek the top leadership post in the U.S. House, which opened up when U.S. Rep. John Boehner, a Cincinnati-area Republican, announced his plans to resign at the end of this month.\nRegardless of who's chosen to succeed Boehner, Portman indicated he or she would not have an easy job ahead of them.\n\"This is the worst job in American politics,\" Portman said. \"It's like herding squirrels – and squirrels with big egos. So it's even worse. But it's an important job.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/09/house-republicans-speaker-ryan-mccarthy/73643178/"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:38:28.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
