(Kenzo Tribouillard/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) By David Ignatius Opinion writer October 13 at 7:53 PM Follow @ignatiuspost An internal political storm is roiling Saudi Arabia, as the crown prince and his deputy jockey for power under an aging King Salman — while some other members of the royal family agitate on behalf of a third senior prince who they claim would have wider family support.\nFor the secretive oil kingdom, whose internal debates are usually opaque to outsiders, the recent strife has been unusually open. The tension between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef and his deputy, Mohammed bin Salman (the king’s son), is gossiped about across the Arab world. Dissenters from the royal family have begun circulating open letters that have drawn tens of thousands of readers online.\nDavid Ignatius writes a twice-a-week foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog.

The young prince urges more diversification of the economy, greater privatization, and a future that’s closer to the more open model of the United Arab Emirates than to the conservative House of Saud. He is said to have engaged top U.S. consulting firms in framing his modernization plans.\n“His vision is hugely impressive in its scope, detail and pace,” says one former senior U.S. official who recently had a lengthy meeting with Mohammed bin Salman. The current frenetic political situation “could be the early stages of upheaval, or of a Saudi Arabia that’s vastly more capable economically, politically and militarily.”\nCritics counter that Mohammed bin Salman is impulsive and inexperienced — and that he has championed a costly but unsuccessful war in Yemen . These dissenters argue that the Yemen war has strengthened al-Qaeda’s position there and brought new pressure from refugees and insurgents on Saudi Arabia’s border.\nThe internal tension has increased over the past month.
