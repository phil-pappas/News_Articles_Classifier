The stated intent of Prop. 34 was to scale back the influence of wealthy interests and donors by establishing limits on what could be given to state legislative and statewide candidates.\nBut while it limited money going directly to candidates, it started a snowballing of independent expenditures, for which there are no limits.\nDemocrats have taken advantage of that more than Republicans, with $44 million spent by the Democratic Party in independent expenditures on behalf of state candidates in 2014 and $17.3 million spent by the Republican Party.\nOrange County got its share of that action, thanks to a couple races that were supposed to be competitive but turned out to be relatively easy GOP wins.\nIn the race to replace the seat vacated by termed-out state Sen. Lou Correa , D-Santa Ana, Democrat Jose Solorio received nearly as much help in independent expenditures ($2.8 million) as he raised for his own campaign ($3.1 million). But that wasn’t enough to overcome Republican Janet Nguyen , who got less help in independent expenditures ($2.1 million) but raised more for her own campaign ($3.5 million).\nNguyen prevailed on Election Day, 58 percent to 42 percent.\nIncumbent Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva , D-Fullerton, had a much greater money advantage ($3.7 million spent by her campaign, $1.3 million in independent expenditures) over GOP challenger Young Kim ($2.2 million spent by her campaign, $174,000 in independent expenditures). But it wasn’t enough to turn the tide her way.\nKim prevailed on Election Day, 55 percent to 45 percent.\nMaplight hasn’t run recent numbers breaking down the amount of political spending in the state by special interests, but I’d be surprised if the proportions have changed much since their tally for the 2012 election cycle.\nPublic employees easily led the field with $7 million in spending, followed by: construction unions ($4.4 million), insurance companies ($3.8 million), attorneys and law firms ($3 million), Indian tribes ($2.9 million) and telecommunications interests ($2 million).\nPolitical scofflaws\nA couple of fairly minor fines were approved Thursday by the state Fair Political Practices Commission.\nFullerton Councilwoman Jennifer Fitzgerald agreed to pay $100 for not listing her job with the lobbying and public relations firm of Curt Pringle & Associates on her 2015 statement of economic interests. She is a vice president with the firm.\nKermit Marsh has agreed to pay a $200 penalty for his Westminster City Council campaign failing to pay the $50 annual secretary of state fee in 2013.\nThe sole big Orange County fine approved was $15,000 for longtime trash hauler George Briggeman, Jr. , for masking $13,200 in contributions to a PAC that supported City Council candidates in Cypress, Anaheim and Lake Forest. This has been written about more extensively elsewhere in the Register.\nContact the writer: mwisckol@ocregister.com ; @MartinWisckol", "external_links": ["http://maplight.org/content/report-new-tool-reveals-80m-in-independent-expenditures-spent-in-californias-2014-election", "http://maplight.org/california/interest"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:13:48.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
