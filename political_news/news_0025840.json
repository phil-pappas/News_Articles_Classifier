What, is the private sector broken or on holiday right now? Why don't they pull themselves up by their bootstraps and pay for their own security? Too funny. Some fool will get upset and go off about Secret Service details for these campaigns, as if I never heard of that before. Just wait, it will happen, and we can laugh together when it does!

Carson And Trump Request Secret Service Protection : It's All Politics : NPR You might! But, hey make sure you log in as Fayt first. That way you can be consistent! Would you like for me to re post your Daily KOS talking point Fayt? Or, are you going to get brave and actually think for yourself? Naww, I will just wait for the Daily KOS talking points. Location: Lehigh Valley Pa.,USA Posts: 545 Carson has received death threats If you libs were consistent you would be wailing about what racist is threatening the black candidate!! But as we all know You are a bunch of hypocrites Quote: Originally Posted by coke You might! But, hey make sure you log in as Fayt first. That way you can be consistent!

What game are you small minded little boys trying to play now? Are you all whispering and giggling on PM now, trying to come up with a way to get rid of the girls on this site? It's pretty pathetic. All this talk about me being Fayt, or me being some other waiting tables gal. That must be the \"waitress\" comment bear made the other night. Pathetic. Face the facts, guys, you get your hair mussed up and laughed at by more than one girl here. I know it probably makes you all a but insecure, but it really shouldn't. Girls are smarter anyway. Just the way it is. Deal with it. Girl up for god's sake.

Now you are starting to annoy me with the \"girl Thing\" If you want to play the sex card, be prepared to get equal respect back....And stop with the damned whining... Quote: Originally Posted by Jimgorn Now you are starting to annoy me with the \"girl Thing\" If you want to play the sex card, be prepared to get equal respect back....And stop with the damned whining... You guys keep beating me up for being a girl. Being too thin skinned, emotional, I can't hang with the big boys and all that crap. I never said anything about it when I came here, before being beat up and questioned about and for my being a female. You don't like it, then get off it. If you feel like you are being unfairly singled out, try being one of us. Oh yeah, and get your little giggling buddies to drop this stupid shit about me and Fayt being the same person. I get it, y'all have girl issues, that is clear to see. Don't push that crap on us, though. Treat us with equal disrespect that you do the guys here. That's all. Don't pick at us for wearing a skirt, and I won't pick at you for being afraid of a skirt. Easy peasy. Quote: Originally Posted by Lyzza You guys keep beating me up for being a girl.

I defend your right to say dumb things, but I also reserve the right to call it stupid, That is not \"beating up the girl\" Nobody is beating you up because you are a girl...So stop with the \"I'm a victim!!\" bullshit You get beat up because your posting illogical, emotional crap. ..And you encourage a couple of other numbskulls who are posting the same crap....", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:18:10.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
