Bush in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, following the recent comments made by Trump. \n\"Look, my brother responded to a crisis, and he did it as you would hope a president would do. He united the country, he organized our country and he kept us safe. And there's no denying that. The great majority of Americans believe that. And I don't know why he keeps bringing this up. It's - it doesn't show that he's a serious person as it relates to being commander in chief and being the architect of a foreign policy. Across the spectrum of foreign policy, Mr. Trump talks about things that - as though he's still on The Apprentice. I mean, literally, talking about Syria saying \"ISIS should take out Assad, then Russia should take out ISIS\" as though it was some kind of board game and not a serious approach is just - this is just another example of the lack of seriousness. And this is a serious time. We're under grave threats again, and I think we need a president with a steady hand,\" Bush said. \nAll but one of the 19 men who hijacked planes and flew them into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania legally entered the country on business or tourist visas. One entered on a student visa but did not show up to class.
