To portray these as an ill-conceived attempt of the government to win the upcoming elections distorts the facts and echoes the terrorist organization’s propaganda.\nIndeed, the PKK already declared the end of the peace process in July and claimed responsibility for killing two Turkish police officers . Since then, 130 members of the Turkish police, gendarmerie and military and 43 civilians have been killed and 536 security personnel and 288 civilians wounded by the PKK as of Sept. 29.\nNo responsible government could be expected to refrain from taking action while its law enforcement personnel and civilians are being murdered by a terrorist organization that is designated as such by the international community, including the United States and European Union . Indeed, Turkey’s right to self-defense has always been acknowledged and recognized by the American authorities.\nTurkey’s determined stance in countering terrorist organizations in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere leaves no room to question. Turkey makes no distinction among terrorist organizations. It may be politically expedient to pick and choose among terrorist groups because some of them may present themselves as partners in the fight. However, as such a marriage of convenience is inconceivable with forces like Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria, the same logic should also apply for the PKK. Unless the global community adopts a similar comprehensive and non-discriminatory approach that aims to defeat all terrorists regardless of their motives, peace and security in the region and beyond will be impossible to achieve.\nSerdar Kilic , Washington\nThe writer is Turkey’s ambassador to the United States.", "external_links": ["http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/07/kurdish-group-claims-revenge-murder-turkish-police-150722132945249.html", "http://vasington.be.mfa.gov.tr/ShowAnnouncement.aspx?ID=242732", "https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/europe/20357-eu-condemns-pkk-terrorism", "http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm", "http://national.bgnnews.com/2-turkish-police-killed-2-wounded-in-pkk-attack-in-hakkari-haberi/9445"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:55:53.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
