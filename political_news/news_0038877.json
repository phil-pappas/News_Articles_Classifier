Sadly, you can't gain votes when repeating lies. Obama broke a child's heart in the last debate discussing how the 2A protects gun ownership. Obama told CONGRESS to discuss the issue. The instant Rubio's campaign started using lies is the day his campaign died. Obama never once in history said he wants to ban all guns. In fact, no (dominant) Left Winger in History said they want to ban all guns. If you think they did, read/view past the 10 second snip you viewed. I know, you base your THEORY on SLIPPERY SLOPE. You KNOW the Left wants to take all your guns and never think why your bullets cost so much today. It's not Fear Mongering Capitalism. Let's explore even further. If laws were passed, it would be GrandFather Clause. Some of you are so scared of door to door gun collection based on propaganda, you don't think about it because you are scared.
