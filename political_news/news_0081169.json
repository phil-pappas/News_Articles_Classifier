King as his pick to replace outgoing U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan (who is returning to Chicago, where his kids now attend a $30K-a-year private school ), King was Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pick to lead Zuck's failed $100 million \"reform\" effort of Newark's Schools. From The Prize: Who's in Charge of America's Schools? : \"[Newark Mayor Cory] Booker asked [NJ Governor Chris] Christie to grant him control of the schools by fiat, but the governor demurred, offering him instead a role as unofficial partner in all decisions and policies, beginning with their joint selection of a 'superstar' superintendent to lead the charge. Booker's first choice was John King, then deputy New York State education commissioner, who had led some of the top-performing charter schools in New York City and Boston and who credited public school teachers with inspiring him to persevere after he was orphaned as a young boy in Brooklyn. [Mark] Zuckerberg and [his wife Priscilla] Chan flew King to Palo Alto for a weekend with them and [Facebook executive Sheryl] Sandberg; Christie hosted him at the governor's beach retreat on the Jersey Shore; and Booker led King and his wife, Melissa, on a tour of Newark, with stops at parks and businesses that hadn't existed before his mayoralty. But after much thought, King turned them down. Zuckerberg, Christie, and Booker expected to arrive at their national model within five years. King believed it could take almost that long to change the system's fundamental procedures and to raise expectations across the city for children and schools. \"John's view was that no one has achieved what they're trying to achieve: build an urban school district serving high-poverty kids that gets uniformly strong outcomes,\" said an acquaintance who talked with King about the offer. \"You'd have to invest not only a long period of time but tremendous political capital to get it done.\" King had questions about a five-year plan overseen by politicians who were likely to seek higher office.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T16:57:16.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
