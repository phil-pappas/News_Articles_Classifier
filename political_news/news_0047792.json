It enables us to know where we match up, what areas need more attention, and helps us figure out what we need to do about problem areas,\" Dr Smith says. \n\"This is the first comprehensive report on New Zealand’s environment produced by Statistics New Zealand. It puts into practice the maxim that you manage what you measure. Robust, independent financial reporting has helped achieve significant improvements in New Zealand’s financial management and our ambition is to achieve the same for the environment,\" Mr Foss says. \nThe environment reporting framework was a key part of National’s ‘Bluegreen’ policy developed in Opposition. A public discussion paper - Measuring Up - was released by Dr Smith in 2010 on the proposal. The Environmental Reporting Bill was introduced to Parliament in 2012 and passed last month. \n\"The strength of this environment reporting system is its independence, the audit by the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment and the succession of future reports that will enable comparisons. There will be a six-monthly report on each of the five domains covering freshwater, marine, atmosphere and climate, air and land. The next full synthesis report will be produced in October 2018,\" Dr Smith says. \n\"The Environment Aotearoa 2015 report is a dry run of the new reporting system proposed under the just-passed Environmental Reporting Act. It has been written and managed consistent with the Act’s requirements. Measuring environmental statistics is challenging and we welcome feedback next month as we consult on the regulations to back up the new law,\" Mr Foss says. \n\"This report shows New Zealand is making good progress in reducing air pollution that causes urban smog and many premature deaths, and that our fisheries are being more sustainably managed with fewer stocks overfished and significant reductions in seabird bycatch. The key areas where we face major challenges are freshwater, climate change and biodiversity,\" Dr Smith says. \n\"The report on freshwater is a mixed bag and varies significantly around New Zealand. Water clarity and pollution from ammonia-nitrogen is improving. However, the trends for total nitrogen and dissolved phosphate are negative. While the report finds that 96 per cent of monitored freshwater sites are suitable for wading and boating, it does not report on swimming water quality. I am advised this is because the data is inconsistent and not nationally comparable. This is an area on which we will need to improve the data. \n\"The report shows New Zealand needs to step up its efforts on greenhouse emissions and climate change. We are making good progress on increasing renewable electricity and are on target to achieve 90 per cent by 2025. We need to make more progress on transport emissions and we have a huge challenge around agricultural emissions. The next step will be the review of the Emissions Trading Scheme and the critical negotiations in Paris in December. \n\"The major threat to our biodiversity is introduced pests. We have significantly increased areas where pests are controlled but the reality is that too many of our native species are in decline. The War on Weeds and the Battle for Our Birds programmes are stepping up our efforts in these areas. \n\"This report has been produced independently of Ministers and policy officials who have only received it today. There are no major surprises in this report but it will in time inform Government policies and funding priorities.\" \nThe Environment Aotearoa 2015 report is available online from: www.mfe.govt.nz. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:27:29.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
