In the last five years alone fees have shot up by $1,400 (or 24.64%). \nNow students are being asked to bear a growing burden at a time when nearly half of full time students struggle to pay the rent, and most are giving up on aspirations of home ownership in the city they love. The future looks increasingly bleak for Generation Debt. \nStudent debt reaches $15 Billion in February 2016, and the University of Auckland Council intends to add to it on Monday. Students have had enough, and we’ll be rallying against our growing Debt Sentence. \nWhat: \nRally to oppose ever-increasing fees and inadequate student support \nSpeakers:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:13:49.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
