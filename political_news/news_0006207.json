The reality is that, what happened in Dadri was barbaric and to try and justify it is even more preposterous and obnoxious. Justifying the lynching is not only insulting but a much bigger crime,\" Congress leader Manish Tewari told ANI. \nAccording to reports, ABVP is set to come up with the claim at its annual state-level convention to be held in Sitapur from November 1 to 3 that the Dadri lynching was the result of a personal dispute, with one of Mohammad Akhlaq's two sons having a 'love affair with a Hindu girl', and that politicians wrongly projected it as a fallout of 'beef consumption'. \nAkhlaq (50) was killed and his son Danish (20) were attacked by a mob after rumours spread that the family had consumed and stored beef in their house at Bishara village in Dadri in Gautam Budh Nagar District of Uttar Pradesh on September 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:37:19.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
