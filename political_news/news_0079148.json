The chicken affected by this recall was marketed as a ready-to-eat product and was produced between the end of August and mid-September of this year. Some of the brands affected by this recall include Antioch Farms, Acclaim, Family Favorites, Schwan's, Chestnut Farms, Sysco, Spartan, Oven Cravers, Shaner's, Home Dining Selections, and Kirkwood .\nHowever, this is not the first time chicken products potentially contaminated by salmonella were recalled by this producer. This past July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service determined that an outbreak of salmonella could be traced back to chicken products produced by Aspen Foods. The FSIS' inspection was prompted by five patients who experienced symptoms as a result of salmonella poisoning starting in May of 2015. During this original recall, nearly 2 million pounds of frozen chicken were recalled.\nSalmonellosis is one of the most common foodborne illnesses that exists and can develop when a person consumes food that has been contaminated with salmonella. Those who develop salmonellosis may experience a higher fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps anywhere from 12 to 72 hours after they are first exposed to this organism. In most cases, those affected by salmonella recover within a week's time and do not require medical treatment. However, salmonellosis can cause those who are older, infants and people with a weakened immune system to suffer from severe side-effects.\nAspen Foods' most recent recall of the contaminated chicken is expected to include all of the products that could have been affected by this particular strain of salmonella. Those who purchased any of the potentially contaminated chicken products produced by this company are encouraged to throw them away or return them to the store where they purchased them.\nEven though only a few cases of salmonellosis were reported during this recent outbreak, many people are affected by this foodborne illness every year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on an annual basis, salmonella poisoning results in 380 deaths and approximately 19,000 hospitalizations.\nThose who experience severe illness as a result of salmonella poisoning may incur significant medical bills and find that the quality of their daily life is compromised. Anyone in this situation should promptly reach out to Merman Law Firm, P.C. for assistance asserting their legal right to fair and proper compensation.
