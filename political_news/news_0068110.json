Issues such as infertility, early menopause and body image as well as time away from work and family can have a substantial impact, with long term physical, psychological and social effects,\" the chief executive officer of Cancer Australia, Professor Helen Zorbas, said.\n\"Although the number of young women diagnosed with breast cancer has increased over time, the incidence rate has remained stable over the past three decades.\"\nBreast cancer survivor Joanne Maillet with her husband Marcus and dog Elvis at home in South Yarra. Photo: Paul Jeffers\nThe report, by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, is the first report to look at the situation facing young women with breast cancer.\nAdvertisement It found that 795 women aged between 20 and 39 years would be diagnosed with breast cancer this year and 65 women would die from the disease.\n\"This is an average of two diagnoses a day and one death a week,\" a spokesman for the institute, Justin Harvey, said.\nThe report found women had a better chance of beating the disease now than 20 years ago.\nIn 2007-2011 young women had an 88 per cent change of surviving for five years after their initial diagnosis compared to the 90 per cent survival rate for women aged 40 and over,\nIn 1982-1986 women aged between 20 and 39 years had a five year survival rate of 72 per cent.\n\"When looking at breast cancer in young women, we see a higher proportion of very large breast cancers diagnosed than in older women. Very large breast cancers are associated with lower survival than small breast cancers,\" Mr Harvey said.\nBut in the case of small breast cancers, young women have a lower survival rate – 93 per cent – than women aged 40 and over – 99 per cent.\nBreast cancer survivor Joanne Maillet​, 31, of South Yarra, said the figures of incidence of the disease in the young was \"very scary\" and urged young women to get their breasts checked and trust their instincts.\nIn 2011, two GPs she saw about a lump in her left breast dismissed it as improbable a 26-year-old would get the disease. \"They said, 'you're too young, don't worry about it'. If I'd listened to them, I wouldn't be here talking to you.\"\nThe third doctor, a surgeon, diagnosed stage three cancer and she started treatment. \"Stage four is terminal so I caught it just in time.\"\n\"If you think there's something wrong, just push and push and push [for a second opinion] because you know your body better than anyone else. It's not just an old person's disease. It happens to women of all ages.\"\n\"If my story can save one life then I've done my bit. It's all about early detection with this type of cancer with young people. If you don't, it's just going to be too late.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:30:02.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
