First a teletype, then a fax, and now a secure email and chat link, the emergency hotline was designed to prevent nuclear Armageddon. It is still tested regularly but seldom used — and not during the Ukraine or Syria crises, according to a Pentagon official.\n“There’s no real need to — there are so many avenues to talk with the Russians,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.\nBut the the reality is, according to interviews with other Pentagon and State Department officials and experts, those channels have long been silent. The lines once open in the form of meetings, exchanges and training exercises that were conducted between the former Cold War foes virtually all went dead after Russia invaded the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea early last year — and Washington-Moscow relations hit a post-Cold War low.\nObama: Putin hasn't won anything By Michael Crowley\nNow that the Russian Air Force is also bombing targets inside Syria, U.S. military leaders are struggling to find a new mechanism for regular communication to avoid a larger confrontation between superpowers in the air and on the ground, where the Syrian Army and a dizzying number of rebel and terrorist groups with competing and shifting alliances are operating — including U.S.-backed guerrillas dedicated to the overthrow of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, Moscow's chief Middle East ally.\nThey are virtually starting from scratch. Indeed, the most recent case of U.S. and Russian forces coordinating their operations in a war zone appears to be when their armies met at the Elbe River in Germany in 1944. And that was when they were both dedicated to defeating Germany in World War II.\n\"That is about the last time, on a tactical level, that we have been effective in talking to each other,\" said retired Air Force Gen. Gene Habiger, former chief of the Strategic Air Command. \"At the strategic level we have done some things — military-to-military contacts and the red phone. But cooperation and coordination on targeting is a big deal. And given the past seven or eight years, especially with the current leadership team in place in Moscow, it will be very difficult if not impossible.\"\nHabiger is the senior U.S. representative to the so-called Elbe Group, a collection of former U.S. and Russian military and intelligence leaders sponsored by Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government that will meet later this year in the Bahamas.\n\"We are rapidly in a declining state of confidence-building and trust — and we've got to change it,\" he added. \"And I don't know how to change it.\"\nThe stakes are considered extremely high.\n\"This can escalate if someone shoots another one’s plane down or if you are bombing the wrong place or the wrong airfield,\" said retired Army Gen. George Joulwan, the former commander of NATO who enlisted the Russian military in a historic partnership in the 1990s when the Western alliance sent peacekeeping forces into the Balkans.\nThe State Department lists several dozen fora for the two militaries to talk in recent years — including a video teleconference between the Joint Chiefs chairman and his counterpart, a “Colonels Working Group” that met in Moscow, and a variety of visits by naval commanders, top officers in the Asia-Pacific, and war college students.\nBut since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Washington has cut off many of those contacts and struggled to understand the intentions of the mercurial Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, whose aggressive moves in Ukraine prompted U.S. military assistance to the democratically-elected government in Kiev.\nRussian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu asked Secretary of Defense Ash Carter last week to re-establish military talks to “de-conflict” operations in Syria after Russian combat forces began arriving inside the country at the invitation of Assad last month.\nBut they didn’t take place before Russian jets started bombarding targets in northern Syria on Tuesday.\nOn the American side, the job to open some sort of dialogue fell the next day to Elissa Slotkin, the acting assistant secretary of defense for international affairs, and Vice Adm. Frank Pandolfe, the director of strategic plans and policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nWhite House\nObama to Putin: Good luck with that By Michael Crowley\nThe two talked via a secure video teleconference with their counterparts in Moscow in a discussion the Pentagon emphasized was “cordial” and “professional,” but which didn’t yield any final agreement.\nPentagon officials are trying to decide just how they might change their approach to incorporate the Russian air operations in Syria over the long term, according to several military officials who were not authorized to speak publicly about the internal deliberations.\nThere are three possibilities, officials told POLITICO.\nThe first is to simply draw up “sectors,” which the U.S. and Russia would agree upon and keep their units within.\nThe second would be “procedural de-confliction,” in which the two sides would agree to talk on a regular basis about where and when they planned to operate so they could respond accordingly.\nThe third option might be a full partnership in which Russia joined what the U.S. calls its “60-nation” coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq. A Russian liaison officer might join the other international officers posted to the Combined Air and Space Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.\nThat command center, outside Doha, is what runs the daily U.S. and international air war in the Middle East, and writes each day’s “air tasking order,” which assigns missions to warplanes. Russia has so far resisted American calls to join the coalition and restrict its targeting in Syria only to the Islamic State, which has the been the focus of a yearlong U.S.-led air campaign in both Syria and Iraq.\nWhat the Russians want, according to a person with knowledge of this week’s secure teleconference between the Pentagon and Moscow, is for the U.S. to join their intelligence cell in Baghdad. Russian military and intelligence officers have opened an office there to share information with Iraqi, Iranian and Syrian representatives.\nMoscow also invited the U.S. to send its own liaison officers to help with “de-confliction” in Syria, but Washington appears unlikely to agree; the U.S. does not want to deal with Iranian or Syrian intelligence officers and officials are already working to put up boundaries between the Americans and Russians in the Iraqi capital.\nSo far, the U.S. and Russia have confined their early discussions about how they’ll operate in Syria to high-level considerations aimed mostly at the safety of air crews.\n“One is to use particular international frequencies that can be used at a time of distress,” Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook told reporters. “Second, a question has been raised about exactly how that conversation between aircraft — what language would it be in? Those are some of the questions that we're trying to address.”\nBut some military experts believe it is naive to think there can be genuine coordination let alone cooperation with the Russian military inside Syria.\n“Our position is that Assad has to go and their position is that Assad has to stay, and they have used military force,” said Frederick Kagan, head of the Critical Threats Project at the hawkish American Enterprise Institute and a frequent adviser to the U.S. military.\nA close-up view of the tape machine of the 'red phone.' | AFP/Getty\n“That is a situation where we cannot coordinate with them without fundamentally altering our objectives and partnerships, which would be foolish,\" he added. \"They are trying to deny us a series of options for operating against Assad,” including taking steps like setting up a no-fly zone to protect civilians against Assad’s air force.\nIf the U.S. coordinates too much with the Russians, “there is a high likelihood they will pass along to the Syrians and Iranians,\" added Kagan, a former professor of military history at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,\nBut others insist there is little choice.\n\"We have to stop and have an air coordination center [with the Russians] immediately over that area,” believes Joulwan.\nHe said that even if the U.S. and Russia do not share all the same objectives, there is a common interest in defeating the Islamic State.\n\"Russia has more to fear from ISIS than us,\" he said, citing Muslim extremists inside Russia and along its vast borders. \"Sure, Assad is an issue with us, but I think once you start cooperating military-to-military, at some point that part can be handled.\"\nMichael Kofman is a defense analyst at CNA Corp., a federally funded research center formerly known as the Center for Naval Analysis. He previously coordinated exchanges between the two sides at the National Defense University, an arm of the Pentagon,. Those exchanges went into hibernation for a time after the Russian invasion of the Republic of Georgia in 2008 and then again after the Ukraine crisis.\nSome sort of coordination will happen in Syria, he hopes, but it will take some shrewd leadership on both sides — and clear instructions to commanders in the region.\n\"We are largely running two separate operations.\"\nPhilip Ewing contributed to this report .\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:19:39.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
