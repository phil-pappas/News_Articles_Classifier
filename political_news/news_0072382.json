DiStefano (Photo: CU) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBOULDER, Colo. (AP) - University of Colorado's chancellor is defending his decision to host the Republican presidential debate after students demanded the school pull its involvement if organizers refused to increase the number of tickets for students. \nThe Daily Camera reports Chancellor Phil DiStefano issued a newsletter saying the Oct. 28 debate is not a public event and is instead a TV broadcast with a studio audience. He said having the debate at the Coors Event Center will increase CU-Boulder's recognition. \nDiStefano said students will receive a majority of the university's 100 tickets. \nStudents had passed a resolution demanding the university not host the event if more tickets weren't made available. But the student body presidents vetoed the resolution, saying students could be more engaged by hosting a debate watch party on campus. \n(Copyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
