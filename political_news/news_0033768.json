If the \"Move Seattle\" levy is approved, the same homeowner would pay $275 a year, a $145 increase. \nMayor Ed Murray believes Move Seattle is the answer to Seattle's traffic gridlock. His plan focuses on making it easier for buses to get around with more rapid ride lines. \nMurray thinks that will increase bus ridership, which will get people out of their cars. But when pushed about the promise of relieving traffic, Murray backed off a bit. \n\"Will we solve the global problem of congestion, the answer to that is I don't know anywhere in the planet that's happened, but we could make it better,\" said Murray. \nThe $930 million levy would also fund sidewalk and road repair, bikeways, bus stations, bridge retrofitting and other work. But Move Seattle is expensive enough that when you even mention the cost... \n\"For a $930 million packageâ€¦\" laughed Amanda Clark, president of The League of Women Voters of Seattle/King County. \nIn the past month, opponents have been lining up. The Municipal League, The Seattle Times and The League of Women Voters have urged voters to reject the levy. \n\"I think our main problem was the accountability and transparency of the projects and how they're written,\" said Clark. \nClark says the levy lacks specificity and oversight, with some of the projects as mere suggestions with no promise of follow-through. \n\"We're disturbed by the fact that there doesn't seem to be any prior priorities set for some of these projects,\" said Clark. \n\"I will guarantee it,\" said Mayor Murray. \"I've showed we can deliver these projects.\" \nAs the mayor makes his final push, he's up against mounting opposition. \nThe League of Women Voters thinks the newly redistricted Seattle City Council should decide the next move, instead of passing Move Seattle. 2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.king5.com/story/news/politics/city/2015/10/20/move-seattle-levy-facing-growing-opposition/74309784/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:19:52.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
