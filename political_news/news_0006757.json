Related Content Netanyahu offers olive branch to Obama on Iran \nBut former U.S., Palestinian and Israeli officials said that options are extremely limited -- and that Washington must be careful to not set expectations too high or risk making the situation worse. \nSecretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday that he is planning a trip to the region \"soon,\" although officials said the date and location have not yet been set. \n\"We're working on trying to calm things down,\" Kerry said at Harvard University. \"And I will go there soon at some point, appropriately, and try to work to reengage and see if we can't move that away from this precipice.\" \nAlthough the Obama administration has been careful not to place blame on any party for the latest escalation of violence, the officials said Kerry is particularly concerned about statements by Palestinian officials inciting their people to violence. \n\"This violence and any incitement to violence has got to stop,\" Kerry said at a separate event. \"The situation is simply too volatile, too dangerous. And it is not going to lead to the outcome that people want, which is to have a peaceful resolution of the differences.\" \nHe added, \"We continue to stress the importance of all persons of responsibility to condemn the violence on either side and to avoid provocative statements.\" \nU.S. officials said Kerry is concerned about heavy-handed treatment of Palestinian rock throwers by Israeli security forces, particularly the use of live ammunition against young protesters. \nAnd, in his remarks at Harvard, Kerry pointed to Israeli settlement construction. \n\"There's been a massive increase in settlements over the course of the last years,\" he said. \"Now you have this violence because there's a frustration that is growing, and a frustration among Israelis who don't see any movement.\" \nThe U.S. officials said Kerry hopes to meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas when he travels to the region. \nA challenge to the two-state solution \n\"He is worried about the violence itself, but is generally concerned about where the whole two-state solution is going,\" a senior official said. \nBut former officials and experts worry that a visit by Kerry so early in the outbreak of violence could risk damaging the fragile situation even further by pushing too hard for a solution. And neither Netanyahu nor Abbas has particularly good relations with the Obama administration after years of fruitless efforts at diplomacy and, in the case of Israel, sharp disagreements over the recent Iran nuclear deal. \nStanching the violence is a tall task for the United States, which must seem concerned and involved in efforts to restore peace but can't overplay its hand. Another failed mediation effort could erode confidence in the United States even more and serve as a black eye for Kerry and President Barack Obama. Kerry held intensive talks with the parties and made repeated visits to the region in a bid for a peace deal that fell apart in spring 2014. \n\"In the immediate term, I don't think there is much space for high diplomacy,\" said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former Palestinian Authority official. \nBut he said the United States can play a role in encouraging both sides separately to take productive steps. For the Israelis, that would include making improvements in quality of life for Palestinians, and on the other side, the Palestinian Authority should tone down its rhetoric and focus on a positive message, he said. \nAl-Omari's sentiment was echoed by Dan Arbell, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former senior member of Israel's foreign service. \n\"Kerry's efforts (at a peace deal) last year failed. While he'll be listened to and he'd be used perhaps as a conduit to convey messages from one side to another, I'm pretty skeptical about what he can achieve at this point in time,\" Arbell said, adding the violence needs to subside before anything more substantive can be done. \n\"Kerry can put pressure on (Abbas) at this point and ask the Israelis to look at concrete ways of offering the Palestinians, once the violence is over, a political horizon, or that negotiations can be resumed,\" Arbell said. \nKerry would need to walk tightrope \nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, in a briefing with reporters Wednesday, seemed to acknowledge to some extent the limitations the United States faces. \n\"Ultimately, ending this conflict will require both sides making some difficult decisions, some decisions that will require them to exercise some significant political courage,\" said Earnest, who noted U.S. officials were in touch with both sides. \"But ultimately, what the United States can do is to try to facilitate those conversations, to try to be supportive of that process.\" \nElliott Abrams of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former Middle East adviser to President George W. Bush, said two major factors complicate Kerry's efforts, particularly if he were to try yet another broad push for a peace deal. \nHe cannot appear to be rewarding terrorism -- \"if the thing that gets you back at the table is killing Israelis, that's a very unhelpful lesson to teach\" -- and with Abbas aging and in a weakened position, Palestinians are facing a succession battle, Abrams said. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:41:41.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
