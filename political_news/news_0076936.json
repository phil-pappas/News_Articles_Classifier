It is for them to agree to implement the Smith Commission in full, or end up being accused of failing to deliver the report's recommendation.\"Responding to the speech, a UK Government spokesman said: \"The Scotland Bill delivers the Smith Commission Agreement in full with no vetos.\n\"The Scottish Parliament will be given the power to top up reserved benefits and no one is going to stand in their way.\"\nEarlier in the day, David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, repeated his determination to have the Scotland Bill passed before May's Holyrood election.\nHe said the campaign should focus on how the parties would use the new tax and welfare powers, which are expected to come into force in April 2017.\nHe said: \"It's very important that people in Scotland know ahead of next year's elections what the\nThe Scotland Bill will give MSPs control over income tax rates and bands, and will hand Holyrood half of the cash raised from VAT in Scotland while at the same time making it responsible for about £2.5 billion worth of welfare spending.\nA UK Government spokesman made clear that the Scotland Bill would enable Holyrood to top-up its welfare powers.\nHe said: \"The Scotland Bill delivers the Smith Commission Agreement in full with no vetoes. The Scottish Parliament will be given the power to top-up reserved benefits and no one is going to stand in their way.\"\nDavid Mundell has already indicated that the legislation will be \"substantively\" amended before it is considered further by MPs later this month to change the language in certain areas to ensure that people are assured that the UK Government would not seek to veto any changes Holyrood desired to make.\nThe Scottish Secretary stressed how Whitehall wanted the Scottish Parliament to have the new tax powers available to it at the earliest possible date, April 2017, and that it was now up to the SNP Government to set out its proposals on tax and spend in the run-up to the May 2016 elections.\n\"Everyone in Scotland, even people who voted Yes, wants to see Scotland having tax and spending powers, why wouldn't you?\" declared Mr Mundell.\n\"Obviously, they want to get a fair settlement; we want to get a fair settlement and I'm absolutely sure that that can be achieved.\"\nShare article Confirming that he would be bringing forward \"substantive amendments\" to the Scotland Bill within the next two to three weeks, the Secretary of State added: \"I want to make sure that anybody who is objective will sign off the Bill as meeting the Smith Commission in full; in word and spirit.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-09T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:43:20.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
