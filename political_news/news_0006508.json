Stephano's Fine Art has moved and changed its name and organization: It's now Stephano and Gaines and it's moved to 1916 N. Fillmore, behind the aquamarine blue door. Everybody knows Stephano , Arkansas's answer to Andy Warhol (and a good answer, too). Mike Gaines , who worked as President Clinton's chair of the U.S. Parole Commission and has had other political jobs, is a self-taught watercolorist and sculptor. The gallery website allows as how in 2006 one of his clay sculptures was featured in an episode of \"Kidnapped\" on NBC. Check the new digs and the gallery owners out tonight for Third Thursday in the Heights, 5:30-8:30 p.m. The animal-loving gallerists have also joined up with Out of the Woods Animal Rescue and will be drawing for two tickets to the rescue organization's Woof, Wag and Wine fundraiser 6:30 p.m. Oct. 17 at the old downtown YMCA on Broadway. As ever on Third Thursday, there will also be a drawing for a free giclee of a painting by Louis Beck and L&L Beck Gallery, 5705 Kavanaugh Blvd., at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:48:18.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
