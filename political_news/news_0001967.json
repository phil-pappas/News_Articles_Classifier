Quote: . . . n an email, George Washington University political science Professor Sarah Binder explains that this enables Boehner himself to prevent chaos if his soon-to-be-former colleagues cannot agree on a replacement. Boehner, she notes, could simply stay on as Speaker until the balloting is resolved. At least one of Boehners allies in Congress says that the sitting speaker is likely to do this if necessary. But what if Boehner refuses to serve through a drawn out process to choose his successor  of if he is overthrown in an intraparty coup? Binder points to a provision of the House rules that govern vacancies in the speakership after a speaker has already been elected as a likely solution. As soon as practicable after the election of the Speaker and whenever appropriate thereafter, the Speaker shall deliver to the Clerk a list of Members, this provision provides. The rules add that in the case of a vacancy in the Office of the Speaker, the first name on this list becomes Speaker pro tempore and may exercise such authorities of the Office of Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end. A spokesperson for the House Clerk confirmed to ThinkProgress that Speaker Boehner has delivered such a list of names, and an entry in the Congressional Record also confirms that Boehner delivered the list on January 6. The Clerks office, however, would not reveal who is in line to become speaker pro tempore should the speakership become vacant. A request to the speakers office was not returned as of this writing. . . . If you can't develop a budget for two years, and you can't vote for a new Speaker, why the hell are you collecting American tax dollars for your wages, rent, food, and health care?
