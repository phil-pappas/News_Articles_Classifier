This has not happened. \n\"New Zealand First would remove GST from healthy foods as only this initiative would encourage Kiwi families to choose healthy eating options and lead healthier lifestyles - without burdening poorer New Zealanders with more taxes. \n\"If this is all government can produce in the fight against obesity than they have already lost,\" says Mrs Stewart. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:30:21.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
