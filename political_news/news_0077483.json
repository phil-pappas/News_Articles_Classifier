However, let’s look at Ryan’s positions on 2 main issues which lead to loss of millions of American jobs and reduction of wages:\n1. illegal immigration\n2. free trade agreements, which lead to outsourcing of American jobs.\nIf you read statements of Paul Ryan, he is no different from Obama, Boehner and McConnell. He is for immigration reform, which is a massive amnesty and a huge magnet for more illegal immigration.\nAdditionally, Ryan pushes for TPP, aka Obamatrade, which will send millions of American jobs to countries where workers are paid 50 cents per hour.\nRyan is an establishment. For this reason you should call your congressmen, urge them to vote for Daniel Webster, who represents us, American people, not establishment.\nSecond of all, it is time for Trump to start speaking out about the fact that on the above mentioned issues Ben Carson has establishment views and policies as well. Carson opposes deportation of people who are here illegally. Additionally, Carson never stood up, never spoke up against free trade agreements, such as TPP, which rob us of jobs.\nPlease, spread the word, we need Daniel Webster as the Speaker of the House and Trump as the next US president!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:11:29.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
