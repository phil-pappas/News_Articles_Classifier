He returned to them in Las Vegas on Monday.\nNow a Democratic presidential hopeful, O'Malley was running for Baltimore mayor in 1999. He landed the endorsement from that city's SEIU organization. It was the only labor union that endorsed him in the race, which O'Malley went on to win against two other contenders with wider name recognition.\nThe former Maryland governor spoke Monday at a town hall at the SEIU Local 1107 headquarters about his run for the Democratic nomination. O'Malley's soft spot for the labor organization was on display.\n\"I should have worn my purple tie,\" O'Malley joked, a reference to the union's purple color. \"I apologize for that.\"\nO'Malley, who is polling well behind former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. His big chance to boost his profile will also be in Las Vegas: Democratic presidential candidates will debate Oct. 13 from Wynn Las Vegas on CNN.\n\"Aren't you glad the Democratic Party's finally going to start having debates?\" \"O'Malley said, getting applause from the group of about 70. \"I say it's about time, and let's hope what happens in Vegas doesn't stay in Vegas.\"\nHe outlined policy stances to a receptive audience. They include raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, expanding Social Security and making it easier for people to join labor unions and collectively bargain. He also wants comprehensive immigration reform, with a \"path to full citizenship.\"\nThe SEIU Local 1107 bargains for about 17,000 employees who work in government agencies and health care jobs in Southern Nevada.\nNevada is an early voting state with February caucuses that will play a key role alongside South Carolina, Iowa and New Hampshire in determining who gets the Republican and Democratic nominations.\nIt's attracting a steady flow of candidates. Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida are visiting Southern Nevada this week, too.\nTrump has a Thursday rally planned at TI, and Rubio will do a three-day stretch of events starting Thursday.\nContact Ben Botkin at bbotkin@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2904.
