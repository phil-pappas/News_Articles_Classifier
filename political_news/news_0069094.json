So far, all has been going well but it seems as if there may still be some things to worry about in that not all issues may have been touched upon. It seems as if the biggest issue lies within the fact that the process has been very slow and the bill would only apply to a small group of people. This means that it would not have much of an effect on those that currently need to access medical marijuana through the black market.\nGreens leader, Senator Richard Di Natale, stated on Monday that the Bill to make a regulator for medical marijuana for specific conditions has already been made and would be voted upon by the Senate in November. Sources say that the Bill is even supported by the Prime Minister. Victoria and NSW state governments have made it clear that they would like to legalize medical marijuana, however, a regulation scheme from the federal government is needed in order to issue farmer licenses and permit doctors to prescribe it. Queensland shall “be a kind of offsider, joining in on any ventures the southern states start.”\nThis week’s moves make it clear that the benefits of medical marijuana are copious yet neither the substances nor the supply lines are legalized for those who need these benefits. The moves also restrict those who would be allowed to have it greatly. Basically, the move may be good for years to come, but not for right now. The Victorian Government has promised that they would have set up an Office of Medicinal Cannabis by the end of this year into order to conduct research, develop, and dispense marijuana products through pharmacies to those allowed to receive medical marijuana.", "external_links": ["http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmarijuanastocks.com%2Fcannabis-a-medicine-not-a-drug%2F&linkname=Cannabis%20a%20Medicine%20not%20a%20Drug", "https://www.addtoany.com/share_save", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmarijuanastocks.com%2Fcannabis-a-medicine-not-a-drug%2F&linkname=Cannabis%20a%20Medicine%20not%20a%20Drug", "http://www.addtoany.com/add_to/google_plus?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fmarijuanastocks.com%2Fcannabis-a-medicine-not-a-drug%2F&linkname=Cannabis%20a%20Medicine%20not%20a%20Drug"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:43:21.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
