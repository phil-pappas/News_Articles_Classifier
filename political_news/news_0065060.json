Yet studies show that these populations are more deeply affected by psoriasis than Caucasians, on both a physical and psychological level.\n\"The two emotions I felt after my diagnosis were frustration and embarrassment,\" said Jonathan Scott , a nine-year veteran of the National Football League and featured patient panelist at the congressional briefing. \"By learning more about psoriasis and getting involved with the National Psoriasis Foundation, I gained confidence in myself and my ability to manage the condition. I hope that by spreading awareness of psoriasis among people of color, I can help others in my community feel comfortable in their own skin.\"\nIn addition to Scott, other panelists included Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (TX-30), nationally recognized dermatologist Paul Wallace , M.D., and Amy McMichael , M.D., chair of dermatology at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and the Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity.\n\"Through this congressional briefing and other skin of color efforts, we hope to shine a light on underserved populations in the psoriasis community,\" said Randy Beranek , president and CEO of the National Psoriasis Foundation. \"These efforts will help us meet our goal of dramatically improving health outcomes for all people with psoriatic disease.\"\nFor more information, visit www.psoriasis.org/socbriefing .\nPsoriasis is a chronic, genetic disease of the immune system that appears on the skin, causing it to crack, itch and bleed. It is the most common autoimmune disease in the country, affecting as many as 7.5 million Americans. Up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis, which causes pain and swelling of the joints. If left untreated, psoriatic arthritis can cause irreversible joint damage.\nLearn more at www.psoriasis.org .\nAbout the National Psoriasis Foundation\nThe National Psoriasis Foundation is the world's largest nonprofit organization serving people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
