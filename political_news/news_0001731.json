The program marries education and workforce development so that students can thrive in the corporate world. Participants have successfully completed a rigorous summer session consisting of technical training, including IT essentials and Microsoft Office, combined with interpersonal skills such as public speaking and team building, earning them 12-month part-time positions in meaningful roles within some of the Bay Area's top corporations such as Salesforce, Google, PG&E, and Kaiser Permanente, Okta, San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), and Clif Bar . For their entire senior year, the interns go to school in the morning and then work at these corporations in the afternoon.\nGenesys Works – Bay Area is in its third year of operation. The program has doubled each year, reaching nearly 200 students across Oakland and San Francisco . Over 95% of students who completed the program have gone on to college, with a 100% persistence rate beyond their first year. The organization currently has training centers in San Francisco and Oakland , and will be opening a San Jose office in spring 2016. Previous speakers at Breaking Through have included angel investor Ron Conway and Ed Reiskin , Director of Transportation for SFMTA. The event is sponsored in part by AT&T, PG&E, and Salesforce.\n\"The program works because of our strong alliance with schools and corporations,\" adds Katz. \"Companies are eager to source locally and support our communities, and we provide a young and talented workforce excited to learn and succeed.\"\nAbout Genesys Works\nGenesys Works, established in Houston in 2002 and now with locations in the San Francisco Bay Area , Chicago and Minneapolis/St. Paul , is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization that enables economically disadvantaged high school students to break through barriers and discover through meaningful internships that they can succeed as professionals in the corporate world.\n releases/genesys-works---bay-area-and-local-corporations-celebrate-high-schoolers-success-at-breaking-through-2015-300152128.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genesys-works---bay-area-and-local-corporations-celebrate-high-schoolers-success-at-breaking-through-2015-300152128.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC16896&Transmission_Id=201509301838PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC16896&DateId=20150930", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:36:02.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
