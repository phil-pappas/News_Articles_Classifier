Ronnie Musgrove will get another opportunity to convince a Hinds County chancery judge to order the state to fully fund Mississippi’s local school districts. Hinds County Chancellor William Singletary has scheduled a hearing for 9:30 a.m. Oct. 13 to hear arguments on Musgrove’s motion for the judge reconsider his ruling where he refused to order the Legislature to provide additional funds to the local school districts. The state’s school districts have been underfunded $1.7 billion since 2008 and are underfunded $200 million for the current school year.
