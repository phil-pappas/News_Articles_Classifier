About 300 students, all dressed up, sang and performed several skits.\nThe Xaviers group at 8.30 started the cleanliness drive at Kanyapada, moving from there they went ahead to clean pimpripada and finally the gokuldham market. Ex-student of Xaviers and now a social worker, Mr. Gaurav Sharma, who was a part of the drive said, \"They were so excited! It was amazing to see little kids going around and cleaning the roads. To see them care about the society is a really great feeling.\" On asking why people are so much concerned about the surroundings and cleanliness around us, when it is actually a basic etiquette, he said \"Modiji has connected a lot of people and made the whole drive into a bigger picture. He has changed peoples mentality towards cleanliness. When he said he was chai walla people made a big deal about chaiwallah and respected them. I won't call it herd mentality, but it's like following someone you think will make a huge difference.\" Ryan International started the drive at 11.30. Principal Kavita Hegde said, \"We plan to do this every month. We discuss areas every fortnight and go about cleaning the nearby areas. We don't want this to be just talk and no work kind of a thing. We want to make sure, the project has a lasting effect.\" The program was attended by The NGO Revoluters, singer Ansh Upadyay, and the makers of the movie Singh is Bling. When asked about the reason a film being promoted in such an event, one of the students, Miss Khyati Sharma of 10th std, said \"I guess because celebrities have such a big fan following and they influence people a lot. If they are cleaning the environment, why shouldn't we?\" Xaviers' principal, Mrs. Anju Singh said, \"We have been able to involve the parents and make the children guide their parents about basic cleanliness habits for them to take this seriously. What we do is we make groups of 6, we ask each of the six to make a group of 6 more, including people in their locality etc, so this movement spreads faster.\" On asking about her plans on Gandhi Jayanti, Singh added saying \"It's a holiday tomorrow, but every student has a task to do. They all have to conduct a swach Bharat abhiyaan individually in their societies.\" For more such hyper-local stories visit www.iamin.in", "external_links": ["http://www.iamin.in/"], "published": "2015-10-02T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:25:24.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
