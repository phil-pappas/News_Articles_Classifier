The Washington Post reports there is good news this year from the fronts of the effort to eradicate poverty worldwide.\nThe report says recent estimates from the World Bank predict the number of people living in extreme poverty to drop below 10 percent of the world's population for the first time ever.\nThe World Bank estimates 9.6 percent of the world's population in 2015 is living on less than $1.90 per day, the international poverty line recently updated by the organization. The line is measured in U.S. dollars.\nThe World Bank credits the shift to strong growth in developing countries and ongoing education, health and social safety investments, though it acknowledges circumstances remain dire in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. There is also some concern about the reliability of poverty numbers, which rely mostly on data collected and provided by countries.\nRead the full Washington Post article.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/10/05/for-the-first-time-less-than-10-percent-of-the-world-is-living-in-extreme-poverty-world-bank-says/?tid=sm_fb"], "published": "2015-10-07T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T16:48:02.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
