(Timothy C. Wright/For The Washington Post) October 8 at 5:44 PM Regarding the Oct. 4 editorial “ Jamycheal Mitchell’s ghastly death ”:\nWhy does any person suffering a life-threatening mental-health crisis have to wait for a hospital bed? How can this be acceptable? People suffering other acute illnesses don’t have to wait.\nIf the state hospital was full, why couldn’t Mr. Mitchell have been taken to another hospital with unfilled beds? People committed in our area are routinely transported greater distances than from Hampton Roads to here. And every psychiatric ward has lockdown capabilities: That is what makes them safe for people in the throes of a mental-health crisis.\nAll hospitals receive state and/or federal funds in addition to insurance payments and the exorbitant fees they charge the uninsured, so why isn’t there short-term urgent-care psychiatric space available at each one of them? That should be a minimum standard of health care for the communities they purport to serve. And it would help fill unused beds and generate revenue.\nVirginia’s ongoing failure to provide an adequate level of mental-health care should make all of us in the state ashamed — every citizen, state official, doctor, nurse and hospital administrator. What is hailed as the greatest health-care system in the world effectively and routinely shuts out from care and leaves to die people who are terribly vulnerable and unable to take care of themselves because of an illness over which they have no control.\nPamela Fletcher , Warrenton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:14:32.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
