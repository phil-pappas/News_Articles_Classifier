SB 941 is one of hundreds of bills passed by the Legislature this session that contained an emergency clause, which prevents opponents from forcing a public vote through the referendum process. (Ian Kullgren/Staff) Comments \nSALEM — Rep. Val Hoyle, months after stepping down as House majority leader, is following through with much-discussed plans to run for secretary of state in 2016. \nHoyle, set to formally announce her candidacy Thursday morning, becomes the third high-ranking Democrat to declare for the statewide job — making next May's primary election one of the most interesting and potentially contentious. \n\"I've been inspired by the support I've received to enter this race from people all over Oregon,\" Hoyle said in a statement. \"Oregonians want proven leaders in Salem who will fight for their families every day. They want a Secretary of State who will make sure every voice is heard and every vote is counted. They want someone who won't be afraid to speak up on tough issues. That's how I've spent my life in public service. Now, I'm ready to stand up for all the people of this state.\" \nThe west Eugene lawmaker follows Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian and the Oregon Senate's main budget writer, Richard Devlin . All three are prodigious fundraisers with ties to powerful constituencies. \nDevlin, according to a review of his campaign finance reports, has been lining up support from the state's business community. Avakian and Hoyle, on the other hand, will spar for the imprimatur of Oregon's labor movement, a traditional source of campaign cash and support for Democratic politicians. \nHoyle served as House Democrats' chief fundraiser and vote-enforcer. During the past legislative session, she helped revive a Republican lawmaker's proposal for on-demand birth control prescriptions at pharmacies. She also said she'd lead a work group tackling ethics reforms ahead of next February's short legislative session. \nHer support for legislation this year requiring background checks for all private gun sales in Oregon earned her the ire of gun-rights advocates , including a failed recall attempt. \nHoyle's announcement comes days before the candidates are set to gather for a long-planned debate at Oregon Democrats' 2015 meeting in Sunriver. They'll be back on stage next weekend for a debate during the Oregon AFL-CIO's annual convention in Seaside. Three top Democrats are running for secretary of state next year: Rep. Val Hoyle of Eugene, left, Sen. Richard Devlin of Tualatin, center, and Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian. Denis C. Theriault | The Oregonian/OregonLive \nThe position has taken on a higher profile in the wake of Gov. John Kitzhaber's resignation: Whoever holds the job is first in line to succeed a governor who leaves office. Then-Secretary of State Kate Brown took over for Kitzhaber on Feb. 18. \nThe office also oversees the state's elections system, auditors and corporation registry, among other roles. And the secretary of state sits on the State Land Board, which weighs the fate of natural resources including Oregon's forests, coastal lands and rivers. \nHoyle has raised nearly $197,000 this year, much of it since the legislative session ended in July — and about when she announced she'd be exploring a run for statewide office. Lawmakers aren't allowed to raise campaign cash when they're in session. \n\"I believe that I can make a difference as secretary of state by expanding our citizens' access to government, fighting for small businesses throughout Oregon and increasing participation in our elections at all levels,\" Hoyle said in a statement in July. \nShe's actually outraised both of her rivals — helped by allies including House Speaker Tina Kotek , D-Portland, who gave Hoyle $1,000 from her own campaign account. But Hoyle still has just $107,000 on hand to spend. Devlin has $295,000 , while Avakian has $180,000 . \nHoyle stepped down as majority leader in part to free herself from having to help her caucus raise cash. She gave up a monthly stipend from House Democrats' campaign committee, Future PAC, for doing that work. \nHoyle was the first legislative caucus leader to receive such a payment. Current House Majority Leader Jennifer Williamson , D-Portland, also receives a stipend. \nShe also has business experience, working for two Oregon bicycle manufacturing companies. \nRepublican Sid Leiken, also from Lane County, is the only other candidate from a major party who has announced for secretary of state. \n— Denis C.
