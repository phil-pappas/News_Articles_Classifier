We’ve got you covered. \nJohn Kasich will unveil a plan today in New Hampshire for the first 100 days in office should he be elected president. \n“I’m going to be introducing a very, very large plan to resuscitate the country,” Kasich said “No one has done this.” \nHere’s some of what you can expect from the plan, according to Dispatch Public Affairs Editor Darrel Rowland who has been traveling with the governor this week. \n“The proposal will revamp taxes in a way that he already knows will be criticized as helping the rich. It increases defense spending while holding the line on other federal outlays and hiring,” Rowland writes. “The plan would shift the responsibility – and funding – for a variety of programs such as  education from the federal government to states. It will espouse energy independence and fair trade deals that are enforced. A new ‘common sense court’ will be set up to hear appeals on federal regulations, which will be pared.” \nYou can watch the roll out live at 10:30 a.m. \n*** \nFrom the inbox : Kasich used Tuesday night’s Democratic presidential debate as a way to fundraise, sending this message out, “In last evening's Democrat debate, Hillary Clinton was asked who she's most proud to have as an enemy and her response was ‘the Republicans.’ If she's elected President, how does she expect to get anything done at all if she views Republicans as her enemies? Americans are sick of the division in this country and a continuation of the Obama-legacy of partisan politics will only further prevent us from finding solutions to our biggest challenges. We should stop demonizing others for having different opinions.” \n*** \nWhat he said on Clinton while in N.H. “I’ve gotta tell you, that’s a disgrace. That is a D-I-S-G-R-A-C-E, got it? I don’t ever want to brag about the fact that I can’t get along with people. I want to talk about putting the country together again. Do you want the election that badly? If that’s how badly you want it, you shouldn’t have it.” \n*** \nSpeaking of fundraising : Today is the deadline for campaign finance reports meaning we will find out how much Kasich’s official campaign raised. This is the first look at the fundraising for the official campaign - not his super PAC New Day for America. \n*** \nICYMI : U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and Ohio Rep Sean O’Brien - both Democrats - are off to Cuba along with business officials, the Youngstown Vindicator reports . \n“The itinerary includes meeting with U.S. diplomats at the American embassy, visiting an economic development zone, discussing the legalities of foreign investments, going to small businesses owned by private investors and state-owned retail shops.” \n*** \nDeath penalty : “Former Ohio Supreme Court Justice Evelyn Lundberg Stratton still supports the death penalty, but now believes it is ‘inefficient, ineffective and a great burden on our society,’” Dispatch reporter Alan Johnson writes. “Stratton, a Republican who served on the court from 1996 to 2012, testified Wednesday in support of a bipartisan bill that would ban the execution of people with diagnosed serious mental illness at the time of their crimes.” \n*** \nPolice benefits : “The families of volunteer and part-time police officers who are killed or seriously injured in the line of duty would be eligible for benefits under a bill passed unanimously by the Senate on Wednesday,” Dispatch reporter Jim Siegel writes. “Sen. Frank LaRose, R-Copley, a prime sponsor of the bill, said he was alerted to the issue by police officers in his district who noted that the families of full-time officers qualify for benefits when they are hurt or killed, but part-time and volunteer officers do not.” \n*** \nIn Columbus politics : “Franklin County Sheriff Zach Scott wants to tie his opponent in the Columbus mayor’s race, City Council President Andrew J. Ginther, to failing to uncover fraud in a federal tutoring program almost a decade ago. Ginther’s camp shot back that Scott has become ‘desperate,’” Dispatch reporter Bill Bush writes. \n*** \nMayoral debate : Ginther and Scott squared off for another debate Wednesday night. \n“For much of the mayoral debate held Wednesday night at All Saints Academy on Livingston Avenue, Zach Scott slammed his opponent Andy Ginther, blaming a host of problems on the city council president,” Dispatch reporter Rick Rouan writes. “For his part, Ginther mostly ignored the jabs and stuck to listing his successes as councilman and plans to build on them.” \n*** \nOn this day : From the Dispatch library, on this day in 2008, “Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden holds a rally at the Lancaster campus of Ohio University.” \n*** \nVoters Guide : Early voting has started in Ohio and you can see what will be on your ballot with The Dispatch's Voters Guide. \n*** \nGet the news in your inbox : Did you hear we have a Dispatch Politics email?
