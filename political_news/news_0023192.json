The move comes days after it emerged that his fundraising juggernaut was slowing, amid concerns that the former Florida governor was failing to resonate with voters in the early primary states. More Puerto Rico risks ‘humanitarian crisis’ \n“It’s another sign that Jeb Bush has utterly failed to be the ‘shock and awe’ candidate,” said Larry Sabato, a politics expert at the University of Virginia. “I still don’t rule him out, but he needs for events to fall just his way in order to secure a reversal of fortune. In a field this large, that is a Herculean task or the equivalent of a big lotto win.” \nAllie Brandenburger, a Bush spokeswoman, said the campaign was “moving our resources into the states to ensure that voters in primary and caucus states are introduced to his record and vision for the future”. \nAccording to the memo, Mr Bush is shifting resources to New Hampshire, the second state to vote in the primaries and one that is crucial for him to remain a viable candidate. The move comes as he polls third in the state with an average of 9 per cent, well behind Donald Trump , the real estate mogul, who has 27 per cent and Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has 15 per cent. \nWhile Mr Bush languishes in New Hampshire, his position in the state is still much stronger than his national standing where he remains 20 points behind Mr Trump in fifth place. He also trails Mr Carson, Marco Rubio, the Cuban-American senator, and Ted Cruz, the firebrand senator from Texas. \nThe former Florida governor, who is seeking to become the third member of his family to become president, had been seen by Republican elites as their best chance to take the White House as a centrist with appeal to independent voters. But Mr Bush has run a lacklustre campaign and struggled to respond to effective jibes from Mr Trump that he is “low-energy”. It’s another sign that Jeb Bush has utterly failed to be the ‘shock and awe’ candidate \n- Larry Sabato at University of Virginia \nLast week, the Bush campaign revealed it had raised $13m between July and September. While that was the second best total in the 15-member field after Mr Carson, it was a significant slowing from the first quarter when he raised $11m in just two weeks after he announced his candidacy. It was also a poor performance given that Mr Bush has a wealthy network created by his brother and father. \nOutside groups such as Right To Rise, an organisation run by a former top Bush strategist, raised more than $100m in the first six months of the year. But campaign finance rules preclude such organisations from co-ordinating with the campaign or spending money on costs such as personnel. \nJuleanna Glover, a Republican strategist backing Mr Bush, said it was “totally predictable” that campaigns have ups and downs. She said that when voters came closer to making a decision, they would look at the three candidates who were credible presidential nominees — Mr Bush, John Kasich, the Ohio governor, and Mr Rubio — and not Mr Trump. She said Mr Bush’s low poll numbers were similar to Mr Rubio and Mr Kasich, underscoring how the mainstream candidates were being drowned out by the current frontrunners. \nLast month, Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor who had been viewed as the main rival to Mr Bush, dropped out of the race because of money problems. His departure and Mr Bush’s struggle underscores the frustration at establishment politicians that has driven the Republican and Democratic race. Hillary Clinton , the frontrunner in the Democratic race, is facing an unexpectedly strong challenge from Bernie Sanders, a Vermont socialist. \nThe Bush campaign move comes at the end of a good week for Mrs Clinton, the former secretary of state. Her campaign welcomed the decision by Joe Biden , the vice-president, not to enter the race. On Thursday, Mrs Clinton endured an 11-hour congressional grilling into the 2012 attack on a US diplomatic compound in Libya. \nSeparately this week, Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island governor, and Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator, both dropped out of the Democratic race, leaving Mrs Clinton to compete against Mr Sanders and Martin O’Malley, the former Baltimore mayor who barely registers in the polls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:04:05.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
