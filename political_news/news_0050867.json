Paul Ryan is the Washington Establishment's/Chamber of Commerce's man! As Speaker of the House he will single handedly control what legislation moves forward! See: Why The Speakership Matters  The Speaker of the House is one of the most powerful positions in our government. The duties of the Speaker include, but are not limited to, appointing members to various committees, deciding when a bill will be introduced and to what committee it will be assigned, ruling on points of order, controlling the flow of debate and calling for the vote. This means that whatever party holds the majority, and therefore the Speakership, has serious control over what legislation moves forward and what gets blocked, what gets funded and what doesnt. This is why the Chamber of Commerce and the Club for Growth are doing everything they can to get Ryan to be Speaker! JWK To support Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House is to support our Global Governance Crowd and their FAST TRACK, WTO, NAFTA, GATT, CAFTA, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, all used to circumvent America First trade policies, while fattening the fortunes of international corporate giants who have no allegiance to America or any nation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:49:46.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
