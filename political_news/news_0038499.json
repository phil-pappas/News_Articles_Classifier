As in past years, it is likely that far too few students from African-American and Latino communities will wind up attending the eight test-in schools that use the SHSAT for admission.\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. Through innovative outreach and test preparation programs, greater diversity at the city’s top high schools can be achieved — without throwing out the SHSAT as the sole criterion for admission. But it requires money and political will to make it happen.\nThe Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation, which I head, has prepared a $3.9 million proposal for city and state lawmakers to address the underrepresentation of African-American and Latino students at the specialized high schools. This relatively modest sum would:\n— Create a proactive information and outreach program at elementary and middle school levels in underrepresented communities to educate students and families about the specialized high schools and the SHSAT.\n— Level the playing field by providing free SHSAT test preparation to students attending underrepresented middle schools, providing thousands of additional students the opportunity to achieve.\n— Implement “Middle School Pipeline” programs at each specialized high school to take kids from underrepresented middle schools and give them a taste of what the specialized schools have to offer in order to educate and excite them about these schools.\nWith the support of National Grid, my alumni foundation has run a pilot STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) Pipeline program for nearly three years at Brooklyn Tech. We reach out to underrepresented middle schools, meaning schools that do not send any, or send very few, students to specialized high schools.\nTwenty-six of the first 30 students completing our year-long program were admitted to Tech or Stuyvesant, with the remaining four going to excellent non-test-in schools. Half the students entering Tech from our first cohort were African-American or Latino.\nSome advocates of greater diversity believe that the test should be eliminated as the sole determinant, and replaced with a mix of criteria, including subjective ones. But that would open up admissions to outside influences and undermine the real value of these schools in preparing working-class kids for successful futures in the economy of tomorrow.\nA study this spring by NYU’s Research Alliance for City Schools found that dropping the SHSAT in favor of multiple criteria could backfire and make the schools less diverse. Student bodies at the city’s top high schools using subjective criteria have lower percentages of students receiving free and subsidized lunch, a real measure of poverty.\nWe know there are talented students from underrepresented communities who can do the work. But over the years, the school system has failed to invest the resources needed to provide enriched coursework and prepare them for the test and the schools’ rigorous curriculum.\nThis neglect starts at a young age. At least four local city school districts still do not offer elementary-school gifted and talented programs. And too many schools in underrepresented communities don’t even inform parents of the SHSAT’s existence or encourage students to register.\nMayor de Blasio is stepping up with a commitment to ensure that all kids get computer science and on-time algebra. Along with expanding pre-kindergarten to every child in the city, the mayor is clearly committed to getting kids off on the right track. But time is needed for these efforts to work.\nThat is why city and state leaders, and all who care about the future of our city, must commit to increasing opportunities for children from every neighborhood and every demographic. Don’t do away with the test; get more kids ready for it.\nCary, a Manhattan lawyer, is president of the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:16:38.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
