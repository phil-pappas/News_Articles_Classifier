That shows I can keep the Republican Party together. Maybe they should send me the House caucus to try to help them with that.\" \n\"And of all the people on that stage, I guarantee you, George, you'd agree with this, no one has been more tested than me. No one.\" \nYes, it's so incredibly trying to be a right-wing bully in the state of New Jersey. \nStephanopoulos then asked Christie about the insider-versus-outsider nature of the GOP primaries, and where Christie was set apart in the insider group. \nIn typical Christie-esque form, he claimed he was an outsider in his own state. Sure he is. And then came the list of ways he's destroyed public workers' lives in New Jersey. After noting that each veto had been sustained, he claimed that he, and only he could keep the GOP united. \nPersonally, I'd invite him to jump off the George Washington Bridge instead of the Brooklyn Bridge. It's far more appropriate. Barring that, the next best option would be for him to drop out of this race.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:07:00.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
