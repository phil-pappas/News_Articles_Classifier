She is expected to plead guilty and cooperate with prosecutors.\nHer cohorts and former employers, Gary Solomon and Thomas Vranas, owners of The SUPES Academy and Synesi Associates, also were charged.\nIn 2012, Mayor Rahm Emanuel picked Byrd-Bennett to lead Chicago’s predominantly African-American school system after a school strike pushed out Jean-Claude Brizard.\nApparently, Byrd-Bennett wasn’t in the seat for even one hot minute before she figured out a way to grow her hefty six-figure salary with a kickback scheme.\nSome of the responsibility for this breach falls on the Chicago Board of Education for not challenging Byrd-Bennett’s request to give a former employee millions in no-bid contracts in the first place.\nIt’s also fair to knock Emanuel for missing the red flags these deals should have raised.\nWhere were his watchdogs?\nThe mayor has the last word on what’s happening with CPS. Byrd-Bennett’s indictment shows he took his eyes off the prize.\nObviously, Byrd-Bennett, 66, is the biggest culprit. She has been in the education business a long time. This isn’t a case of her not knowing the legal boundaries.\nAccording to the feds, Byrd-Bennett actually discussed kickbacks in detailed emails.\nIn Chicago, she will be remembered for two things: for closing 50 schools and for telling an ex-boss the authorities say also was involved in the scheme: “I have tuition to pay and casinos to visit.”\nThat certainly doesn’t sound like someone who cares about her own reputation or the affairs of a school district that was headed toward bankruptcy.\nWhile Byrd-Bennett is the first Chicago schools CEO to be charged with corruption, we’ve seen the dynamics for this kind of corruption play out before.\nIn 1996, James Harney, a former administrator, was convicted of taking kickbacks from four construction companies.\nPeople were outraged, in part because Harney siphoned off already-scarce resources at a time Chicago’s dilapidated school buildings were making headlines.\nObviously, the mayor can’t do anything about personal greed. But he can make it harder for potential grafters by sending a clear message that everyone is going to be held accountable.\nIn this instance, the mayor’s appointed school board treated his appointed schools chief like she could do no wrong.\nThe indictment gives proponents of an elected school board an even stronger argument.\nSadly, Byrd-Bennett, who was in a position to inspire parents and ensure that public school children get better educational opportunities, turned out to be just another taker.\nFollow @MaryMitchellCST\nTweets by @MaryMitchellCST", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MaryMitchellCST"], "published": "2015-10-10T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:07:31.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
