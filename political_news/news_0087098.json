The previous estimate for August's jobs increase was adjusted downward from 173,000 to 136,000. That was a surprise, as the Labor Department's first estimate for August employment is typically adjusted upward.\nUnemployment was 5.1 percent, unchanged from August, and average hourly private-sector earnings were down a penny. In August they were up 8 cents.\nThe slippage makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates later this month, or possibly even in December. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said she expects an interest-rate hike by year's end, and most analysts expected that to occur when the Fed's Open Markets Committee met Dec. 15-16.\nBut Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Richmond Fed, told The Wall Street Journal Thursday that a hike might come earlier, when the committee meets Oct. 27-28. Such an outcome is more difficult to imagine now.\nAnalysts had predicted the creation of about 203,000 jobs, an unemployment rate of 5.1 percent and an increase in hourly earnings of 0.2 percent, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists . The payroll company ADP estimated Wednesday, based on its own records, that September job growth in the private sector was 200,000, up from its August calculation of 190,000.\nThe jobs report followed news last week from the Commerce Department that GDP increased 3.9 percent during the second quarter of 2015, a small improvement over its previous second-quarter estimate of 3.7 percent and a large one over the first quarterâ€™s 0.6 percent growth.\nBut other economic news has been less favorable. Analysts expect a slowdown in the third quarter, with the Atlanta Fed forecasting a GDP growth rate of 0.9 percent. The Commerce Department's first cut at estimating third quarter growth will be released Oct. 29.\nAnother unfavorable sign of the economy's course: Labor force participation dropped further to 62.4 percent, down from the 62.6 percent.rate that prevailed in June, July and August, which was already its lowest level since the 1970s.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://bloomberg.econoday.com/byshoweventfull.asp?fid=467001&cust=bloomberg-us&year=2015&lid=0&prev=/byweek.asp#top", "https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx?panel=1", "http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm", "http://www.adpemploymentreport.com/2015/September/NER/NER-September-2015.aspx", "http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20150924a.htm", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/richmond-feds-lacker-says-october-rate-rise-possible-1443710708"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:21:52.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
