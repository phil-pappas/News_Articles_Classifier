Therefore, according to Yahoo News , the Afghan government launched its counter-offensive on Oct. 1, Thursday. The Afghan troops then fought since the battles with the city's insurgents.\nLike Us on Facebook\nWhile the fight was on to retake the city, a United States airstrike has destroyed a hospital that is ran by Doctors Without Borders on Oct. 3, which killed at least 22 people. A fact-finding mission was called on by the international charity yesterday to determine if the strike violated the Geneva Conventions, as reported by CTV News .\nPresident Ashraf Ghani's spokesman, Zafar Hashemi, said that some enemy elements are still scattered and remained in residential areas of Kunduz, hiding, as operations still continue to clear the Taliban fighters from the city. This will certainly slow down the speed of the Afghan military operations as they prioritize the safety of the civilians.\nThe spokesman also added that Ghani has ordered to continue the operations to clean up the city totally as well as the province and the northeastern region of Taliban fighters. The latter seized control of the city of Kunduz for three days last week, and after sealing the mining and city roads, they looted and burned some businesses and government buildings and also harassed the human rights workers and journalists.\nThe Afghan national flag, after taking the city back, is then flying over the main square. Shops have opened again and people's lives begin to return to normal. Also, the main roads toward the east and south have opened and the traffic has started to flow.\nThe Public Health Ministry adviser, Qamirudin Sediqi, noted that medical supplies are also being delivered to Kunduz airport aboard military flights to send medical aid to other parts of the country that was affected by the battle.\nTag: Kunduz Afghan troops doctors without borders Taliban insurgents Geneva Conventions ", "external_links": ["http://news.yahoo.com/afghan-official-troops-hold-kunduz-square-calm-returns-084136121.html", "https://www.facebook.com/Chinatopix", "http://trends.revcontent.com/serve.js.php?w=3369&t=", "http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/afghanistan-troops-regain-control-of-kunduz-square-officials-1.2599192", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/F5cVnEYQ1d8"], "published": "2015-10-08T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:46:37.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
