The program provides $45 million in scholarships to D.C. students from low-income families to attend private schools. It is strongly opposed by most Democrats, including President Barack Obama, who has tried to defund the voucher program several times. On the House floor today, Boehner likened the program to \"the little engine that could.\"\n\"Yes, this issue is personal to me — it has been for a long time,\" Boehner said. \"But frankly, it ought to be personal to every single member of this body. Those of us who live here, who make a good living — we owe something to the kids in this town.\"\nDemocrats laid into the program during floor debate, saying the bill is an affront on home rule for the District and attacking Republicans for wanting to pay for it while cutting $2 billion from education in their proposed spending bill earlier this year.\nBoehner's last fight with Obama By Maggie Severns\n\"This bill prioritizes an ideological agenda over the rights of D.C. residents to self-govern,\" said Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.), a former teacher.\nRepublicans shot back at the jabs during the heated debate.\nDemocrats \"know it’s working, and they could never look those parents in the eye and take it away,\" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said.\nA federal study of the program's effectiveness found \"no conclusive evidence\" vouchers had an effect on student achievement, but voucher students did graduate at higher rates than students in public schools.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20104018/pdf/20104018.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-21T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:17:23.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
