This builds on New Zealand’s total investment of $18 million since 2009 to support the development on Niue’s tourism sector. \n\"Since New Zealand began supporting tourism in Niue six years ago, tourism numbers have more than doubled and visitor expenditure is up by approximately 90 per cent. \n\"This latest expansion will accommodate an average increase of 2000 visitors per year to the Matavai, which in turn will bring almost $1million in extra revenue to Niue annually. \n\"The investment will also contribute to the Niuean Government’s target of growing tourism by 10 per cent per year, and its goal of long-term economic sustainability,\" Mr McCully says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:16:02.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
