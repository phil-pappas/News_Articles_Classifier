Linebaugh decided a few weeks ago to hold off on his retirement. “It’s often been said justice delayed is justice denied,” Linebaugh said. “There’s a lot of truth to that.”In his corner chambers overlooking his native York County, Linebaugh said one judge resigned, another is about to and one more will be on active duty come November for a year. While the county has a compliment of 15 judges, if Linebaugh were to leave there would only be 11 on board. “We’re not following that far behind, but there’s a crisis looming,” said Linebaugh. The president judge said he’s completely comfortable with putting his retirement plans of fishing and family on hold because he loves his position. As well, sticking around a little longer on the bench could help out the other judges who deal with thousands of cases each year. “I’m very concerned for all the other judges who just working incredibly hard, that’s really what the problem is,” Linebaugh said. “I’m not sure how long they can continue at this pace with the caseload they have.”Elections in November could add a judge as well as any appointments Governor Tom Wolf would make. Linebaugh said Wolf has yet to make any appointments. CBS 21 News contacted the governor’s office and have not heard back.The less judges could impact cases for the public, too, said Linebaugh. “As quickly as your lawyer wants the case to move through the system, it should be able to move through the system,” Linebaugh said. “We're getting to the point where that can't be done.”Linebaugh would have to retire in two years in the eyes of the law. The constitution states a 70-year-old judge becomes “constitutionally incompetent” at that point, said Linebaugh.
