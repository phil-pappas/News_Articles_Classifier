(Photo: John Locher/AP) \nExactly 100 days ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Democratic presidential candidates and their throngs of supporters will descend on Des Moines to see if the party's signature event will reshape the race. \nThe Iowa Democratic Party’s annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner has historically marked a point of divergence — signifying the final push to caucus night and the milestone where some candidacies pulled ahead and others fell back. \nThe “JJ” is Iowa’s largest gathering of Democrats. More than 6,000 tickets have already been sold, said Sam Lau, communications director for the state party. \nHe said much of that audience represents the party’s core, people who are enthusiastic and who are likely to caucus for a Democrat on Feb. 1. \n“They’re coming to that point where they’re starting to really firm up their decisions on who to caucus for,” Lau said. “And it’s an incredible opportunity for all of our candidates to really make their case to very passionate Democrats — Democrats who are excited, who are engaged.” \nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee will speak. \n7 p.m. Saturday: Follow live coverage and video at DesMoinesRegister.com/JJDinner . \nFormer Virginia Sen. Jim Webb announced Tuesday he would withdraw from the race for the Democratic nomination and instead will explore a bid as an independent. He also withdrew from the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner . \nHere’s a look at seven questions Iowa Democrats are asking ahead of Saturday’s dinner — questions they hope will be answered at the JJ.
