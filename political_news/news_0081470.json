These gains continue the longest streak on record of private sector job growth-now at 67 months-while the unemployment rate is at its lowest since 2008.\n\"The overall outlook for the year remains positive, but it is clear from this month's numbers that our economy is still in recovery mode and we must continue to push forward policies that prioritize job creation and the middle class. The September jobs numbers should remind Congress that we cannot afford another shutdown of government-a partisan distraction that would cost our nation billions and would furlough thousands of individuals across the country.\n\"We only narrowly averted a shutdown this week. Now, as we turn towards the next budget deadline, I urge my colleagues to come to the table and prioritize passing a long-term budget agreement that invests in hard-working Americans and will sustain the economic growth we have experienced over the last several years.\"\n releases/congressman-fattah-statement-on-september-jobs-report-300153405.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/congressman-fattah-statement-on-september-jobs-report-300153405.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC18583&Transmission_Id=201510021142PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC18583&DateId=20151002", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:16:51.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
