But he added: “Devolution to the region will only be successful if it involves broad and effective engagement with business, and we expect meaningful conversations to begin on this matter as soon as possible.” \nThe deals, which cover the North East Combined Authority area and Tees Valley, are expected to prove controversial among many in the Labour party as they require the creation of elected mayors. \nNick Brown, the Labour MP for Newcastle East and a former minister for the north-east, called for the ballot paper in a future mayoral election to offer the option to vote “No”. He dismissed the move as “a lot of talk and no effective action”. \n“The power to borrow more money and to tax ourselves more isn’t what is needed to solve the problems that the region faces — above all, the need to stimulate private sector investment in the north-east of England,” he said. \nTortuous negotiations to achieve the deals, particularly in the North East Combined Authority area, have also highlighted the difficulty of agreeing radical change. In 2004, the north-east voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to reject a regional assembly, with voters fearing that it would merely be an expensive talking shop. \nThe region’s experience of elected mayors has been mixed; it currently has two — in North Tyneside and Middlesbrough — but Hartlepool scrapped the system.
