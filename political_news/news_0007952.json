At today’s luncheon, he also will be part of a panel discussing the utility of the forum.\n“It’s to remind the community why O.C. Forum exists,” said Nancy Dooley, the event’s executive director since its inception.\nThe other scheduled panelists are former county Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez and Orange County Register publisher Richard Mirman. The Register is the founding sponsor of the forum.\nThe luncheon begins at 11:30 a.m. at the Hilton Irvine, 18800 MacArthur Blvd. Tickets are $125 at the door.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:19:43.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
