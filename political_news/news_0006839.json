(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File) By MARY CLARE JALONICK The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nHouse Speaker John Boehner may not be popular enough with House Republicans to keep his job, but he has a lot of admirers on Capitol Hill — many of whom stood in a long line to get a last photo with him Friday. \nAround 300 staffers and other Capitol employees waited in a queue that stretched from Statuary Hall into the Rotunda. Boehner is stepping down next week after announcing his resignation amid GOP turmoil. \n\"It shows his gratitude to staff, that he is willing to take the time to do this,\" said Tom Brandt, an aide to Rep. Lynn Jenkins, R-Kan. Brandt said he is the son of a bar owner like Boehner. \nThe crowd was bipartisan — even House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif., herself a former speaker, cut in line to get a photo. \nMany waiting for a photo were Capitol Hill support staff. Anthony Thompson builds and repairs furniture for House offices and has worked in the Capitol for 34 years. He says he's a Democrat but has always respected Boehner. \nThompson said no other House speakers have made a similar gesture on their way out. \n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" he said. \n____ \nLosing a sports bet forced Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to pay tribute to the New York Mets on the House floor — in song. \n\"Meet the Mets, step right up and greet the Mets,\" Schiff crooned on Friday, a bit off-key after his Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Mets in baseball's playoffs. \n\"Mr. Speaker, please tell me my time has expired,\" Schiff pleaded with the presiding officer in hopes of ending the ordeal. \nSchiff and Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., had made a wager on the series that involved gourmet popcorn, bagels and the requirement that the loser toast the winning team on the House floor. \nSchiff got in a dig at New York's other baseball team at the end of his remarks. \n\"Thank God the Mets are going to the World Series and not the Yankees,\" he said.
