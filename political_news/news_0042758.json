If we want to honor this day, let that 100 go back to Washington and gather 400 more, and together, pledge to make it their mission to restore that law this year.\"\nThat is part of a principle of \"allowing eligible voters to cast ballots, [which] is central to our democracy,\" Earnest said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Florida Senate votes to remove Confederate flag from seal The new seal will replace the Confederate flag with the flags of ally nations, including France and Spain.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 10/19/15 5:31 PM \"We should be able to build bipartisan support\" for measures that protect the franchise and strengthen the Voting Rights Act, Earnest said. \"We hope that both Democrats and Republicans in Alabama, and every other state in the country, can live up to that principle.\"\nTop Story Bill Clinton to campaign in Iowa His   event where   Perry.\nBy Ariel Cohen • 10/19/15 2:28 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:59:43.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
