Photo: Fabien Baron\nRei Kawakubo is one of the most rarely photographed designers around, and Grace Coddington tends to stay behind the camera (though she was one of the stars of our latest Fashion Issue shoot with Rachel Feinstein ). However, the Comme des Garçons designer and the legendary stylist are starring in a portfolio in the October issue of Interview magazine, as part of a 60-page portfolio shot by the magazine's editorial director Fabien Baron and styled by Karl Templer.
