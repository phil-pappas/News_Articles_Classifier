The charities mission is to speak for abused and neglected children in the juvenile dependency process. Over 300 women gathered and supported this important cause at the beautiful home of Vikas and Sonia Ghai in Bakersfield, California . Guests were treated to world class wine, delectable hor d'oeuvres, shopped the latest shoes, accessories and walked the runway in a stunning Macy's fashion show.\nhttp://www.starlettos.com/\nAs a marquee vendor, and supported by the WWS Shoe Guys, Starlettos provided an interactive experience for the stilettos enthusiasts. Each of the women was excited and ready to step into their heel protectors, to prevent them from sinking into the grass, thanks to Starlettos. Multiple heel sizes were accommodated by the one size fits all product , which was an instant hit and further enhanced their stride. The ladies expressed gratitude and relief for the ability to enjoy the afternoon without hindering their grassy experience.
