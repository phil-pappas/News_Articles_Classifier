Jeanne Shaheen, released a statement Monday after Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan announced she would challenge U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. for her Senate seat, and not run for re-election. “As a mother, advocate and small business owner, I understand how important it is to meet the challenges facing working families and small businesses in New Hampshire,” Shaheen said in the statement. “And I’m grateful to those who are urging me to take on that fight and run for governor.” Until she makes her decision, Shaheen said she’ll continue her work “raising awareness about juvenile diabetes and helping families and kids like mine confront this challenge.” Shaheen was in California Monday promoting her book “Elle & Coach: Diabetes, the Fight for My Daughter's Life, and the Dog Who Changed Everything,” about her daughter’s struggles with diabetes. Shaheen in the statement praised Hassan, saying, “Gov. Hassan has made New Hampshire a better place to live, work and raise a family. She’ll be a great United States senator and New Hampshire will continue to benefit from her leadership and tireless dedication.” Shaheen first told the Portsmouth Herald she was considering a run for governor after being asked to by supporters. “I told the folks that asked me that I would think about it,” Shaheen said at the time. She told the Portsmouth Herald the top issue facing the state is “how we continue to expand the economy.” Other top issues include “how New Hampshire is going to address the heroin epidemic that’s ravaging our state and the debate over Medicaid expansion,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:36:58.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
