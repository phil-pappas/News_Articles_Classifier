Assault occurred near a bar, alcohol is believed to be a factor.\n— Sacramento Police (@SacPolice) October 8, 2015 Air Force Times reported that police initially treated the attack as a homicide because they didn't expect Stone to survive.\nIn August, Stone was one of three Americans who stopped a heavily armed gunman on a Paris-bound train, potentially saving hundreds of lives. Moroccan Ayoud El Khazzani had an AK-47, a lugar pistol, a box cutter and several hundred rounds of ammunition, according to Air Force reports.\nStone charged Khazzani, tackling him to the ground and knocking the would-be gunman unconscious before anyone was killed. Despite injuring his own thumb during the attack, Stone provided medical aid to a French passenger who had been shot after subduing the gunman.\nTwo other Americans also helped to stop the gunman: Oregon National Guardsman Spc.
