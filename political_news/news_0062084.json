It makes their mission of shaping a memorable passenger experience all the more personal – and worthy of recognition.\nThe Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) , with airlines and companies around the globe to improve passengers' air travel experience at every step of their journey, is proud to announce a new awards program that will shine a light on the industry's unsung heroes. The APEX Heart Awards will single out the individuals or airline team members who go above and beyond to elevate the air passenger experience.\n\"From the ground up, the people behind the airlines work tirelessly to deliver comfort, peace of mind and a memorable passenger experience; this award is for them,\" said Joe Leader , APEX CEO. \"As the industry's flagship organization devoted to the full passenger experience, APEX is proud to recognize these outstanding individuals.\"\nAPEX provides a unique global forum for the world's leading airlines, top industry suppliers, government organizations, major media groups and related industry leaders to delve deep into the evolving needs of air passengers.

Recognizing major industry and airline accomplishments has long been at the heart of the APEX mission, serving as a crucial incentive to keep improving. But the APEX Hearts program is the first of its kind for the industry.\n\"When a flight attendant goes out of his way to console a nervous flyer during turbulence, or if he takes heroic actions to help a sick or injured passenger, he's not doing it for any kind of recognition. He's acting out of pure compassion,\" Leader said. \"It's time we show airline team members that we see and appreciate their efforts.\"\nWhat Are the Criteria for Silver and Gold APEX Heart Awards?\nSilver Heart Awards: Exemplary everyday actions, above-and-beyond courtesies and outstanding services Gold Heart Awards: Gestures that require a significant change in routine, powerful actions that evoke a strong emotional response from the general public and outright heroics that keep passengers safe. *All stories will be validated by mainstream media sources.\n­­­­For more information about the awards program or about APEX in general, please contact Robin Applebaum at rapplebaum@apex.aero .\nAbout The Airline Passenger Experience (APEX)\nAPEX encompasses a network of businesses and professionals that are committed to providing a world-class airline experience for passengers around the globe.
