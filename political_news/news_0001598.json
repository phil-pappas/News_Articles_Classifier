Total Views World came to know of Modi after Godhra: Shiv Sena The Shiv Sena on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comments condemning the Dadri lynching, saying that \"the world came to know of him because of Godhra\" and \"we respect him for that\". The Shiv Sena was referring to the 2002 communal riots in Gujarat that took place when Modi was chief minister. Modi had called the Dadri killing “saddening and unfortunate”, but said the central government had no responsibility in the matter. Senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut then said Modi had spoken not as the man they knew, but as the prime minister. Both the Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party, who are allies in the Maharashtra government, tried to downplay Raut's comments later in the day. Central government to declassify Netaji files Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced that confidential files related to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose will be declassified by the central government from January 23, 2016, the 118th birth anniversary of the leader, whose disappearance 70 years ago still remains a mystery. Modi made the announcement after meeting 35 members of Bose's family in New Delhi on Wednesday. The prime minister added that he would personally write to foreign governments in possession of any files on Netaji, urging them to declassify the documents. According to Bose's family, secret files on Netaji exist in Russia, Japan, China, USA, UK, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia. Return of literary awards a ‘manufactured rebellion’: Jaitley Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday said that the steady stream of writers returning their Sahitya Akademi awards was a \"manufactured paper rebellion\" against the government in the wake of a \"manufactured crisis\". In a Facebook post , Jaitley asked, \"Is this protest real or a manufactured one? Is this not a case of ideological intolerance?\" He added, \"With the Congress showing no signs of revival and an insignificant Left lacking legislative relevance, the recipients of past patronage are now resorting to 'politics by other means'. The manufactured protest of the writers is one such case.\" US accuses India of curbing free expression The United States state department said that India continued to enforce laws designed to protect \"religious sentiments\", which limited free expression related to religion. In the India section of the Congressional annual report on international religious freedom, which was released on Wednesday, the state department said India witnessed religiously motivated killings, arrests, riots and coerced religious conversions. It added that the police failed to respond effectively to communal violence in some cases.
