Keep improving the grid.\nBy Danielle Spiegel-Feld and Katrina M. Wyman Oct. 14, 2015 | 8:00 a.m. EDT + More Big electricity producers are fighting to curb programs that keep America's power prices low. The Supreme Court has a chance to stop them.\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear a little-noticed case that could have big implications for the future of the American electricity system. Electric Power Supply Association v. Federal Energy Regulation Commission is part of a campaign by the power industry to stifle innovations that could foster a leaner, more efficient electricity system. The court should rebuff the power industry's attack and allow American electricity consumers to enjoy the benefits technological progress has made possible.\nOne of the defining rules of our electricity system is that the supply of electricity in the grid must always equal the demand for it. For most of the grid's history, market operators could only regulate the supply side of this equation. Lacking any control, or even communication, with the millions of electricity consumers tied to the grid, operators had no alternative but to call more and more power plants into action as consumers increased demand.\n[ SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy ]\nThis one-sided approach to grid management was a boon for power producers. Because market operators dispatch plants from least expensive to most expensive until all demand is satisfied, wholesale power prices can increase dramatically during peak periods of electricity demand. Yet American electricity consumers are blind to these price increases because the retail rates they pay are typically set years in advance based on the average cost of service. As a result, consumers have traditionally lacked any incentive – or even ability – to reduce demand in response to rising wholesale prices. This has translated into higher-than efficient electricity rates for American consumers and windfall profits for power producers.\nRecent technological advances offer a chance to rebalance the equities. As information technology has improved, various energy software companies have developed programs that pay customers who reduce their electricity usage when demand is unusually high. These \"demand response\" programs have empowered market operators to balance the grid via the lowest cost means available, increasing supply or lowering demand. This helps keep wholesale electricity prices low and stable.\nOver the past 15 years, as awareness of the value of demand response has grown, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has worked step-by-step to incorporate these programs into wholesale electricity markets. Congress has supported the commission's efforts along the way. In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, for instance, Congress declared it to be to the \"policy of the United States\" to \"encourage\" the proliferation of demand response programs.\nBut power producers see demand response programs as a threat to their bottom line. And so, in 2011, when FERC issued a rule, Order 745, that required that demand response providers to be compensated similarly to electricity providers, a trade association of power producers sued. They've been fighting to strike down Order 745 ever since.\n[ MORE: Editorial Cartoons on Energy Policy ]\nThe cornerstone of the power producers' attack is their claim that the commission does not have jurisdiction to regulate demand response. They argue that the Federal Power Act of 1935 authorizes states alone to regulate such programs. This argument relies on a formalistic interpretation of the Federal Power Act, which was enacted when the electricity system was radically different than it is today and programs like demand response were unimaginable.\nIn a decision that surprised many observers, a lower court accepted the power producers' argument. That court's decision seems to have been primarily motivated by a fear that ruling for FERC would open the door to an unbridled expansion of federal jurisdiction into states' regulatory spheres. These concerns are unfounded. There are well-established legal and political constraints on what the commission can do and Order 745 fits squarely within the accepted confines of its authority.\nTellingly, an unusually broad coalition that includes big businesses, such as Wal-Mart, consumer advocates, environmental organizations, energy law scholars and even some state public service commissions has lined up to support FERC in the present litigation.\nAllowing the lower court's rigid and narrow interpretation of the commission's authority to stand could have ripple effects that spread far beyond the issue of demand response. While we don't know what future technologies may emerge, we do know that FERC must be able to act nimbly as technology evolves to keep America's electricity system up-to-date, efficient and cost-effective. The lower court's decision could prevent the commission from doing just that.\nThe Supreme Court has a chance to reinstate Order 745 and clarify that the judiciary will not obstruct the wheels of progress. Should the court fail to act decisively, it will fall upon Congress to make its support for demand response loud and clear.\nTAGS: renewable energy energy energy policy and climate change Federal Energy Regulatory Commission energy efficiency electricity Supreme Court", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60eg%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Supreme%20Court%20FERC%20Grid%20Case%20Is%20About%20Progress", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60eg%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Supreme%20Court%20FERC%20Grid%20Case%20Is%20About%20Progress&summary=The%20Supreme%20Court%20has%20an%20opportunity%20to%20ensure%20America%27s%20electrical%20grid%20keeps%20improving.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60eg%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60eg%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Supreme%20Court%20FERC%20Grid%20Case%20Is%20About%20Progress", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60eg%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60eg%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:18:05.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
