The SNP and Labour have long been opponents, but there is something pitiful and sad about it.\n“The UK needs a strong opposition and Labour shows no signs of being capable of being that.\n“The SNP is filling that void and will go on seeking to do that. As First Minister, I think every country, every democracy, benefits from a strong opposition.”\nGetty Images Taking over: Sturgeon is joined the SNP’s new MPs after the 2015 election landslide\nShe added: “I feel sorry for generations of Labour voters and supporters who must look and wonder what on earth has gone wrong and what Labour is for.\n“In Scotland, it is not rocket scienc Nicola Sturgeon says SNP will fill the opposition void left by Labour’s “pitiful” demise e. Labour got lazy, complacent, arrogant and lost any real sense of purpose.\n“The question ‘What is Labour for?’ does not have an easy answer in Scotland, or in the UK. What is saddest is the failure to stand up and argue your view of the world.”\nIn an interview with this month’s GQ magazine , she also said Scotland has an “unhealthy” relationship with alcohol.\n“What is most unhealthy is this identification we have, not unique to Scotland but certainly the case here, where we identify having a good time with drinking alcohol, having a s*** time with drinking alcohol, being happy with drinking alcohol, being sad with drinking alcohol,” said Ms Sturgeon.\n“It is too much of an ever-present, regardless of our mood.”\nDailyMirror\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/benglaze", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:43:18.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
