Dave Reichert, R-Wash., announced Friday he will not challenge Gov. Jay Inslee (D) in next year's gubernatorial election. \n“Like so many of you, I have been extremely disappointed in the decisions coming out of the Governor’s Office — regarding our schools, the health of our children, and most recently a decision to give the Green River serial killer a chance to enjoy life in a nicer prison. We deserve better,” Reichert said in a statement. \nBut Reichert said he believes he is best able to serve by seeking reelection to his 8th District seat, which he has held since 2005 and is heavily favored to win again. \nHis decision to forego a statewide race leaves Port of Seattle Commissioner Bill Bryant as Inslee's main challenger. \nThe Washington State Democratic Party said Reichert's decision means Republicans are left with \"their last choice\" in next year's governor's race. \n\"Now the Republicans are left with little-known Bill Bryant, after every other Republican approached to run turned down the offer,\" Democratic Party Chairman Jaxon Ravens said. \"This latest recruiting failure must have heads hung pretty low at Republican headquarters right now.\" \nBryant, reacting to the Democrats' statement, told KING 5 voters are \"tired of his hyper-partisan, divisive style.\" \n\"When you have an incumbent who has no record, has nothing to run on, all he’s going to be able to do is attack,\" Bryant said. \"I think a lot of people out there don’t identify with the Republican or the Democratic party, and they’re tired of this negative crap, so if he [Inslee] wants to start off by attacking, God bless him, go for it.\" \nThe Inslee campaign sent out a fundraising appeal after the Reichert news broke, saying \"Republicans are now coalescing around our opponent Bill Bryant. And the attacks against our campaign, from Bryant and the Republican Governors Association, will only get more intense.\" \nBryant has been campaigning for months and lined up key endorsements from former GOP officials, including former Gov. Dan Evans and former U.S. Sen. Slade Gorton. And he has raised more than $600,000 in the first months of his campaign, far less than the $2.6 million Inslee has raised since he took office in 2013. \nWashington voters have favored Democratic candidates in most statewide races over the past decade. But the Republicans believe Washington is far from a guaranteed \"blue state.\" Republicans have made gains in the state legislature, controlling the state Senate outright since 2014 and within just a few seats of overtaking Democrats in the state House. \nHailing from King County -- home to the largest pool of voters in the state -- Bryant will hope to cut into Democrats' traditional advantage there. \nInslee won the 2012 governor's race over former Attorney General Rob McKenna, carrying 51 percent of the vote (less than 100,000 votes separated the two candidates once all the votes were tabulated). A Republican able to peel off more of King County's traditionally liberal voters stands a higher chance of winning statewide. \nReichert was viewed by some as the GOP's best hope for beating Inslee. The former sheriff won two tight reelection contests in 2006 and 2008 against Darcy Burner, a Democrat who enjoyed significant support from the national party and liberal groups. Those victories in Democratic years showed Reichert was capable of appealing to voters in the state's liberal heartland. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.king5.com/story/news/politics/state/2015/10/16/rep-dave-reichert-not-running-governor/74070710/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:08:00.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
