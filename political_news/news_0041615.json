Both ideas previously belonged to Labour. More UK troops bolster Baltic buffer to Russia \nThose announcements were the latest in a string of ideas appropriated from rival parties in what Jon Cruddas, former head of policy for Labour, has described as a “land grab”. They include some ideas that senior Tories had previously dismissed as impractical or too expensive. \nThis should be seen in the light of the Tory leadership’s broader attempt to recast itself as the “party of working people”. Prime Minister David Cameron’s speech was Blairite in its centrist tone and broad reach. \nMr Osborne’s policy thefts echo Benjamin Disraeli’s account of how Robert Peel would steal ideas from rivals: “He caught the Whigs bathing and had walked off with their clothes.” \nIncome tax threshold \nDuring the 2010 leaders’ debates, Mr Cameron attacked the Lib Dem flagship policy of lifting low-paid workers out of income tax forever. “We cannot afford it,” he lectured Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader. \nBy the end of the Parliament the Tories were no longer letting their junior coalition partners take credit for the idea. \nIndeed, the Tory manifesto in May promised a £12,500 tax-free personal allowance. \nMr Clegg forlornly complained that the Tories had a “brass neck” for stealing his policy. \nLiving wage \nThe idea of a higher wage was pushed hard in the run-up to the 2010 election by Citizens UK: back then Mr Cameron declined to address the group because of a diary clash. \nWhile Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, championed a voluntary “living wage” — and called for the minimum wage to reach £8 by 2020 — the Tory leader stayed on the fence. \nEven days before the summer Budget, Mr Osborne insisted that he had no plans for a compulsory higher minimum wage. \nThen he sprang his big surprise: there will be a compulsory Living Wage of £9 an hour by 2020 — higher than the Miliband equivalent. \nNational Infrastructure Commission \nThis week Mr Osborne announced plans for a National Infrastructure Commission chaired by Lord Adonis, former Labour transport secretary. \nThe body will give long-term advice on Britain’s infrastructure needs, although politicians will still be responsible for deciding which projects to prioritise. \nThe idea is almost identical to a policy pushed hard during the last parliament by Ed Balls, former shadow chancellor. \nBusiness rates \nLabour promised before the general election to allow city and county regions that came together in “combined authorities” to keep 100 per cent of extra business rates revenue generated by additional growth. That was part of Mr Balls’s wider promise to devolve £30bn of funding outside London. \nThis week Mr Osborne took the policy and extended it to all councils, everywhere. He also threw in powers to cut rates or for combined authorities to raise them for specific infrastructure projects. \nNon-Doms \nEd Miliband excited leftwing supporters by promising to end “non-dom status”, the loophole that allows multimillionaires to keep any offshore profits out of the UK tax net. \nIn this year’s July Budget Mr Osborne did something strikingly similar by ending permanent non-dom tax status : anyone living in Britain for more than 15 years out of 20 would lose the status after 2017. \nZero-hours contracts \nLabour has campaigned heavily against zero-hours contracts, promising to let workers convert such contracts into a regular job after three months. \nThat initiative stung the Tory leadership into action — although Mr Osborne has only banned “exclusive” zero-hours contracts which tie workers to one firm without guaranteeing any hours. \nPayday lenders \nThe Labour MP Stella Creasy campaigned vigorously against payday lenders charging sometimes astounding interest rates. \nMr Osborne eventually stepped in during November 2013, promising to end the “absolutely outrageous fees and unacceptable practices” of some firms: ordering the FCA regulator to draw up a cap on the total cost of credit charges. \nProperty taxes \nMr Osborne repeatedly criticised Labour’s plans for a mansion tax, arguing that it would penalise low-income people (such as pensioners) living in large homes. \nYet he was not deaf to the public clamour for a tax on homes after years of galloping house price inflation. His compromise: a revamped stamp duty system penalising homes worth more than £927,500.
