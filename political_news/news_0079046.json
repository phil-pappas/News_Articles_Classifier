Wednesday’s ruling marked a victory for Rocky Mountain Wild, the conservation group that filed the lawsuit. \nThe proposal would offer 177 acres of private land in the Rio Grande National Forest in exchange for 205 acres of federal land. \nThe Forest Service has until Oct. 30 to comply with the ruling. \n___ \nInformation from: Durango Herald, http://www.durangoherald.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:16:52.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
