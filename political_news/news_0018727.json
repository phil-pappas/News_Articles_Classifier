Contenders will gather in Milwaukee on Nov. 10 for an event being hosted by Fox Business Network and The Wall Street Journal. The topics will include the economy, taxes and other domestic issues, as well as foreign policy. The network said on Monday that it had not yet decided on moderators or qualifying criteria for the debate. The Fox Business debate will come less than two weeks after CNBC holds a Republican debate in Colorado. CNN raised the bar for qualifying to make the main stage at that debate, a move that could potentially winnow the bloated field of candidates.

Correction: October 12, 2015 An earlier version of this post incorrectly named the network hosting the debate. It is Fox Business Network, not Fox Business News. Fri. Oct. 09 16 Posts Tue.
