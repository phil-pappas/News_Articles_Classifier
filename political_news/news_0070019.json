Text bigger Jeh Johnson \nThe “dope smoking” high school student who boasted on Twitter of hacking CIA chief John Brennan’s AOL email account has struck again, this time at Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. \nThe FBI is investigating, but Fox News reported the hacking of both high-ranking intelligence officials has been verified. \nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND’s Email News Alerts! \nThe Daily Mail reported the student, who’s claimed to be a marijuana smoker, said he prank called Brennan and recited the federal official’s own Social Security number. As WND previously reported , the teen reported obtaining the CIA chief’s Social Security number by hacking into his personal AOL email account and accessing his 46-page security clearance application. \nThe hacker recounted the prank by saying, “He waited a tiny bit and hung up,” the Daily Mail reported. \nNow Secret Service officials and top-ranking U.S. law enforcement members are looking into this same teen’s reported hack of Johnson’s private account. The Daily Mail reported the high schooler has broken into the Homeland Security official’s Internet provider and listen to his voicemails. \nIt’s not known if the information the teen grabbed on Johnson is classified; the data he took on Brennan was classified, Fox News said. The New York Post said the data from Brennan included information about individual intelligence officials and about interrogations. \nThe teen, who goes by the name of “cracka” on Twitter, posted at one point: “If i go quiet on this account, the CIA losers have found me and I’m being tortured by their stupid methods of ruining a guys thoughts.” \nTrust the government? Maybe you shouldn’t. Read the details in “Lies the Government Told You,” by Judge Andrew Napolitano. \nThe teen also wrote, under the handle of CWA, or “Crackas With Attitude,” of more to come: “IF we get 10 RT’s, we will release Avril Haines, current White House Deputy National Security Advisor’s call logs.:) #CWA.” \nSky News reported contacting the hacker, who said he’d prank-called Brennan multiple times and that hacking into his emails was “easy as f—.” \nDavid Limbaugh’s book chillingly documents the destructive “transformation” of the United States — get “The Great Destroyer: Barack Obama’s War on the Republic” \nThe teen also wrote, the Daily Mail said: “He asked what we want, and I said $2 trillion as a joke lmao, then he said seriously how much do you want.” \nThe New York Post, which first broke the story, dubbed the teen “dope smoking” after he admitted he liked to smoke marijuana with a high school friend.
