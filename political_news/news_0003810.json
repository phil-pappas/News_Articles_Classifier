In an unusual rebuke, even fellow Republicans denied him a “sufficient second” that would have allowed him a roll call vote. \nThen, his Republican colleagues loudly bellowed “no” when Cruz sought a voice vote, a second repudiation that showed how little support Cruz has: Just one other GOP senator — Utah’s Mike Lee — joined with Cruz as he was overruled by McConnell and his deputies. \nJohn McCain used to take a lot of criticism for being roundly disliked by his colleagues. McCain's problem has long been his devotion to national security issues at the expense of actually doing his job as a Senator. Cruz followed this model and set himself up as the ultra-conservative conscience of the Senate, thinking that his superior intelligence would always allow him to argue his way past his colleagues and vault to the top of the pack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:59:15.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
