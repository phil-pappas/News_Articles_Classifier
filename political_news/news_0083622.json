Quote: Who won a debate is inherently subjective. The idea of winning a debate necessarily entails a goal to be achieved. What this goal is, therefore, says as much about the person judging its achievement as the goal itself. Pundits are ostensibly supposed to judge whether or not a candidate said what \"the voters want to hear. But what ends up happening, invariably, is they end up judging whether or not the candidate said what they think voters wanted to hear. This, after all, is why pundits exist, to act as a clergy class charged with interpreting peoples own inscrutable opinions for them. The chasm between what the pundits saw and what the public saw was quite big last night. Bernie Sanders by all objective measures \"won\" the debate. Hands down. I dont say this as a personal analysis of the debate; the very idea of winning a debate is silly to me. I say this because based on the only relatively objective metric we have, online polls and focus groups, he did win. And its not even close. ADVERTISING Sanders won the CNN focus group, the Fusion focus group, and the Fox News focus group; in the latter, he even converted several Hillary supporters. He won the Slate online poll, CNN/Time online poll, 9News Colorado, The Street online poll, Fox5 poll, the conservative Drudge online poll and the liberal Daily Kos online poll. There wasnt, to this writer's knowledge, a poll he didnt win by at least an 18-point margin. But you wouldnt know this from reading the \"establishment\" press. The New York Times, the New Yorker, CNN, Politico, Slate, New York Magazine, and Vox all unanimously say Hillary Clinton cleaned house. What gives? Firstly, its important to point out that online polls, and to a lesser extent focus groups, are obviously not scientific. But its also important to point out that the echo chamber musings of establishment liberal pundits is far, far less scientific. It wasnt that the online polls and focus groups had Sanders winning, its that they had him winning by a lot. And it wasnt just that the pundit class has Clinton winning, its that they had her winning by a lot. This gap speaks to a larger gap weve seen since the beginning of the Sanders campaign. The mainstream media writes off Bernie and is constantly shocked when his polls numbers go up. What explains this phenomenon? Freddie DeBoer had this to say: What's the difference? The upper 1% control the media; guess who they bought for the election?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:43:02.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
