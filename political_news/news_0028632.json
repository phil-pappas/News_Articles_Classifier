He faced little serious competition, though the same hard-line conservatives who forced Boehner out command enough votes to complicate McCarthy's ascent, even without fielding a candidate of their own.\n\"I know what's going on across the country, and I'm concerned about what we hear,\" McCarthy told reporters. \"We want to make sure that we're closer to the people, that they feel this is their government, they're in charge and we serve them.\n\"Now, that's not easy and it won't change overnight. But that's our mission.\"\nMcCarthy spoke as the contest to replace him as majority leader turned volatile, with some Republicans announcing they wanted to draft Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., the chairman of the special panel investigating the 2012 Benghazi, Libya, attacks, and Hillary Clinton.\nGowdy took himself out of the running late in the day, stressing that he doesn't want to give up his responsibility as Benghazi committee chairman.\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Sca lise of Louisiana and Budget Committee chairman Tom Price of Georgia already are competing fiercely for the No. 2 job.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:23:08.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
