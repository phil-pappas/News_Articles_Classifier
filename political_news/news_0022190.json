The little people are speaking up and their only weapon is their vote.\nThomas Jefferson said, \"A little rebellion now and then is a good thing.\" \nThe 2016 elections could be the start of a quiet revolution. We the people have had it with politicians who put the good of their careers ahead of the good of their country. They, the politicians, keep campaigning for their next four or six years from the minute they get into office. They keep forgetting that they represent us. \nI love the senators and congressmen that get up in front of the cameras and say, \"I voted with my heart.\"\nBaloney, they voted what their party told then to vote for. With social media, 24-7 news and every communication device out there, why did they not ask the people who they represent what they wanted?\nAt this point, the American people have had it with a do nothing Congress (only 7 percent approve of what Congress does). Hillary played games with us for four years thinking if she just smiled when asked if she was running that the American people would be kneeling at her feet begging her to run. Wrong! Benghazi, emails, and the fact that she answers every question asked of her like a defense lawyer defending her guilty client brings back memories of the Clinton White House years. \nNo one wants that any more. Trump is saying what the average American wants to hear. No filters, no handlers, no party bosses are there to stop him and the people love him. He has no political or military background and if you really think about it, neither did Obama. Trump does have management, negotiation and organizational skills at the highest level. He will pick the best people to surround himself with, not just political hacks and Party favorites. He may mix his White House cabinet with peoples from both parties. Maybe itâ€™s time to have a businessman, instead of a lawyer in the White House. There are too many lawyers in the Senate, Congress and in D.C. Maybe a businessman can straighten things out. Will he be hard to control or will the aura of the White House calm him down? Remember, at one point, we were willing to put Gov. Christie in the White House but we all thought the Jersey boy in him would be a mismatch. Is Trump a cross between Truman, Johnson and Reagan? The only advice I would give to him for both the campaign trail and in the White House - smile a little.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:49:30.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
