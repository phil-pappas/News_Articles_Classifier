As an Assistant U.S. Attorney, I prosecuted this case and secured a guilty plea from Savant and others. The investigation and prosecution demonstrated how cooperation ought to work, with excellent and professional work by the FBI, the IRS and the U.S. Attorney’s Office. As Attorney General, I want to improve the cooperation between federal, state and local law enforcement officials in order to put an end to public corruption. Mississippi needs an Attorney General who won't just talk about prosecuting public corruption but will make the prosecution of public corruption a priority,” said Hurst. 10/1/15 Posted October 1, 2015 - 10:27 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
