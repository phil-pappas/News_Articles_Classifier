The teens designed the space to include study, lounge and game areas, and requested bright, special Sherwin-Williamsâ„¢ paint colors for the space: Dynamic Blue SW 6958 in the Multi-purpose Room; Calypso SW 6950 in the Teen Lounge; Daffodil SW 6901 in the Art Room; Plum Blossom SW 6974 in the Tech Room; Outrageous Green SW 6922 in the Kitchen; and Grizzle Gray SW 7068 as an accent color.\n\"We are so excited to see our Eller Clubhouse teens' ecstatic reactions to the redesigned Club,\" said Jacquelyn Minor , Director of The Eller Clubhouse of Boys & Girls Clubs of the Western Reserve. \"As a result of this great partnership with Aaron's and the new improved space, our teen members are even more inspired and motivated to elevate their leadership skills and take personal ownership of their future.\"\nAaron's hopes its partnership with BGCA's Keystone Program inspires teens to \"Own It\" by taking ownership of their choices to build the lives they deserve.
