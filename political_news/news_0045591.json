They can come in the form of certificates or other benchmark notices and can be attained in much less time than a typical associate's or bachelor's degree.\n\"These grants were only awarded to a handful of recipients,\" said Secretary Kathy Manderino . \"L&I's inclusion is a testament to the USDOL's recognition of Governor Wolf's and the department's shared commitment to integrated and efficient methods of increasing access to jobs that pay to more Pennsylvanians, and to expanding a quality workforce development system through innovative ideas such as micro-credentials.\"\n\"Micro-credentials have the potential to be a gateway to employment and college degrees for thousands of Pennsylvanians,\" said Deputy Secretary of Workforce Development Diane Bosak . \"These stackable education awards will allow employers to see job-seekers' business-specific skills and help improve their employability absent of, or as a supplement to, a traditional degree. We are grateful for the opportunity to grow this innovative and promising project.\"\nFunds from this grant will also be used to target specific groups with barriers to education and employment (i.e. out-of-school youth) that will benefit the most from micro-credentials, and evaluate and assess various methods of micro-credentialing.\nThe USDOL Workforce Innovation Fund invests in programs that support, evaluate, and enhance workforce investment strategies that generate long-term improvements in the performance of the public workforce system, outcomes for job-seekers and employers, and cost-effectiveness.\nMEDIA CONTACT: Sara Goulet , 717-787-7530\n releases/li-awarded-6-million-for-workforce-development-programs-300151993.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/li-awarded-6-million-for-workforce-development-programs-300151993.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC16657&Transmission_Id=201510010900PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC16657&DateId=20151001", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:47:07.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
