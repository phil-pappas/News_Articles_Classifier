But women lag way behind men in another measure of political participation. Only about 30 percent of big donors to campaigns are women, which, in an election that’s forecast to feed on billions of dollars of donations, is a gender gap in political influence.\nThe estimated gap in overall fund-raising is even larger, because the average contribution from a man is much larger than the average for a woman. For every dollar flowing from big donors into the campaigns of sitting members of Congress, about 76 cents has come from a man and 24 cents from a woman.\nThese findings are based on an Upshot analysis of data from Crowdpac , a Silicon Valley start-up that tracks donations and rates candidates on an ideological scale. The donors’ gender was determined by their first names. (Less than two percent of donors can’t be reliably mapped to gender.) The data includes only contributions of more than $200, because the names of smaller contributors aren’t disclosed under campaign finance law.\nIt’s impossible to know from the way contributions are recorded by campaigns whether a political donation that officially comes from one person actually comes from a married couple. But the name on a political contribution still matters — for access to political figures and influence with them. In an era when big donors demand ever more access to potential future leaders , the gender gap in contributions contributes to a gender gap in political power as well.\nWhat causes the fund-raising gap is harder to pin down. The wage and wealth gap between men and women plays a role. In states where the average woman earns close to the average man’s pay, more of politicians’ big donors are women. The wage gap doesn’t explain the whole fund-raising gap, though.\nIt’s not that women are less willing or less able to give in general. Despite the wage gap, women, across a variety of demographic variables, are more likely to give to charity than men are. Politics is the outlier, with men’s giving outnumbering women’s.\nContinue reading the main story Gender Gap in Campaign Contributions Only a few members of Congress receive more than half of their donations from women.

Men’s contributions, even among big donors, are likely to be larger than women’s.\nAnother pattern in the data is that women give more to liberals and to other women. Only a few members of Congress receive more than half of their donations from women. It’s no big surprise that all are women. All are also Democrats.\nThese patterns are reflected in the presidential primary races, too, but some candidates buck the trends. Hillary Clinton, whose campaign has not been shy about stressing her gender , does well with female donors; more than 52 percent of her 2016 campaign’s big contributors are women. ( Her campaign says that 60 percent of all donors are women.) But Bernie Sanders, a self-described feminist , is situated to neutralize some of her natural advantage about as well as any male candidate could. Compared with his fellow male senators, his campaigns for Congress received the highest proportion of its donations from women.\nOn the Republican side, Carly Fiorina does appear to attract a high percentage of women as donors — but not at the pace that the average Democratic woman does. With a third of her donations so far this cycle from women, she outperforms the average Republican congresswoman by a few percentage points.", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/24/hey-bernie-sanders-are-you-a-feminist/", "https://www.crowdpac.com/", "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/16/hillary-clinton-fec-filing-shows-46m-raised-with-women-60-of-donors", "http://int.nyt.com/chartmaker/2015/10/14/20151012-gender-gap-in-campaign-c/3/artboard-300px.png", "http://int.nyt.com/chartmaker/2015/10/14/20151012-gender-gap-in-campaign-c/3/artboard-540px.png", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/30/us/30DONORS/30DONORS-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:07:39.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
