With so many doubts about the NRSA's role, Tinnapan only agreed to speak to the press yesterday. Here are some excerpts: \"I'm not a speaker, but prefer to work behind the scenes. As a chair, I cannot express opinions on behalf of all 200 members, but prefer to stay neutral and only speak about our resolutions. From now on, we plan to speak to you once a month or in case of an emergency. We will try our best to accomplish the reform task. It would be good if we can complete one issue, and great if we can complete 10. If we fail this time, I don't think we will get a second chance. So, I would like to call on all individuals to consider reforming themselves too. We need to make personal changes first before reforming others. \"You must understand that the NRSA is acts as an advisory body. We do a study and offer suggestions. We have no authority, so we need to have a clear plan and measures to get tangible results. But in the end, it really depends on the powers-that-be to make the last call. WHAT REFORM AGENDA DO YOU THINK IS OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. I cannot say at this point as I have not studied the whole scope of the job. I'm only a chair, and have to consider the rest of the members in order to prioritise our work. We may need to set up several committees that our members can join based on the subjects of their interest. We cannot prejudge the work, but should realise that every reform agenda is equally important. We cannot immediately decide which is a diamond and which a pebble. ARE YOU WORRIED THAT YOU MAY BE FORCED TO SWITCH DIRECTION BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR PEACE AND ORDER (NCPO)? Some people say a soldier's job is to kill. So, I changed my profession [from soldier] to an academic, and as an academic I must maintain my principles and work for public benefit. The work is based on the truth, so I can't be ordered to turn left or right or forced to believe that 2 plus 2 equals 3. That cannot be. Why have you returned to work in politics again? I consider myself a man of honour. But this honour has impoverished me. Sometimes, I have no money to put fuel in my care, but as an honourable man, I am honest. So when they need me, I'm willing to step up and help the country. When they don't need me, I'll leave. HOW WILL YOU AND THE NSRA TACKLE CORRUPTION, WHICH IS PLAGUING THE COUNTRY? I have been studying this issue for a long time… As an adviser for the Prem [Tinsulanonda] government [dubbed clean and transparent] for over eight years, I laid a critical policy demanding that ministers declare their assets. This continues until today. HOW WILL YOU PUSH FOR RECONCILIATION? Reconciliation is important, and we will continue working on the NRC's proposal. But at this point I cannot say if we will push forward the reconciliation work following calls from political stakeholders or not. I have stayed away from the field of politics for 30 years now, and over the past three years, I have also closed my ears to political news as it's so stressful. 253 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:52:59.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
