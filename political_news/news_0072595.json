Thakkar | October 08, 2015, 23.51 pm Sonam and Rhea Kapoor Rhea Kapoor seems well on her way to pulling off a major casting coup for her debut directorial venture, a chick-flick about four girls\nRhea Kapoor, who produced Aisha and Khoobsurat starring her sister Sonam Kapoor, is now gearing up to direct a film. We hear that she is planning a multi-starrer chick flick and if she is able to rope in the names she has in mind, it could be one of the biggest casting coups in Bollywood.\nSo who all are there on her wish list? “Besides Sonam Kapoor, she also wants to rope in Anushka Sharma, Katrina Kaif and Huma Qureshi. The film will tell the story of the journey of four girls.

Anil Kapoor is overlooking the project as it will be produced by his production house.”\nRecently Sonam was Quote: d as saying that she is indeed doing a chick-flick that will have an ensemble female cast. We tried to get in touch with Sonam but she didn’t reply to our text message.\n Rhea Kapoor Sonam Kapoor Anushka Sharma Katrina Kaif Huma Qureshi Bollywood entertainment Also Read Amitabh Bachchan meets Michael Bloomberg, gets enlightened Are 'separated' couple Miranda Kerr, Orlando Bloom ‘friends-with-benefits’?
