PKP was one of its kind and PKP 2 is a very different take on love.\nKartik: More than burdened, I am happy to carry it forward. The characters in the film are very relatable. PKP 2 is a hilarious script. I am hoping it will do good business.\nDo you think people take the PKP series mainly as Nushrat and Kartik’s film?\nNushrat: We are no bigger than a film. PKP is not about Nushrat and Kartik. It’s about Rajjo and Neha or Gogo and Chiku in the second edition. We have a recall value as a couple.\nKartik: It’s not our film, it’s a Luv Ranjan film. He has made PKP a franchise and we are just his characters.\nHow have your characters changed since 2011?\nKartik: I have become more mature than my last character Rajjo. Everyone dominated him, but Gogo is smart and confident.\nNushrat: No, I am still a girl..(Laughs)\nHow do you take it when people think of you as a real life couple?\nNushrat: Is it? No one has actually told me about this ever. I never knew that people think this way.\nKartik: Honestly, a lot of people tell me this. They think that we are a real life couple but I feel that since we are at so much ease with each other, our chemistry is effortless. We have done three films together.\nAny chances for PKP 3?\nNushrat: I hope we will make the third installment, but no clue when will it happen.\nKartik: I hope so too.\n Kartik Tiwari Nushrat Bharucha Pyaar Ka Punchnama Bollywood Also Read Imran Khan enjoys his day with baby Imara at St James' Park It’s Varun Dhawan versus Tiger Shroff for Remo D’souza Saif Ali Khan, Illeana D'Cruz and Kalki at the launch of 'Happy Ending' Amitabh, Abhishek win same award in different categories", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Kartik%20Tiwari%20and%20Nushrat%20Bharucha.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Kartik%20Tiwari%20and%20Nushrat%20Bharucha.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151002/entertainment-bollywood/article/‘people-think-we’re-couple’", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:54:58.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
