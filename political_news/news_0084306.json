Promoted stories \nOn migration, Boris took a slightly less draconian tone than Theresa, explaining: “It is not that we object to immigration in itself – I speak as the proud great grandson of a Turk who fled his country in fear of his life to Wimbledon, for some reason, and who was then assassinated by his political opponents; a fate I intend to avoid - it is about who decides; it is about who is ultimately responsible; it is about control.” \nIn what might not have been the smartest analogy to use Bozza kept referring to England’s rugby world cup humiliation and his time as a teenage prop. \n“The crucial thing you have to do as a tight-head – in fact, just about the only thing you have to do apart from grunting and trying to stop the other guy sticking his fingers up your nose - is to bind on tightly and correctly; in my case to the hooker. Insert joke here as Jeremy Corbyn’s autocue would say.” Share article \nThe rugby scrum, he explained, provided the metaphor for his political beliefs; society as a gigantic collective effort in which one person’s bulk made up for another person’s slightness of stature; where everyone was tightly bound together and one person’s forward progress drove another’s. It was, Bozza told the delegates, the idea of and belief in the “united society”. \nBut the Tory question is who in the race to succeed Dave will get the ball over the line? No-nonsense Theresa or smart funny Boris. Or, most likely, calculating George.
