Bernie Sanders (I-VT) wants ExxonMobil investigated by the Department of Justice. In a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Tuesday, Sanders charged the oil giant of engaging in a cover-up to intentionally mislead the public about the reality of human-caused climate change, and by extension the risks of its carbon-intensive product. It appears that Exxon knew its product was causing harm to the public, and spent millions of dollars to obfuscate the facts in the public discourse, Sanders wrote. The information that has come to light about Exxons past activities raises potentially serious concerns that should be investigated. The information Sanders cited was a recent investigation by Inside Climate News, which found that the ExxonMobil conducted research as far back as 1977 affirming that climate change is caused by carbon emissions from fossil fuels. At the same time, the oil giant gave millions of dollars to politicians and organizations that promote climate science denial, and spent millions more lobbying to prevent regulations to limit carbon emissions. They should be investigated, as the republicans investigated the tobacco industry who knew all along cigarettes were addictive and caused cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:24:24.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
