It offers curbside composting pickup only to certain neighborhoods, while charging a fee that keeps participation low. As a result, Denver's city-run trash service says just 16 percent of waste from the single-family homes and small residential buildings it serves is kept out of the landfill.\nBut that diversion rate may improve in coming years as the city makes progress in replacing industrial trash bins with household carts and prepares for another expansion of the composting program . It plans to add two routes by 2018, allowing more customers to fill a green cart with food scraps, yard waste, soiled paper and other organic material that can be composted.\nStill, it likely will be years before compost pickup — now offered to roughly one-third of households — is a universal option in Denver.\nAdvertisement \"There's so much organic material in the waste stream,\" said Charlotte Pitt, the manager of the city's solid waste division. \"It's such a great opportunity. ... (But) we are growing as fast as we can with the financial limitations that we have.\"\nEast Coast cities also tend to lag, but several Western cities have placed increasing priority on composting and recycling, sometimes following San Francisco's lead by making them a requirement.\nSeattle will begin issuing fines next year when food scraps and other compostable items are thrown in garbage cans. Portland, Ore., now collects trash every two weeks , while emptying compost and recycling containers weekly.\nAnd Salt Lake City offers weekly compost pickup as part of its regular trash fee.\nDenver began a compost pickup pilot program in 2008. Now, of roughly 60,000 households along four pickup routes, 12 percent subscribe to the service, Pitt said. Unlike recycling and trash pickup, which both are covered by city taxes, users must pay a fee for compost collection — $107 for a full year — to cover program costs.\nAbout 75 percent of households have opted in to recycling pickup, Pitt said.\nPitt and some environmental observers point out that cities with more ambitious programs often have faced pressures such as strict state mandates for landfill diversion or costly landfill tipping fees at sites far from city limits. In Colorado, landfills are plentiful and cheap along the Front Range.\n\"I think they're doing the best they can do under those particular circumstances,\" said Marjorie Griek, the executive director of the Colorado Association for Recycling. \"Without funding to purchase the additional capital equipment needed to get the bins, the educational material and the trucks for collection, there's only so much you can do.\"\nBut Denver long has aimed lower. Its 2010 Solid Waste Master Plan set a goal of reducing the 2004 trash tonnage by 30 percent, which would translate into a 34 percent landfill diversion rate.\nAnd while the master plan set a goal to roll out citywide composting pickup, it didn't fix a time frame. The plan projected a cost of $21.7 million to expand recycling participation and add citywide household composting, but Pitt points out that costs could vary widely depending on the scope set.\nLongtime environmental advocate Janna Six says she would like to see more gumption from Mayor Michael Hancock and other city officials, who make policy and control the purse strings.\n\"I just don't see anyone with the vision to try to make a difference,\" said Six, who formerly worked with the Alliance for a Sustainable Colorado.\nThe composting pickup program will grow modestly in coming years.\nThe Solid Waste Management Division doubled the number of compost pickup routes from two to four at the start of this year. It plans to add a fifth route in 2016 and a sixth route two years later.\nHindering a faster rollout of composting is that it's a self-sustaining program, and an expansion requires more trucks, employees and equipment. A $2 million loan from the city's Department of Environmental Health made the second, third and fourth routes possible, Pitt said, and repayment starts next year.\nThe city faces other waste-related financial pressures. Last month, the City Council approved an amendment to its contract with the company that processes its recyclables. The company will reduce payments to the city for the material by more than half, giving up about $800,000 over 17 months, because of a downturn in the recyclables market.\nIn recent years, Denver's resources have been focused mostly on converting all customers to a uniform cart system that eventually will offer three carts for trash, recycling and compost to residents.\nThe Solid Waste Management Division does not provide waste services to larger residential buildings or any commercial properties, which are responsible for contracting with private haulers.\nLast year, the city provided 95-gallon trash carts to 22,000 homes, replacing big alley bins or customer-provided containers . This year, another 23,000 cart conversions are underway, leaving 72,000 to convert in 2016 and 2017.\nThe council recently approved a $10.5 million purchase order to allow the city to buy more trash, recycling and compost carts over the next five years.\nPitt said the conversions are paying dividends by reducing operational costs.\nAnd in areas converted last year, she said, customers have generated 20 percent less trash while activating 13 percent more free recycling subscriptions.\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or @JonMurray\nLeafdrop program starts\nDenver Recycles' LeafDrop program starts Monday.
