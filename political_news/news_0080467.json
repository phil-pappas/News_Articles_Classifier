They said he was expected to pull through. \nPolice said two assailants fled in a car. No immediate arrests were made. \n\"This incident is not related to terrorism in any way,\" Deputy Police Chief Ken Bernard said. \"We know it's not related to what occurred in France months ago.\" \nBernard said the stabbing was \"related to a nightclub incident\" involving Stone's group and a second group of people. Bernard would not say what the fight was about and said there was no evidence Stone's assailants knew who he was. \nThe deputy chief said he did not know whether Stone was drinking, but others in his group were. \nIn a statement, the hospital said Stone's family \"appreciates the outpouring of love and support\" and requests privacy. \nOver the summer, Stone and two of his childhood friends from Sacramento, National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos and college student Anthony Sadler, were vacationing in Europe when they took down a gunman and thwarted a terror attack on a Paris-bound passenger train. \nAyoub El-Khazzani, a man with ties to radical Islam, had boarded the train with a Kalashnikov rifle, a pistol and a box cutter. A British businessman and a French-American were also commended for helping to stop the gunman. \nPresident Barack Obama met with the three Americans last month, praising them for their quick thinking and courage and calling them \"the very best of America.\" They were also awarded France's highest honor by President Francois Hollande. The three appeared on late-night talk shows and received a hometown parade. \nStone suffered a cut thumb and other injuries in stopping the train attack. He is assigned to Travis Air Force Base in California.
