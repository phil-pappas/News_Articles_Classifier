Despite the 261-159 vote, the pro-oil forces face growing resistance from the same environmental groups that have spent seven years fighting Keystone to a standstill — along with opposition from the White House and Democrats like Hillary Clinton. But this time, oil supporters are optimistic they’ll prevail in the end.\nStory Continued Below\nThe arguments for and against crude exports broadly parallel the debate about building the Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline: In both cases, Republicans say the move would create jobs at home, enhance national security and lessen the influence of rivals like Russia. Greens say it would encourage carbon-spewing oil production, damaging the fight against climate change. And the White House wants Congress to stay out of the issue — a message lawmakers pointedly ignored Friday.\nExport supporters also call the ban an outdated relic of the scarcity-haunted 1970s, unsuited to an era when the fracking boom has turned the U.S. into one of the world’s top oil producers. So far, though, they're short of the 60 votes they would need to get past a filibuster in the Senate.\nWatchdog dings Park Service over Biden vacation By Eric Wolff\nIn contrast to the anti-Keystone campaign, greens have been slower to mobilize on exports, but they are beginning to wake up to the fight. The godfather of the Keystone opposition, climate activist Bill McKibben, offered a warning before the vote to lawmakers who back crude exports: \"We will hang it around their necks at every opportunity, an oil-soaked albatross.\"\nThat peril isn't deterring pro-Keystone Republicans like Donald Trump, who has called the ban \"archaic.\" But President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both came out against Texas Republican Rep. Joe Barton's bill last month — shortly after Clinton announced her opposition to Arctic offshore drilling and just before she declared she opposes Keystone, two moves that drew cheers from the Democratic Party's green base.\nStill, the oil industry's supporters are hopeful. \"There is not a nationally organized effort to keep the export ban in place for environmental reasons like you had on Keystone XL,” said one private-sector exports advocate, who noted that the pipeline sparked “ideological opposition” from Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid way back in the fall of 2011. “You don’t have Tom Steyer cutting ads and air dropping in, funding opposition groups.”\nEven Obama and Clinton aren't saying they oppose the principle of easing the export restrictions. The White House has said the Commerce Department can already make decisions on export proposals, while Clinton has said she might support exports as part of \"a broader energy plan that does include concessions from the oil and gas industry.\" Meanwhile, Reid has expressed openness to a Senate deal in which Democrats would support exports in return for concessions, starting with extensions of clean-energy tax breaks, though many of them would be nonstarters for Republicans and the oil industry.\nSpeculating about that kind of trade-off is still a common parlor game for pundits when it comes to Keystone, though nothing has ever come of it. On crude exports, however, one conservationist is already talking about a deal: National Wildlife Federation President Collin O'Mara last month proposed a package of concessions that environmentalists could demand in exchange for eliminating the ban, including new regulations on the petroleum industry and an extension of clean-energy tax credits.\nJeb Bush goes heavy on fossil fuels By Darren Goode\nBut other greens say they're poised to escalate their opposition as the exports bill works its way to the Senate. And their successful fight to stymie the pipeline can serve as a template. \"The nice thing about the Keystone battle for us is that it's going to have lasting impact,\" said Lena Moffitt, director of the Sierra Club’s fuels campaign.\nLeague of Conservation Voters lobbyist Zach Drennen was just as confident on oil exports as his group is about killing Keystone. “Republicans this session have not had a great track record of getting their leadership's priorities to the president's desk, despite their campaign promises,” he said.\nThe pool of Democratic Senate moderates who might join the GOP's cause on exports is smaller than it was in the most recent Keystone battle, when Congress passed a pro-pipeline bill that Obama vetoed in February. North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp and West Virginia's Joe Manchin are the only Senate Democrats to come out in favor of the legislation so far, while Mark Warner (D-Va.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Angus King (I-Maine) are considered potential swing votes on exports, just as they were during the heyday of the Keystone battle.\nTwo pro-Keystone Democrats, Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Jon Tester of Montana, also expressed openness to ending export limits this month, although they ultimately opposed a Heitkamp-led bill on oil trade.\n“At the end of the day, it passes the House but I don't see a path forward yet for it in the Senate,” conceded Stephen Brown, vice president of the independent oil refiner Tesoro, which supports easing the ban.\n'Clean coal' group downsizing amid industry struggles By Darren Samuelsohn\nWhen Congress imposed the export ban in the 1970s, fears of scarcity following the Arab oil embargo led to a strategy of keeping domestically produced crude at home. Now the world is awash in a glut of inexpensive oil, spurring the drive by U.S. oil producers to find new markets abroad. The plunge in oil prices during the past year has also lessened — though not entirely eliminated — the danger that lawmakers who unleash exports would take the blame if prices rise at the pump.\nAt the heart of the pro-exports campaign is a national security argument broadly similar to the case for Keystone. Republicans and industry interests pitch secure supplies of both U.S. and Canadian oil as valuable geopolitical assets that can insulate America and its allies from threats including Russian aggression in Ukraine and Iran's imminent return to the global oil market.\nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) advanced that case Thursday in a letter chastising Treasury Secretary Jack Lew for what she calls Obama's inconsistency on the issue. \"The Administration’s recent statements criticizing legislative efforts regarding U.S. oil exports stand in stark contrast to prior Administration policy designed to support Libyan and Syrian rebels in their efforts to export oil from their countries,” she wrote.\nBackers of both exports and Keystone also promise job creation and lower gasoline prices as new fuel reaches the market, while their opponents contend that putting that new oil on the global market would mainly benefit countries like China.\nEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz poured cold water on some of the pro-exports arguments this week, telling senators that the current low prices mean that markets are not \"looking for that oil\" that U.S. producers hope to sell abroad. That dynamic resembles the damage that plummeting crude prices have wreaked on the Canadian oil industry and Keystone's prospects for success.\nBut industry backers of exports see several factors playing to their advantage that broke for green groups during the battle over Keystone. The most obvious divergence is marketing: Keystone is a tangible, multibillion-dollar target, easy to demonize on a protest sign or in a television ad — while crude exports are not.\nOn Keystone, \"the answer is either yes or no,\" GOP energy lobbyist Mike McKenna said. \"Exports can be graded and shaded and nuanced.\"\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/08/opinion/why-can-the-epa-regulate-smog-but-not-greenhouse-gases.html", "https://www.politicopro.com/energy/whiteboard/2015/09/trump-endorses-end-to-oil-export-ban-060425?print=true", "https://www.politicopro.com/trade/story/2015/09/pro-exports-compromise-schor-restuccia-053602", "https://www.politicopro.com/energy/whiteboard/2015/09/clinton-comes-out-against-bill-ending-oil-export-ban-060518?print=true", "https://www.politicopro.com/energy/whiteboard/2015/09/clinton-leaves-door-open-to-compromise-on-oil-exports-060688", "https://www.politicopro.com/energy/whiteboard/2015/09/white-house-says-it-opposes-house-bill-to-lift-crude-export-ban-060405?print=true", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/exporting-oil-and-protecting-wildlife-1443568671"], "published": "2015-10-09T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:01:04.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
