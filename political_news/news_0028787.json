Skinner, D-Berkeley, is vying with former Assemblyman Sandre Swanson , D-Alameda, in this race – two labor-backed liberals with no daylight between them on most notable issues. \n“Nancy Skinner is a proud progressive leader who is not afraid to take on powerful corporate interests and fight for our families,” Reich said in Skinner’s news release. “We need a fighter like Nancy Skinner in the State Senate.” \nSkinner, who was term- limited out of the Assembly late last year and now is an energy and transportation senior fellow at UC-Davis , said she’s honored to have Reich’s support. “Not only is he a personal hero, he is one of the most thoughtful, compelling and effective progressive leaders in America. Reich has dedicated his career to combating injustice and making a real difference in the world.” \nSkinner less than two weeks ago announced her endorsement by 12 current state Senate Democrats. But Swanson began rolling out his own endorsements at the start of this past summer, which have included nods from both the assemblymen now representing the district; Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland; Teamsters Joint Council 7; and 9th District incumbent Loni Hancock, D-Berkeley, who’ll be term-limited out next year. \nSkinner had about $922,000 ($925,176, less $2,878 in outstanding debt) banked for this race as of June 30, while Swanson had about $50,000 ($80,387, less $30,443 in outstanding debt). \nRepublican Richard Kinney , San Pablo’s vice mayor, also is running for the seat; he had about $750 banked as of June 30. But in a district that’s 63 percent Democrat to 8 percent Republican , it’s hard to imagine him making it into the June primary’s top two in order to advance to November. \nA third prominent Democrat, former Assembly Majority Leader and current Alameda County Supervisor Wilma Chan , dropped out of this race late last month. \n“Over the past six months, I am proud to say that we had successfully begun to build a campaign based on local support, community action and alliances with like-minded groups in Sacramento, Chan wrote in message to supporters. “Unfortunately, political races are increasingly dependent on money and less on grassroots support and action. It has become clear that the window of time I have to raise the necessary funds will be difficult given my responsibilities to my constituents. It has also become clear that the needs of my family must come first.” \nChan noted that although she can use some of the money she had raised for this race for her supervisorial campaign committee and the rest for like-minded candidates and causes, she will honor individual contributors’ requests for refunds. \nThe 9th District is a swath of Contra Costa and Alameda counties from Rodeo in the north to San Leandro in the south, including Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda, Piedmont, Emeryville, Richmond, El Cerrito, San Pablo, Hercules, Kensington and other communities. \n  Elwood \n61 year old Nancy Skinner looks really nice in her HS graduation photo. \nMust be all that political musical chairs they play in Berserkerly. JohnW \nOh, I thought that was Molly Ringwald. RRSenileColumnist \nReich, a disappointed office-holder, is desperately attempting to make himself relevant in current politics. Nobody outside Berkeley, and a few Occupy Everything clubs, gives a hoot which liberal Reich endorses", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:32:13.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
