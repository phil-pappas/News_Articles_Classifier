This is despite a similar trial going ahead in Victoria, Australia.\" \nIn Colorado, a state with a similar population to New Zealand, US$ 326,716,273 in medical cannabis sales have been made in the year to October. \n\"These sales were mainly natural cannabis buds grown by caregivers working for retail dispensaries,\" Mr Crawford said. \n\"By preventing a similar scheme here, the Associate Health Minister is costing the health system millions and putting patients' lives at risk.\" \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
