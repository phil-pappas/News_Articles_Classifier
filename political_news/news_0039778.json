Crist lost by a very slim margin to Gov. Rick Scott. CHRIS URSO/Tampa Tribune Previous Next \nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) â€” Former Republican Gov. Charlie Crist is expected to announce he's running for Congress as a Democrat in an attempt to return to politics. \nCrist has a series of news conference scheduled at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday in his hometown of St. Petersburg. \nCrist served as governor from 2007 until 2011 but decided to run for Senate in 2010 instead of seeking a second term. He dropped out of the Republican primary and ran as an independent after falling behind to eventual winner Marco Rubio. \nCrist later registered as a Democrat and challenged Republican Gov. Rick Scott last year, losing in a close election after Scott pumped almost $13 million of his own money into his campaign in the final week. Crist hopes to replace Republican U.S. Rep. David Jolly, who is running for Senate. \nCopyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
