It means creating a government that represents all of us, not just the wealthiest people in the country,\" Sanders said.\nSanders has become the leading challenger to front-runner Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential race with calls for greater economic equality, including more taxes on the wealthy and corporations and more government spending on programs such as free college tuition and a higher minimum wage.\nBut the political label of \"socialist,\" with its Cold War associations and images of government takeovers of private industry, evokes negative connotations for many Americans and is typically used as a slur against U.S. politicians.\nSanders said voters just needed to better understand the concept.\n\"I think we have some explaining and work to do, but I think at the end of the day you are going to find more and more people agreeing with our point of view,\" Sanders said.\n\"You go to your public library, or you call your fire department or police department, what do you think you are calling? These are socialist institutions,\" he said.\nSanders said voters should know that countries like Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Germany had instituted successful socialist economic programs while remaining democratic.\n\"They may not be familiar with some of the very positive policies that those governments have developed for the middle class and working families,\" Sanders said. \"So I think that's a discussion we have to have.\"\n(Editing by Jonathan Oatis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:44:30.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
