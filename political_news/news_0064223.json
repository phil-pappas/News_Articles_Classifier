We are proud to carry on the legacy and the mahi of wāhine Māori,” said National President Prue Kapua. \n“Any solution for Māori families and children must include Māori women at its centre. The League has always reached into our communities in a way that departments and other organisations can never do.” \n“We know our communities, we live in our communities and have worked for and with our people for 64 years: this is our strength and is what sets us apart.” \nThis year marks 64 years since the League’s first National Conference was held in 1951. This year’s National Conference is being held at the ASB Leisure Centre, Whangarei, from 7 – 10 October. \nThis year the Report by the Children's Commissioner and the CYF Expert Panel report confirmed the alarming numbers of Māori children in state care and the effects that has. \n“Of the 5000 children in state care, almost 3,000 are mokopuna Māori. It is time now for the Government to listen to the solutions we can offer as League women involved in our communities and passionate about better outcomes for our whanau.\" \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:33:13.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
