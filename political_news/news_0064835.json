He then opened the second half up by keeping McDermott at the three and moving Mirotic to the four.\nWelcome to the hardest part of Hoiberg’s job.\n“I’ve said since Day 1 that my biggest job is going to be to figure out a rotation and try to get everybody to buy into roles,’’ Hoiberg said. “It’s going to be tough. A lot of guys deserve to play.’’\nEspecially a lot of big guys, and therein lies the problem.\nGasol is their most productive big man on offense, both with his scoring from the post, as well as his rebounding and passing. Noah is supposed to be the “energy guy,’’ and is just two seasons removed from being named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.\nThen there’s top reserve Taj Gibson, who made his preseason debut against Detroit after having offseason ankle surgery, and scored four points in 10 minutes of work.\nMirotic is a must-play because of his ability to stretch the floor, especially at the four.\nFinally, there’s the emergence of rookie Bobby Portis, who was expected to make some noise in training camp, but not this loudly. The 22 nd pick overall came into the game with Detroit averaging 12.5 points and a team-high 12.3 rebounds through the first four exhibition games, and then went out against the Pistons in the first half and scored a team-high nine points.\n“He is making it hard,’’ Hoiberg said of keeping Portis out of the rotation. “There’s no doubt about it. We have a lot of people we can throw out there.’’\nPortis just wants to make sure that’s one of those in the mix.\n“Of course it’ll be tough but that’s all players,’’ Portis said of a scenario where he wouldn’t be in the rotation. “I feel like all great players have to go through adversity to go somewhere. All great players have done that. If I want to be a great player it’ll happen to me someday. Everything isn’t peaches and cream.’’\nWith veteran Mike Dunleavy (back surgery) likely missing at least the first month of the regular season, there are still more questions than answers for Hoiberg.\nTony Snell and McDermott are the likely candidates for Dunleavy’s spot, especially with the clunky look that the “jumbo’’ provided, and then it will be up to Hoiberg to find minutes for his five bigs.\n“It’s going to be, ‘Be ready, be ready,’ ‘’ Hoiberg said of the mentality he wants his players to carry with them. “If you don’t play one game you might play 20-25 minutes the next.’’\nThat wasn’t the only message the coach gave to his team, especially after giving up 38 fourth-quarter points to the Pistons and dropping to 2-3 in preseason play.\n“We weren’t very energetic out of the gate,’’ Hoiberg said. “The fact that we’re not getting back in transition is the disappointing thing. That’s obviously going to be a point of emphasis in practice the next few days.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:08:13.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
