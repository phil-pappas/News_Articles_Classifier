Of those surveyed, 91 percent are aware of current local laws pertaining to texting while driving. In addition, approximately 81 percent of respondents believe Millennials between the ages of 19-34 text most often of all age groups while driving.\n\"Mobile phone technology offers enhanced convenience and connectivity for consumers, but it is increasingly a source of distraction on the road,\" said Arthur Henry , senior manager of Strategic Insights for Kelley Blue Book. \"In fact, consumers believe drivers who use cell phones are a more significant safety concern than drunk drivers, road rage or weather conditions.\"\nDistracted driving beat out impaired drivers on the road at 75 percent of respondents, followed by road rage at just over half of respondents and weather conditions at 35 percent of respondents citing it as one of the biggest safety concerns impacting today's drivers.\n\"According to Kelley Blue Book's latest survey, almost half of consumers send text messages while driving because they feel it can't wait,\" said Rebecca Lindland , senior director of Commercial Insights for Kelley Blue Book. \"In order to combat this issue, friends, family and colleagues need to develop situational awareness and avoid texting someone when we know they are driving in an effort to keep them and other drivers out of harm's way. Your text can wait.\"\nKey Highlights from Kelley Blue Book's Texting and Driving Survey\n97 percent of total respondents selected \"distracted drivers on the road (e.g. people texting or talking on cell phones)\" as one of the biggest safety concerns impacting today's drivers. 91 percent report being aware of current local laws pertaining to texting while driving. On average, total respondents think 41 percent of drivers text while driving. 66 percent of all respondents think, of all age groups, 19-25 year olds text most often while driving, followed by 26-34 year olds and 15-18 year olds, respectively, at 15 percent each. 20 percent of total respondents indicate texting while driving, while 55 percent of Millennials (respondents between the ages of 18-34) report texting while driving. 62 percent of total respondents report texting while at a standstill, 2 percent while in motion, and 36 percent both at a standstill and while in motion. Just 45 percent of Millennials admit that their ability to drive is compromised when texting while driving, compared to 59 percent of total respondents. Nearly half (47 percent) of total respondents say they text while driving because they \"feel it can't wait.\" 75 percent of total respondents feel guilty and/or worried when they text and drive. Only 60 and 64 percent of Millennials, respectively, feel the same. 76 percent of total respondents believe \"technology that will make it safer/easier to communicate while in a vehicle,\" such as voice-to-text or text-to-speech, would make them abstain from texting while driving. 27 percent said it would take getting into an accident to make them abstain. 50 percent of Millennials report themselves or someone they know personally almost getting into an accident as a result of being on a cell phone, compared to just 29 percent of total respondents.
