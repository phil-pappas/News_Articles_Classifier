Our feeling, our words, I think, have been received,” he said. \nYamaguchi did not elaborate on what the letter said. \nIn Tokyo on Friday, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga avoided directly commenting whether Yamaguchi’s comments reflected Tokyo’s official position. \nBut he said Japan hoped to improve its ties with Beijing. \n“Nothing has been decided about the Japan-China summit. But Japan and China are in agreement that the bilateral relations should be improved under the direction of a mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests,” Suga said. \n“We wish to build stable bilateral relations by continuing dialogues at various levels. In this respect, (Yamaguchi’s) visit to China was extremely significant,” he added. \nXi has not visited Japan since coming to power more than two years ago. \nBitter memories of Japan’s violent rule in China before and during World War II continue to afflict their relations, with China asserting that Tokyo has not sufficiently atoned for its past. \nThe ties plunged in 2012 following Tokyo’s nationalisation of disputed islands in the East China Sea. \nMeanwhile, China’s Communist party tends to stoke Chinese nationalism as part of its claim to legitimacy. \nAbe’s past visits to the controversial Yasukuni war shrine, seen by China as a symbol of Japan’s war-time militarism, have also damaged relations between the two countries. \nBut over the last year the two nations have been making gradual and visible efforts to improve their relations. \nChinese State Councillor Yang Jiechi, the highest-ranking Chinese diplomat to make an official trip to Tokyo for several years, met with Abe on Wednesday in Tokyo. \nAbe told Yang that he hoped to meet with Chinese leaders at upcoming international meetings, such as the G20. © 2015 AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:59:00.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
