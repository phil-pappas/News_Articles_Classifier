The system is flexible enough for that to happen. With the economy going as flat as it is, we are going to see other companies look at this.\"\nA potential industrial flashpoint looms at Arrium's Whyalla steelworks in South Australia where the company wants to cut jobs and overhaul work practices.\n The embattled steel, mining, and materials group is seeking an additional $100 million of cost savings in its steel arm, OneSteel, on top of $60 million of previously announced savings.\nThe company declined to comment on Friday on whether the BlueScope agreement had implications for its approach to its upcoming negotiations with unions, including the AWU.\nBut Mr McDine made it clear on Friday that the company should not be encouraged by the concessions given by unions to BlueScope management.\n\"All companies, including the likes of OneSteel and Arrium, should not see this as a green light,\" he said.\nThe dramatic concessions at BlueScope, which also include an effective strike freeze, follows the company's warning in August that $60 million in costs, including 500 jobs, would have to be cut at Port Kembla or it would close the plant and import commodity steel .\nThe union concessions are contingent on the company board deciding to keep the Port Kembla. Sources said the agreement achieved $170 million in cuts and would require an injection of about $30 million from the NSW government to reach the company's target.\nBut the company's bid to achieve payroll tax and other concessions from the state government is yet to be secured. A spokesman for NSW Industry Minister Anthony Roberts, has said the government remained in productive discussions with BlueScope ahead of the board considering the ongoing viability of the steelworks.\nMr McDine called on NSW Premier Mike Baird to deliver the payroll tax relief. He said the state government was \"sitting on its hands\" and needed to make a decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:35:58.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
