Related \nThe signs read, “Don’t vote for Ho Chi Chin; vote for more jobs not welfare.” Chin is of Asian decent. \nThe signs were discovered hanging from buildings on Main Street and Pine Street. \n“The future of Lewiston is too important to be sidetracked by filth like this,” said Chin in an email. “It will only make me fight harder to bring people together to revitalize Lewiston and improve our city’s reputation.” \nMayor Bob MacDonald told WMTW News 8 in a phone interview that he has nothing to do with the signs. MacDonald is running for reelection. \nMacDonald said he overheard talk of the signs in a coffee shop and told the person, “Please don’t do it. It will only come back on me,” he said. \nIt is unclear who is responsible for posting the signs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:18:15.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
