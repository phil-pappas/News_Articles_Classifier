We will continue to build the case for intervention in the new Parliament.”\nConflict: Russian airstrikes on Syria\nHis comments came after the former chief of MI6, Sir John Sawers, warned there was a “real danger” of clashes between Russian and coalition warplanes if they mount rival operations in the skies over Syria.\nDavid Cameron has made clear that while he wants to join the US in attacking IS in Syria, he will only seek a Commons vote if he can be sure of victory.\nNew Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has indicated he would vote against military action, but allow his MPs a free vote.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MirrorPolitics", "https://twitter.com/Jack_Blanchard_", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/+Mirror/posts", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:02:35.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
