Those fatal shootings come on the heels of the violence at Umpqua Community College (UCC), where Mr. Obama visited the families of victims on Friday. \nImmediately following the UCC shooting, which left nine dead and nine others injured, Obama had expressed his anger regarding the nation’s lax gun laws.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:49:09.829+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
