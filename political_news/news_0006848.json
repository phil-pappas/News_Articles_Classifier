We talk about medicinal cannabis. Actually, there’s no such thing. There’s medicinal cannabis products. And I think it would be very, very good to get some much more specific and scientific evidence about the efficacy before we can make decisions,” said Mr Dunne. \nBoth Mr Dunne and campaigner Toni-Marie Matich said there was still a stigma attached to cannabis based products: \nAbsolutely. We’ve written to and approached 300 organisations this year to have really logical, responsible discussion for their patients said Toni-Marie Matich. Look, it took six months and three banks to get a bank account she said. \nHere’s the link to the full interview: http://tvnz.co.nz/q-and-a-news/dunne-open-medicinal-marijuana-video-6406409 \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:36:31.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
