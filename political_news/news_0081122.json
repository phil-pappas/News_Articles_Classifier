They’re going to build a plant and illegals are going drive those cars right over the border.” As the crowd laughed and cheered, Trump one-upped himself yet again, taking one more jab at illegal immigrants: “And they’ll probably end up stealing the cars.” \nOver the four-month span of Trump’s run for the presidential seat, a number of controversial issues have come and gone. But illegal immigration has remained firm in a multitude of Trump’s speeches, guaranteed to excite conservative audiences nationwide. \nIn announcing his candidacy in mid-June, Trump said the “U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems” and that Mexico is “sending people that have lots of problems.” In setting the tone for his campaign, Trump said: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” \nIt’s no surprise to anyone that the comments sparked anger and a number of companies cut their ties with Trump, including Macy’s department store. \n“When I started talking about illegal immigration, they thought it might not be politically correct — and now they don’t sell my ties anymore,” said Trump, who has surged in the polls since then and continues to dominate across the country. “Oh, and by the way, I know one thing: They wish they didn’t do that because they would be selling more ties right now.” \nIn response to some harsh criticism, Trump said he doesn’t understand the backlash. \n“I love Mexico, and I love the Mexican people,” Trump said. “I have thousands of Hispanics working for me, and they’re great, and they do a great job.” \nBut perhaps the wording rubbed some the wrong way, much like it did celebrity chef José Andrés, a Spanish immigrant who backed out of plans to open a restaurant in the hotel Trump is building in D.C. The sudden dropout has resulted in The Trump Organization suing Andrés for $10 million. \n“They Don’t work FOR You,”Andrés tweeted on Wednesday night, “They work ‘With’ You….” Such sentiments were put on the backburner Wednesday night by a crowd that laughed at Trump’s jokes, cheered his campaign promises, and kept chanting: “Trump! Trump! Trump!” Trump’s speech flowed so fluently, it was almost as if he was having a conversation with the audience rather than giving a speech. \nEarlier that evening, Trump talked about Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl leaving his post in Afghanistan, leading to his eventual capture and the need for his rescue. \n“Six people died going after him and nothing’s going to happen,” Trump said to the crowd of supporters. “Can you believe this? This is what has happened.” \nMinutes later, the outspoken Republican brought up his distaste for being “politically correct,” in which a man from the audience yelled an expletive to describe his thoughts on political correctness. \n“It’s true,” said a smiling Trump. “If I said that, they would be writing horrible stories about me all the time. It’s so good that he said that. I love that! Feel free to interject. I love that.” \nTrump marveled the crowd’s energy and enthusiasm as his near hour-long speech came to an end. \n“There’s a movement going on,” he said. “It’s a strong movement. You know, they used to call it the silent majority? It’s not silent. That term doesn’t work.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:01:02.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
