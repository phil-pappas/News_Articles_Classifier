Some refused to partner with her. Some interrupted Jeanneret and talked over her. Still, others talked only to Mauldin as if Jeanneret did not exist. ​ ​ As he continued as a student in the mechanical engineering program at Eastern Washington University in Cheney, Maudlin often observed men slighting women. He realized that the females in the program worked harder than many of the men, simply to be accepted.\n​Mauldin also teaches a technology class to children and found that the bias started at a young age. Female siblings of students who showed interested in the class seemed discouraged from enrolling, and parents \" confided to Maudlin that their daughters feared being in a class with all boys. ​\"\nHis observations are in line with a global observation that women are underrepresented in STEM fields due to several barriers , including societal and cultural stereotypes taught at a young age and ​gender bias and discrimination ​ within the field.\n​\"Nothing I said was new, it has all been said a thousand times before. The difference is that I am a man,\" Mauldin told the Huffington Post . \"Maybe by standing up and breaking the silence from the male side, I can help some more men begin to see the issues, and begin to listen to the women who have been speaking about this all along.\" ​\nFollow Prachi on Twitter . ​", "external_links": ["http://www.today.com/parents/were-unequal-engineering-students-humble-letter-praises-female-peers-feats-t48856#", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x853/gallery-1444403221-12049260-1009255895783473-8538477281376862148-n.jpg", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-men-engineers-arent-equal-jared-mauldin-letter_561699b9e4b0e66ad4c6bee5?utm_hp_ref=women&ir=Women&section=women", "http://easterneronline.com/36007/letters-to-the-editor/letter-to-the-editor-stem/", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/480x640/gallery-1444403221-12049260-1009255895783473-8538477281376862148-n.jpg", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1444403221-12049260-1009255895783473-8538477281376862148-n.jpg", "https://twitter.com/prachigu", "http://www.today.com/parents/were-unequal-engineering-students-humble-letter-praises-female-peers-feats-t48856", "https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~srugheimer/Women_in_STEM_Resources.html", "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/640x320/landscape-1444403221-12049260-1009255895783473-8538477281376862148-n.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:08:36.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
