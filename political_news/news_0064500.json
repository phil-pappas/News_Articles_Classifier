It's well overdue. \n\"The median hourly pay of men is nearly 12 percent, or $3 an hour, more than that of women, and this year the gender pay gap actually increased under National. \n\"It’s time for all political parties to show leadership on gender equity, and I hope the Government’s announcement today is the start of National finally getting that message. \n\"Last week the Greens announced that when in Government half of our Cabinet appointees will be women. \n\"I hope today’s announcement is a sign the Government is ready to take the lead on promoting gender equity,\" Ms Logie said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:23:42.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
