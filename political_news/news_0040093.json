But we felt we must do something on our own to fight back,\" Fox said over email. \nMeanwhile, the union backed Progressive Seattle PAC was formed in support of candidates Seattle City Council candidates Kshama Sawant (District 3) and Lisa Herbold (District 1). It list contributions of $3,000, so far, from Teamsters Local 117 and the Electrical Workers PAC. \nCampaign watchers expect IE spending to ramp up in the next couple of weeks. \nUnlike, individual donations to a candidate, independent expenditures don't have limits but cannot be made in connection with an individual candidate or the candidate's campaign. So candidates are not supposed to know how that money is being used to help their campaigns. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read  //www.king5.com/story/news/politics/city/2015/10/06/whos-behind-the-new-ie-commitees-citizens-alliance-for-limited-growth--progressive-seattle/73462716/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:37:18.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
