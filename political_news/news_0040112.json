By BRIAN ROHAN and MARAM MAZENAssociated Press \nCAIRO (AP) - Egyptians on Sunday began voting in the nation's first parliamentary election since the military's 2013 ouster of Egypt's first freely elected president and the election a year later of the general who removed him. \nThe vote is likely to produce a legislature packed with supporters of Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, a soldier-turned-president who has since taking office 16 months ago waged a campaign to revive the country's ailing economy, fight an Islamic insurgency and assume a greater role in a turbulent Middle East - all while silencing opposition at home. \nFearing attacks by Islamic militants to disrupt the vote, tens of thousands of police and soldiers have been deployed to secure the election, many of whom were in full combat gear, complete with camouflaged fatigues, helmets and body armor. Some wore ski masks. \nThere was a resolve among early voters Sunday to keep Islamists out of the 596-legislature, with some saying they are casting their ballots specifically to ensure that. Mohammed Morsi, the president ousted by el-Sissi, belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic group now banned and labeled a terrorist organization. \nHowever, the Salafi Al-Nour party, an ultraconservative Islamic group that supported the ouster of one-time ally Morsi, is running in this election. \n\"I came to vote because it is my duty, if not enough people show up to vote, the country will fall into the hands of the Brotherhood and the Salafis. Then we will have more of a mess,\" said Nahed Aref, a retired jeweler, while waiting in line to cast her vote in the district of Dokki in Giza, Cairo's twin city. \n\"The main issue for me is voting for candidates who are neither Salafis or Brotherhood. We need to separate religion from politics,\" she said. \nAnother retiree in Giza, Mamdouh Abdel-Aziz, 72, walked 30 minutes to reach his designated polling center and waited another 30 in line to cast his ballot. \n\"My hope is that the election will strengthen Egypt ... and that we aren't controlled by someone with a beard or someone who uses religion for personal gain,\" he said, alluding to Islamists. \nEgyptians residing abroad began voting Saturday and will continue Sunday, the first of two days of voting in 15 provinces, including Giza and the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria. About 27 of Egypt's registered 54 million voters reside in the 15 provinces where voting is taking place Sunday. \nVoting in Egypt's 13 other provinces, including the capital Cairo, will be on Nov. 22-23. Each stage of the vote will be followed by a runoff. \nFinal results for the 596-seat parliament will be announced in early December. \nMany analysts and observers expect a low turnout despite President Abdel-Fattah's el-Sissi's impassioned call Saturday on Egyptians to come out and vote. \n\"Line up in front of polling stations and plant with your votes the hope for a bright tomorrow for our new Egypt,\" said the soldier-turned-president in a televised address. \nThe next parliament will be the first elected after the adoption last year of a new constitution, arguably the most liberal Egypt has ever had. The constitution empowers lawmakers, albeit under stringent conditions, to impeach the president, call for early presidential elections or withdraw confidence from the prime minster or individual members of his Cabinet. \nBut analysts and observers say el-Sissi has made sure that the next parliament will be subservient to his will so that he can press ahead with his policies without the distraction of serious political opposition. \nA compliant chamber will harken back to those elected under Hosni Mubarak, the authoritarian leader ousted in a 2011 popular uprising, when election after election gave his National Democratic Party an overwhelming majority amid credible claims of rigging, fraud and police interference. \nUnder a new election law he decreed last year, 448 of the house's seats will be contested by \"individuals\" - or candidates not linked to any political group, a system that, critics say, will favor wealthy government-connected businessmen and powerbrokers with strong local patronage networks, in what is essentially a repeat of the Mubarak-era model. Only 120 lawmakers will be elected on party lists, while el-Sissi will appoint 28 others, potentially bolstering support for his rule in the chamber. \nShopkeeper Mohammed Hussein predicted that, \"the turnout will be low because we don't know the people running.\" \n\"I personally just voted for the first guy I saw. I am only participating for el-Sissi,\" Hussein, 60, said after he cast his ballot in the crowded Giza district of Imbaba, a one-time stronghold of Islamists. \nThe election is being held amid a climate of fear not seen in decades and a tightly controlled public sphere. \nBacked by a population longing for stability and peace after the chaos and bloodshed that followed Mubarak's ouster, authorities have gradually shown less and less tolerance for dissent since Morsi's ouster. Security forces have since killed hundreds of Islamists in a series of deadly clashes in the summer of 2013 and jailed thousands more, of whom scores have been sentenced to death after trials criticized by rights groups as flawed or hasty. \nDraconian restrictions on demonstrations since late 2013 have all but killed street activism of any kind. Human rights abuses by the police go mostly unpunished or even investigated and authorities have shown little concern over recent cases of young activists opposed to el-Sissi's government or linked to the Brotherhood disappearing. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Nour Youssef contributed to this report.
