Usually at the beginning of the campaign, undecided is around 15 to 20 per cent,\" Nanos said.\nAccording to the pollster, the early decisiveness was coupled with signals many were unsure which party they would support.\n\"The interesting thing is that undecided vote was down, but the level of switchers between the New Democrats and the Liberals was exceptionally high. It was at a historic high in terms of the Nanos tracking,\" he said.\n\"People were going to get out and vote, but they just weren't sure … whether it would be for the New Democrats or the Liberals. And it looks like, right now, they're looking at the Liberals.\"\nPoll methodology \nA national dual - frame (land and cell) random telephone survey is conducted nightly by Nanos Research throughout the campaign using live agents. Each evening a new group of 400 eligible voters are interviewed. An oversample of 800 interviews was conducted on Friday and Saturday.\nThe daily tracking figures are based on a three-day rolling sample composed of 2,000 interviews. To update the tracking a new day of interviewing is added and the oldest day dropped. The margin of error for a survey of 1,825 decided voters is ±2.3 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.\nLarger sample \nToday's three-day rolling average is based on 2,000 interviews (800 interviews Saturday, 800 interviews Friday and 400 interviews Thursday).\nFull poll at Nanos Research\nFollow @niknanos on Twitter\nRelated Stories Nanos survey: 7 in 10 Canadians feel it's 'time for a change' Campaign catch-up: The themes that dominated Elections Canada anticipates heavy voter turnout on Monday Five things to know about voting in the federal election Related Links Nanos Nightly Tracking, released daily at 6 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:18:33.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
