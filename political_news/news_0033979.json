Your Right to Know Enlarge Image Request to buy this photo Barbara J. Perenic | Dispatch Issue 38 would require that rezonings in Worthington not take effect for 60 days, instead of the current 20. \nThe video shows Worthington folks enjoying their yards and single-family homes in established neighborhoods surrounded by lots of trees and green space. \nA female narrator, backed by a soothing, upbeat melody, talks about the “special place” that is the suburb. \nSo special, she says, “you don’t want to lose what you can’t get back.” \nVote for Issue 38 on Nov. 3 “to keep Worthington beautiful,” she tells viewers of the Facebook video. \nIssue 38 would change the city charter so that property rezonings would not take effect for 60 days, an increase from the current 20. The waiting period would give residents more time to mount a campaign to overturn the rezoning by a referendum. \nThe issue also would prohibit the city council from declaring a rezoning an emergency that takes immediate effect. >> Dispatch Voters Guide: Check out a sample ballot customized to your residence \nThe Keep Worthington Beautiful website says the city is “facing large-scale development pressures in the heart of our city, and decisions being made today will determine the character of Worthington for generations to come.” \nIssue 38’s chief target is Lifestyle Communities’ proposal for the United Methodist Children’s Home property on High Street . \nLifestyle Communities has in mind a mixed-use development with office and retail space and 350 high-end apartments fronting High Street. Behind all that would be a residential zone of 250 homes ranging from $200,000 town houses to million-dollar “estate” homes. A fourth of the property would be green space, Lifestyle Communities said. \n“Here’s another developer coming to town to put in a lot of densely populated apartments,” Sean Demaree said. “I think Worthington has enough apartments already. We don’t need more transient population.” \nDemaree is running for a seat on the city council. He supports Issue 38, as do Councilman Doug Smith and council candidate Doug Foust. \nAfter more than a year of public meetings, the city council passed a comprehensive plan in September 2014 that recommends how the UMCH site should be developed. It has not approved a rezoning or development plan for the 41-acre parcel. \nUnder Issue 38, if residents collected enough signatures for a referendum, the question would go on the next general-election ballot. Until that vote, the rezoning would be in limbo. \n“You could wait up to 18 months,” said real-estate broker and Worthington resident Tom Dalcolma. Developers who often eye more than one city for a project would reject Worthington as “ anti-business,” he said. \nDalcolma is a member of Keep Worthington Working. The group, formed to oppose Issue 38, also has a website and Facebook page. \nAny property owner, including a small business or a homeowner seeking a rezoning, would have to wait 60 days, the group said. \nDemaree said the city is spreading unfounded fears about Issue 38. \nIt makes sense for a business moving to Worthington to choose a property already zoned for commercial use, Demaree said. He said the group’s research showed that a rezoning was required in Worthington only six times between 2007 and 2014. \nThe UMCH property has “exempt charitable” zoning. That would have to be rezoned to accommodate mixed residential use. \nCity Council President Bonnie Michael said Issue 38 would hurt the city’s economic growth by turning away development, such as offices with well-paid workers contributing to the city’s tax base. \n“Seventy-five percent of our budget is income tax,” Michael said. \nShe and another council candidate, Candy Brooks, oppose Issue 38. \nAccording to the city’s website, there have been 136 zoning changes since 1971, with only one referendum vote. \nDalcolma said the council doesn’t give developers a free pass. \n“You have to go through the municipal planning commission, the architectural review board, the city council,” he said, and each is willing to bend over backward for residents. \nThe city-approved comprehensive plan for the UMCH site provides only guidelines. \nMore than 300 people attended a public meeting on the UMCH proposal in June. Most of them seemed to call for no apartments and more single-family homes and green space. \nIssue 38 will not deter Lifestyle Communities from pursuing the project, even if an eventual rezoning goes to a referendum, said Chase Miller, the company’s director of development. \n“We have that risk with every city, every zoning,” he said. \nMiller said Lifestyle Communities is committed to the entire project, including single-family, empty-nester housing and green space. The apartments would rent for between $1,100 and $1,650, the company said. \n“These are people who can afford a home but who we call ‘renters by choice,’  ” Miller said. \nMichael said city officials have offered to extend the waiting period for rezonings to 30 days. The city’s Chamber of Commerce supports the compromise. \nKeep Worthington Beautiful rejected the idea, Demaree said. “Why would you give away your upper hand?” \nIssue 38 supporters said even 30 days is not enough, noting that it took them 75 days to organize, circulate petitions for the issue and submit them to the Franklin County Board of Elections for approval.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:53:15.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
