Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\nEducation Minister Simon Birmingham has been a passionate advocate for a controversial US-style school voucher system that would likely encourage more families to exit the public school system.\nThe debate about school vouchers - in which students are allocated a set amount of funding that follows them to whichever school their parents enrol them in - is one of the most ideologically charged in education circles.\nSupporters say vouchers empower low-income families and increase competition between schools while opponents say they lead to widening gaps between the public and private sectors.\nIn his maiden speech to Parliament in 2007, Senator Birmingham said a voucher system should be trialled, even if leads more parents to pull their children out of public schools. Politicians traditionally use their first speech to outline the beliefs that drove them into politics.\nAdvertisement \"Families who can afford to choose between an overly bureaucratised government school and a responsive private school have voted with their feet in recent years, shifting en masse from the public to the private sector,\" he said.\n\"But those who most need choice – people in areas of disadvantage with low incomes – are those who most miss out. It is time that at least one state, in at least one region, trialled the implementation of school vouchers – affording all families the opportunity of choice, the opportunity to allocate the government funding for their child to pay the fees to the school of their choice.\n\"The neediest should not be the ones to miss out on choice and, if even more families were to opt out of the government system, administrators would have clear evidence of the need to overhaul the teaching and/or management of such schools.\"\nSenator Birmingham, who attended a local public school in Adelaide, predicted that many would \"baulk\" at the idea, but said \"great advances are not made by standing still\".\nHe also expressed an interest in performance-based pay for teachers as a way to boost student results.\nIn a 2012 opinion piece, Senator Birmingham said, \"Parents should be free to choose the education that best suits their child,with government funding appropriate to the students' needs moving with that student, regardless of the type of school they attend\".\nHe also expressed support for US-style charter schools (privately managed public schools).\nAsked whether he still supported a trial of school vouchers, Senator Birmingham said any funding changes would \"require leadership from the states\".\n\"I will engage in any constructive discussions with the states about how to best empower families in areas of disadvantage to access the best possible education for their children, but vouchers are not the policy of the government and our focus remains firmly on how to lift teacher quality, school autonomy, parental engagement and, ultimately, student outcomes,\" he said.\nLabor school education spokeswoman Kate Ellis said: \"A voucher system would equate to the government washing their hands of any responsibility for our schools.\n\"Simon Birmingham needs to rule out introducing a voucher-style system which he has so clearly longed for, and which will simply exacerbate the divide between well-off and disadvantaged schools.\"\nJennifer Buckingham, a research fellow at the free-market Centre for Independent Studies, said vouchers were a fair and transparent funding system for schools. But she said they would be difficult to introduce in Australia because of the federal-state funding system. They would also probably lead to \"huge increases\" in education budgets and could push up private school fees unless they were capped.\nAustralian Education Union President Correna Haythorpe said vouchers would advantage the richest schools.\n\"We don't need a debate about vouchers – we need the federal government to commit to delivering the full six years of the Gonski agreements,\" she said.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-26T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:26:39.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
