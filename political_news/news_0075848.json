But the way it stopped on this beautiful fall day and looked at me — maybe because I instinctively called out, “Here, kitty, kitty!” — made me think it was a visitor from hell.\nAs I have said many times, what are the Cubs without symbols?\nThe incident made me wonder once again about that infamous black cat near the on-deck circle at Shea Stadium during a key Cubs-Mets matchup in 1969. Who brought that terrible animal into the park? And how? In a suitcase? A paper bag? Tucked under one’s arm like a football?\nIf you thought the 2015 Cubs season was one of near ecstasy and optimism, despite the embarrassing sweep in the National League Championship Series by — of course — the Mets, then symbols are not for you. The Cubs’ bright future is guaranteed for you. If 2015 has a symbol — for you — it is bubbly wine squirting endlessly from Joe Maddon’s Binny’s-sponsored champagne bottles.\nAnd you feel this way even though the Cubs lost the series by the combined score of 21-8, never leading for one moment, being routed by a team that no one predicted would be in the World Series.\nWhy do you feel this way? Because you believe 2015 was just a way station on the road to Cubs greatness. This Theo Epstein-built team will only get better and better. The young players will only get better and better.\nYou are a congenital Cubs optimist.\nI salute you. I salute your DNA.\nBut you ignore the only known fact: It has now been 107 years since the Cubs won the World Series. And the clock is ticking on 108.\nConsider, at key positions, the triumphant Mets are a young team, one that rivals the Cubs’ current kiddie corps. Just as the Mets were young in that first black-cat year, 1969.\n“That’s a great comparison,” said Hall of Famer Billy Williams, who was part of the 1969 Cubs team ruined by the Mets, “when you look at the pitching staff of this Mets club and the club in 1969.”\nThat is, back in the day, Tom Seaver was 24, Jerry Koosman was 26, Gary Gentry was 22, closer Tug McGraw was 25 and a guy named Nolan Ryan was 22.\nThis year? Mets righty Matt Harvey is 26, closer Jeurys Familia is 26, Jacob deGrom is 27, Noah Syndergaard is 23 and Game 4 starter Steven Matz is 24. Shortstop Wilmer Flores is 24, catcher Travis d’Arnaud is 26, shortstop Ruben Tejada (out with a broken leg) is 25 and outfielder Michael Conforto is 22.\nThe point is: Where do you think the Mets are going? Away?\nSame with the Cardinals, who actually won the Cubs’ division with a 100-62 record. (Remember, the Cubs finished third.) You think that St. Louis organization is going to sit back and let the Cubs take over? After being in the playoffs 12 times starting in 2000, including playing in four World Series, winning two?\nJust before Game 4 began, young left fielder Kyle Schwarber turned to the bleachers and the grandstands near him and applauded the crowd, thanking the fans, getting them fired up. It was a lovely gesture, one of inclusion, friendship.\nThen he threw the warmup ball into the bleachers. Only he missed. The ball fell short of the basket, the reaching fans. So he ran and got it, and tossed it over his head to them just as the game was about to start.\nAn omen of his poor play to come?\nAs stated earlier, everything becomes an omen, a talisman, a symbol, a metaphor, a fleeting ghost in Cubs history. It has to be this way because nobody alive has ever seen the team win a championship.\nWhat else are there but symbols?\nUnless Cubs fans are content being teased and tickled and optimistic about vapor.\nFans had no problem when the franchise admittedly tanked for three years, not even attempting to win, to build “for the future.” Such a strategy has never been used by a major-market team, but with Cubs fans, that was just fine. No one loves promise and potential more than they.\nEpstein, the president of baseball operations, acknowledged the final pain of this season in his wrap-up speech Thursday, saying, “But that’s baseball, and that’s life.”\nAn optimist, he added, “I think as time fades, the memories we’ll hold closest will be the memories of all the accomplishments, the 97 wins, the 13 walk-offs, the wild-card game, the Cardinals series.”\nThat will be true only if the Cubs make it to the World Series, soon. There is no other reasonable response. If this Cubs team does not win a pennant, then a championship, what is all this but sleight of hand?\nHere’s an example of how the Cubs are different, how they do things, historically, that other winning clubs do not. The “Schwar-board Ball,” the big tater hit by Schwarber in the last game of the NL Division Series, the one that landed on the right-field video board that would never have been encased in plexiglass by the Yankees or Cardinals. Maybe if it was the game-winning homer to win the World Series. But not if it was just the final home run in an already-won game halfway to the big prize.\nYou see what I mean? The joy everyone felt at that moment — myself included — was a false one. It was a Cubs joy.\nSo my black cat vanished down a walkway. Meaningless, irrelevant.\nBut there.\nFollow me on Twitter @ricktelander.\nEmail: rtelander@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:47:10.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
