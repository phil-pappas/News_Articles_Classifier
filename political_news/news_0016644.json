The tax would target trading strategies that involve significant numbers of order cancelations, a practice the Democrat's campaign says makes markets \"less stable and less fair.\"\nHer campaign released the plan Wednesday night just days before the first Democratic debate puts her on stage with her primary rivals.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
