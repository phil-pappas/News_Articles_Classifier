That's his new enemy.\" \nTucker Carlson argued that Islamic extremists or ISIS members would have been more appropriate enemies. \n\"The [Supreme Serpent] is an American who has misgivings about unlimited illegal immigration and the costs associated with it,\" Carlson said. \"And that, according to the comic book, is evil.\" \n\"Right, so these serpents are stopping people from coming over the border and Captain America is saying, 'That's not going to happen on my watch, I'm Captain America,'\" Morris agreed. \"An interesting discussion around the idea of [immigrants bringing] disease and rapists and everything else.\" \nCarlson declared that Marvel was portraying average Americans as \"snake-handling bigots and they need to be held in place or else they'll turn this country into Nazi Germany. It's like, the people who run this country, a lot of them actually believe that. I live near them. They really think that.\" \n\"They should do a comic book on the opposite,\" co-host Health Childers offered. \"The people who are working the border to keep us safe.\" \nMorris called for comic books to return to story lines like Captain America \"punching Hitler in the face.\" \n\"And now the threat comes from ordinary Americans,\" Carlson lamented. \"Probably some of you watching at home, they think you're dangerous.\" \n\"Keep politics out of comic books,\" Childers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:03:12.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
