In a letter sent today to the FDA, Stephen Gray, chief counsel of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, argued that if the state meets a series of five criteria, including that the drug, sodium thiopental, is from an FDA-registered source, then it is legal to import. Ohio has not executed an inmate since Jan. 16, 2014, when Dennis McGuire struggled and gasped for several minutes before succumbing to a combination of drugs being used for the first time anywhere in the U.S. The FDA in June warned state prison officials that the agency learned the state was trying to obtain bulk dosages of sodium thiopental, which is not available in the United States. “Please note that there is no FDA-approved application for sodium thiopental, and it is illegal to import an unapproved new drug into the United States,” the FDA wrote. The state did not follow through with a foreign drug purchase, and state officials responded today arguing that there is a legal way to import the drug under a 2012 court ruling. “The responsibility to carry out lawful and humane executions when called upon by the courts to do so is enormous, and it is the responsibility that ODRC does not take lightly,” Gray wrote. “ To that end, ODRC has no intention of attempting to procure drugs for legal injection in a manner that would violate a proper interpretation of the (Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act).” Gray wrote that he wants to start talks with the FDA to determine how to legally procure drugs for lethal injection. Ohio is trying to find drugs for its scheduled execution of Ronald Phillips of Summit County on Jan. 21, 2016. An additional 23 executions have been set through 2019. Under state procedures, officials must ensure there are sufficient quantities of execution drugs approximately 30 days prior to the execution date. “DRC continues to seek all legal means to obtain the drugs necessary to carry out court ordered executions,” said agency spokeswoman JoEllen Smith. “This process has included multiple options.” Ohio is hardly the only state facing problems with executions. Oklahoma this week announced it would delay all future executions as it investigates how the wrong drug was apparently used as part of a three-drug cocktail during an execution in January. Meanwhile, an Arkansas judge stopped the executions of eight inmates after some inmates challenged a new law allowing the state to keep secret the identity of its execution drug manufacturers. Ohio in late 2014 passed a bill permitting the Department of Corrections to buy different chemicals under a secret contract with a “compounding pharmacy” that mixes ingredients to a user’s specifications. So far that law has not led the state to obtain the drugs needed for executions. The last domestic manufacturer of sodium thiopental stopped production in 2011, largely because states were using it for executions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:54:16.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
