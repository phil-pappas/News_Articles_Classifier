Apparently, soup is also gay food. \nOnce again, Campbell's is pulling on the heartstrings of Americans. In the same way the company brought us the warm feelings about eating hot soup on a cold day or showing the snow melt away from the snow man to reveal a cute young boy who just came in from winter play, now Campbell's is now sharing a warm scene of 2 real-life dads and their young son enjoying soup together. \nYin Woon Rani, Campbell's vice president of marketing activation, described the campaign in a statement on the company's website: We wanted to show actual families, which means families of different configurations, cultures, races and life choices. The American family is changing faster than at any time in recent history and it is now a true mosaic of shapes and sizes, all bonded through love, and love of good food. \nMonica Cole of the American Family Association describes the commercial and what it is portraying this way: It starts off with the first man feeding soup to the little boy and in a \"Star Wars\" Darth Vader voice says, \"Luke, I am your father.\" Then the other man enters the scene and says, \"No, Luke, I am your father.\" How confusing for this little boy and for all children viewing this commercial. Obviously, Campbell's is sending the message that homosexual men are raising children, whom they wouldn’t have if a woman wasn’t involved, and they are ok with it. Campbell’s Soup is glorifying this unnatural marriage. One Million Moms believes family is based on love, but this does not justify normalizing sin. 1MM does not agree with the need for Campbell’s to support same sex marriages or couples.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:47:53.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
