Sanders showed off some of his moves during the interview, which aired in the U.S. on Thursday (October 15), as he danced onto the set - the typical entrance of many of DeGeneres' guests. He then played a game of question and answer with DeGeneres. Among the questions, he was asked what Republican candidate he'd want to be stuck with on a desert island, Sanders responded, \"Marco Rubio; he's used to the sun.\" Sanders, a 74-year-old U.S. senator from Vermont, is trailing Clinton in most polls, but is considered the strongest contender for the Democratic nomination after the former U.S. Secretary of State.
