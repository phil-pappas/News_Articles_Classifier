Instead, she began a new battle with Hobby Lobby, her employer for 17 years, over her ability to use the women's restroom both as an employee and a customer. This month, a decision was unveiled announcing that state judge sided with Sommerville, agreeing that the craft chain's refusal to allow her to use the restroom of her gender is a form of discrimination that violates the Illinois Human Rights Act . In an interview with Cosmopolitan.com, Sommerville explains why she sued Hobby Lobby, how she has been affected at work, and why, despite everything, she would never leave her job.\n I started working for Hobby Lobby in 1998. I was out of work and my unemployment just ended. I had known about Hobby Lobby for several years. Every floral piece we had for our wedding came from there. I was very familiar with their Christian perspective, that they were closed on Sundays, but I was walking into the unknown. I'd never worked retail before, but I needed a job. I wasn't even done filling out the application and the manager said, \"OK, when can you start?\"\n They put me back in the framing department right away. I learned from people who had been framing for years and I learned quickly. There were some minor issues when I worked there, but you're always going to have some bumps when you work for one employer for a long time. They never wanted to terminate me or anything like that. I brought in pretty good numbers for them, I had a very loyal customer base.\nMy being transgender was probably the worst-kept secret in the store. I dressed as androgynously as possible. I felt very uncomfortable even shopping in the men's department. I have no hesitation in saying, yes, for 20-plus years I only shopped in the women's department because that was where I felt comfortable. So my shirts and things may have been obvious to some people that they were female attire rather than male attire. But no one said anything to me. Everything was kept professional.\nTransitioning for me was a longer process. I started with laser hair removal on my face — that was something that bugged me from puberty. That was three years on and off just for that. For a long time I had my hair longer, I colored my hair. For a long time, I did whatever I could to feel like I could express a part of me — maybe not the whole thing, but trying to express part of myself.\nIt finally got to the point where my marriage fell apart. Things took a bad turn and I ended up homeless. I finally decided, There we are, I don't have a safe place where I can be myself. I can't be this other person to the rest of the world anymore. It was just too much for me. It really was leading a double life.\nI started hormone therapy, medication to suppress testosterone. It was a bit slow, but there were a few people in the store that I confided in. They got to know who I really was and I had the opportunity to really be myself, and that wasn't something I could do anyplace else. It really did help me make the final decision, knowing they would be there to support me and encourage me and even laugh with me as I was going through essentially a second puberty.\nI am a woman, and being forced to use the men's restroom forces me to deny who I am.\nShare Tweet My manager already knew I was trans, but in the spring of 2010, I sat down with my manager and two co-managers and told them that I was going to the county courthouse to file paperwork to legally change my name. I was relying heavily on the change in the Human Rights Act here in Illinois, where they changed the wording to include and protect sexual orientation in 2006. I had that in my back pocket, thinking no matter what the reaction was in the store, Hobby Lobby was probably going to be aboveboard and follow the law.\nThe reaction from the managers was, \"OK, talk to HR,\" but I remember my manager saying she didn't foresee any problem. It didn't become a problem until I was asked, \"Well, once you transition, are you planning on using the women's restroom?\" I was like, \"Yeah, because I'm a woman.\" The day after I came back from the courthouse having changed my name, I was told I was not allowed to use the women's restroom.\nI am a woman, and being forced to use the men's restroom forces me to deny who I am. It's humiliating. It's embarrassing. And it's potentially dangerous. The history of violence against the trans community is very well documented , and that's something that is always in the back of my mind. What is the reaction going to be if someone catches me in here or if I am discovered using the men's bathroom? What's a mom going to say if she has her son going into the men's restroom and a woman's walking out? That puts me into a very awkward and potentially unsafe situation.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/41/1600x800/landscape-1444592779-meggan-sommerville-1.jpg", "http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/pdf/Sommervilleruling.pdf", "http://www.hrc.org/resources/entry/a-national-crisis-anti-transgender-violence", "http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActID=2266&ChapterID=64"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:14.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
