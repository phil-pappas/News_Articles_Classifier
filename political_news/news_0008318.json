Mr. David, who was a creator of “Seinfeld” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” provided a spot-on impersonation of the Vermont senator-turned-presidential candidate, raging against billionaires and big banks. But while Mr. David may have set the bar for portraying the candidate, it is worth noting that he is not the only one with a Bernie Sanders impression. It is hard to find anyone in this small city in northern Vermont who does not have a story about meeting Mr. Sanders for the first time in person, and many will offer their own take on the man without much urging . As they share their stories, the tone of their voices sometimes drops an octave or two, the occasional “billionaire” becomes a “billion-AY-ah,” the consonants punctuated by a slightly harsher cluck, and the leafy pedestrian Church Street starts to sound a little more like Flatbush Avenue. Indeed, Mr. Sanders’s thick Brooklyn accent , developed as a child growing up in the Flatbush neighborhood and oddly never dissipating despite living for decades in Vermont, is able to be replicated, to varying degrees of accuracy, by most who have called Burlington home for a number of years. But perhaps most notable in their impressions is the recitation of his message: Mr. Sanders, a politician since his successful run for Burlington mayor in 1981, has often spoken out about the poor and vanishing middle class, railing against income inequality. Indeed, as the residents of Burlington made their way through sharing an impression, they also made their way through his modern presidential stump speech, quoting their favorite lines, which, to them, sound the same now as they did when he was mayor, Brooklyn accent at all. \nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .
