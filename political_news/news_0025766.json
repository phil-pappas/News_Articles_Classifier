If you haven't cast your vote yet, make sure you do so on Oct. 19, 2015. By Canadian law, you get three consecutive hours off in order to vote , so your boss won't even get mad. \nIf you need some more convincing, however, The Huffington Post Canada has conducted an entirely unscientific analysis to find out what exactly the universe will bring upon you if you don't vote. \nFeel free to pass it around, or just send the individual cards below to relevant friends and family. \nAnd remember — if you don't vote, you don't get to complain. And we all love to complain. More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:14:47.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
