These attackers, Arab attackers, murdered several Jews, including our celebrated writer [Yosef Haim] Brenner.\"\n\"And this attack and other attacks on the Jewish community in 1920, 1921, 1929, were instigated by a call of the mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, who was later sought for war crimes in the Nuremberg trials because he had a central role in fomenting the final solution,\" the premier said. \"He flew to Berlin. Hitler didnâ€™t want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jews. And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said, 'If you expel them, they'll all come here.' 'So what should I do with them?' he asked. He said, 'Burn them'.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:35:04.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
