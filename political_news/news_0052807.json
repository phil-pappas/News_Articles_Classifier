That is people who believe that the biggest problem we face is over population and the competition for resources this will create. I've never bought this, for the same reasons Thomas Malthus was wrong originally - we tend to get more efficient at using the resources we have, extracting resources we didn't know we had and finding substitutes for resources that do become to scarce to use economically. What doesn't seem to get a lot of attention is the opposite problem. The global equivalent of what has happened in Europe and Japan. A fertility rate in freefall, an aging population which is declining and not enough people of working age to actually extract and use the resources we need.Here's the World Bank's data on fertility http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN... Bearing in mind that the replacement rate, i.e. the number needed to maintain a steady population is 2.1. So if you thought that this was a first world problem you're wrong. Thailand, Cuba and Puerto Rico are well below this. Even much of the Arab world is hovering in the 2-3 zone and falling, and to find positive growth you have to go to sub-Saharan Africa, which dominates the top zone. But even here it's falling dramatically. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate... The world as a whole is at 2.36, just above replaecment.Our current predicament in the UK of high prices for first time buyers and a large pension liability might be just a foretaste of global population decline, and the same problems on a world wide scale as billions of people live longer, work less, consume more and have fewer children. And the house prices and taxes required to cover it won't encourage people to have more children or have them younger, which might avert this.Anyone think we're going to run out of people before we run out of oil, water, land or food?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:13:01.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
