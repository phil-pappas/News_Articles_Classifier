The decision is taken due to the insurer's failure to timely execute a Bank of Russia instruction, namely, due to its non-compliance with financial sustainability and solvency requirements with respect to securing insurance reserves, procedure and conditions to invest capital and insurance reserve funds. The decision becomes effective the day it is published in the Bank of Russia Bulletin. Suspended licence shall mean a prohibition on entering into new insurance contracts and also on amending respective contracts resulting in increase in the existing obligations. The insurance agent shall accept applications on the occurrence of insured events and perform obligations. distributed by This content was issued by Central Bank of Russia on the 2015-10-07 and was initially posted on www.cbr.ru.
