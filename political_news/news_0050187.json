But in his place, practically everyone would be influenced––even in spite of themselves––by knowledge of what their father and big brother did in similar situations, especially given that every likeness and reversal will prompt commentary. As voters weigh whether to entrust the presidency to a third member of the Bush family, it is proper to reflect on the legacies of George H.W. and George W. Bush.\nThose family ties could be a strength. Surely Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton have gleaned insights and wisdom about being president from their unusual proximity to the office.\nThe question is whether Jeb’s family ties would influence him for better or worse overall. That depends, in part, on whether he sees his family’s legacy more clearly than those in his wing of the Republican Party, who tend to underrate Bush 41 and overrate Bush 43. Perhaps that political reality helps to explain why Jeb has shown no inclination to emulate a tremendously successful father, even as he defends a big brother who has easily done more to tarnish the family legacy than anyone else.\nReuters Whatever explains Jeb’s failure to embrace his father’s successes or to distance himself from his brother’s failures, the spectacle is confounding to anyone who steps back from America’s irrational political culture to survey the facts of Bush family history.\nWikimedia Commons The elder President Bush was a spectacularly impressive man from the start. After a privileged childhood complete with a chauffeur who drove him to grammar school, he attended Phillips Academy, graduating in a 1942 ceremony where Henry L. Stimson, the secretary of war, urged the elite graduates to attend college rather than enlisting. To the consternation of his parents, George H.W. signed up for the Navy anyway and was bound for the Pacific war mere weeks after his 18th birthday.\n“He became the war's youngest Navy pilot and flew Avenger bombers,” Walt Harrington wrote in one of the finest profiles of Bush. “His plane was hit. With smoke and flames pouring from his engine, Bush still dropped his 500-pound bombs on an enemy radio station before bailing out into the ocean. His two-man crew was killed. After hours at sea, Bush, sick and vomiting, was saved from Japanese gunboats by a U.S. submarine. He was a bonafide hero, the recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross. He would rack up 1,228 hours in the air and 58 combat missions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:00:46.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
