( Reuters ) Thursday night as our family gathered for our evening prayers, we prayed for the injured and the families of those killed at Umpqua Community College in Oregon by an anti-Christian gunman. We didn't know the names or all the details at the time, only that Christians were specifically targeted.\nAccording to witnesses the gunman asked his victims what their religion was. If they responded they were Christians, he shot them in the head. If they did not answer, he shot them in the leg.\nThose details were not discussed this weekend by President Obama when he spoke to the media about the shooting. Nor did he mention the heroic actions of 10-year Army veteran and 30-year-old father, Chris Mintz, who was shot multiple times when he tried to stop the shooter.\nRather, he immediately began using the tragic shooting that claimed the lives of nine people to advance his agenda for more laws restricting gun ownership. In his press conference, the president said some would claim he was politicizing the shooting, \"Well, this is something we should politicize.\"\nI agree. We should politicize the fact that the \"security guards\" were unarmed, because the college campus was a \"gun-free\" zone that prohibits law abiding citizens from protecting themselves and others.\nWe should politicize the toxic environment that President Obama's policies have fostered toward Christians.\nWe should politicize the fact that the president continues to not just tolerate, but fights for policies that further coarsen our culture and devalue human life.\n ", "external_links": ["http://shop.charismamag.com/collections/life-in-the-spirit/products/life-in-the-spirit?utm_source=charismanews.com&utm_medium=article", "https://secure.strangmagazines.com/~strangma/charisma/2015/40years/?utm_source=charismanews.com&utm_medium=article"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:55:03.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
