It led to someone editing his Wikipedia page to describe the encounter with Cathy Newman as \"pisspoor\". \nDuring the interview, Newman pressed him: \"You say you're not a deficit denier, so what is the deficit going to be this year?\" \nBurgon appeared unable or unwilling to answer. \"Well... I'm not an economic... I'm not somebody that's going to put a figure in a crystal ball at the end of the year,\" he said. \nNewman replied: \"You don't need a crystal ball. It's in the government's figures, it's in the government's financial forecast.\" \nBurgon said: \"I think it will be higher than the government says it's going to be.\" \nNewman also quizzed the City minister on when the last time he met someone from the finance sector in the City was. \nHe replied: \"Well, we meet people all the time from the City. I met representatives from buisness only a couple of weeks ago in Brighton. \nNewman asked: \"When was the last time you went into a City firm?\" \nBurgon said: \"Well, I was only appointed to this role a number of weeks ago. Parliament has been in recess. We had the conference season. At the conference season of course I had meetings of representatives of business.\" \nNewman appeared unconvinced: \"Have you fixed any meetings with people in the City to familiarise yourself with your patch?\" \nBurgon said, before the interview ended: \"I've got a very busy diary as you can imagine. I will be meeting City representatives I will be interested to hear their views and their perspectives.\" \nAt someone point after the interview, the City minister had his Wikipedia entry updated to reflect how it went.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:34:34.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
