The Ghana Catholics Bishop Conference says it favours a new register if evidence presented by the NPP is found to be true. \nA stateswoman, Dr. Joyce Aryee aslo believes, a new voters' register will clear the controversy and cure any credibility concerns. \nBreaking his silence on the controversy, President Rawlings has been admitting that 2016 will be very stressful and challenging. \n\"There is a lot of stress in the air, there is a lot of nervousness…it is going to be a test on all of us” he said. \nThe only way we can really contain and prevent things from getting out of hands is to ensure that the electoral register is as credible as possible \nFormer President Rawlings however wants the electoral commission to listen to all sides including organized groups and individuals in addressing doubts about the voters' register. \nAccording to Ghana’s longest-serving leader, the NDC government could cooperate with the NPP in accepting the demand for a new register. \n“As a sitting government I think if we feel pretty confident about that register we should have no fears in doing what needs to be done to win the confidence…to take away doubts,” he observed. \nAccording to former President Jerry Rawlings, “it is an unfortunate thing to abuse the sanctity of the right of choice”.
