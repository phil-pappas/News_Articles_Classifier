David Ige signed an emergency action this month that would funnel more than $1 million in state funds to address the issue, with a focus on expediting temporary shelter. \nDuring the announcement, the recently appointed governor's coordinator on homelessness said Hawaii has the highest rate of homelessness per capita in the U.S., with an estimated 465 homeless people out of every 100,000 . \nThis all comes after officials in Honolulu started clearing a large homeless encampment in the city last month.
