It's official. The Republican effort to demonize the poor is costing taxpayers a fortune. According to a recent article by Matt Agorist of The Free Thought Project, drug testing welfare recipients has done nothing except disprove decades of Republican talking points. For years, we've heard about \"lazy welfare recipients sitting at home and smoking their drugs all day,\" but they data shows that those people simply don't exist. Numerous states have enacted policies that force welfare recipients to take drug tests in order to receive their benefits. However, data from Arizona, Kansas. Mississippi, Oklahoma and other states shows that poor people use drugs far less than average Americans. While the national drug use rate is, on average, 9.4 percent, less than one percent of welfare recipients tested positive for drug use. And, that means that the other 99 percent of drug tests were paid for by taxpayers simply so that Republicans could make life harder for the poor. For example, the latest state to enact this despicable policy was Tennessee. And they found a grand total of 55 drug users out of the 30,000 drug tests that the state administered. And, that's not far from the numbers seen in the other states where welfare recipients are being treated like criminals. These policies aren't about saving taxpayers money or identifying those who cheat the system. They are simply Republican tactics to keep Americans focused on those evil poor people instead of the billionaires who have rigged the system. And, Republicans are perfectly willing to waste a ton of taxpayer money to make sure they can keep the \"Welfare Queen\" myth alive. In state after state, these policies have cost us a fortune, and they have made too many Americans feel like being poor is a crime. Testing welfare recipients for drug use is simply un-American and we can't let Republicans keep us from focusing on real problems - like the billionaires who have broken our system. You couldn't get by with this without creating a religious cult to back up your hatred of the poor and love of the rich.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:25:41.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
