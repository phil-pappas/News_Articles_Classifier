Duncan, the former Chicago schools head who is one of Obama’s few remaining original cabinet members, has clashed with most camps in the education community since taking the post. He’s supported charter schools and encouraged using testing for measuring teachers and schools and the divisive Common Core standards. He’s also taken on the higher education establishment by pushing policies to regulate for-profit colleges and make colleges and universities more transparent.\nHis announcement comes as Congress is the closest it’s been in years to updating the long-overdue No Child Left Behind law — something that could be a critical part of his legacy. His term could also be remembered for his embrace of Race to the Top grants that incentivized many of the controversial ideas he’s long embraced.\nObama has selected former New York state education commissioner John King to replace Duncan. King has had his own clashes with many of the same groups with whom Duncan has sparred.\n“What gives me peace with this decision, and I hope comes as a reassurance to everyone here, is the extraordinary talent of John and our leadership team,” Duncan said in a message to Education Department staffers. “John comes to this role with a record of exceptional accomplishment as a lifelong educator — a teacher, a school leader, and a leader of school systems.”\nEarlier this year, Duncan’s wife and children moved back to Chicago, where his children now attend private school. Duncan said that drove his decision and he has no immediate plans for what he’ll do next.\nDuncan took an already powerful post — power granted through the 2002 No Child Left Behind law — and made it more forceful. Via waivers from the law and a huge infusion of cash from the federal stimulus for grant-making, he made major inroads on K-12 reforms, including spurring the widespread adoption of the Common Core academic standards. He has helped made big changes in higher education including a government takeover of student loans, a crackdown on for-profit schools and a huge expansion of student aid.\nAt the National Press Club earlier this week, Duncan was asked whether he plans to stay on through the end of the administration. He didn’t explicitly say yes, rather, said there’s much work left to do.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:29:34.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
