Other options include reducing non-contact time for teachers and opening longer to increase the income kindergartens receive. \n\"This kindergarten association rightly remains committed to having qualified teachers because evidence shows they provide the best outcomes for young children. \n\"However, the Government has pushed for increased participation to meet arbitrary targets at the expense of educational quality. \n\"Labour has a strong record on early childhood education. The former Labour government is proud to have introduced the 20 hours free policy which has helped so many families. \n\"We remain committed to increasing the number of qualified teachers working with our youngest students. \n\"The Government’s funding cuts are shortsighted and will have lasting ramifications for children, parents, teachers and the wider school community,\" Chris Hipkins says. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
