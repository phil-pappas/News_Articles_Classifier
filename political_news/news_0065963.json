Richardson has acknowledged making the purchases with agency funds, but said the expenses were justified. \nOn Tuesday, federal officials visited the housing agency office and planned to return Wednesday as part an operations review. A HUD spokesman would not provide specifics except to say authorities were looking into management, personnel and finance issues. \nThe inquiry follows an Observer report last month that revealed details from the complaint letter and other accusations of unethical and unprofessional conduct. \n“It is long overdue,” said Glenn Pinckney, one of the three former employees who signed the complaint letter sent to Washington in June. “It is amazing HUD has allowed these blatant atrocities for as long as they have. If it is a honest and thorough investigation, there will have to be change.” \nCraig Hensel, a Greensboro attorney who plans to file a lawsuit on behalf of female tenants, said Tuesday that at least seven women have accused a manager and other staffers of sexual harassment. Hensel said he anticipates that others will come forward. \n“I am happy somebody is looking into this,” Hensel said. “This is an organization where there needs to be a closer look.” \nRichardson did not return phone call seeking comment. She has previously defended herself against the allegations, saying she would not tolerate sexual harassment and bought gifts for employees with public money to boost workplace morale. \nHickory has only about 300 public housing units, 15 employees and a $5 million annual budget. But in recent years the agency has paid to send administrators and others on training trips nationwide, including to Martha’s Vineyard, Mass.; Hilton Head Island, S.C.; Orlando, Fla.; and Las Vegas. \nRichardson has said the training was needed after HUD investigators in 2012 cited the organization for mismanaging more than $500,000 and ordered the money repaid. \nMayor Wright said he plans to appoint two new members to help the Board of Commissioners , which oversees the agency. He said he did not believe the spending for gifts amounted to misuse of taxpayer money, but acknowledged it does not create a good appearance. \nWright said: “HUD should not have had to come back and look at it again.” \nClasen-Kelly: 704-219-2667 Hickory Mayor Rudy Wright said he plans to appoint two new members to the Housing Authority’s Board of Commissioners City of Hickory i", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:19:38.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
