Among the materials in the hands of investigators is a video [see below] where you see someone shoot from a window of the hotel “Ukraine” on Independence Square, protesters and police. The room in question (no. 1132) was occupied by the Svoboda deputy Oleg Pankevich.\nRecall that the National Fascist party Svoboda was one of the main organizations to take part in the violence that led to the coup, with the not hidden support of the EU and US. In fact its leader Oleg Tjagnibok had numerous meetings with John McCain, Victoria Nuland and European representatives, like the then High Representative for EU Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton .\nIn recent months, however, Tjagnibok’s party (who also formed a battalion of volunteers sent to the Donbass) entered into a collision course with Poroshenko and the majority of the Verkhovnaja Rada [Parliament]. In September, the militants of Svoboda, along with other fascist groups, arranged a fight [in front of the Rada] which resulted in three deaths and hundreds of injured.\nThe searches do confirm what had surfaced from wiretaps between Ashton and Foreign Minister Paet of Estonia , which showed that the snipers were not “governmental”, but professionals hired by the far-right organizations.\nUnder sniper fire - the unseen footage from Kiev.
