There were puddles downtown, but nothing more than a passing thunderstorm might leave.\nMaximiliano Macedo of Puerto Vallarta strolled arm in arm with his wife down the waterfront unable to resist the curiosity of seeing things by the light of day.\nIn his words, \"Fortunately, nothing happened here.\"\n7:50 a.m.\nResidents of the coast where Patricia came ashore last night describe an enraged sea crashing into hotels, scooping beach away from their foundations, and howling winds that toppled trees and telephone posts.\nDomingo Hernandez is a watchman at the Hotel Barra de Navidad in the resort village of the same name. He says \"waves were coming into the hotel,\" and adds that \"All the streets here in town are full of downed trees all over the place.\"\nHe describes Patricia as the strongest storm he's seen in a quarter century of living on the coast.\nMexico's Tourism Secretary Enrique de la Madrid says major resorts like Puerto Vallarta had had \"extraordinary luck\" in avoiding damage from the once immensely powerful storm.\nHe says mountains around the city \"served as a barrier.\"\n7:15 a.m.\nPatricia has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves across Mexico.\nThe storm's maximum sustained winds decreased Saturday morning to near 50 mph (80 kph) with rapid weakening expected to continue.\nPatricia is centered about 35 miles (55 kilometers) northeast of Zacatecas, Mexico, and is moving toward the north-northeast at 21 mph (33 kph).\nThe storm made landfall Friday evening on Mexico's Pacific coast as a monstrous Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph).\n___\n3:45 a.m.\nHurricane Patricia continues to weaken, dropping to a Category 1 storm as it crosses Mexico.\nThe storm's maximum sustained winds early Saturday had decreased to near 75 mph (120 kph) with rapid weakening expected to continue.\nThe storm made landfall Friday evening on Mexico's Pacific coast as a monstrous Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph).\nPatricia is currently centered about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south-southwest of Zacatecas, Mexico, and is moving north-northeast near 21 mph (33 kph).\n___\n1:15 a.m. Saturday\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami says Hurricane Patricia has weakened to a Category 2 storm, with sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph).\nThe storm made landfall Friday evening on Mexico's Pacific coast as a monstrous Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph).\nBut it is rapidly losing steam as it moves over a mountainous region inland from the shore.\nEarly Saturday, its center was about 135 miles (215 kilometers) southwest of Zacatecas, Mexico.\nAuthorities say that so far there are reports of flooding and landslides, but no word of fatalities or major damage.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
