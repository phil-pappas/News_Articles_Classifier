These highly successful schools do the following: take deliberate steps to create a positive school climate with a focus on prevention; ensure that clear, appropriate, and consistent expectations and consequences are in place to prevent misbehavior; and ensure fairness and equity for all students and a commitment to continuous improvement.\nDr. Lora Hodges , Executive Director at Center for Responsive Schools, developer of the Responsive Classroom approach to teaching, will facilitate the plenary panel. The three leaders who will speak include: Dennis Copeland , Principal of Randolph Middle School in Randolph, New Jersey ; Judith Nuss , Social and Emotional Learning Specialist Consultant at CASEL; and Kelly Newman , Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Education at Great Neck Public Schools in Great Neck, New York . All three are veteran users of Responsive Classroom and have been using the approach ranging from 10 to 23 years.\nEducators, policymakers, and community stakeholders are increasingly recognizing the significance of positive school climate as a critical ingredient to student success. \"Students need to feel safe, respected, and included in their classroom and school communities,\" says Dr. Hodges. \"Students cannot fully engage in their learning and develop the skills they need to be college and career ready without an environment where teachers are truly available to teach and students are truly available to learn. Physical and emotional safety are both crucial to creating a positive climate for learning.\"\nOver 400 educators from the U.S. and international school community will be attending the 2015 Responsive Classroom Leadership Conference. Registration is $495 and is available on the Responsive Classroom website https://www.responsiveclassroom.org/conference or by calling 800-360-6332 ext. 130.\nABOUT RESPONSIVE CLASSROOM Â®\nThe Responsive Classroom approach to education was developed over 30 years ago by public school educators who envisioned a way of teaching that would bring together academic and social learning throughout the school day. It has been recognized by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL) as \" one of the most well-designed, evidence-based social and emotional learning programs .\" Center for Responsive Schools (CRS) offers Responsive Classroom on-site consulting services to schools and districts; workshops for educators in locations around the country and internationally; and a wide collection of books, videos, and other resources for teachers and administrators . Each year, CRS provides training for more than 10,000 teachers and administrators from over 40 states, the District of Columbia , and the international school community.\nFor more information, visit www.responsiveclassroom.org .\n releases/responsive-classroom-leadership-conference-plenary-panel-300151868.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://casel.org/guide", "http://www.responsiveclassroom.org/resources-educators", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.responsiveclassroom.org/conference", "http://www.responsiveclassroom.org/workshops-institutes", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC16443&Transmission_Id=201509301435PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC16443&DateId=20150930", "http://www.responsiveclassroom.org/", "http://www.responsiveclassroom.org/school-district-services", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/responsive-classroom-leadership-conference-plenary-panel-300151868.html"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:38:06.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
