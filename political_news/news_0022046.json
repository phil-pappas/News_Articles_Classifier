Blame him, or don't blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign,\" Trump said. \nThe comments came in response to a question from Ruhle about Trump's \"soft hand.\" She said the world had seen his strong side, but Bush after 9/11 and President Barack Obama after the Sandy Hook massacre both had to stand in front of America and show a different side of them. \n\"I need to know that you will make us feel safe and you will make us feel proud,\" Ruhle said to Trump. \n\"I think I have a bigger heart than all of them.
