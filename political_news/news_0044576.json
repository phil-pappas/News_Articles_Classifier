Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) delivers remarks during a news conference on the Workplace Democracy Act on Capitol Hill in Washington on Oct. 6. (Shawn Thew/European Pressphoto Agency) October 20 at 5:54 PM Kathleen Parker’s summary of Republicans’ views of capitalism in her Oct. 14 op-ed column, “ The Sanders-Trump magical mystery tour ,” was a rational exposition, citing their belief that communities thrive most with less government, when the free market can “thrive, create, innovate, reward and expand.” Her summary of the Democrats’ view was a snide, sarcastic, not very informative description. She left out the role of unions in service to capitalism and in creating the middle class.\nWorld War II brought us out of the Great Depression with the war industries producing aircraft carriers, fighter planes, tanks, jeeps, clothing for the fighting forces, processed food for their sustenance, etc. After the war, these industries began hiring the returned fighters, producing a large workforce that begged for unions to protect the workers.\nUnions fought for living wages, health insurance and sick leave. The decent wages and benefits achieved by the unions allowed factory workers, miners, meatpackers and those in service industries to buy modest homes and cars for the first time and to send children to college.\nThen Republicans attacked union leaders as communists, and Republican states enacted right-to-work laws, which put the finishing touches on the war on unions.\nWhy do politicians not give credit to unions for preserving capitalism and producing the greatest middle class in history? Why is the middle class disappearing? Think about the role of unions. Where are they now?\nIna B.
