With the inspector watching, an employee tried to render a lame pig unconscious, a procedure that need to require a single shot to the head with a stun gun. Because the pig was not correctly restrained, nonetheless, the employee had to shoot her various times.\nLater, the inspector witnessed a further botched beautiful: the employee had to &quotpull out the stuck rod from the skull and reload the captive bolt&quot before he lastly succeeded. In both circumstances, there was no backup amazing device offered.\nSuch sloppy work amounts to &Quote: gregious&quot illegal activity below the Humane Slaughter Act, which declares that livestock have to be slaughtered &quotonly by humane strategies.&quot The U.S. Department of Agriculture &#8212 according to its own policy directives &#8212 is supposed to suspend plant operations in response to such infractions. It can also refer abuse for criminal prosecution or, in intense circumstances, successfully shut down a poorly run plant by withdrawing its grant of federal inspection.\nYet official records that I received by way of the Freedom of Information Act show that soon after the Clougherty Packing debacle, as well as equivalent incidents across the country over the last two years, the USDA declined to punish the perpetrators, issuing administrative warnings instead.\nUSDA inspection records chronicle workers running over crippled animals with building gear, animals regaining consciousness just after having been shot by means of the head with a captive bolt, and workers intentionally abusing injured animals. Dozens of slaughterhouses either can not or won’t adhere to the law. But the USDA permits them to continue operating.\nAt a Minnesota slaughterhouse, a plant manager repeatedly electrocuted a cow that was trapped in the amazing box with a hole in her head. For more than 15 minutes, the worker tormented this cow with electric prods, trying to force her from the pen &quotdespite this getting physically not possible.&quot When she was ultimately killed and extracted from the box, this poor animal had 4 freshly broken ribs and multiple deep wounds where her &quothide had been forcefully ripped off, varying in depth but in some regions down to the [muscle] beneath.&quot\nOver significantly less than eight months, this plant was cited 14 occasions for humane slaughter violations and its operations were suspended on a number of occasions, but it was not shut down and no a single was criminally prosecuted.\nAt a plant close to Fresno, a worker unloading animals from a truck dropped a crippled calf from a height of about 3 feet onto the concrete floor of the slaughter pen. &quotThis calf landed on its physique and remained recumbent on the concrete.&quot The worker continued, pushing four extra calves &quotoff the trailer, chin 1st onto the concrete.&quot Although plant operations had been briefly suspended, the worker was not charged for this intentional and criminal cruelty.\nAs if such documented brutality weren’t bad enough, undercover investigations consistently discover that abuse is even worse than is indicated in the USDA’s official records.\nAt a slaughter plant in Chino that processes significant numbers of crippled dairy cows, the Humane Society of the United States secretly documented workers beating animals, shocking them, ramming them with forklifts and applying high-energy hoses to shoot water into their nostrils &#8212 all in an try to force them to stand. USDA inspectors have been in the plant in the course of every single incident, but they under no circumstances cited the plant for abuse.\nThe USDA’s personal inspector general warned in 2013 that Humane Slaughter Act enforcement was each &quotinconsistent&quot and &quotlenient.&quot In a random sampling of inspection reports, the inspector basic discovered 10 egregious violations of the law that did not outcome in plant suspension, like a captive bolt lodging in a conscious pig’s skull for at least four minutes just before the animal was killed, a pig being boiled alive and a forklift operator driving repeatedly into a crippled pig.\nIf the USDA is going to follow its personal policy directives and enforce the Humane Slaughter Act, it need to contemplate two crucial reforms.\nInitial, all egregious violations of the law should automatically result in at least plant suspension. More than the years 2013 and 2014, I documented dozens of examples of such violations that resulted in mere warnings. That merely tends to make no sense an egregious infraction deserves a stern response.\nSecond, the USDA ought to refer intentional abuse for criminal prosecution. The Humane Slaughter Act is a criminal statute and violations can &#8212 theoretically &#8212 result in fines and jail time. Not only is criminal prosecution a suitable punishment for animal abuse, but the predictable threat of prosecution would act as a deterrent, discouraging mistreatment in the initial spot.\nPersonally, I see no ethical distinction involving eating a chicken or a cat, a pig or a puppy I do not feel slaughtering animals for one’s dinner can ever be humane. But, for now, the Humane Slaughter Act is all we have the least the USDA could do is enforce it.\nBruce Friedrich is director of policy for Farm Sanctuary, a national farm animal protection organization.\nStick to the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-friedrich-humane-slaughter-20150920-story.html"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:47:59.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
