The deal secured by their union, Unite, sees Sellafield Ltd and the 14-strong group of on-site sub-contractor companies drop their refusal to facilitate a senior shop steward to deal with health and safety, workplace welfare and training issues. The agreement, which comes after a campaign of industrial action, including walkouts and action short of a strike, also sees the formation of a health and safety committee spanning all contractors on the site. Commenting Unite regional secretary for the north west Mick Whitley said: 'This victory for common sense would not have been achieved without the resolve of our members who stood shoulder to shoulder to get a better deal on health and safety. 'A healthy workplace is a more productive workplace. The creation of a new senior shop steward on maximum facility time at Sellafield will help make the site safer, reduce accidents and enable workforce issues to be dealt with speedily. 'It's a win, win for everyone involved in the decommissioning and renewal project at Sellafield and once again underlines the importance of trade unions in making the workplace a safer more productive place.'
