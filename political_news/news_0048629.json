(Kirsty Wigglesworth/Associated Press, Pool) By Editorial Board October 23 at 6:44 PM CHINESE PRESIDENT Xi Jinping treated himself to a strutting military parade in Beijing last month featuring 12,000 troops and shiny new missile systems. A few weeks later he was honored by President Obama with a 21-gun salute and a state dinner at the White House. But for a ruler who revels in pomp and symbolic tributes, nothing quite matches the glittering — and frequently fawning — reception arranged for him in Britain this week by the government of David Cameron.\nMr. Xi was accompanied by Queen Elizabeth II in a horse-drawn carriage to Buckingham Palace for a white-tie dinner. Authorities ensured that his route was lined with a rent-a-crowd orchestrated by the Chinese Embassy, while relegating protesters for free speech and Tibet to the outskirts. The Chinese president was given the rare honor of addressing a joint session of Parliament. He was invited to Chequers, the prime minister’s country home.\nThough Mr. Xi is presiding over the biggest crackdown on political dissent and civil rights China has seen in decades, not a word about human rights appeared in the joint statement he issued with Mr. Cameron. Instead it proclaimed a “golden era” in U.K.-Chinese relations and the construction of “a global comprehensive strategic partnership for the 21st century.”\nFor some time there has been cause for wonder about the direction of British foreign policy under Mr. Cameron, who in 5½ years in office has overseen big cuts in the military and a broad retreat from global engagement. A country that once prized its place as the closest U.S. strategic ally and its ability to “punch above its weight” has taken a back seat in matters ranging from the fight against the Islamic State and the Syrian civil war to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nNow Mr. Cameron appears to have hit upon a strategy: to make Britain China’s foremost Western partner — and thereby become a favored client for trade and investment. The first payoff of this new special relationship came in the announcement that a Chinese firm would invest $9 billion in a new British nuclear plant . But Mr. Cameron and his chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, hope for much more. They see London becoming a platform for Beijing’s financial initiatives and British companies winning a growing share of the Chinese market.\nThere’s nothing wrong with courting Chinese investment or seeking a productive relationship with Mr. Xi’s regime, of course; countries around the world are doing it. But the unprincipled zeal of Mr. Cameron’s campaign, seen in the context of the broader international retrenchment he has led, can only be troubling. It raises the question of whether Britain will stand with the United States when it resists China’s bullying of its neighbors, its attempt to claim most of the South China Sea as territorial waters or its retreat from the promise of political autonomy and democracy it made when it took control of the former British colony of Hong Kong.\nBritish officials said Mr. Cameron", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/02/us-army-chief-of-staff-concern-defence-budget", "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/22/xi-jinping-state-visit-hong-kong-freedom", "http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/10/21/u-k-china-cement-growing-friendship-with-big-nuclear-deal-hinkley-xi-osborne/"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:24:36.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
