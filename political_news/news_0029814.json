The Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General issued a report on Wednesday that accused Secret Service Assistant Director Edward Lowery and other agency officials of plotting to leak information about Chaffetz, including his unsuccessful attempt to join the organization.\nThe leaks were a highly unusual breach of decorum. Lawmakers often battle with agencies, but the fights mostly stay above board and focus on policy, rather than descending into leaking private information.\nThe report found that between March 24 and April 2, 2015, 45 Secret Service employees accessed “sensitive personal information” on Chaffetz nearly 60 times. Only 4 of the 45 employees had “an arguable legitimate need to access the information,” the report found.\nThe IG also found that there was widespread dissemination of the personal information.\nSenate strikes compromise on criminal justice reform By Rachael Bade , Daniel Lippman and Sarah Wheaton\nLowery, in one instance, emailed employees saying “Some information that he might find embarrassing needs to get out. Just to be fair.”\nChaffetz blasted the agency for the alleged leaks.\n“Certain lines should never be crossed. The unauthorized access and distribution of my personal information crossed that line. It was a tactic designed to intimidate and embarrass me and frankly, it is intimidating,” the Utah Republican said in a statement. “It’s scary to think about all the possible dangers in having your personal information exposed.”\nThe Oversight Committee launched an investigation into the Secret Service earlier this year after a series of embarrassing security incidents at the White House. Chaffetz helped uncover reports that a knife-wielding man got much further into the White House than initially reported and that an armed man was allowed into an elevator with President Barack Obama.\nThe panel is also investigating reports that Secret Service agents paid for sex during a presidential visit to Columbia.\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the panel, said the Secret Service should issue an “immediate apology.”\nClinton worried about Fox media storm over 'mother' and 'father' passport issue By Nick Gass\n“Although the Inspector General identified no evidence of political motivation or influence, I believe in fundamental fairness, and those who are unwilling or unable to meet the highest of ethical standards should not be a part of the Secret Service,” Cummings said in a statement.\nSecret Service Director Joseph Clancy said he takes “employee misconduct very seriously” and will ensure the involved parties are punished.\n“I again apologize to Representative Chaffetz for this wholly avoidable and embarrassing misconduct,” Clancy said. “Additionally, I will continue to review policies and practices to address employee misconduct and demand the highest level of integrity of all our employees.”\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.oig.dhs.gov/assets/Mga/OIG_mga-092515.pdfhttp:/"], "published": "2015-09-30T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:45:31.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
