The approach of those around you and your own approach and policies is highly likely to to worsen the decline and in the Labour party’s credibilty.\" \nIn March 2014, Lord Warner controversially suggested patients should be charged £10 to use the NHS. The idea was dismissed by the then coalition government and Labour said it was \"not something we would ever consider\". \nShadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith said he did not think Lord Warner’s resignation mattered. \"He has been leaving Labour for quite a while I am not sure we will miss him too much,\" he told BBC Newsnight. \nFormer deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said it was \"no great loss\". And Warley MP John Spellar said more bluntly: \"he was always an arse.\" Lord Warner. A minister you've never heard of who wanted to charge people £10 a month to use the NHS. No credibility. No great loss. \n— John Prescott (@johnprescott) October 19, 2015 he was always an arse https://t.co/axUYGafZr4 \n— john spellar (@spellar) October 19, 2015 READ MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:31:13.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
