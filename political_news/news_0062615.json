(AP) â€” Uber wants to expand throughout New York state into cities like Buffalo, Albany, Syracuse and Rochester where the ride-hailing service is now prohibited from operating. \nA company executive on Tuesday called on state lawmakers to pass regulations allowing Uber to expand throughout the state, saying the move could create thousands of jobs and provide a new alternative to millions of upstate residents. \nWhile Uber has expanded throughout the country within New York it is available only in the New York City area. \nUber's New York General Manager Josh Mohrer gathered with supportive state lawmakers at the Albany state Capitol on Tuesday to encourage the Legislature to take action on the regulations next year. The Legislature will return to the Capitol in January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:37:42.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
