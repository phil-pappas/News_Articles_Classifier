(Washington Blade photo by Damien Salas) \nThe Human Rights Campaign hosted Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Rodham Clinton at breakfast and Vice President Joseph Biden at dinner on Oct. 3. It was a great day for the LGBT family. \nHRC is the nation’s leading LGBT civil rights organization and has been at the forefront of the fight for the rights of the LGBT community. It has at times been attacked for its lack of diversity and sometimes seems to have had a hard time moving on from the days when it was known as HRCF and nicknamed the Human Rights Champagne Fund. But the reality is running a major organization like HRC takes a lot of money and rich people with money in our society are still too often only white and male. \nThe organization has been making strides to become more diverse and we need HRC to be strong and successful. As marriage equality has become a reality, HRC is leading the fight for a comprehensive civil rights bill and has undertaken a southern strategy and a global strategy to help members of the LGBT community here and around the world. \nIn the morning it was Hillary’s turn to speak to the board and active members of HRC. Introducing her to hundreds who crowded into the ballroom of the Mayflower Hotel in D.C. Chad Griffin, HRC’s president, reminded everyone he has known Clinton from his days in Arkansas and shared some slides of him as a teenager with Hillary. He quipped Hillary was actually the “first HRC he worked for.” \nHillary spoke passionately of her wide-ranging commitment to LGBT rights and to all human rights. She reiterated the statement she made in Geneva on Human Rights Day in 2011 “gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.” She talked about needing to stay vigilant to protect the rights the LGBT community has won as we move forward to guarantee all our rights. \nWhile we in the LGBT community strive to be more inclusive it was rewarding to hear Hillary speak of the need for inclusiveness in government, the military and society. Anyone who has followed Clinton’s career from her days at the Children’s Defense Fund knows she has spent her life fighting for all people’s rights, including African Americans, women and LGBT people. One of her loudest applause lines came when she said about her fight for civil rights, “I am just getting warmed up.” She spoke in support of transgender individuals, to allow them to serve openly in the military, and to protect them from violence and our judicial system. She spoke of the need to remember we do this work not only for ourselves but for our children and our grandchildren, reminding all her grandchild just turned one. She spoke of our need to be vigilant and not to slide backwards and to protect the gains we have made including those made through executive orders signed by President Obama. She committed to working with HRC to pass new comprehensive civil rights legislation. It was the most heartfelt speech on LGBT rights she has ever made. \nThen Saturday evening it was Biden’s turn to speak. Biden has been a longtime passionate supporter of LGBT rights. He spoke of the administration’s ongoing efforts to ensure members of the LGBT community were serving in every area of government. He mentioned Eric Fanning, who was in the audience, had just been nominated as the first openly gay Secretary of the Army. Biden reminded us it was he in 2012 who supported marriage equality before the president seemed ready to do it and got an ovation from the audience. His two funniest lines were when he began “after that people started to say to him” at which point someone in the audience yelled ‘run Joe run’ and Biden replied, “No that wasn’t it.” And when he talked about there still being homophobes and said, “Most of them seem to be running for president.” \nHe said the LGBT community would get full civil and human rights sooner than we think and most people don’t realize we don’t already have them. Biden spoke out for transgender rights and allowing trans people to serve in the military and for banning conversion therapy for minors. He committed his continuing support for the work ahead and was given a thunderous ovation. \nIt was another successful day for HRC. Tim Cook, Apple CEO, received an award at the dinner and Carly Rae Jepsen entertained. It was announced the sponsors of the dinner collectively donated more than $1 million for the evening.
