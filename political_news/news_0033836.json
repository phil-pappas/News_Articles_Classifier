Clinton told NBC's \"Today\" that if she were president, she would have \"done everything\" in her power to shut down such a partisan investigation.\nClinton was secretary of state during the 2012 attacks.\nShe stopped short of calling for disbanding the Benghazi panel, as some Democrats have urged.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
