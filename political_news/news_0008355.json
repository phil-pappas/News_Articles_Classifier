They said Iran's work will almost certainly take more than the two months Iran has projected.\nThe administration officials spoke on a conference call with reporters, but under the condition that they not be identified by name.\nAs part of the nuclear agreement, Obama on Sunday also issued provisional waivers and a memorandum instructing U.S. agencies to lay the groundwork for relieving sanctions on Iran.\nIn Iran, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told state TV: \"On implementation, all should be watchful that Westerners, particularly Americans, to keep their promises.\"\nVelayati said Iran expects that the United States and other Western countries that negotiated the deal will show their \"good will\" through lifting sanctions.\nIran's atomic energy chief, Ali Akbar Salehi, told state TV that Tehran was ready to begin taking steps to comply, and awaited an order from President Hassan Rouhani. \"We are hopeful to begin in the current or next week,\" he said.\nThe IAEA said Sunday that Iran has agreed to allow greater monitoring of its commitment to the deal, going beyond basic oversight provided by the safeguards agreement that IAEA member nations have with the agency. For instance, it allows short-notice inspections of sites the IAEA may suspect of undeclared nuclear activities.\nEven as the terms of the deal begin taking effect, recent developments have shown the wide gulf between the U.S. and Iran on other issues.\nFighters from Iran have been working in concert with Russia in Syria, and a Revolutionary Court convicted a Washington Post reporter who has been held more than a year on charges including espionage. The court has not provided details on the verdict or sentence. Further, two other Americans are being detained, and the U.S. has asked for the Iranian government's assistance in finding a former FBI agent who disappeared in 2007 while working for the CIA on an unapproved intelligence mission.\nAlso, Iran successfully test-fired a guided long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile.\nBut the U.S. officials asserted that those actions would be worse if they were backed up by a nation with a nuclear weapon. The officials emphasized that the seven-nation pact is focused solely on resolving the nuclear issue.\nThe steps being taken by the U.S. come 90 days after the U.N. Security Council endorsed the deal.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:01:20.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
