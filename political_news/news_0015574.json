Water supply, surface water and wastewater are the main focuses of the new Three Waters Strategy, which will be developed over the next year. The impact of climate change, and the values associated with landscapes, ecology, recreation, drainage, heritage, and Tangata Whenua will also be included. \n\"We used to take water services for granted but, after the earthquakes, we were suddenly more conscious of water and everything that affects it. Our pipes were broken, we were forced to collect drinking water from tankers and use portable toilets on the street, and homes flooded when we had heavy rain,\" Ms Beaumont said. \"The Three Waters Strategy will, in the short-term, provide guidance for fixing and adapting our infrastructure. However, the strategy is not time-bound and will inform other Council long-term plans, infrastructure strategies and asset management plans for many years to come,\" she said. \nIt is timely to develop a combined approach. Two of the previous strategies (water supply and surface water) are due for review, but other legislative and regulatory changes require an integrated approach to achieve efficiencies and better outcomes for the health of our wetlands, rivers and harbours. \nThe development of the strategy is not confined to the city's boundaries, but considers the influence of practices in neighbouring Selwyn and Waimakariri districts. \nThe Council has engaged MWH and subcontractors Tonkin and Taylor, Cranleigh and Aqualinc to develop the Three Waters Strategy. \n\"It is too early at this point to give any indication of the detail of the strategy, but we know it is being put together with international best practice in mind. With this strategy, we will have a clear plan to manage Christchurch water resources now and in the long-term,\" Ms Beaumont said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:08:27.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
