I'd say I sit pretty much to a right of centre position with a liking for moderate Tories such as John Major, Micheal Heseltine, Kenneth Clark, Chris Patton and the now late Geoffrey Howe. I also find myself nodding with agreement with many an interview with Right Wing Labour polititions and Liberal Democrat.From this perspective when engaging with nasty nutty UKIP/Britain First I sometimes feel like I am looked upon as a Neo Corbynite, flag and country hating, loonie left, sandal wearing beared hippy.From my perspective the BBC sits in a very comfortable place as a sort of innoffensive, neutral, lets try not offend position within the political spectrum. I just don't see the rampant left leaning bias so many on here complain of. I am also aware of an equally strident voice from the left complaining the BBC are in fact right leaning, pro-establishment, pro-business and very conservative with a small \"c\".When it come to bias does that mean the Beeb is unbiased, biased to the centre and thus unnaceptable to those on the nasty nutty right and loonie left or are there still going to be those who say a \"shower of pinko, hippy, tree huggers\"?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:51:05.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
