You’re not going to change the gay male world singlehandedly, but you can certainly speak up when others disrespect your marriage. \nMichael , \n\nMy husband and I have been married for three years. Yet we’re frequently hit on by strangers, acquaintances, casual and close friends. \n\nWe both wear wedding rings. Even when politely told “no,” some guys are persistent and way too touchy. Last week a fellow volunteer at a gay organization we’re involved in made a blatantly sexual overture to both of us while we were chatting after a meeting. This is not the first time this sort of thing has occurred. \n\nMy husband travels frequently for work and every time he is out of town, a friend of mine suggests we hook up. I’ve told him repeatedly to cut it out; his response is that he’s joking and that I shouldn’t take him seriously when he’s drunk. But then of course it happens again and again. We’ve both gotten similar proposals from other friends (including couples), some of whom poke fun at our being monogamous. \n\nAfter all the fighting for marriage equality, I think it’s nuts that a lot of the gay men I interact with don’t actually seem to respect marriage, my marriage included. Lately I’m getting more and more pissed off and want to tell these people to grow up and develop some sexual boundaries. \n\nBut I also want to have friends and be part of the community, and I definitely don’t want to be so angry. What’s wrong with gay men? \nMichael replies: \nIt would be terrific if more gay men were respectful of other gay men’s sexual boundaries. I hear complaints frequently from gay clients about unwanted advances and even outright harassment. \nThere’s a sort of Wild West, “anything goes” atmosphere around sex in the gay community: Some men are monogamous, some are on Scruff 24/7, many are somewhere in between. With no one standard, there will be guys who tell themselves that they can be as forward — or even pushy — as they like. \nWe have a long history of being sexual outlaws. Lacking much experience with visible, societally approved committed relationships, we’re still figuring out who and how to be. In just a few generations, we’ve gone from hoping to find another horny guy somewhere for a furtive encounter to New York Times wedding announcements and legal marriage. That’s a big jump. \nSo it makes sense that some guys would view you as fair game for sex simply because you’re gay. And since a lot of gay men don’t have monogamous relationships, some guys may think or hope that rules around monogamy don’t apply when they’re interested in you, or in any coupled guys. \nTo top it off, married men are often especially appealing to those who like breaking boundaries and forbidden fruit. \nWhat can you do? \nYou’re not going to change the gay male world singlehandedly, but you can certainly speak up when others disrespect your marriage. While it’s a pain to be an activist, that’s your best hope for changing the way things are and how you’re treated. That’s how we accomplished marriage equality: by refusing to accept the straight world’s dismissal of our relationships. \nWhile I get that the two of you don’t want to spend all your time giving hell to people who come on to you, you will have to do so at times if you are to get some of these folks to cut it out. In addition, reconsider where and with whom you spend time. I don’t know where you typically hang out, but if there is a lot of hooking up going on and a sexual vibe in the air, expecting not to be hit on is a lost cause. \nLikewise your friends who keep propositioning you despite your telling them to knock it off. How many times do you want to say “no” before giving up on these characters? \nKeep in mind that despite your experiences, there are plenty of gay men in this world who do take “no” for an answer and who are happy to respect other people’s boundaries. Going forward, one of your tasks is to put some effort into finding and befriending them. \nFinally, here’s a bit of good news: It sounds like you two are doing well at living according to your own vision of what’s right for you, despite not getting much support. Doing so is not an easy task, so congratulations on staying strong. \n\nMichael Radkowsky , Psy.D. is a licensed psychologist who works with gay couples and individuals in D.C.
