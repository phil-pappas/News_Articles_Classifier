During the development of the film’s story, the team thought the theme of a trip to the vets could be explored beyond the usual 1 to 2 minute YouTube films we make, and saw it as the perfect opportunity to tell a longer narrative – out of which the idea for our Indiegogo crowdfunded short film ‘Off to the Vet’ was born.\n‘Box Clever’ features in ‘Off to the Vet’ as just a small part of the overall story. We decided to release ‘Box Clever’ in black and white as it works as a stand alone film, and a small teaser for non funders. : )\nWe hope you enjoy it!\n‘OFF TO THE VET’ UPDATE\n‘Off to the Vet’ is the first 12 minute Simon’s Cat film produced in full colour. The film is now complete and currently only available to our Indiegogo funders via our private production blog. We plan to release ‘Off to the Vet’ in 2016, so please look out for updates on www.simonscat.com and on our YouTube channel!\nPublic updates relating to the campaign and project can be seen at – https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/simon-s-cat-in-off-to-the-vet#/updates\nNEW BOOK OUT IN OCTOBER!\n‘Off to the Vet and Other Cat-astrophes’ will be released internationally on October 29th.
