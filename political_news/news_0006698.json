He added: \"We’re seriously concerned that this could remove any obligation for some drivers to drive safely, as well as potentially increasing insurance premiums for all drivers.\"\nOpposition MSPs called for a U-turn in light of the criticism. Alex Johnstone, the Conservative transport spokesman, said it was \"quite extraordinary and unfair\" that law abiding drivers would see their insurance premiums rise.\nHe added: \"Once again, the SNP government have obviously not thought through the wider implications for all drivers. How is it fair that good drivers will be hit hard in this way? Road safety may also be badly hit, with there being less of an incentive to drive carefully. The nationalists need to rethink these imprudent plans.\"\nThe changes were proposed as part of a widespread overhaul to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, after ministers accepted that the law did not achieve the right balance between protecting the public and allowing offenders to put mistakes behind them. Employment opportunities can be severely restricted if offences must be declared.\nOther proposals include ensuring only convictions resulting in a prison sentence of at least four years, compared to 30 months currently, would never become spent. Community Payback Orders are among non-custodial sentences that would become spent after one year plus the length of the order, compared to a blanket five years currently.\nShare article A Scottish Government spokeswoman said an independent analysis of the consultation responses would be published by December. She added: \"The responses received to the consultation will inform Scottish Government decisions about next steps in this area. This includes in the area of road traffic offences.\n\"Protection of the public will remain at the forefront of any future decisions, which will be made after the analysis has been completed and scrutinised.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-20T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:24:47.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
