Actress Kriti Kharbanda is excited about finally coming to Kollywood. In an exclusive chat with dna , Kriti talks about her upcoming films and her co-stars.\nOn her Tamil movie debut\nAll I can say is that I’m really lazy! I was to join the gym six years back and till today I haven’t. (Laughs) I was happy doing Kannada films because that’s where my career was made and future is; and Telugu films because my debut was in Telugu and it’s close to me. Having said that, I was actually signed on for a Tamil film two years back, but things didn’t pan out at that point. A few months back, I was supposed to sign a big Tamil film but I had date issues again.\nThe tale of two Bruce Lees\nWhen I was shooting for Ram Charan’s Bruce Lee three months back and they mentioned they might title it Bruce Lee , I remember saying there was a Tamil movie as well by that name. I honestly didn’t know I’d be a part of the Tamil Bruce Lee as well! It’s a pleasant surprise.\nOn Ram Charan’s Bruce Lee\nI was sceptical about doing this film when they narrated the script to me. They told me it was a small but significant role for which they wanted a lead actress in particular. I can say that shooting with Ram Charan and the crew for this film was one of the top two movie experiences in my career. It was a fabulous experience.\nOn Ram Charan\nI hope I get to work with Ram Charan again sometime in the future. Though my role is small in Bruce Lee , he made sure that he mentioned me during the audio launch of the film and that was very humbling. He is great to work with.\nGV Prakash’s Bruce Lee\nI am making my Tamil movie debut – finally – with GV Prakash in Bruce Lee . I really liked the script. The role I play is of a bold and extremely stylish urban girl. It’s an action comedy and I’m looking forward to it. I think this movie is going to be an entertaining one.\nOn GV Prakash\nI think for a successful music director like him to make a career in films, he has to work much harder than others for people to take him seriously. With both Darling and Trisha Illana Nayanthara, he has proved that he can strike gold at the box office, now he just has to convince directors he can pull off any script. I think he is doing that with his choice of scripts.\nExpectations from films\nAt this point, I have no expectations and I’ve realised that that’s what works best for me. Things that are meant to happen will happen even if I don’t want them to – I strongly believe that. I ensure I play my role well and give my best. Then it’s up to the director and the audience!", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/1/104841276583076607065/posts"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:34:10.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
