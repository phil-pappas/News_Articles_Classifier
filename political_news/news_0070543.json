Parliament accepted the President’s veto of the law on amnesty, but one of the irregular sessions failed to result in proper amendments to the law. The Speaker noted that amendments to the Amnesty Law will be finalized during this session. He went on to say that the fall session of Parliament will discuss and adopt the 2016 state budget and 2016′s budgets for the Social Insurance and Human Development funds, as well as a draft resolution on approving the 2016 basic guidelines for fiscal policy. “This fall session is to become the most vital and responsible period for all members of Parliament, as the forthcoming 2016 Spring Session will coincide with preparations for parliamentary elections,” he stressed. “Many bills, draft amendments and resolutions are expected to be discussed and passed during the fall session. In particular, a draft amendment to the Constitution of Mongolia and a bill on elections must be adopted six months ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections,” he added and urged MPs to make efforts to resolve these issues. Session meetings start at 9:00 a.m. and continue until 2:00 p.m. every Thursday and Friday. Responsibilities have been given to the heads of the parliamentary standing committees, sub-committees, and Secretary General of the Parliamentary Office B.Boldbaatar to organize the parliamentary fall session within the approved timetable. After the opening of the fall session, the independent parliamentarians Ts.Davaasuren, Kh.Bolorchuluun, and S.Ganbaatar called a press conference to announce that they are ready to back the dismissal of Minister and head of the Cabinet Secretariat S.Bayartsogt. \nShort URL : http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=16388   Oct 1  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:58:59.136+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
