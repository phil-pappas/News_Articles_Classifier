Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “political Ravana”, he said that his political end would be in Bihar. \n“The people of Bihar would slay the political Ravana,” Lalu told reporters. Checking himself from going overboard, he said that he meant to say that communal politics would meet its end in Bihar Assembly polls. \nBJP -led National Democratic Alliance leaders, however, reacted strongly to Lalu’s remarks. Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh told the media that the electorate was ready to seal the fate of those who promoted “jungle raj” in Bihar. \nUnion minister of state Ramkripal Yadav criticising Lalu, said, “People who would set the Ravana on fire enjoy the patronage of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad .” \nFormer chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi also spoke harshly against Nitish Kumar . “He calls me Vibhisan of JDU, which means he is Ravana—full of false pride, ego and ambition. I know where the amrit (nectar) lies and now PM Narendra Modi needs to fire an arrow to put an end to Ravana,” Manjhi said, while reacting to Lalu’s comment. \nBJP ally Rashtriya Lok Samata Party chief Upendra Kushwaha too came out against Lalu for speaking “anap-sanap” (irrelevant) anticipating defeat in the polls. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:25:27.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
