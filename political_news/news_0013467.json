You go off, you drop out, you live for yourself, for your family, and you try to live a good life. No; too many people have fought and bled and died to help this country and to help strangers in foreign lands. There’s still half the country that has not had their mind snapped.” \nThe “snapping” comment was a reference to Kupelian’s new book, “The Snapping of the American Mind,” in which the author proposes multiple levels of solutions to healing America, which has been practically destroyed by what he terms a “lawless government and godless culture.” He shared some of his ideas with Noory’s audience of 3-5 million listeners earlier this week. \nAccording to Kupelian, American needs healing on three levels. The first is the nationwide or “macro” level. He said that starts with obvious steps like “electing a president who loves the U.S. and its Constitution!” As commander in chief, he adds, “the president must be loved by America’s friends and feared by her enemies.” \nRestoring the country also involves having a strong military, supporting Israel, and securing the borders, he said, ticking off many other needed changes, including reducing the size of government to constitutional levels, abandoning political correctness and abolishing the IRS. \n“The Snapping of the American Mind: Healing a Nation Broken by a Lawless Government and Godless Culture” – autographed by the author – is available now from the WND Superstore! \n“I also said abolish the Federal Reserve, which is actually not constitutional, because the people gave Congress the power to ‘coin money and regulate the value thereof,’ and didn’t say they could give it to an outside banking cartel,” he told Noory and his vast nighttime audience. \nHowever, Kupelian understands there’s not too much ordinary Americans can do to bring about those macro-level changes, however needed they are. \n“You can argue, yeah, well that’s great, David, but how are we going to make those things happen?” he said. “OK, point taken … That has to do with leadership. Until we get the kind of leadership and a change in the culture and, really, a revival in the country, not too many of those things will happen.” \nTherefore, Kupelian says the American people need to heal on an individual level as well. One of the key things, he says, is to stop depending on the government. It’s also important to have faith in God, exercise your Second Amendment rights, vote, and to protect your children from a sometimes perverse American culture. In addition, he urges people to prepare for an uncertain future. \n“Prepping is a good thing; you’re not a nutcase to prep, to prepare for the worst and live for the best,” he advised the “Coast to Coast” audience. \nKupelian also suggests what he calls “de facto secession.” He acknowledged real secession is unlikely to happen in America, but he pointed to the Mormons as an example of “de facto secession.” They moved to Utah to escape persecution in the East, and their lives dramatically improved even though they remained a part of the United States. \n“So, you can move to [another] state,” he said, for example, “if you’re a conservative, you can move to Texas. If you’re a liberal, you can move to any big city, basically. There is that way of moving to where you’re more comfortable.” \nBut even these individual-level fixes may not be enough. \n“If we’re so stressed out, our minds are snapping and we’re one of those 130 million people that has to take legal or illegal drugs or get drunk in order to get through life, we’re not doing much good for anybody, for our country, for our family … or ourselves,” Kupelian cautioned. \nSo the author calls for another level of individual healing that has to do with personal wellness. Exercise is important, he says, because it provides incredible stress relief. And finding the right diet is crucial. \n“Hint: disregard everything the government has ever said about food,” he urged. \nConsider what the government has said about eggs: \n“They just this last year said, ‘Oops, we were wrong. We scared the crap out of everybody for 40 years about eating eggs, but you know what? They’re actually good for you, and they don’t raise your cholesterol.’ So you have to do a little research. What you eat is important.” \nBeyond diet and exercise, Kupelian encourages people to pray, meditate, get enough rest and rise above anger and hatred. \n“I go through a whole lot of things that are sort of personal discipline-type things where even if the rest of the country, God forbid, is going to hell in a handbasket, you and your family can live a sane and happy life in the midst of chaos,” he told Noory’s audience. \nAgain, it will be difficult to heal America, but Kupelian pointed out there are still many traditional, right-thinking Americans whose minds have not yet snapped. They provide the key to a revival. \n“I think yes, there is hope, but people need to wake up individually,” Kupelian said. “They need to find their humanity and stop being so brainwashed and intimidated by political correctness. … It’s a long road back, there’s no question about it, but yes, it is possible. Because the alternative to having hope is hopelessness, and I’m not going to go there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:20:57.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
