The Federation Council (the upper chamber) of the Russian parliament has voted unanimously on Wednesday to grant President Vladimir Putin the right to deploy the country’s military troops in Syria, Russian state news agencies reported.\nThe upper chamber of the Russian parliament met at a close-door session to discuss Putin’s request. The Kremlin said in a brief statement this morning that Putin sent a request to the Russia’s upper chamber for the authorization of the use of force in Syria “on the basis of universal principles and norms of international law.”\nSergei Ivanov, the head of the Kremlin administration, told journalists after the vote has been announced: “The Syrian president asked the leadership of our country for military assistance.” He added, “the authorization is necessary not in order to achieve some foreign policy goals” but “in order to defend Russia’s national interests.”\nIvanov told the Interfax News Agency that the parliament has approved the use of Russian aviation, signaling that Russia could begin carrying out airstrikes in Syria soon.\nWhen asked at the United Nation in New York on Monday whether Russia will engage in airstrikes in Syria, Putin said “we do not rule out anything but if we act, we will do it in strict compliance with the international law.”\nThe last time Putin requested the Federation Council to hold a similar vote was before Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea, in March 2014. Then, the upper chamber voted unanimously to grant Putin the right to use military force in Ukraine.\n ", "external_links": ["http://ria.ru/defense_safety/20150930/1292970356.html"], "published": "2015-09-30T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:53:24.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
