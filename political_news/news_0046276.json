Brian Sims (D-Philadelphia (Washington Blade file photo by Michael Key) \nA gay Pennsylvania lawmaker who has led efforts in the state to pass a non-discrimination bill on Tuesday announced his bid to run for a U.S. House seat. \nBrian Sims, who represents Philadelphia in the State House, declared his bid for Pennsylvania’s 2nd congressional district. The seat is currently occupied by Rep. Chaka Fattah (D-Pa.), who was indicted in July as a result of alleged roles in a racketeering conspiracy. \n“I’ve spent my life taking on big challenges in order to do what’s right,” Sims said. “Whether tackling gender and pay equity as a civil rights attorney, or standing up for justice reform in Harrisburg, I’ve never backed down from the big fights. And I never will.” \nSims has the distinction of being the first openly gay person elected to the Pennsylvania Legislature, but he’s not the first out person to serve in that body. That distinction belongs to former state Rep. Mike Fleck, a Republican who came as gay after Sims was elected, but before he was seated. \nA civil rights advocate and attorney, Sims is credited with leading on issues ranging from gender and pay inequity to environmental protection. He co-sponsors legislation in the House called the Pennsylvania Fairness Act, which would update the state’s non-discrimination law to include sexual orientation and gender identity. \n“We need a progressive congressman who will stand up for opportunity and justice for everyone, not just those at the top,” Sims said. “In Congress, I’ll fight to invest in our kids and our classrooms, create real economic fairness and opportunity, and stand up to the NRA to get the guns off our streets.” \nAmong those praising Sims upon his declaration he would pursue a U.S. House seat was Andrea Sanders, a local activist in Philadelphia. \n“Brian is a ferocious advocate for the people of this community,” Sanders said. “When it comes to fighting for the people he represents, there is no one more dedicated or tenacious than Brian. He’ll make a great Congressman.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:56:50.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
