Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) has been busy this year promoting a plan now under consideration on Capitol Hill that would essentially privatize air-traffic control. He says his role as co-chairman of a think-tank working group convinced him the change is needed. What he hasn't mentioned in at least two appearances is that in June he signed on as a paid lobbyist for American Airlines, which is pushing the plan. At least one member of Congress was surprised to find out about Dorgan's lobbying client after meeting with him on the issue as a think-tank representative, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting. He also spoke to an aviation summit two weeks ago and said nothing about his lobbying role.\nDorgan, who served in the Senate from 1992 to 2011, drew $10,000 in the second quarter to lobby for American on \"air traffic control reform and related issues,\" according to a lobbying disclosure. The company's chairman and CEO, Doug Parker, testified in March before the House aviation subcommittee that air traffic control should be broken out of the Federal Aviation Administration and run under a \"commercialized, non-profit type governance structure.\"\nTwo months later, on the other side of the dome, Dorgan made a similar case, in written and oral testimony , before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation, which he used to chair. As a senator, Dorgan was skeptical of privatizing air traffic control, but while leading a two-year working group at the Eno Center for Transportation he concluded that air traffic control should be spun off into a \"new independent entity, which should be a government corporation or a non-profit organization that is fully outside the federal government.\"\nIn June, Dorgan formerly registered and started lobbying for American.\n\"What I have done has been disclosed publicly and I certainly would not try to keep from anyone knowledge of what I’m doing,\" Dorgan told POLITICO. \"I feel very strongly about the kind of thing we did at the Eno project and I'm happy to promote the result.\"\nDorgan's co-chairman on the Eno committee, former U.S. Secretary of Transportation Jim Burnley, has l obbied for American Airlines since the 1990s. The company paid Burnley and his firm, Venable LLP, $110,000 in the second quarter on issues including \"ATC reform.\"\n\"Having people who were employed directly by or represented major aviation players was the whole point of the exercise, and if someone is suggesting there was something inappropriate about that, that is hilarious,\" Burnley said. \"When I talk about it or meet with people, I'm very open and above-board about the fact that I represent a major airline.\"\nDorgan's revised position came through his work at Eno, said Joshua Schank, who led the center until last month. Schank said he didn't know Dorgan is now working for American.\nDorgan and Burnley \"both decided to lobby on behalf of a client who completely agrees with their position, not that they came in with this client and therefore took this position,\" Schank said.\nThe non-partisan Eno Center received $25,000 from American Airlines and $10,000 from the U.S. Travel Association, which also supports privatizing air traffic control, according to the center's 2013 tax form (the most recent available). The think tank also got $10,000 apiece from the National Business Aviation Association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which oppose the plan. The center took in $401,307 overall.\nLobbyists collect fees, do no lobbying By Eamon Javers\nPaul Lewis, Eno's vice president of policy, said he wasn't aware of Dorgan's and Burnley's lobbying for American, but he doesn't believe it undermines the independence of Eno's working group.\nTwo weeks ago, Dorgan spoke at the Commercial Aviation Industry Summit at the National Press Club, sponsored by Airlines For America, the trade group led by Parker, the American Airlines CEO. Dorgan cited his work for Eno but did not describe himself as a lobbyist.\n“I feel very strongly that we need now to take a pretty big step, it’s a pretty heavy lift to do so, but create this government-chartered non-profit organization that will allow America to lead the world in this area,” he said.\nThe former senator isn't breaking the law by failing to volunteer his client, according to Kenneth Gross, a lawyer at the law firm Skadden Arps who specializes in regulation of political activity.\nCraig Holman, government affairs lobbyist at watchdog group Public Citizen, said Dorgan should have been forthcoming about his lobbying interests in any meetings on the issue. \"If you've been a member of a legislature or Congress, you also understand how important it is that lobbyists are honest and upfront,\" he said.\nKathryn Wolfe contributed to this report .\n<div", "external_links": ["http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=6b58f65b-cb03-48b5-9561-7b1028e92308&filingTypeID=64", "http://summit.airlines.org/agenda/atc-reform/", "http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/66374e94-55b9-45e6-99bc-676d9646da75/2A01D2D4A746DE074918E85F97E65137.hon.-dorgan-testimony.pdf", "http://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/hearings?ID=C995602E-2171-4047-9C0E-2E1B9B9A0512", "http://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2015-03-24-parker.pdf", "http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&filingID=56b68e70-11bf-4342-8703-a7e3dd18c0ca&filingTypeID=60", "http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/060/060662124/060662124_201312_990PF.pdf?_ga=1.6283827.126233843.1444394754"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:24:56.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
