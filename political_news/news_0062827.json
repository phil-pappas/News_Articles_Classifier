(AP) â€” A suspect has been arrested in a shooting that left an Albuquerque officer critically wounded, officials said early Thursday.\nThe eight-year veteran officer underwent surgery Wednesday night after being shot multiple times.\nPolice said that a suspect was in custody, but no other details on the arrest were immediately available.\nThe announcement came after contingents of officers spread out in eastern Albuquerque hunting for a shooter.\nThe shooting occurred around 7:45 p.m. by a Walgreen's near the junction of Eubank and Central Avenue, just south of Interstate 40.\nAlbuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden said the initial investigation showed that the officer was shot during a traffic stop.\nHe was hit multiple times and underwent surgery, Eden said. His name was being withheld until relatives are notified.\n\"For me, this is a terrible day. A terrible day,\" Eden said at a news conference, during which he also announced a suspect in the road-rage shooting death of a 4-year-old girl had been arrested.\nSpeaking before the arrest report, Eden described the suspect as armed and dangerous.\nHe had urged residents in the area of the store to stay inside with doors and windows locked, and to call 911 about anything suspicious.\n\"Pray for his (the injured officer's) family,\" he said.\nHe said Bernalillo County Sheriff's deputies and the state police assisted in the search.\nEubank had been closed from Central Avenue to Interstate 40.\n___\nAP writer Bob Seavey in Phoenix contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
