There also are no caps on lobbyist gifts. \nBrunner, who lives in the St. Louis suburb of Frontenac, needs to distinguish himself from the four other GOP candidates: State Sen. Bob Dixon, former Navy SEAL officer Eric Greitens, former U.S. attorney and Missouri House Speaker Catherine Hanaway and Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder . \nAttorney General Chris Koster is the only Democrat who has said he plans to run, although he hasn't yet formally entered the race. Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon can't run for re-election because he's reached his term limit. \nBrunner isn't a new face in Missouri politics, despite his lack of experience in office. He's long been a donor to other conservative candidates and he poured millions of dollars into a failed U.S. Senate campaign in 2012. Brunner lost in a Republican primary to former U.S. Rep. Todd Akin , who in turn lost to Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill . \nCampaign spokesman Mike Hafner said Brunner has learned from his last attempt for elected office and plans to focus more on building grass-roots support. Brunner so far has donated at least $87,600 to an exploratory committee that allowed him to fundraise while mulling over whether to launch a full-blown campaign, according to campaign finance records. His wife has given his campaign $50,000. \nBrunner said in the video that he's a \"threat to the political class and their big-dollar donors because I can't be bought.\" \nFollow Summer Ballentine on Twitter at https://twitter.com/esballentine FILE - In this Aug. 7, 2012, file photo, Republican John Brunner speaks to supporters in Clayton, Mo., during his bid for the U.S. Senate.
