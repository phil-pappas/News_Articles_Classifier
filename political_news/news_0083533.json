More EU ‘flawed concept’, says City fund manager \nAlthough a founder member of the Tory Free Enterprise Group, Ms Truss believes a bit of state pressure on supermarkets and the catering industry to promote British food is entirely appropriate. \nThe environment and rural affairs secretary points out that food is Britain’s biggest manufacturing industry; bigger than the car sector and aerospace combined, and that the country needs to export more and import less. \nSpeaking before the Tory party conference, Ms Truss has an appropriately patriotic response to the issue: persuading supermarkets to fly the flag to make it clearer to consumers the provenance of their food. \n“I want supermarkets to be much clearer,” she says. “I’m talking about things like using the Union Jack prominently — it’s using that mark of excellence in the UK as well.” \nThe minister wants regional brands to be given more prominence but accepts that many retailers are already responding to consumer demand. A Union Jack tractor symbol is already used as a mark of quality. \nMs Truss’s department is also pushing for Britain to export more under the “Great” brand and is expected to take on more direct marketing responsibility from UK Trade and Investment in the coming months. \nThe 40 year-old Norfolk MP also has some intriguing ideas of where the next wave of UK food exports may come from. \nShe intends to make “a treasure trove” of agricultural data available from the Defra files to help farmers branch into new areas, including into the fast-expanding wine sector. \n“The wine industry is booming in this country,” she says. East Anglia alone has 60 commercial vineyards and a lot are now exporting. We’re exporting sparkling wine to France. They think it’s high quality.” \nMs Truss also says she wants British drinks manufacturers to exploit a growing international market for gin. “My ambition is for gin to be as big as whisky on the international stage,” she says. \nThe minister is going on a trade promotion exercise to China next month in which she is also going to be promoting British dairy products, including cheese, a sector which she believes is underperforming. \n“Dairy is a big opportunity,” she says. “We have seen exports up 60 per cent since 2009 but most of the yoghurt we buy at the moment is imported. There are products like Brie that people might want to buy, but we’re importing 40,000 tons of Cheddar every year when it’s a great British cheese.” \nAs part of her drive to promote British food, the eurosceptic Ms Truss is applying to the EU for more “protected names” to be registered, joining a pantheon of already recognised products such as the Birmingham Balti and Westcountry Farmhouse Cheddar. \n“We have 63 registered at the moment and France has 200,” she says. “My ambition is to get up to those levels. We know these names command a premium in the market.” \nCarmarthen Ham and Cromer Crab are among those in the pending file. \nBut does Britain actually need so much farmland these days, especially when there is an acute housing crisis? Ms Truss says she supports the use of farmland for farming but there has to be some flexibility. \n“I like the idea of villages being able to expand incrementally,” she says. “If they want to expand a few houses every year that should be possible.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:54:14.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
