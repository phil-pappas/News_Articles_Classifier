Do you favor or oppose doing this?\"\nMore black respondents supported removal (46 percent) than opposed it (31 percent), but the poll showed there there is nothing close to consensus on the issue in the African-American community.\n\"Personally, I would have expected a larger percentage of black voters in favor of removing (the monuments). That wasn't the case,\" Faucheux said. \"But that's what you do polls for.\"\nWhite voters, on the other hand, were far more unified in their opposition to removing the monuments. About 85 percent wanted to keep the monuments in place. Only 5 percent want them taken down.\nThat was another surprise, Faucheux said. Voters, especially white voters, around the state had very strong feelings, even though the debate has been focused on New Orleans, where Mayor Mitch Landrieu is leading an effort to remove statues of three Confederate grandees -- Robert E. Lee, P.G.T. Beauregard and Jefferson Davis -- as well as a monument commemorating the Battle of Liberty Place, the bloody culmination of an 1874 coup launched by ex-Confederates against the integrated Reconstruction government.\nMore people were undecided about who to vote for in the governor's race than were unsure about the monuments, Faucheux said. Ninety percent of Republicans opposed removal, he said.\nNew Orleans' removal effort has dominated headlines, but Confederate monuments and place names are widespread in Louisiana, which might help to explain voters' passion.\nThe emotional resonance has drawn gubernatorial candidates into the debate. All three Republican candidates said they oppose removal. Sen. David Vitter in particular has gone out of his way to score political points on the issue.\nJohn Bel Edwards, the lone Democrat, has neither endorsed nor expressed opposition to removal of the monuments, saying only that the decision should be made locally.\nIn all, the poll found that about two-thirds of Louisiana voters say the monuments should stay where they are.\nThe poll also found strong opposition to removal among voters in metropolitan New Orleans, an area that included Orleans, Jefferson, Plaquemines, St. Bernard and St. Tammany parishes, Faucheux said, but the sample size was too small to gain meaningful insight into sentiment in New Orleans proper.\nWhite voters in New Orleans tend to be far more liberal than voters statewide, so it's reasonable to expect there is more support for removal there than elsewhere, Faucheux said. Without a local poll, though, it's impossible to say whether Landrieu is leading the pack or following it, he said.\nA spokeswoman for the Landrieu administration said the mayor hasn't had any local polling done to gauge how voters feel.\n\"Mayor Landrieu began the discussion about monuments because he thought it was the right thing to do, not because it was politically popular,\" Sarah McLaughlin, Landrieu's communications director, said in an email. \"That discussion has brought out strong opinions on both sides, along with the position of three commissions who supported relocating the monuments. As the discussion continues, the hope is that the people of New Orleans will continue to engage around difficult issues related to history and race in an effort to find common ground that moves the city forward. Mayor Landrieu has a strong belief that symbols do matter and should reflect who we are as a people.\"\nHaving trouble viewing the interactive map above?
