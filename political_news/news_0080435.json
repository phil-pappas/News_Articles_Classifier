Some did. However, the author of the following post understands the extra attention based on Colorado's leading role in progressive cannabis policy.\nHere's what he had to say.\nNathanael Mulder writes:\nIt's news, no matter how you look at it. It's a pretty big failure of the industry, having almost 25% of shops fail the check. It's a first for the industry, and the industry is still in its infancy. This is what regulation brings with it. Stores get fined or shut down for selling cigarettes to minors as well. We have to remain above the fray and within the confines of the law if we are to establish trust and respect with the community and the country. Minors having access at stores is a big worry of the federal government and every other state that is watching us. We have been the shining example of how to do it right, and now we've been sullied. Time to double our efforts and prove that we're still the best in the country for legal weed.
