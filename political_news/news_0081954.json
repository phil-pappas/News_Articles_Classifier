At this election, the Scottish Conservatives have a huge opportunity.\"\nShe added: \"I believe we have the chance to appeal right across the board - to be the voice of the two million Scots who want to keep our country together.\n\"In May, many Scottish Conservatives voted tactically, supporting other pro-UK parties in the hope of stopping the SNP.\n\"I can tell you, there are two reasons why this will not happen next year.\n\"Firstly, because Labour and the Lib Dems now seem embarrassed by their support of our union. And secondly because next year every single vote counts.\nPromoted stories \"As the head of our campaign, I have made it clear to my team that I want to target the regional list vote next year.\n\"For so long as the SNP refuses to rule out another referendum, our message for voters looking to cast that second vote is clear.\n\"If you're one of the two million people who voted no in last year's referendum, use it as your intelligent vote for the union.\"\nMs Davidson told delegates that while fighting elections was exciting, the party should not forget what it is fighting for.\n\"I don't want us to be just the party of the technocrat. The grudging vote of competence,\" she said.\n\"I want us to be the party of the thinkers, the dreamers, the reformers and the visionaries too.\n\"The zeal of the missionary, the courage of the pioneer, the ambition to lift our eyes to the horizon and say 'there's a new Jerusalem we want to build and we will work towards it every day'.\"\nLabour's shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said: \"Ruth Davidson had the chance to back 350,000 working families in Scotland by calling for a halt to the Tory tax credit cuts.\n\"People in Scotland won't forget that when push came to shove Ruth Davidson sided with David Cameron rather than working families.\"\nScottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: \"Ruth Davidson's party have done more damage to the union since the referendum than Alex Salmond managed in the last decade.\n\"People should not be fooled. The Tories are not the party of the union. They are the party of massive cuts to tax credits that hurt working families. They are the party of immigration scaremongering. That is what Ruth Davidson is asking people to vote for.\"\nSNP MSP Stewart Maxwell said: \"(Secretary of State for Scotland) David Mundell and Ruth Davidson's dismal, negative speeches today displayed the exact same attitude which saw the Tories get their lowest share of the vote for over a century at the general election.\n\"With their appalling track record on the economy, social security, the constitution and so many other issues - the Tories are completely out of step with opinion in Scotland.\nShare article \"And rather than helping matters, this party conference has been filled with the same right-wing rhetoric and devotion to austerity that has pushed Tory support to its lowest point in Scotland since 1865.\n\"The Tories are already at their lowest ebb in Scotland in 150 years - and unless they quickly buck up their ideas and deliver the full powers we were promised, things are only going to get worse for the quickly diminishing band of Tories in Scotland.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-07T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:56:34.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
