(AP) - Candidates for Louisiana governor are crisscrossing the state, working the phones and filling the airwaves with their final pitches, hoping to drum up interest from undecided voters for Saturday’s election. \nNone of the four major contenders is expected to top 50 percent support, so a Nov. 21 runoff will decide which man follows term-limited Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal into office. And the competition to make it into that runoff has been fierce, mainly on the GOP side. \nRepublican U.S. Sen. David Vitter has campaigned as front-runner, but his poll numbers have slipped amid continued hits about his 2007 prostitution scandal. \nRepublican rivals - Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle and Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne - are trying to peel enough support from Vitter to squeak into the runoff. Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards appears to have locked up runoff a spot in November, with a core base of party support. \nPolls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday. Fewer than half the state’s voters are expected to cast ballots. \nAngelle spent Friday touring his Acadiana home region, including a lunch stop at a seafood house in Abbeville. Vitter was phone-banking, sign-waving and door-knocking heading into Election Day, according to campaign spokesman Luke Bolar. \nDardenne attended an LSU lunch honoring his son’s business and had an afternoon question and answer session on Facebook scheduled. Edwards also was in the Baton Rouge area Friday, doing phone-in interviews to radio stations, attending Catholic mass and knocking on doors, his campaign said. \nVitter and a super PAC supporting him have outraised and outspent the other contenders. But he’s faced hits from two outside groups formed solely to oppose his candidacy. One of them has been regularly running TV ads about the prostitution scandal. \nBoth Angelle and Dardenne also reference the eight-year-old scandal, when Vitter apologized for a “very serious sin” after his number was found in the phone records of Washington’s “D.C. Madam.” \n“We have a stench that is getting ready to come over Louisiana if we elect David Vitter as governor,” Angelle said in the last TV debate this week, which Vitter did not attend. \nDardenne’s campaign has focused on making “Louisiana proud.” He’s accused Vitter and the pro-Vitter super PAC of using misleading attacks ads and trying to buy the election. In his latest ad, Dardenne says Vitter and “Washington outsiders” supporting him are “dangerous.” \n“There won’t be a second Louisiana purchase,” Dardenne says, looking into the camera. \nVitter left his closing argument on TV to his wife, Wendy. In the widely-run ad, Vitter’s wife, sitting on a couch, says Vitter will “turn Louisiana around.” \n“David has the courage to stand up to the Baton Rouge politicians,” she says. \nSix other statewide races are also on the ballot, along with four constitutional amendments, state legislative seats and local elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:53:44.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
