That there are efficiencies you can find. You can get more officers on the front line, you can cut crime and you can save money and we're asking them to continue to do that job.\nHow exactly the money is saved and indeed the money is spent will be a matter for them. I think community support officers do an excellent job.\n– Prime Minister David Cameron London's mayor spent almost £220,000 buying and upgrading three second-hand German water cannons following the riots in 2011 but in July the Home Secretary rejected the Met's request for a licence to use them.\nI support what the mayor does and he does an excellent job but here there is a very important role which is for the Home Secretary to decide whether this should be licensed and on the basis. On the basis of the advice she received the evidence to date, the decision was not to do so. But that wasn't ruling it out for ever and a day.\n– Prime Minister David Cameron Last updated Mon 5 Oct 2015 Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:50:35.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
