While 92 percent of Americans believe it's important to wash their hands after using a public restroom, only 66 percent of Americans say they always wash up after using a public restroom. As for washing with soap, nearly 70 percent admit they've skipped the suds and just rinsed with water.\nThe survey also found that the majority of Americans come up short on how long they wash their hands. Nearly 60 percent of Americans wash their hands for just 15 seconds or less, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing with soap for at least 20 seconds to allow enough time to remove and rinse off germs.\n\"Universally, proper hand washing practices – whether it be at home, health care facilities, schools or community gatherings – are proven to help stave off germs that cause sickness,\" says Jon Dommisse , director of global marketing and strategic development for Bradley Corporation. \"In addition to cold and flu germs, hand washing with soap minimizes the transmission of other ailments seen on a global level like diarrhea, pneumonia and other contagious diseases.\n\"In the spirit of Global Handwashing Day, it's incumbent on all of us in the building construction and facility maintenance industry to provide hand washing facilities – especially ones that are clean and well-maintained – to encourage thorough hand washing.\"\nFor more than 90 years, Bradley Corporation has designed and manufactured commercial washfountains, and today is the industry's exclusive source for plumbing fixtures, washroom accessories, restroom partitions, emergency fixtures and solid plastic lockers. Headquartered in Menomonee Falls, Wis. , Bradley serves the commercial, industrial, health care, recreation, education, and corrections markets worldwide.
