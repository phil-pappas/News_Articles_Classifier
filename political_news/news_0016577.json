Different from traditional drugs, peptides occur naturally in the body. RCT's proprietary therapies work by stimulating the body's innate repair response – unleashing its intrinsic ability to heal itself. Peptide therapeutics can also be highly personalized, allowing RCT to design each treatment to a patient's specific needs. Through the careful administration of these customized peptide therapies, RCT has demonstrated the ability to modify the course of a diverse range of diseases; from neurological diseases like Alzheimer's, brain injury, and dementia, to rheumatic conditions like arthritis and lupus. Patients from all over the world have traveled to RCT's clinic, and given powerful testimony to the impact of RCT's pioneering approach to medicine.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150922/269607\nPeptide and Protein Therapy has deep roots at RCT. Building on research that began over 30 years ago, RCT continues to refine and optimize these remarkable therapies. Acting as chemical \"messengers,\" peptides communicate with our DNA, telling it to create proteins in the body that can facilitate natural healing. At RCT's state-of-the-art facility, a multi-step, ultra-purification process is used to isolate an exclusive combination of peptides and proteins for every patient, based on a careful assessment of his or her needs. These personalized treatments then target and actually change the disease process to prevent further deterioration, while simultaneously stimulating the body's own repair mechanisms – all without toxic side effects. Patients that respond well have experienced striking remissions from autoimmune conditions and various forms of cancer, as well as dramatic improvements for a spectrum of neurological disorders, including a significant increase in the cognitive function of advanced Alzheimer's patients.\n\" Encountering a serious illness is a life altering event and is often met with uncertainty and unease about the future. RCT is diligently working to give patients the treatment their body needs to move forward,\" said Dr. Donese Worden , Advisor at RC Therapy. \"The facility provides leading-edge technology and therapies to assist in the healing process, and the entire staff is committed to helping patients in all aspects of their health.\"\nThe team of doctors at RCT believes in the body's own capacity to heal, and the importance of caring for the needs of each individual patient.
