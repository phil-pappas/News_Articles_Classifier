In addition, there were numerous violations found during the data review of the microbiological testing areas of the laboratory.\n\"We believe that, now with this agreement, Microbac has demonstrated that going forward they now have the capability to consistently generate valid, accurate data and that they will strive to implement laboratory quality standards,\" said Dr. Martina McGarvey , director of the DEP Bureau of Laboratories. \"Recent inspections at other Microbac Laboratories' divisions have reflected positive quality improvements within Microbac Inc.\"\nBased upon DEP's assessment, Microbac's division Center Valley agreed to subcontract microbiology samples impacted by the violations on February 24, 2015 and to voluntarily relinquish all accreditations July 1, 2015 . Microbac Inc. purchased the Center Valley division in November 2013 . As part of the company's strategic realignment of services in eastern Pennsylvania , Microbac no longer conducts accredited analysis at Central Valley for compliance purposes. Pennsylvania DEP was Microbac – Center Valley's primary accreditation authority.\nThe Department found that Microbac – Center Valley inaccurately reported results for microbiology samples for public water supply clients using incubators that did no maintain the required temperatures thus calling into question the validity and accuracy of the compliance data.\nMEDIA CONTACT: Neil Shader , 717-787-1323\n releases/pennsylvania-dep-reaches-civil-penalty-agreement-with-microbacs-division-laboratory--center-valley-300156871.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-dep-reaches-civil-penalty-agreement-with-microbacs-division-laboratory--center-valley-300156871.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC24010&Transmission_Id=201510081438PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC24010&DateId=20151008", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:58:44.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
