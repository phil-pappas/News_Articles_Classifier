He was sentenced Wednesday.\nOn Jan. 29, 2013, Green grabbed a 17-year-old girl from behind and attempted to carry her away as she walked home from Bolingbrook High School. A passing motorist stopped to help the girl and “frightened off the attacker,” who fled in a dark Ford Explorer, according to a statement from prosecutors.\nTwo days later, Green followed a 16-year-old girl as she walked to her girlfriend’s Bolingbrook apartment building after school. He grabbed the girl in the hallway and attempted to cover her mouth, but she struck him with her elbow and screamed for help, prosecutors said. Green then ran away.\nBolingbrook police searched vehicle records to identify people who owned dark Explorers and who fit the description provided by the two victims and the driver who helped the first girl. Detectives identified Green as a potential suspect, and he was later picked out of a photo lineup by all three witnesses, according to prosecutors.\n“A dangerous man has been taken off our streets because of two brave girls who refused to become victims, a courageous good Samaritan who refused to look the other way, and dogged police work by detectives who refused to let their community become the hunting grounds for a predator,” State’s Attorney James Glasgow said in the statement.\nOnce he is released from prison, Green must register as a violent offender for 10 years, according to prosecutors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:10:48.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
