Charlie Baker's administration is revising downward its state revenue projection for the current fiscal year. In a letter to the governor and the Legislature's Ways and Means committee, Secretary of Administration and Finance Kristen LePore said total budgeted revenue is now seen as falling $145 million short of the estimate on which the state's $38 billion budget is based. LePore says the state remains on track to meet its goal of $26.1 billion in tax collections for the fiscal year that started July 1. The problem is with non-tax revenues — including various state fees — that are coming in at a lower-than-expected clip. Baker has made no move to cut spending at this time. A shortfall in last year's budget required a $765 million patch by the administration and Legislature. southcoasttoday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:34:02.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
