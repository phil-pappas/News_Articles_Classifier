On Monday, there is also expected to be a highly contentious debate in the House over reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, following a rare procedural step in which rank-and-file Republicans and Democrats joined to force House leaders to call a vote on the matter. That small show of bipartisanship was a brief exception to the rancor that characterizes most business in Congress these days. Those divisions were on full display during Friday’s floor debate over the reconciliation package, as Republicans cheered the push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “This is a great opportunity to get some awful things off the back of the American public,” said Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois. Many Republicans have been angered by videos that purport to show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted fetuses for use in medical research. Planned Parenthood has said that opponents of abortion rights doctored those videos. House Republicans have undertaken several investigations, and at one point were pressing to include provisions in the temporary spending measure that would have cut funding for Planned Parenthood. Those efforts failed, and Democrats said the push on the reconciliation would have a similar result. House Democratic leaders on Friday held a news conference in which they called on Republicans to swiftly move a measure that lifts the debt ceiling without conditions. “We have seven legislative days left until we default on the full faith and credit of the United States of America,” said the Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California. “This is a very, very serious matter — in fact, it’s as serious as it gets for our economy, for interest rates.” Even as the Democrats were talking about the debt limit, Republicans were lining up to take ceremonial photographs with Mr. Boehner, a sign of the historic shift that will take place next week. In an initial vote on Wednesday, Republicans are expected to nominate Mr. Ryan to be speaker, with a formal vote on the House floor set for Thursday. \nFollow the New York Times’s politics and Washington coverage on Facebook and Twitter , and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter .
