In that time, he has devoted himself to the well-being of Harrison, participating in many community activities, including years as a coach in our recreational youth programs. He is intelligent, has the highest integrity, and someone I am proud to call my friend. \nJudge Lust is known for his strong sense of fairness and the professional way he runs his court, treating everyone with dignity and respect. He is also a past president of the Westchester County Magistrates Association. \nWith Judge Lustâ€™s leadership, our Town Court has earned an outstanding reputation for dispensing fair justice. \nAnd, the Harrison police know who to turn to when they need to get their job done. Whether to issue a search warrant or to get out of bed to conduct an arraignment, Judge Lust is the person the Harrison police turn to for assistance. \nIn recent weeks, some negative comments have circulated regarding Judge Lust, based on unsubstantiated allegations, and it is important to remember sometimes things aren't always how they appear. \nLet's not lose sight of what Judge Lust has done for our community these past 16 years. The goal is to elect the most qualified candidate and that makes our choice on Election Day an easy one. \nVote for Judge Lust on Nov. 3, so he can continue to serve our community. \nMartin Rogowsky", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:09:34.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
