The military members' data, including home addresses and photos, was scraped from publicly available websites and passed on to Junaid Hussein, a British hacker who was active on social media recruiting westerners to join ISIS, authorities said. The U.S. military announced in August that it had killed Hussein in an airstrike in Syria. He was a leading member of ISIS's so-called CyberCaliphate, which has carried out mostly nuisance hacks on military and other government websites in the U.S., France and other countries. Malaysian authorities agreed to extradite the hacker, a Kosovo native who was living in Malaysia, to the U.S. where he is expected to face U.S. cybercrime charges. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:01:54.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
