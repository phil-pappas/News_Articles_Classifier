When asked to comment on the diversion of funds, CBI spokesperson said the probe is in initial stage and every input is being evaluated.\nThe sources remained tight-lipped about the countries where such transfers were made as they feel it might compromise the information that they might be seeking through letters rogatory, judicial requests, from these countries.\n\"There was no need for the bank to take the exposure outside the consortium when already other loans were getting stressed,\" a senior CBI official, probing the matter, had earlier said on the IDBI loan.\nLast week, CBI registered a case against Vijay Mallya, Director of defunct Kingfisher Airlines, the company, A Raghunathan, Chief Financial Officer of the Airlines, and unknown officials of IDBI Bank in connection with alleged default of over Rs 900 crore loan from the Bank.\nIt is alleged that the loan was sanctioned in violation of norms regarding credit limits. CBI had carried out raids at the offices and residence of Mallya in Mumbai, Goa, Bangalore and other places.\n\"The CBI officials visited UB Group premises in Bengaluru, Goa and Mumbai in the course of an investigation regarding a loan facility availed by Kingfisher Airlines. \"The company co-operated with the officials,\" the official spokesperson of the UB Group had said.\n business latest companies Kingfisher Also Read Air India resumes Delhi-Moscow flight service after 15 years Gold futures slide on weak global cues Sensex rises on global cues; metals stocks surge Parag Parikh dies on way to Buffett meet", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Mallya_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Mallya_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/business-latest/article/cbi-likely-file-more-firs-kingfisher-loans-case", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:05:53.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
