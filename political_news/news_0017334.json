Pat Quinn’s scandal-plagued anti-violence initiative. But his biggest client, as it turns out, was Brown, records show.\nBrown’s campaign fund paid the video production company based at her husband’s then-South Side home nearly $90,000 over a four-year period ending in 2010, according to Illinois State Board of Elections records. The business, Gideon Video Productions, doesn’t appear to have been licensed with the state of Illinois, the city of Chicago or Cook County.\nThis is a developing story.
