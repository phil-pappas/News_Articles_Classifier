For me however there are other approaches we should take. A lot of the issues are deep rooted, generational and societal.”\nLyle recommended a “wide ranging and holistic approach” with children taught to be tolerant.\n“Education is one root (sic) which we can take and is a strand to a wider approach. I would push for the Government to undertake their fuller review on the OBFA and take it from there.”\nDr Stuart Waiton, senior sociology lecturer at Abertay University and author of Snob’s Law, a book on the OBFA, urged other SNP MSPs to be as sceptical as Lyle.\n“This is arguably the most authoritarian piece of legislation in modern times in Britain. That you can go to prison for five years for being offensive at a football match is insane.”\nThe OBFA followed a spate of violent incidents in the 2010-11 football season, including 35 arrests and a clash between club managers at an Old Firm game.\nCeltic manager Neil Lennon was also targeted with parcel bombs and live bullets in the post, and lunged at by a Hearts fan at the Tynecastle dugout.\nIn response, the government pushed the OBFA through parliament in a few months, creating new offences around inciting religious hatred and offensive chanting associated with football.\nHowever opposition parties said the legislation was being “railroaded” through Holyrood and only SNP MSPs voted for it - all other MSPs abstained.\nIn the wake of a recent evaluation of the OBFA, the government said it was now “exploring positive alternatives to prosecution for young people through early intervention, voluntary work and formal warnings”.\nShare article A spokeswoman said: “We remain actively engaged with clubs and fans and will continue to work closely with relevant organisations and agencies to ensure this legislation achieves what it set out to do, stamping out prejudice and bigotry from football in Scotland once and for all.”\nLyle did not return calls.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-04T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T02:41:22.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
