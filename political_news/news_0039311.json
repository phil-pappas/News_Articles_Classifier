Egypt's long-awaited parliamentary elections will start on Oct. 18-19, a hoped-for step toward democracy amid a harsh crackdown on dissent. The second stage of the staggered vote will take place on Nov. 22-23. Final results will be announced in early December. Arabic reads, \"Ahmed Fekry.\" (AP Photo/Amr Nabil)\nAssociated Press Oct. 17, 2015 | 6:19 a.m. EDT + More By MERRIT KENNEDY, Associated Press\nCAIRO (AP) — Egyptians residing abroad began casting votes Saturday in the country's first parliamentary election since the 2013 military overthrow of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.\nEgypt's state-run news wire MENA said embassies and consulates in 139 countries will be open for two days of voting.\nThe vote is staggered, with polling in half of Egypt's governorates set to start Sunday. The election will take place in two phases, concluding in early December.\nPresident Abdel Fattah el-Sissi called on Egyptians to vote in a televised speech Saturday.\n\"Line up in front of polling stations and plant with your votes the hope for a bright tomorrow for our new Egypt,\" he said.\nVoting will go forward in Egypt under heavy security, in light of regular militant attacks since Morsi's ouster. At least 185,000 military troops will secure the election in the first phase, MENA reported. Interior Ministry spokesman Abu Bakr Abdel-Karim says they will be joined by 180,000 police.\nFew candidates have broad recognition or clear platforms, and most have a pro-government bent.\nThe vote will mark the final step in what has been billed as a transition to democracy. But critics say the next legislature is likely to be a rubber-stamp body that further solidifies the power of el-Sissi, a former general who led Morsi's overthrow.\nThe vote is also taking place in an atmosphere in which public criticism of the government is strongly discouraged. Virtually the entire media is supportive of el-Sissi and regularly berates critics as traitors or supporters of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which is now officially branded a terrorist group.\nEgypt has been without a parliament since it was dissolved by a court ruling in 2012.\nThe 2011 election, held after the uprising that toppled longtime autocrat Hosni Mubarak, saw candidates from across the political spectrum, from ultra-conservative Islamists to left-wing youths, vying for seats. Egyptians stood in line for hours to cast their votes — many for the first time in their lives — and the Muslim Brotherhood won the largest bloc.\nNone of the key liberal figures that helped fuel the 2011 uprising, like Nobel Peace laureate Mohamed ElBaradei or former presidential candidate Hamdeen Sabahi, are running in the current elections.\nIn the face of the government's crackdown and curbed freedoms, lesser known pro-democracy activists who burst onto the political scene in 2011 have either sought exile abroad, withdrawn from public politics or been jailed.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
