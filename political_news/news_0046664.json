However, we have established it was because a five-year lease ended in January this year and the building was sold in June. \n\"The Auckland-based programme is moving to a temporary site in a scout hall. The Defence Force plans to close it in 2017. \n\"The Minister was caught in an embarrassing situation today in Parliament when she did not have any of this information yet the programme is from the Ministry she has responsibility for. \n\"The Minister insists that only 800 of almost 25,000 unemployed youth would be suitable for this course - which is a ludicrous and unprovable claim,\" says Mr Ball. \n\"Minister Tolley needs to increase places on the LSV programme and stop any further unjustified cost cutting to continue.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:08:50.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
