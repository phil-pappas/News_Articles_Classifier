'She liked her hair soft. She liked it teased. She liked it rolled. She liked it sprayed' Eivind Bjerke, stylist \nShe also catalogued all the clothes, noting which was worn when and naming them according to the place at which each appeared (“Kiev”, “Versailles”) or because of what they looked like (“Gloriana”). \nShe was particularly pleased with the navy and white check suit which Mrs Thatcher wore in the election campaign, in which she “looked a million dollars”. \nMrs Thatcher herself had a good memory for what she had worn when, and liked to wear old favourites, or, as she sometimes called them, “recipes”, revamped. \nThe countryside look: Dressing for the campaign trail in Cornwall, 1983 \nFor someone who was so busy and needed to change fast, dresses were vulnerable and complicated: suits were better. \nShe preferred sturdy tweeds, brocades and British wool to frail silks or linen, and was preoccupied with “a very good line”. \nRegal style: Thatcher came to dess like the Queen She was well upholstered, well covered and always perfectly groomed and coiffed, although, when travelling, she never took a hairdresser but relied on local stylists. \n“She had very nice hair [although] a little bit on the fine side,” recalled Eivind Bjerke, her stylist of choice in the US. \n“She liked it – in today’s parlance – a little bit old fashioned. She liked her hair soft. She liked it teased. She liked it rolled. She liked it sprayed. \n\"It also had to be something that, when she was photographed from all angles, would look good.” \nShortly before the 1987 general election, Mrs Thatcher visited Moscow and was looking for a coup de theatre. Crawfie told her, “if you’re going to Moscow, I think we’d better buy you some new clothes. Mrs Gorbachev always wears Yves Saint Laurent.” \nMargaret and Denis Thatcher with George Bush and his wife Barbara in 1987 Photo: Rex Features \nCrawfie saw a black coat in the window of Aquascutum, which she got on approval. She also found a camel-hair coat with a sable collar and borrowed a sable hat from a friend. \nMrs Thatcher arrived in Moscow late on Saturday 28 March, and descended from the plane in her black coat and fur hat, carrying a black crocodile skin handbag. \nThatcher and Denis on a state visit to Jordan in 1985, with King Hussein (centre) and the Jordanian Prime Minister (far right) \nCrawfie recalled, “she looked stunning”. She went to watch Swan Lake at the Bolshoi Theatre wearing a black lace evening dress lent to her by her friend Lady Glover. \nEverything comes from the shoulders: Thatcher was inspired by Vogue editor Anna Wintour She was never informal, because she instinctively recognised that this would invite a familiarity which would weaken her, but she had learnt from her mother, “do not sit around in good clothes”. \nShe could never afford to be “flamboyant, daring, sexy”, she once told an interviewer ; and when asked where she bought her underwear, the reassuringly unsexy answer was Marks and Spencer. \nAlthough Mrs Thatcher’s style was, in a sense, conventional, she rejected the cliché of the female executive which sought to imitate men – the pinstripe, the dull navy suit. \nShe made sure she stood out, and her female equivalent of armour made her feel powerful, but she knew that being powerful is like being a lady: if you have to tell people you are, you aren’t.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:05:49.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
