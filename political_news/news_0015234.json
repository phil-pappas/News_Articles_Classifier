And we're not as different as people think,\" Trump told CNN about the poll results. \"You know we have a very good relationship. ... But there is certainly a different style. You know, I have great assets and he has some great assets. But we are both resonating, there's no question about it.\" \nEarlier Tuesday, Trump also told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day,\" \"Well I like [Carson], he likes me. I mean, stranger things have happened … But it's too early to think about.\" \nNo other Republican candidate besides Trump and Carson has double-digit support nationwide, according to the poll.

A summer fling, momentary amusement,\" said Wallace. \"As I watch that interview and I heard what he had to say about the country and about trade and about losing and just the sheer force of his personality, I am beginning to believe he could be elected president of the United States.\" \nThe Republican strategists told National Review that momentum is key to grab wins in the early primary states, which are essential to securing victories later on and Trump has that right now. \n\"He has the potential to win Iowa and New Hampshire and more,\" said Rollins. \"No one seems to be developing to challenge him at this time.\" \n\"Momentum matters a great deal,\" said Schmidt. \"You have to win in the early states to win in the larger mega-state primaries that folds out over the balance of March and April.\" Contact: leonardo.blair@christianpost.com ; follow me on Twitter @leoblair", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:11:24.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
