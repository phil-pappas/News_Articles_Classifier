At one point, David launched into an extended rant that included a riff on Sanders' personal possessions.\n\"I don't have a super PAC. I don't even have a backpack,\" said David as Sanders. \"I own one pair of underwear. That's it. Some of these billionaires, they got three, four pairs. And I don't have a dryer. I have to put my clothes on the radiator. So who do you want as president? One of these Washington insiders? Or a guy who has one pair of clean underwear that he dries on a radiator?\"\n\nCBS News digital journalist Kylie Atwood asked Sanders about his supply of undergarments during a campaign stop in Iowa Sunday.\n\"Last week I bought my second pair of underwear,\" Sanders said with a straight face. \"That is a joke. Don't write it down, that was a joke. I have an ample supply of underwear.\"\nHis suits, however, were once in short supply.\n\"When I was mayor of the city of Burlington, I think I did have one suit but I have now, being a United States senator, increased my number of suits,\" he added.\nSanders joked that his team was going to put David on stage at his next rally.\n\"He does it better than I do,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:28:32.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
