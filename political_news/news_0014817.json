Related \nPint-sized Americans and presidential candidates go together like politicians and politics, but rarely does it reach the level of viral cuteness as supporters dress their kids up as the Vermont senator turned Democratic presidential candidate with amazing accuracy. \n“I think it's all in good humor,” said Christina Munson, a mom in Williston. \n“I just think it's fun to see Bernie doing so well in his popularity, so I think it's just fun to support him that way,” said Katie Coe. \nIt was one small-scale Sanders who quickly became a hit, inspiring the \"Babies for Bernie\" merchandise sold online. \nThe “about us” section of the website reads: \"All parents want a better future for their children. Bernie Sanders is going to get us there!\" \nIt's a message sanders backed during Tuesday’s CNN debate. \n“We are going to have medical and family paid leave like every other country on earth,” said Sanders during the debate. \nIt's not just #BabiesForBernie that's burning up the Internet. \nSanders was also the most talked about candidate on Facebook and Twitter after the debate, helping his campaign rake in $1.3 million in donations in just the four hours following. \nThis time of year, politicians are also raking in the dough for costume shops. \nAccording to the National Retail Federation, political characters are the 10th most popular adult Halloween costume. \nThe Party City in South Burlington said their Donald Trump masks are flying off the shelves. \n“It's just a lot of fun to kind of show your support that way,” said Coe. \nNot to be outdone, supporters for Trump, the Republican front-funner recently started making a dent with #ToddlersForTrump. \nThey may be way too young to vote but not too young to show support (or for their parents to do so through them).
