John Kasich told a New Hampshire crowd Wednesday that while he didn't watch Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, he heard Hillary Clinton identify Republicans as her enemy loud and clear.\n\"She bragged that she made enemies out of Republicans? Is that where this country is going?\" Kasich asked incredulously. \"That is a disgrace. D-I-S-G-R-A-C-E.\"\nKasich also didn't shy away from taking subtle shots at GOP front-runner Donald Trump.\nRelated Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ \"Be careful,\" Kasich said, \"we're not picking American Idol, we're picking someone to run America.\" Kasich paused before repeating the line again.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Your Voice, Your Choice: Ask Bobby Jindal a question Gov. Bobby Jindal, R-La., will be fielding questions on Monday Oct. 26, at 7 p.m. ET.\nBy Washington Examiner Staff • 10/14/15 2:38 PM \"Boy was that a great quote. You want me to repeat that again?\" Kasich asked. \"We're not picking American Idol, we're picking someone to run America. Clap again.\"\nKasich, who ranks seventh in the Washington Examiner 's most recent power rankings , continued to explain that he did not have \"a lot of name ID\" with voters because he was preoccupied with fixing Ohio. But he later appeared to tout some attributes that he shares with the businessman leading the GOP pack, and said, \"I consider myself to be a CEO more than I think of myself as governor.\"\nThe Ohio governor also praised the importance of the Granite State to the presidential nominating process, and said he thought New Hampshire should be renamed \"Cape Canaveral because when someone does well here they get launched into the public consciousness.\"\nBut Kasich's standing in New Hampshire has plummeted since earlier this year. He polled in the double-digits this summer and remained in third place in surveys conducted as recently as September. Now he finishes sixth in RealClearPolitics' average of New Hampshire surveys.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner White House: Clinton's strong debate won't effect Biden decision Biden's decision is \"rooted in a decision about his own presidential campaign, not anybody else's.\"\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/14/15 3:19 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:31:49.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
