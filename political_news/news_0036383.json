He’s being challenged in the playground so he is threatening to bring round lots of his mates to duff us up,” he said. \n“He would be creating a constitutional crisis. But that will be a crisis of his creation, not of ours.” \nThe Lib Dem peer added that his party had decided to go for the 'nuclear option' of a fatal motion because to do otherwise would allow ministers to get off the hook. \n“We would have a vote, [say] this is the terrible and the Government would say 'thanks very much, we don’t care',\" he said. \nBut Lord Butler said it would be \"quite wrong\" for peers to block the plans, pointing out they were a 'central plank' of an elected government's manifesto to cut the cost of welfare. \n“The House of Lords is already too big, and the fact is that this was established 100 years ago that the House of Lords doesn’t oppose the House of Commons on tax and financial matters,” he said. \n“And the Government would have a quite legitimate grievance if it did. So, that would be really an example of the House of Lords getting too big for its non-elected boots.” \nIn a fresh development, crossbencher Baroness Meacher has now wrapped her own motion into one from Labour's Baroness Hollis, in a move the Opposition believes is a 'poison pill' rather than a 'fatal' motion. \nLabour's Lords Twitter feed revealed the switch this morning.
