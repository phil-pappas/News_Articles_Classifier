Marco Rubio has jumped 6 percentage points in a new survey of Republican voters, positioning him that much closer to GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\nA Public Policy Polling report released Tuesday showed Rubio in third place behind Trump and Ben Carson with 13 percent support among registered Republicans. Trump's 2-point drop since last month's survey puts him at 27 percent support while Carson jumped to 17 percent.\nAccording to the same survey, Rubio and Carson are also the two most popular candidates in the wide-ranging GOP field. The Florida senator, who is fourth in the Washington Examiner 's presidential power rankings , has a net-positive favorability rating of 57-24 percent and is led only by Carson who is viewed favorably by 71 percent of Republican voters. Meanwhile, just 50 percent of respondents indicated they have a positive view of Trump — down 14 points since PPP's survey last month.\n\"It seems like most polls these days you can either pick out data to say they're good for Donald Trump or pick out data to say they're bad for Donald Trump,\" Dean Debnam, president of PPP, said in a press release.\n  Conservatives: No one has the votes for House speaker... yet \"I wouldn't predict there is one at this point if there was a vote right now this night,\" said Rep.
