The production, from playwrights Arden Kass and Seth Bauer and commissioned by Public Citizens for Children and Youth (PCCY), uses the real voices of more than 100 Pennsylvanians to dramatize funding inequities among school districts across the state.\n\"School Play belongs to everyone. You do not need sets, costumes or lighting to tell the critical story of the state of our schools and a child's desire to have basic resources to help them succeed,\" said Donna Cooper , executive director of PCCY. \"We want people in communities across the state to pick up a script and hold their own School Plays so that more Pennsylvanians are aware of how funding cuts hurt our children.\"\nSchool Play received overwhelmingly positive reviews at sold-out performances last April at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia .\nTickets are free and will be available at the door for each performance.\nA complete list of showings is below. Materials, including a full script of the production, are available on PCCY's website: www.pccy.org/initiatives/school-play/ .\nSchool Play Tour Dates\nMontgomery County\nFriday, Oct. 2 , 8 p.m. , The White Pines Place, 7908 High School Road, Elkins Park Saturday, Oct. 3 , 7 p.m. , The Black Box Theatre at Montgomery County , 340 Dekalb Pike, Blue Bell Berks County : Monday, Oct. 5 ., 7 p.m. , Reading High School, 801 N. 13th St.\nDauphin County : Tuesday, Oct. 6 , 5:30 p.m. , Majority Caucus Room, Main Capitol Building, Harrisburg\nLancaster County : Wednesday, Oct. 7, 7 p.m. , McCaskey East High School, 1051 Lehigh Ave., Lancaster\nCentre County : Thursday, Oct. 8 ., 7 p.m. , State College Area High School, 653 Westerly Parkway\nCambria County : Saturday, Oct. 10 ., 7 p.m. , Greater Johnstown High School, Cochran Auditorium, 222 Central Ave.\nDelaware County : Sunday, Oct. 11 , 7 p.m. , Wolf Performing Arts Center, 1240 Montrose Ave., Bryn Mawr\nLehigh County : Monday, Oct. 12 , 7 p.m. , Civic Theatre 514, 527 N. 19th St., Allentown\nElk County : Tuesday, Oct. 13 , 7 p.m. , St. Marys Area High School, 977 South St. Marys Road\nSchuylkill County : Thursday, Oct. 15 , 7 p.m. , Schuylkill Haven High School\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/school-play-production-about-education-funding-going-on-tour-300152728.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/school-play-production-about-education-funding-going-on-tour-300152728.html", "http://www.pccy.org/initiatives/school-play/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH17562&Transmission_Id=201510011217PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH17562&DateId=20151001"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:46:25.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
