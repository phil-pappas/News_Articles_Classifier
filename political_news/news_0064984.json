These products currently contain either strontium citrate, strontium gluconate or strontium lactate.\nThe new directions limit these products to users who have no history of, or risk factors for, heart disease, circulatory problems or blood clots. As well, consumers are advised to consult a healthcare practitioner for use longer than 6 months.\nThe measure follows a Health Canada safety review, a summary of which is available online. The review was undertaken in light of findings in Europe that led to restrictions for use of oral prescription drugs containing strontium at 680 mg/day (as strontium ranelate), due to the increased risk of cardiovascular events seen in patients who have risk factors for heart or circulatory-related side effects.\nThe Health Canada review found that there is no information available on the cardiovascular risk with strontium ranelate at levels lower than 680 mg/day, or with non-ranelate forms of strontium at any dose. No Canadian or international reports of cardiovascular side effects involving non-ranelate strontium products were identified at the time of the review. The review also found there is not enough information to compare how strontium ranelate is absorbed in the body relative to other, non-ranelate forms of strontium.\nWhile uncertainties remain, Health Canada is using a precautionary approach and considers that strontium, regardless of the form it comes in or dose taken, may have a potential risk of cardiovascular side effects in people who are already at risk.\nHealth Canada continues to consider whether additional risk minimization measures may be needed to further restrict the use of strontium-containing products, particularly those products with higher daily doses. Measures under consideration include further changes to the directions for use or changing how certain strontium-containing products (e.g. with higher doses) are regulated so that they are available by prescription only, under the supervision of a healthcare professional. Health Canada will keep Canadians informed of new actions regarding these products.\nWhat you should do:\nDo not use a strontium-containing product if you have, or are at high risk for heart disease, circulatory problems, or blood clots. Risk factors include: a history of heart disease, heart attack, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, high blood pressure, high blood fat levels, diabetes, taking prescription hormone drugs, or if you are temporarily or permanently immobilized. If you have any cardiovascular risk factors, read the label of products you are taking to know if they contain strontium. Consult a healthcare practitioner for use beyond six months. Talk to a healthcare practitioner if you have questions or if you are unsure whether these products are appropriate for you.
