Participants will share information and technology to identify and prosecute illegal fishing groups. \nNOAA will expand development of an application that detects lights and targets illegal fishing activities. The detection system will be implemented in Indonesia, the Philippines, and three other countries next year. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
