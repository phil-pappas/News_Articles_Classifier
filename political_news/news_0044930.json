John Kasich’s office.\nThe new study comes on the heels of Tuesday’s refusal by the Ohio Board of Education to hand over documents to state Auditor Dave Yost relating to scrubbed charter school evaluations and a falsified federal grant application while David Hansen – husband of Kasich’s presidential campaign manager, Beth – supposedly overseeing the charter schools.\n“With its lax charter school oversight laws and its large number of unaccountable authorizers, Ohio has been an embarrassment to charter school proponents,” the center’s study said.\nOhio has been awarded more than $195 million between 2004 and 2015 in Charter Schools Program State Educational Agencies grants, the center said, including $71 million awarded over five years based on a state application last summer that contained false information.\nThe center noted the application had been prepared with the help of Hansen’s former employer, the National Association of Charter School Authorizers (NACSA). The association provided Ohio with fill-in-the-blank language to submit to the federal education agency:\n“(NAME OF SEA) believes that high quality authorizing is a critical step in ensuring the expansion of successful charter schools in (STATE). To that end, (…SEA) intends to partner with NACSA to develop a series of tools and trainings to be made available for authorizers across the state with the goal of improving the quality of authorizer practices statewide.” SEA is short for State Educational Agency.\nOhio’s application quoted the second sentence almost verbatim:\n“The Department will partner with NACSA to develop a series of tools and trainings to be made available for authorizers across the state with the goal of improving authorizer practices statewide at a cost of $40,000 per year.”\nThe investigation also found fault with the federal agency, which refused to release the applications of Ohio or other states until the grants were awarded – too late for public input.\n“Federal charter school bureaucrats accepted the word of state charter proponents that their charter programs had adequate controls for performance and against fraud and waste,” the study said.\nThe reviewers contracted by the U.S. Department of Education to evaluate Ohio’s grant request offered glowing remarks. One gave Ohio a perfect score on its standards, saying “Ohio has established high and exacting accountability expectations of authorizers (including evaluation against standards) and, inferentially, schools,” the center found.\nAnother reviewer also awarded Ohio a perfect score, commending the state for including “strong and clear language for the expectations and evaluation of charters AND authorizers” on its website, the center said.\nSince the questionable material in Ohio’s application came to light, the federal agency put several conditions on Ohio's grant, such as regular reporting requirements and a ban on giving money to “ineffective” charter schools.\ndrowland@dispatch.com \n@darreldrowland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:24:44.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
