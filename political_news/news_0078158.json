Read More Trump also brushed off the idea that the Republican mainstream could find a way to take him out of contention late in the game if his poll numbers don't start to ebb on their own. \"I just think it's very hard, and maybe I'm na√Øve to say this, but if I go around and win Iowa and win New Hampshire and win South Carolina and just keep winning, I don't see how they could do much,\" Trump said. \"There'd be a revolution in the Republican Party if that (winning streak) happened.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:42:04.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
