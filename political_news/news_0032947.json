Bernie Sanders opened up on Jimmy Kimmel Live Wednesday night , sharing his personal views on religion and his willingness to consider marijuana legalization. \nSanders, whose views on pot went over well with the audience, had indicated in the first Democratic debate that he favored legalization of recreational use of the drug. \n“We have large numbers of lives that have been destroyed because of this war on drugs and because people were caught smoking marijuana and so forth,” Sanders told host Jimmy Kimmel. \n“I think we have got to end the war on drugs,” he said. “I am not unfavorably disposed to moving toward the legalization of marijuana.” Sanders said. \nThis position is only likely to bolster his already strong support among young voters, and perhaps give added meaning to his slogan “Feel the Bern.” \n“You have excited a lot of young people,” Kimmel said with a smirk. “Have you ever exited young people before?” \n“Not too often, no,” Sanders replied. \nA large part of that support comes from Sanders endorsement of free college education. \n“In a very competitive global economy what we have to say, if we want to compete, we’re going to have to have colleges and universities tuition free in the United States of America,” Sanders said. \nThings got deeper when Kimmel asked the self-described socialist about his religion — or lack thereof. \n“I am who I am,” Sanders said. “And what I believe in, and what my spirituality is about, is that we’re all in this together. But I think that it is not a good thing to believe that as human beings we can turn our backs on the suffering of other people. \n“We do best as human beings, we fulfill our lives when we work together rather than say, ‘Hey I want it all and I don’t care about the hungry kid down the street.’ I don’t think that’s what America should be about.” \nKimmel also asked Sanders about his perceived problem of electibility. \n“They say you’re too old,” Kimmel said. “They say you’re too far left. They say you don’t bother to brush your hair. How do you respond to something like that?” \nSanders answered by citing polls that showed him faring better against Donald Trump in the general election than Hillary Clinton. But, he felt his greatest strength was to bring disillusioned voters back into politics. Since increased turnout usually favors Democrats this would allow him to not only win the White House, but pave the way for the Democrats to retake the Senate, Sanders said. \n“Our job is not just to defeat Republicans,” he said. “Our job is to revitalize American democracy, bring people who have given up on the political system back into the system and create a government which represents them, rather than large campaign donors.” \nThings ended on a lighter note, as Kimmel asked Sanders what he thought of Larry David’s impersonation of him on Saturday Night Live . \n“Well I thought it was pretty, pretty, pretty good!” Sanders said, mimicking David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm catch phrase. \nIt’s worth nothing that the presidential candidate didn’t make the cut for the show’s first interview slot. That honor went to Michael J. Fox. But hey, it was Back to the Future Day, and at least he didn’t have to talk about his underwear .
