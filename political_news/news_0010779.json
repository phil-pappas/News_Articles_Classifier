The senator who is running for President has a 40 percent approval rating in his home state. That's down from 45.5 percent in March. \nThe poll didn't survey residents on all current presidential candidates, but it did ask what they think about current leaders. \nPresident Obama has a 41 percent approval rating. \nGovernor Nikki Haley is higher at 55 percent. \nThe poll also looked at controversial issues. \nWhen it comes to same-sex marriage, half of poll respondents said the union should be recognized by law as valid. When asked if county clerks of probate judges in the state should be allowed to deny a marriage license to same-sex couples, only 34 percent said yes. \nThe Confederate battle flag was a hot issue over the summer. Two-thirds of South Carolina residents surveyed said the S.C. Legislature made the right decision in removing the flag from the State House grounds.
