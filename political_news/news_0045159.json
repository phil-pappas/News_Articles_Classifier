Alia is crazy, simple and sweet. She lives in her own imaginary world.\nThere are no similarities.\n\"I don't think anyone can try and play her. She is an iconic character, at least for me. And there are no similarities between 'Jab We Met' and 'Shaandaar' except Shahid,\" Alia said while promoting \"the movie here.\nThe actor, however, thinks otherwise.\n\"But if anybody could play Geet in future or a character like her than it is you Alia because you are like her. Your energy matches to Geet.\"\nThe 22-year-old actress said, \"Thank you, that's a huge compliment for me.\"\nThis is not the first time Alia's on screen character has been compared to Kareena's. Her debut role of a young style queen of her school had striking similarities to Kareena's 'Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham' character Pooja.\nWhen asked if Alia prepared differently for her role in 'Shaandaar' considering she plays an insomniac, the actress said, \"I had to stay awake all night but at the same time look good and be focused and present there... My sister is an insomniac so I know how that person functions.\n\"But without taking away the difficulty from this, I will say Vikas treated it in a happy way. That's how he works. The nights for Shahid and my character became our days. I am shown reading, eating at night and he drives away so that was nice.\"\n'Shaandaar' hits theatre on October 22.\n entertainment Bollywood alia bhatt Shahid Kapoor Kareena Kapoor Also Read Baby AbRam dresses up as Santa Claus Miranda Kerr strips for new ad Shahid Kapoor was the first choice for 'Bang Bang'?
