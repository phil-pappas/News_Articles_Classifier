Apparently, it was Salman Khan who recommended the film to Kangana, adding that it was a tailormade role for her. The actress had earlier rejected the film when director Nikhil Advani had approached her with the script. But since Salman was working with Nikhil (on Hero), he recommended the role and the film strongly to Kangana.\nThat’s how the Queen actress came into the picture. With Katti Batti proving to be a disaster at the box office, the blame game seems to have started. Apparently, Kangana’s team believes Salman put her into the situation. But Salman was quick to clarify that he had recommended that she listen to the script, and that the decision to do the film ultimately was entirely hers.\nSays a close friend of the superstar, “Salman never asked her to do the film. He just suggested that she give Nikhil time to narrate the script to her. The decision to do Katti Batti was Kangana’s. And if she is blaming Salman for its disaster, then who does she blame for Rajjo and Revolver Rani for?” Needless to say that for Salman, the entire episode has left a bitter taste in the mouth.\n entertainment Bollywood Kanganan Ranaut Katti Batti Also Read Salman Khan helps four runaway kids reunite with their parents Sonakshi Sinha gets her long locks back for 'Akira' Gauhar Khan to star in Meet Brothers next video Ranbir, Katrina, Rani, Aditya Chopra and other Bollywood stars pay respect to Ravi Chopra", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/13KR2_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/entertainment-bollywood/article/kangana-blames-salman-katti-batti’s-flop", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/13KR2_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:16:24.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
