China says the small outposts, designed to expand its claims to the strategic waters, are part of its sovereign territory. But that has been refuted by international legal scholars who insist the 12-mile territorial sea enshrined in international law does not apply to man-made structures.\nNevertheless, the U.S. Navy has refrained from sailing too close to the artificial islands — a stance that critics have charged tacitly accepts China’s destabilizing moves, which are seen by U.S. allies in the region such as Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam as highly threatening.\nThe decision to give the U.S. Navy a green light to disregard China's claims comes after months of internal debate about the issue, pitting some U.S. military leaders against the White House and State Department. And the decision to disregard the Chinese claims is bound to spark a negative response in Beijing.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/26/us-southchinasea-usa-idUSKCN0SK2AC20151026"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:38:26.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
