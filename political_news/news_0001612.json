Students will also be able to share stories about their goals, their progress and what's inspiring them to go to college. \nThe first lady was announcing the new phase of her Reach Higher initiative at a White House event on Monday. \nShe follows up on Wednesday by heading to Ohio for a rally at the University of Akron with LeBron James of the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers. \nMore than 20 media, business and nonprofit groups are assisting the public awareness campaign, the White House said. Among them are such recognizable names as Vine, Mashable, American Eagle Outfitters, Funny Or Die and the CW television network, along with AwesomenessTV and CollegeHumor. \nMrs. Obama launched Reach Higher nearly two years ago to help meet President Barack Obama 's goal of returning the U.S. to first in the world in the number of college graduates by 2020. \n___ \nFollow Darlene Superville on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/dsupervilleap Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:07:49.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
