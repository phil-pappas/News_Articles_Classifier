We lost the World Trade Center on September 11th.\"\nTrump drew fire late last week and throughout the weekend for remarking in a Bloomberg interview that the 9/11 attacks that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 more than 14 years ago happened \"during the reign\" of George W. Bush, the older brother of fellow contender Jeb Bush.\nHe also faulted intelligence gaps between the CIA, FBI and the NSA, which \"came out as a major problem\" and would not have happened in a Trump administration.\nPressed by co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck on whether Bush kept the country safe after the attacks, Trump agreed that he had, but again slammed Bush for his decision to invade Iraq less than two years later.\n\"Well we haven't had a major problem at home. I agree with that. I've never disagreed with that,\" he said. \"But we attacked a country, we spent $2 trillion attacking a country, and you know what we have for it right now? Zero.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:01:45.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
