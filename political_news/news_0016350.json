Those events — the fifth and sixth on the party’s schedule — were left unscheduled when the committee unveiled its plan in August. PBS will host the event in Wisconsin, and Univision and the Washington Post will co-host the Miami confab.\nWhile the Democratic debates have not gotten as much attention as the Republican ones, the political world’s eyes have been increasingly drawn to them in recent weeks. The first debate — billed by CNN as a showdown between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders — will be in Las Vegas next Tuesday.\nThe party will also hold three more debates before the Iowa caucuses, a number considered too low by some members of the party establishment and presidential candidate Martin O’Malley.\nThe other events will be on Nov. 14 in Des Moines, Iowa; Dec. 19 in Manchester, New Hampshire; and Jan. 17 in Charleston, South Carolina.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:12:30.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
