Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announces his plan to end the Affordable Care Act,on Tuesday, in Manchester, N.H.\nBy Kimberly Leonard Oct. 13, 2015 | 12:23 p.m. EDT + More Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has released a plan to reform the nation's health care system that builds somewhat on changes created under President Barack Obama but would shift more authority to states to determine how to cover their citizens.\nThe plan , released Monday, does not focus on the legislative mechanisms for repealing Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act, but outlines strategies for innovation and reducing costs. It would allow people to use tax credits to buy their own health insurance and would increase contribution limits for health savings accounts that can be used for out-of-pocket expenses.\nRELATED\nPeople with Obamacare Plans Report It's Expensive But Bush made his intention to repeal the law clear during a speech Tuesday at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics & Political Library at Saint Anselm College in Manchester.\n\"You can't fix something that was a failure from the start,\" he said.\nBush's proposal gives states authority to oversee a transition plan for the more than 17 million people who have gained health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act, whether through tax-subsidized private plans or through Medicaid , the joint state-federal program for low-income Americans. The current model standardizes plans' requirements across the country, requiring insurance companies to pay for a specific set of services, such as coverage for maternity and for dental care. Bush's plan would allow states to tailor their own insurance markets.\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton also recently released a plan that seeks to improve on the Affordable Care Act and includes controls on the prices of prescription drugs . Bush's plan instead focuses on eliminating barriers to bringing drugs to the market, including by reducing government regulations and increasing funding for the National Institutes of Health, the government agency that conducts and funds scientific research for treatments and cures.\n\"We need to get Washington out of the way and stop its micromanagement,\" Bush said Tuesday.\nAmong other GOP presidential contenders, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida have proposed anti-Obamacare health care plans, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas introduced his Obamacare alternative in the Senate earlier this year. The two Republican front-runners – billionaire Donald Trump and neurosurgeon Ben Carson – haven't released plans but have publicly expressed their disapproval of Obamacare.\nBush also elaborated on portions of Obamacare he objects to, and provided examples of what he said were evidence of the law not working, including that premiums have risen under the law and that millions of people are still uninsured. He also said the law's protections for those with conscience-based objections to some of its coverage requirements are not adequate.\nThe Affordable Care Act has been unpopular among Republicans since it was passed without their support in 2010. They have voted more than 50 times to repeal at least parts of the law, and various elements of it have been challenged before the Supreme Court. Obama has said he will veto any bill that aims to dismantle the law, so having a Republican in the White House would be the only way the party could repeal the law and put forth its own proposal.\nRELATED\nJeb Bush Relies on His Family to Raise Money Americans' views on Obamacare are mixed, with about half viewing it unfavorably, according to Gallup polling numbers . Still, there are provisions of the law that many Americans support, such as its allowing children to stay on their parents' insurance coverage until they turn 26 and its barring health insurance companies from turning away patients with pre-existing conditions.\nCoverage for people with pre-existing conditions is included under Bush's plan.\nIn presenting his plan, Bush referred to his experience with Medicaid as governor of Florida. He started a pilot Medicaid reform project that allowed poor or disabled citizens to choose their own health insurance through vouchers and was successful at reining in costs . Democrats have criticized the plan, saying it limited choices for Floridians, but the Florida legislature voted to put it fully into effect for all counties in the state beginning in 2014.\nBush does not support Medicaid expansion, a component of the Affordable Care Act, as a way to decrease the number of uninsured.\n\"Spending more through a broken insurance system isn't the solution to this,\" he said Tuesday.\nTAGS: 2016 presidential election Bush, Jeb public health Affordable Care Act health care reform", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5jpe%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5jpe%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Jeb%20Bush%20Presents%20Obamacare%20Alternative", "https://jeb2016.com/health-care-plan/?lang=en", "http://www.gallup.com/poll/182318/americans-slightly-positive-toward-affordable-care-act.aspx", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5jpe%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5jpe%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Jeb%20Bush%20Presents%20Obamacare%20Alternative&summary=The%20presidential%20candidate%20is%20stressing%20the%20importance%20of%20innovation%20in%20delivering%20better%20health%20care.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://news.ufl.edu/archive/2014/01/floridas-medicaid-reform-pilot-is-saving-money-uf-study-finds-1.html", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5jpe%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Jeb%20Bush%20Presents%20Obamacare%20Alternative", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe5jpe%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:01:20.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
