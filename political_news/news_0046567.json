Herceptin, a drug used to treat cancer, can cause heart failure.\nBy Steve Sternberg Oct. 20, 2015 | 12:01 a.m. EDT + More Nanci Young stepped into “ the wonderful world of Herceptin ” soon after the drug was introduced in 2002. After years of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, she says, Herceptin was a miracle drug , a designer antibody with few side effects that tamed a monster disease.\nBut the drug’s most significant side effect—heart failure—was almost as terrifying as cancer. It only strikes a small percentage of women, so Young’s doctors advised her to take the risk . “We want to do this indefinitely, conceivably for the rest of your life,” they told her. “I said, ‘Let’s go for it.’”\nYoung was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1991. She has been battling the disease for nearly 25 years. For eight years, Herceptin changed her life. Young flourished. Then, in 2010, her heart began to fail. “You need a heart,” her doctors told her, and took her off the drug. Within three years, the cancer roared back with a vengeance, in her spine, lymph node and chest. After caring for her successfully for more than two decades, her local doctors conceded defeat. But they didn’t quit. They referred her to Dr. Sandra Swain and Dr. Ana Barac and the SAFEHeart trial in Washington, D.C.\nSwain, a cancer specialist, and Barac, a cardiologist, practice at Georgetown University Hospital and MedStar Washington Hospital Center , launched SAFEHeart to see whether women with mild heart failure can continue to take Herceptin and Perjeta, another designer antibody that works in a similar way. “These are women who normally would not be able to get these drugs, because their heart function has decreased,” Swain says.\nUnlike other forms of chemotherapy, which aim to eradicate the cancer, Herceptin and Perjeta, whose generic name is pertuzumab, interferes with the cancer’s growth and spread. While they may cure cancer caught early, metastatic cancer is a chronic disease requiring lifelong treatment.\nNancy Young, started to experience heart failure after using Herceptin, but is now using the drug, again. Herceptin has a big advantage over the chemotherapy agents called anthracyclines, because Herceptin’s heart damage may not be permanent. Swain believes that, for women whose tumors respond to Herceptin, it’s a better choice than anthracyclines. “I believe we should be using [anthracyclines] less,” she says.\nBut that means using Herceptin more, sometimes in women whose hearts have already taken a hit from chemotherapy. The SAFEHeart trial is still open for women who qualify. Sixteen women have signed up; there are 30 openings.\nSo far, Nanci Young’s heart is holding up nicely, says Dr. Maria Raquel Nunes, also of Georgetown University and MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where Young, 61, receives treatment. If there’s no change, she can continue taking Herceptin even after the trial is over.\nEvery three weeks, Young travels to the oncology clinic where she is given infusions of Herceptin and Perjeta, with a half an hour in between. Each session lasts three and a half hours. The worst side effect, she says, is a temporary rash with a burning sensation so overpowering that she has tried everything to stop it. Only ice seems to help.\nA rash, Young says, is a small price to pay for survival.\n“Think about this folks; it’s life and death here,” she says, adding: “Every third Friday there’s no place on earth I’d rather be.”\nTAGS: heart failure heart health breast cancer chemotherapy drugs", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8kkl%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8kkl%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Herceptin%3A%20A%20Wonder%20Drug%20With%20a%20Frightening%20Side%20Effect&summary=One%20woman%20thrived%20on%20Herceptin%20for%20years%20%E2%80%93%20and%20then%20her%20heart%20began%20to%20fail.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8kkl%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8kkl%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Herceptin%3A%20A%20Wonder%20Drug%20With%20a%20Frightening%20Side%20Effect", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8kkl%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Herceptin%3A%20A%20Wonder%20Drug%20With%20a%20Frightening%20Side%20Effect", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8kkl%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:41:31.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
