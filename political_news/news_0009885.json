(Maharashtra chief minister Devendra) Fadnavisji has publicly said that Khurshid won't be allowed to have any anti-India view in his programme and if he does, the organiser will be responsible for it. We welcome the CM's stand.\"\n\"Blackening of Kulkarni’s face was a mild protest. Wait to see what happens in the evening if the programme continues,\" Raut said. The book launch programme involving Kasuri is scheduled later in the evening.\nRaut said his party has written a letter to Fadnavis giving all proof that \"exposes\" Kasuri's \"anti-India\" stand.\nClaiming that Sena has no \"political agenda\" behind opposing the book launch event, Raut claimed while Khurshid was Foreign Minister of Pakistan, he was responsible for bringing all extremist anti-India organisations together to \"suit their Kashmir agenda.\"\n\"When he was Foreign Minister, he did all sorts of things that were anti-India. We have submitted all of that to the CM and we now expect him to keep his word of not allowing any anti-India stand and intervene and stop the programme,\" he said.\nRead:\nKulkarni ink attack: Congress lashes out at Shiv Sena, says it's 'Taliban hooliganism'\nKulkarni ink attack: It's not ink, but blood of our martyrs, says Shiv Sena\nPak former minister flays attack on Kulkarni, says there is need for positive mindset\nEx-Pak minister book launch: Sena activists allegedly throw ink on event organiser Shiv Sena demands cancellation of ex-Pak Minister Khurshid Kasuri's Mumbai book launch\nSmearing Sudheendra Kulkarni with paint is not right: Kiren Rijiju\nDemocracy must ensure tolerance for different viewpoint, says Advani on attack on Kulkarni\nInk attack on Sudheendra Kulkarni: Reactions pour in ahead of Kasuri book launch\nOrganiser Sudheendra Kulkarni goes ahead with launch, Pak minister Kasuri says this was no way to protest\nInk attack: Police registers FIR against unidentified men\nRaut further claimed that Khurshid’s stand on India during his current trip is \"completely different\" when he is in Pakistan.\n\"He (Khurshid) was responsible for bringing extremist organisations like the Hurriyat together.
