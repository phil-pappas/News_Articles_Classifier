Eligible schools are invited to showcase their school breakfast programs through a creative video that could win their school a grand prize of $5,000 to put toward school breakfast and health and wellness programming. Entries will be accepted between October 8, 2015 and January 8, 2016 at www.ActionforHealthyKids.org/Contest .\nIn 2014, only 44 percent of students participating in the National School Lunch Program also participated in school breakfast programming (30.3 million lunch participants vs. 13.5 million breakfast participants, according to the USDA), which means that millions of low-income children are not receiving a nutritious breakfast available to them at school. Alternative school breakfast programs incorporate this important meal into the school morning through a variety of models that reach students where they are located, including breakfast in the classroom, after the bell, in the hallway, or near the cafeteria and school entrance where grab-and-go breakfast works best. By increasing access to school breakfast and removing obstacles that prevent students from taking advantage of the program, schools are able to increase breakfast participation and feed more kids who would otherwise go without.\n\"Routinely we see that kids who need school breakfast the most don't or can't easily participate until programs like alternative school breakfast are implemented,\" said Rob Bisceglie , CEO Action for Healthy Kids. \"We know the benefits of eating school breakfast – from increased attendance and better behavior to improved cognition and academic performance – and want to showcase all the ways schools have made great strides through alternative breakfast programs.\"\nEligible schools must 1) be state accredited schools (K - 12) located in the 50 United States and Washington, D.C. that offer an alternative breakfast program as part of their National School Breakfast Program (e.g. breakfast in the classroom, grab-and-go breakfast, second chance breakfast) and 2) have 40% or more of the student population eligible for free/reduced-price meals. To enter, schools are invited to submit a 1-minute video that creatively demonstrates their alternative school breakfast model. A panel of judges, including a representative from the School Nutrition Association, will judge the video submissions based on creativity, overall quality of submission, the best demonstration of alternative breakfast, and connection to the School Nutrition Association's 2016 National School Breakfast Week theme of \"Wake Up to School Breakfast.\" Prizes include one $5,000 grand prize, two $1,000 runners-up prizes, and seven prizes of $200 each awarded to third-place winners.\nOfficial rules and entry form for the video contest can be found at www.ActionforHealthyKids.org/Contest . This contest is made possible with support from the Kellogg Company Fund.\nSince 2009, Action for Healthy Kids and Kellogg Company Fund have helped schools launch or expand alternative school breakfast programs that have helped schools increase student participation in the National School Breakfast program, on average, by 47 percent.
