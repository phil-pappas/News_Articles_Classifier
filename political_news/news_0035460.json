Mr Ng is the founder of the Animal Concerns Research and Education Society, which has been active in lobbying on animal welfare matters.\n\"We go quite a long way back and we both come from activism circles, so I thought I'd share his post because there are quite a lot of activist people on my Facebook page as well,\" said Mr Ng.\n\"Putting aside which political parties we are from, ultimately, we want to help each other.\"\nThrough a grassroots leader, Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam also approached Mr Philemon to let him know that he would keep a lookout for any job openings. Both men later chatted over e-mail.\nSeparately, Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan also sent words of encouragement. \"He encouraged me to continue finding ways to contribute to our political discourse,\" said Mr Philemon.\nSingapore Management University law professor Eugene Tan said such gestures showed \"exemplary leadership\". \"Looking out for a fellow Singaporean, even an opposition politician, is the right thing to do,\" he said. \"We should see more of this from our politicians.\"\nWhile he is still looking for a job, Mr Philemon said he is in discussions with two companies: a local NGO that works with young adults and a media firm.\nAlso on the job hunt is former Workers' Party (WP) candidate for East Coast GRC Mohamed Fairoz Shariff, who left his job as a librarian with the National Library Board to stand in the general election. A WP member since 2004, the father of three had twice said \"no\" to standing for election before he took the plunge this year.\nWhile he could not be reached for comment, fellow WP candidate Leon Perera wrote on Facebook that Mr Fairoz had made a big sacrifice when he left his civil service job to stand for election.\n\"He is currently unemployed. I hope it will not be long before he finds a position that befits his tremendous talent, energy and leadership ability,\" said Mr Perera.\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Sunday Times on October 11, 2015, with the headline 'Opposition candidate gets helping hand from election rivals'.
