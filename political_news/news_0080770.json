She instantly recognized me.” \nBratton said he “politely” took the joint out of the woman’s possession, throwing it into the sewer and letting her go on her way. \nUnder new rules pushed forth by Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio, possessing less than 25 grams of marijuana is not a crime in New York, but is considered a violation punishable by a fine. Smoking cannabis is public, however, is technically a misdemeanor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:06:26.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
