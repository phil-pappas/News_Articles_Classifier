Peter Welch, D-Vt., who said it was \"off the rails\" for McConnell to make that comment. He said competition between the parties is fine during the election, but said once the elections end, the parties need to work together.\nThe No Labels meeting was attended by Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., New Jersey Gov.
