The contest encourages people of all ages to recognize and reward family caregivers in their lives in small but meaningful ways, especially during National Family Caregivers Month in November.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7607231-aarp-caregivers/\nMany family caregivers spend 18 hours per week or more providing care like bathing, dressing, preparing meals, administering medications, driving to doctor visits, or paying bills. Sixty percent of caregivers are helping care for a loved one while holding down a job at the same time. 'Random Acts of Kindness for Caregivers' might be something as simple as doing a caregiver's grocery shopping, taking their dog for a walk, or even cutting the lawn.\n\"I've been a family caregiver my entire adult life and I know that unexpected kindness can go a long way for a caregiver,\" says AARP Family and Caregiving Expert Amy Goyer, author of the new book Juggling Life, Work, and Caregiving . \"If you are not one of the 40 million caregivers in the U.S. now, you either have been a caregiver or will be one in the future.\"\nOne in every six adults is a family caregiver and surprisingly, 1 in 4 family caregivers is a Millennial (between the ages of 18 and 34). Their family caregiving stories are often filled with love and sacrifice, but may also include financial and emotional stress. Through 'Random Acts of Kindness for Caregivers,' AARP is hoping to give family caregivers a little extra support, joy and relief.\n#BeKindToCaregivers Ideas\n'Random Acts of Kindness' can encourage overwhelmed caregivers, free them up to have more time with other loved ones they care for, or even give them personal time to relax and rejuvenate. Here are a few ideas:\nwash a car pick up the dry cleaning water the flowers send an encouraging card in the mail do an item on a to-do list take them dinner take their kids to soccer practice bring over a movie just say thank you! Those sharing acts of kindness are encouraged to submit stories and a photo of their random acts to the contest website found at www.aarp.org/caregiverkindness . In March 2016 , AARP will select 12 winners who have made a meaningful difference in the lives of family caregivers. The winners will share a $10,000 prize.\nA Day in the Life of a Caregiver\nThe October issue of AARP The Magazine takes readers inside the lives of eight families who live through the daily struggles and the surprising joys of family caregiving. These emotional stories open the door to what happens when people care for loved ones who may be a spouse, friend, child or parent. This video gives a look into what it is like 24 hours in the life of an American caregiver.\nFor more information about how AARP is supporting National Family Caregivers Month and for more caregiving resources, visit the AARP Caregiving Resource Center at http://www.aarp.org/caregiving .\nAbout AARP\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
