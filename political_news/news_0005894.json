Doug Pittman said the three suspects will be extradited to California after investigators tracked them from the homicide scene at a scenic hiking trail 20 miles north of San Francisco to a community dining hall 600 miles away in Portland, Oregon.\nPittman declined to discuss the type of gun recovered and any more details, including a possible motive for the killing of Steve Carter on Monday evening near Fairfax, California. \"It's still very early in our investigation,\" Pittman said.\nAuthorities identified the suspects as Sean Michael Angold, 24, Morrison Haze Lampley, 23, and Lila Scott Allgood, 18. The sheriff's office said none of the suspects has a known permanent address.\nNo charges have been filed. The trio may be transferred to a Marin County jail sometime next week, Pittman said.\nA hiker found Carter's body about 6 p.m. Monday. Carter was still holding the leash of his dog, which was also shot. Carter's Doberman pinscher was turned over to the Marin County Humane Society and is expected to recover.\nCarter drove to the trail, and his 2003 Volkswagen station wagon was gone when police showed up. Using GPS technology, Marin County sheriff's investigators tracked the car to Portland, where the three were arrested without incident.\nPittman said investigators were also aided by surveillance footage from a gas station in Point Reyes that showed the suspects with the stolen car about a half-hour after the slaying.\n\"So many people are in possession of cameras in cars, homes, businesses,\" he said. \"Those types of systems became crucial to the pursuit and apprehension.\"\nAuthorities have not provided a motive for the attack and said it did not appear the suspects knew the victim. Pittman said it was unclear if Carter might have been targeted for his car or other belongings.\nFollowers credited Carter with improving their romantic relationships by teaching tantra, a philosophy of meditation, yoga and sexuality famously embraced by rock star Sting.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Sudhin Thanawala contributed to this story from San Rafael, California.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
