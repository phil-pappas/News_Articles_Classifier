Jay Inslee on Thursday promoted a longtime employee to lead the state Department of Corrections, which is charged with managing the state’s prisons and supervising released offenders. \nDan Pacholke, currently the Department of Corrections’ deputy secretary, will replace outgoing Corrections Secretary Bernie Warner, who is stepping down to work for a private prison operator in Utah. Warner, whose last day is Friday, leaves the agency after leading it for four years. \n“Dan is not only an outstanding administrator and manager, he’s committed to further strengthening the great work happening all throughout DOC,” Inslee said in a news release Thursday announcing his decision. \nAccording to Thursday’s news release, Pacholke started working for the department as a correctional officer at McNeil Island Corrections Center in 1982. He later served as the superintendent of three prisons, and in 2010 was appointed assistant secretary to oversee the department’s prisons division. \nThe Department of Corrections incarcerates roughly 17,000 people and supervises about the same number. It operates 12 prisons. \nPacholke moves into the new leadership role Saturday, Inslee’s office said. \nMelissa Santos: 360-357-0209", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:03:58.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
