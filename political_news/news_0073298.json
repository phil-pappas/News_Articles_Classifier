Shoppers will not have to pay sales tax on Energy Star or WaterSense items that cost $1,500 or less. One caveat: the items must be purchased for noncommercial home or personal use.\nSo, what qualifies?\nClothes washers are among products that may qualify this weekend during Georgia’s sales tax holiday. Energy Star products: Air conditioners; ceiling fans; clothes washers; dehumidifiers; dishwashers; doors; fluorescent light bulbs; refrigerators; and windows.\nWaterSense products: bathroom sink faucets and accessories (such as aerators); high-efficiency toilets; high-efficiency urinals; shower-heads; and weather or sensor-based irrigation controllers.\nThe state held its first tax holiday in summer for back-to-school shopping.", "external_links": ["https://dor.georgia.gov/sites/dor.georgia.gov/files/related_files/press_release/2015_Sales_Tax_Holiday_Energy_and_Water_Efficient_Products.pdf", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/01/76/66/Energy-Star-Ratings-label.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:44:43.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
