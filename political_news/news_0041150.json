(AP) — Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump says that money won’t make the difference for candidates this election cycle. \nTrump spoke Monday evening in front of an enthusiastic crowd of thousands at the Civic Center of Anderson, South Carolina. \nIt was his latest visit to the early-voting state. \nFinancial disclosure reports released last week show that the billionaire has attracted tens of thousands of small-dollar contributions. \nHe has also spawned several super PACs that can raise unlimited funds. \nBut Trump says that he doesn’t think that bringing in huge contributions will help rivals like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush prevail. \nHe says that if candidates don’t resonate with voters, all the money in the world won’t help.
