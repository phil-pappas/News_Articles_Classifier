The fact that the D.C. Council remains in session on a year-round basis might be causing more trouble than they’re worth. \nLocal fitness trainers probably think so. \nUntil Council member Jack Evans last week introduced a bill garnering a majority of sponsors to repeal a measure unanimously approved last year to register and regulate trainers, the District was poised to become the nation’s first in the country to do so. The D.C. Council’s regulatory reflex to manipulate and manage anything that comes within its field of vision will likely, in this instance, be scuttled. It took an organically organized outcry by fitness professionals, however, to make that happen. \nAnyone pondering why industry associations lobbying for self-preservation proliferate in this town need only cast a gaze toward the politicians, and anonymous agency personnel catering to their whims, possessed with a big government instinct to control commerce. There’s ample reason D.C. is widely considered one of the worst unfriendly-to-business locations in America. \nAs is often the case, the resulting regulatory rulemaking spawned by prior passage of the law was partly prompted by a federal administration all too eager to promulgate these types of nanny state measures. The ostensible rationale for the local edict was a provision in the national health insurance overhaul that will allow corporate tax breaks and insurance applicability for wellness programs. \nHowever, the now-former head of the buried-in-the-bowels-of-government D.C. Board of Physical Therapy, recently informed by Mayor Bowser that she would not be reappointed after 15 years, neglected to even mention such justification when defending having urged the Council to approve the law and justifying the proposed regulations she intended to forward for approval. Instead, the “model” requirements setting off alarms around the country within the fitness world were characterized as necessary to regulate trainers similarly to hairdressers. \nThat assertion only begs the question why hairdressers are also over-regulated when national studies indicate the result discourages personal entrepreneurship and professional engagement – often primarily affecting minorities and those with skill levels recommending craft or service work as ideal employment options. As usual, the unintended consequences are overwhelmingly negative. \nAll of this merely leads to corporatization of independent endeavors and small business sectors through government-supported cronyism picking winners and losers by breeding layers of quasi-independent industry overlords. In the instance of regulating trainers in D.C., the board tasked with writing the rules had an inherent conflict of interest favoring the physical therapists currently under their domain. They were additionally confronted with choosing a particular private sector certification group with potential bias against exercise disciplines such as CrossFit, for example. \nPerhaps more revealing, D.C. Council member Mary Cheh confessed that she and her colleagues didn’t adequately examine the legislation approved last year. Cheh told local “Loose Lips” political reporter Will Sommer, “The truth is we never really focused on it.” Presumably the reflexive instinct to regulate was sufficient. \nThis boils down to dual derelictions in philosophy and judgment by government: All commercial activity requires smothering by heavy-handed regulation to protect infantilized consumers incapable of being competent marketplace actors and vetting service selections. If the “sharing economy” has taught politicians anything it’s that user evaluation is more valuable and beneficial than lurking and lumbering bygone-era bureaucracies. \nPerhaps District residents should be spared politicians with too much time on their hands and too much inclination to legislate and regulate beyond reason or even commonsense. \nOnly 10 states have genuinely full-time legislatures. In the Washington region, both Maryland and Virginia have less-than-full-time legislators, paid less than a full-time salary and commanding few staff. \nIn fact, no state pays its legislators a sum even approaching the District’s baseline salary of nearly $135,000, exceeded among municipalities only by Los Angeles. \nMaybe a little tightening of the legislative and regulatory belt would be just the fitness regimen D.C. needs. \n\nMark Lee is a long-time entrepreneur and community business advocate.
