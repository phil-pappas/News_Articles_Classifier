At a Rotary Club meeting in Manchester, she cast herself as a presidential candidate looking to lead by serving others first.\n\"Leadership indeed has nothing to do with the size of your office, the size of your title, the size of your airplane, the size of your ego,\" Fiorina said. \"Leadership has to do with service. And the highest calling of leadership is to unlock the potential in others. I believe at this pivotal time, we need a leader in the Oval Office who understands their calling is to unlock the potential of this great nation by working with all of the citizens of this great nation.\"\nFiorina said she learned from her colleagues and bosses as a secretary who taught her that she had potential she never imagined harboring.\n\"Because they saw possibilities in me and because they took a chance on me and because they gave me a helping hand, I found possibilities and potential in myself that I did not know existed,\" she said. \"Every single one of us has had somebody like that in our lives. You see I thought way back then the leader was whoever had the big office, the big title, the big parking space, the big perks. And then I came to see that there were people with big offices who did not lead.\"\n  Report: Obama to meet families of Oregon victims Last week after the shooting took place, the president repeated his call for gun control.\nBy Daniel Chaitin â€¢ 10/05/15 10:01 PM She focused much of her speech on the need to open the government's books and determine how Uncle Sam spends taxpayers' money.

She has made several public stops in New Hampshire and plans to travel to California this coming weekend.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:53:44.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
