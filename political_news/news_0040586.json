(Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT\nAssociated Press Oct. 19, 2015 | 11:26 p.m. EDT + More By HOWIE RUMBERG, AP Baseball Writer\nTORONTO (AP) â€” Troy Tulowitzki and Josh Donaldson each homered in a six-run third inning, and Toronto's bats broke out at home for an 11-8 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Monday night that trimmed the Blue Jays' deficit to 2-1 in the AL Championship Series.\nRyan Goins also connected and had a two-run single, one game after his misplayed pop fly set off Kansas City's winning rally Sunday.\nVeteran knuckleballer R.A. Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City's 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4.\nIn the first ALCS game in Toronto since 1993, Tulowitzki connected for a three-run shot off Johnny Cueto, and Donaldson hit a two-run drive off Kris Medlen as the Blue Jays hit their first home runs of the series.\nCueto failed to retire a batter in the third inning, allowing eight runs and six hits in the worst postseason start of his career.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
