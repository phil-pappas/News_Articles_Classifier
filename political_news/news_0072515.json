Anont Nampa, Sirawit Serithiwat, Pansak Srithep and Wannakiat Chusak yesterday made an appointment with the court to deliver their first testimonies in the case after being accused of violating the National Council for Peace and Order's ban on political rallies. The Pathumwan Police Station police arrested them after they led a rally at the Bangkok Art and Culture Centre on February 14 where they called for an election next year. Prosecutors of the military court later filed a criminal suit against the four, accusing them of breaching NCPO order No 1 7/2557. Pansak said the military court accepted the petition questioning the authority of the military court over civilians. The military court ordered prosecutors to have the Pathumwan District Court set up a committee to rule on the court's jurisdiction. He said the military court and the Court of Justice were also considering which court has the authority to try the case against former education minister Chaturon Chaisang. He said he did not accept the authority of the NCPO because he believes the junta does not run the country democratically. If the committee appointed by the Pathumwan District Court decides that the case against his group can be tried under the military court, he would see if the reason given were justified. 347 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:10:05.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
