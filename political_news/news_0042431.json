Chris Christie wore a fleece jacket for a media briefing on this weekend's storms, but it wasn't THAT fleece.\nChristie said Friday that he still has the blue fleece emblazoned with his name that he famously wore during the recovery from Superstorm Sandy. But he says he decided to wear other fleeces given to him by towns across the state.\nHe says he didn't break out the \"heavy artillery\" Friday and will only wear the blue fleece \"in case of real emergency.\"\nChristie says he was given 27 fleeces by towns after Sandy and joked that he went through each methodically Friday before choosing to wear one from Camden County.\nHe says it was a tribute to the Camden County Police Department for its work in Camden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T21:23:45.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
