Taxpayers’ Union Executive Director, Jordan Williams, says: \n“With the more challenging economic environment, this small surplus means that the Government is going to have to exercise restraint if it is to avoid going back into the red. For taxpayers that means Bill English and John Key are going to have to trim the fat and cut the most wasteful government expenditure if they are to deliver meaningful tax cuts without borrowing the money.\" \n“New Zealanders will be encouraged by Mr English’s commitment to paying down debt rather than looking at non-essential and nice to have spending priorities. Here’s hoping that the Government’s actions in the coming years match the Finance Minister’s words today.” \nENDS New Zealand Taxpayers' Union \nNew Zealand's grassroots campaign for lower taxes and less government waste \nThe New Zealand Taxpayers' Union is an independent activist group, dedicated to being the voice for Kiwi taxpayers in the corridors of power.
