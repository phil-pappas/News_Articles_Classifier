Let me repeat that: Grown men and women who are representing this nation in a time of terrorism and very real economic anxiety actually wept because Kevin McCarthy wont lead them into another round of voter discontent, hatred and recrimination. When our members of Congress rise up from their fainting couches, it might finally dawn on them that whats going on now isnt really about John Boehner or Kevin McCarthy. Its about a much bigger problem inside the GOPone thats been obvious to every single person in the world, but them. For months on end the GOP establishment has continued to ignore all the signs of its impending doom. Its been living in a delusionthinking that they were in charge even as all the evidence made clear that their grasp of reality was not much better than Randy Quaids. Sure, their supporters are mad at them. But theyve been mad before, like when they bailed out Wall Street in 2008, while the rest of the economy tanked. It will all blow over. But it wont. And largely this is a problem of the establishments own making. Time and again, the GOP and its consultant class has overpromised to win votes and then underperformed once the votes were won. In 2014, every elected official running on the GOP ticket vowed to do all in their power to repeal Obamacareand yet Obamacare seems here to stay. They vowed to fight a raise of the debt ceiling without spending reformsand the debt ceiling was raised anyway. They railed against gay marriage, an issue about which they secretly care little, even when they knew the Supreme Court would rule against themmaking them look bigoted, hypocritical and ineffective to boot. Leaders savaged President Obama for an Iran deal that theyve told voters will lead to World War IIIand yet brushed aside real efforts to challenge the administration on it. The Republican majority has decried Planned Parenthood, and yet rejected efforts to block federal funding for the organization. On key occasions, the Republican leadership in the House has forged majorities with Democrats against the wishes of their own conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:38:54.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
