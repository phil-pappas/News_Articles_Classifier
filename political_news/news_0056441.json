The cost of training. Unless I train to be a maths teacher (which I can't do as I barely scraped a C at GCSE level) then I'll generally need to pay the full £9k, that's a hell of a lot of money to get my hands on (or get in to even more debt for) and frankly I'd rather just save the money and use it for a house deposit in the future.2. The parents. I'm sure most of the kids are fine, but I've worked in customer services since I was 17 and adults are becoming ruder and far more demanding in shops alone, I don't think I can deal with having to put up with the same crap from parents.For me, pay is not the be-all and end-all, I know teaching isn't going to be the best paid job in the world and I can accept that. But I don't want even more debt (I still owe the SLC £12k from my BA degree) or alternatively spend my house deposit on even more education, and frankly the actual working environment does not seem to be a positive one.I doubt I'm the only person that feels like this, most people would put up with poor wages in return for a good working environment, but getting abuse off parents because you dared to put little Timmy in detention for hitting another child is not a good environment, and it's not something I'd be willing to put up with for long.
