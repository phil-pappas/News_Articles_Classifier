You might want to check out what is teaching your kids . I always thought that in order to teach at the university level, you had to have at least a basic knowledge of fundamental things that are America. Apparently, to become Director of Women and Gender Studies at The College at Brockport ( Translation : teach women to snivel, whine, and blame men for their lot in life) you only need to be a dried up hipster hag and be uniquely uninformed about anything having to do with BADTHINK, such as guns, for instance. Barbara LeSavoy is just that – an endless fount of stupid in a world where stupid is pretty damn common!\nI urge President Obama to ban firearm possession in America. He is the president of the United States. He can change the country. He can do it today. I believe in him.\nDelusion much?\nHe’s such a miracle worker, that he will somehow take a large, steamy dump on the Constitution, and no one will bat an eyelash! That’s how brilliant he is!\nI voted for Barack Obama. Twice.\nI’m shocked… absolutely floored at this revelation!\nThis is my shocked face.\nDuring his 2008 presidential campaign, my two daughters, partner, and I ate every meal in our house on Obama placemats. We bought these at our local supermarket, plastic-coated, plate-sized paper rectangles with an image of his face framed by colors of the flag. While politically minded, I am not overly patriotic, so this mealtime ritual of American allegiance was odd for me. Still, we looked at the image of his face each day and we believed that he really could be the change in America.\n“And then… we all genuflected in front of a little shrine with Teh Won’s visage on it and said a little prayer to Obama!”\nWhat. The. Flying. Hell. Kind. Of. Douchery. Is. This????\nThis is quite possibly the stupidest thing I’ve read all year, and this includes the dumbass who shat himself over an NRA bumper sticker ! I also note with no small amount of irony that this sniffly harpy is ostensibly a feminist, who, along with her partner (ostensibly female), teaches her daughters how to prostrate themselves at the feet of a man. Nice job setting women back a few hundred years, you nitwit!\nAs Obama’s 2012 campaign approached, I was a little jaded. Some of his promises to our country did not come true, and I was anxious about rising social tensions he and his administration faced. Racial inequality plagued the news, gender-based violence grew in global proportion, and women’s reproductive freedoms had become increasingly vulnerable.\nStill, I did not waver. I dug into our old dining room cupboards, and found our worn but resilient Obama placements. I dusted them off, and once again, my family and I ate all of our meals looking at his image. In his presidency, we still imagined a country on the edge of change.\nGuess reality didn’t kick you in the ovaries hard enough. Whom did you blame, Cupcake? Those vil Rethuglicans? Because your Lord and Savior obviously can do no wrong in your eyes! Did you imagine the vomiting subsequent to your staring at Those place mats during your meal was caused by Ted Cruz?\nToday, I write this letter with a bleeding heart. I admire Obama. But he has let me down. I am disappointed because his presidency could have done more for our country, and sadly, the many taken lives who cannot read this essay. I still worry about urgent social tensions facing our nation, and I recognize their ongoing complexities in policy and legislative action. But gun violence can be averted. Can our country ever be free from senseless gun-crime?\nApparently, this one’s excuse for a brain isn’t firing with all pistons. She unequivocally claims “gun violence” can be avoided, while at the same time plaintively asking if we can ever be free from “senseless gun-crime.” Yeah, we can be free of it. If we leave peaceable citizens alone to exercise their right to self-defense and stop standing in the way of them exercising their Second Amendment rights. Oh, that’s NOT what you had in mind? How did we guess?\nFirearm possession should be banned in America; President Obama can orchestrate this directive. His presidency can be remembered as a remarkable turn in United States history where a progressive leader forever changed the landscape under which we live and work. This is his legacy. To establish gun control laws in America that will reduce high levels of male violence and usher in a culture of peace and civility .\nThere’s so much stupid in this paragraph, it’s really difficult to decide what to address first. Is it the folly of banning the ownership of a tool that saves is used in self-defense millions of times per year? Because, obviously if we ban something, criminals won’t use it. It worked SO well with heroin, coke, and other drugs, after all! Is it the claim that the President of the United States can unilaterally violate the Constitution? Is it the borderline retarded, debunked claim that gun control has any hope of reducing violence and ushering in a “culture of peace and civility?” Because the near-ban of firearms after Dunblane in Britain didn’t make one iota of a difference in violence ? Is it the contention that somehow Obama can overcome that whole Constitution thingy?\nI’m also wondering if this daft bint will be advocating “male control” in the near future, since the vast majority of violent crimes are committed by men? Probably… except for Lord and Savior Obama, of course, whose place mats she still worships in her candle-lit alcove adorned with newspaper clippings of Teh Won(tm).\nBarack Obama is the president of the United States. He can change the country. He can do it today. I believe in him.\nRepeating something so incredibly stupid, it actually pains the eyes to read it, will not make it come true, but go ahead and whip out your magic Obama place mat again. See how that works out for you.\nFiled under: gun control , Guns , schools and campuses", "external_links": ["http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/facebook/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://thelibertyzone.wordpress.com//feed/https://www.brockport.edu/wms/faculty/blesavoy.html", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "https://thelibertyzone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_3294.jpg?w=500", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gotwitter/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/2015/08/27/what-your-reaction-to-my-nra-sticker-says-about-you/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/category/schools-and-campuses/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/category/guns/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://thelibertyzone.wordpress.com//feed/https://thelibertyzone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_3293.jpg", "http://blog.skepticallibertarian.com/2013/01/12/fact-checking-ben-swann-is-the-uk-really-5-times-more-violent-than-the-us/", "http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=thelibertyzone.com&#038;blog=27856414&#038;post=5179&#038;subd=thelibertyzone&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/twitter/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://thelibertyzone.com/category/gun-control/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gofacebook/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://thelibertyzone.wordpress.com//feed/https://thelibertyzone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_3294.jpg", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "https://thelibertyzone.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_3293.jpg?w=500", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/", "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/opinion/guest-column/2015/10/09/obamas-legacy-guns-ban/73682284/", "http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/thelibertyzone.wordpress.com/5179/"], "published": "2015-10-16T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:14:17.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
