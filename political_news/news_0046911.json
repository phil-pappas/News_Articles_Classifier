She added that no one has been arrested or cited under this ordinance.\n\"I'm glad to hear they're being responsive,\" said Mickey Osterreicher , general counsel for the photographers association. Osterreicher said he regularly has to deal with instances of photographers being interfered with around the country.\n\"I think it's really important that people are able to protect their First Amendment right, both under freedom of expression and the freedom of the press,\" he said.\nA police officer on Wednesday stopped a news photographer from shooting photos near the Fox Theatre in midtown Atlanta, the letter says. The officer told the photographer he was violating a city ordinance and that he would be arrested and his equipment confiscated if he didn't stop, the letter says.\nThe ordinance says \"the taking of photographs on the streets in front of the place of business of another without the written consent of the other shall be deemed an offense ... if the photographs are taken for the purpose of sale.\"\nThe ordinance appears to be aimed at people who photograph people on the street and then sell the photos to them, the letter says. But it is being used to prevent journalists or anyone else with a camera from taking photos on a public street, which violates the First Amendment, the letter says.\nPhotographers around the country face increasing harassment by police officers \"who, under color of law, cite privacy, safety and security concerns as a pretext to chill free speech and expression or to impede the ability to gather news,\" the letter says.\nThe organization says the ordinance is fundamentally flawed and asks that it be immediately repealed.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show Osterreicher said \"freedom of the press,\" not \"freedom of the craft.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:32:58.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
