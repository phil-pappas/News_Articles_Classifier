It is meant to invite them to act unconstitutionally. This business of stampeding the EC to introduce a new register and so on is blatant interference contrary to Article 46 of the constitution; that is my view. I don’t think that a former president has the right to decree that article 46 should be set aside.” \nMr. Ndeburi added there is no need for the hullabaloo about the register particularly when the EC has collated proposals and is already working to reach a consensus on the matter. \n“The commission has taken proposals and is processing them so what’s this business of going to former presidents and all that…are they saying that you can just go to a former President to decree that Article 46 should be set aside “he queried.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:43:29.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
