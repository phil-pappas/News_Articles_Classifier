These results are findings of a survey recently conducted by PPAHS. Survey respondents consisted of 73 nurses who are members of the American Hospital Association (AHA). The AHA leads, represents and serves hospitals, health systems and other related organizations that are accountable to the community and committed to health improvement.\nSandra K. Hanneman , PhD, RN, FAAN (Jerold B. Katz Distinguished Professor for Nursing Research, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), School of Nursing, Center for Nursing Research) commented on the preliminary results. Noting that statisticians are currently analyzing the results, she said, \"The preliminary results show that nurses would like patient monitoring technology that is wearable and wireless. Having such technology would mean patients are not tethered to machines and foster greater patient mobility.\"\nDr. Hanneman will be the lead author of the final survey report and is also on the PPAHS board of advisors.\nPreliminary findings also showed that nurses would like a single monitor multi-parameter device that monitors all current physiological parameters, as well as a risk assessment tool to help reduce the risk of respiratory compromise .\n\"Our work as nurses is prevention and early detection of deterioration to keep patients safe and facilitate rapid recovery,\" said Dr. Hanneman. \"At times current patient monitoring technology contributes to the development of complications because it hampers patient movement.\"\nMichael Wong , JD (Executive Director, PPAHS) will discuss these preliminary survey results at the ACI Medical Liability conference. This conference is on claims, coverage and risk management in healthcare.\n\" Where would we be without nurses? ,\" asked Mr. Wong. \"Nurses are essential to patient safety. This survey will help show the technological tools nurses need to provide the best patient care possible.\"\nIf you would like a copy of the survey results, please complete the contact form at http://www.ppahs.org/about/contact-ppahs-2/ .\nAbout Physician-Patient Alliance for Health & Safety\nPhysician-Patient Alliance for Health & Safety is a non-profit 501(c)(3) whose mission is to promote safer clinical practices and standards for patients through collaboration among healthcare experts, professionals, scientific researchers, and others, in order to improve health care delivery.
