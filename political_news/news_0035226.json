He hurls insults and makes fun of his crying, as he speaks to someone on speaker phone giving instructions.\nThere are two camps of opinion regarding this video, one says this is a clear portrayal of Hernandez’ criminal mindset and behavior, while others defend Hernandez insisting the video was just a joke and that he was play acting.\nEither way, reasonable persons will view the clip and conclude Hernandez as being very comfortable in thug behavior.\nThis is not presented as footage of the crime he has been charged with and if the case goes to trial it is doubtful it would ever be presented as evidence. The evidence in the Newberry South Carolina case against Hernandez, is reported as having in evidence an audio recording of the crime.\nVictim: wrong place, wrong time\nJosé Andrade, who became a kidnapping and assault victim over a $30,000 dance performance debt speaks out.\nAccording to a Newberry County criminal complaint, Jesus Andrade , previously identified as Jose, was a victim of a kidnapping and assault on August 16. In an interview with Al Rojo Vivo, he insists that he is not a dance promoter and at no time did he hire Mexican narco ballad singer Larry Hernández to perform at a dance in Newberry.\nAndrade said that he was a victim and was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nAndrade identified Hernández as the person who had threatened his life twice while he was beaten and held against his will by Hernández, Jesús Ivan Solis and several other people who have not been identified.\nRoberto Gomez (at left) was identified as the dance promoter that actually hired Larry Hernández to perform in Newberry. Gomez failed to pay Hernández the $30K. He told Univision that he would not confirm whether he paid Hernández in full or deny it.\nAndrade was Gomez’s chauffeur who was kidnapped and assaulted by Hernández and Solis.\nVideo begins at 1:27", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITnvweyFk7A?rel=0&#038;controls=0"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:36:27.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
