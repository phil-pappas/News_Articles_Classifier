Andrew Cuomo will announce the policy change Thursday night at an event hosted by the Empire State Pride Agenda.\nGay, lesbian and transgender New Yorkers have long pushed to include gender identity in the state's anti-discrimination law. But while the measure has passed the Assembly multiple times, it remains stalled in the Republican-controlled state Senate.\nCuomo's move will prohibit discrimination against a transgender person when it comes to jobs, loans, schools and public accommodations.\nThe state already prohibits discrimination based on race, religion, disability and gender.\nNineteen states and the District of Columbia already prohibit discrimination against transgender individuals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:30:53.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
