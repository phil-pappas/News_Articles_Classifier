Dickson, III , CEO and founder of Seismic Warning Systems. \"We have a growing array of seismic sensors that detect earthquakes and HPWREN gives us another means to ensure Californians are alerted immediately.\"\n\"Over the past 15 years HPWREN has been used by research scientists and public safety organizations, providing critical sensor information and data communications from remote back country locations not well-served by other telecommunications systems,\" said Frank Vernon , HPWREN's director and a research scientist with Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. \"We are looking forward to the opportunity to provide a scalable platform that Seismic Warning Systems can leverage.\"\nAbout QuakeGuard\nPatented sensing technology to detect and analyze P-waves Programmable audio and visual alarms prevent injuries Automated control of emergency systems, mission-critical infrastructure Designed for immediate earthquake notification No \"shadow zone\" around the epicenter About HPWREN\nThe High-Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN) is a collaborative project between the San Diego Supercomputer Center and Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the UC San Diego. HPWREN functions as an Internet-connected cyberinfrastructure for research, education and public safety activities. The project supports a fixed wireless data network in San Diego , Riverside and Imperial counties. The network comprises fixed wireless links using backbone nodes, typically on mountain tops, to connect often hard-to-reach areas in remote environments.\nAbout Seismic Warning Systems, Inc.\nFounded in 2000, Seismic Warning Systems has been providing systems and services for early seismic detection and automated system response to commercial, industrial and government customers for fifteen years. Seismic Warning Systems Senior Management, inclusive of Founder/CEO, Mr. George Dickson , has been serving on the Governor's Office of Emergency Services Statewide Earthquake Warning Working Group to help provide direction and options for the fulfillment of Statewide Earthquake Warning solutions via Public Private Partnerships.\nDuring this time, (including most recently in the November 2014 Napa earthquake where SWS's system was the only Earthquake Warning System to provide actionable earthquake warning to the City of Vallejo's fire stations), many potentially dangerous quakes have been detected and acted upon, saving lives and protecting against injury, without a single false alarm. The company designs and manufactures the patented QuakeGuard TM family of seismic detection systems, which help avert human injury, mitigate earthquake damage to property and other assets, and contribute to business continuity.
