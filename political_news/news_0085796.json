Still, the GOP wants to prove it can repeal Obamacare with a Republican president in 2017 even if they cannot win a filibuster-proof majority of 60 votes in the Senate. \n“While reconciliation is not a silver bullet, it is a powerful tool, and one we remain committed to using in order to help protect Americans from President Obama’s disastrous health care law,” said Mr. Price, a candidate to replace Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who poised for a promotion to House speaker when the GOP elects its leaders on Thursday. \nInstructions in the GOP-authored, fiscal 2016 budget instructed the Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Education and the Workforce committees each to draft recommendation for reducing the deficit by at least $1 billion. \nLast week, Ways and Means voted along party lines, 23-14, to repeal insurance mandates on individuals and large employers and levies on medical devices and generous health care plans. It also voted by voice to scrap a panel set up under the health law to rein in Medicare costs. \nThe Energy and Commerce panel asked Congress to defund Planned Parenthood as punishment for its controversial abortion practice, and to repeal Obamacare’s Public Health and Prevention Fund, a pool of money that Republicans have labeled a “slush fund” with little oversight. \nThe Education and Workforce Committee said Congress should Obamacare’s “auto-enrollment mandate” on companies with 200 or more full-time workers. The rule automatically enrolls new employees — and re-enrolls existing ones — into a company health plan if the worker fails to affirmatively select a plan or opt out of coverage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:54:45.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
