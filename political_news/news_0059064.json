Share article \n“Payments will be lower for landlords who operate good practice, and higher for those who do not. \n“In the meantime I would urge landlords with HMOs in these areas to apply for a HMO licence” Promoted Stories New rules protect HMO tenants in Southampton multiple occupants Sorry, an error occurred.
