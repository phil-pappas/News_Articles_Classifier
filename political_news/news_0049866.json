It's not just something being politicized. It's incumbent on people to realize that. And it's incumbent on activists to take seriously the job police have,\" Obama said about the movement.\nObama also stressed that despite efforts to paint it that way, the Black Lives Matter movement is not opposed to law enforcement and is not inciting violence against law enforcement.

It gained momentum after the deaths of Michael Brown, John Crawford and Eric Garner in 2014, all at the hands of white police officers.\nSince then, it has become a social justice force nationwide and has inserted itself into the 2016 presidential election.\nAfter posting a petition online earlier this week for a racial justice-centric presidential debate, the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee both gave their respective blessings to the Black Lives Matter movement, specifically the #BlackLivesMatter network and Campaign Zero, to host a presidential town hall focused on racial and social justice issues.\nBlack Lives Matter organizer Elle Hearns told the Washington Post that her group had not yet decided if they would try to host a town hall.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Can debates keep Fiorina going? \"The worse she does in debates, the worse off her campaign is going to be,\" an aide said.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/22/15 4:52 PM Top Story Gowdy scolds Benghazi Dems for focus on 'money,' not 'heroism' Gowdy tore into Democrats at the Benghazi hearing for complaining about the $5 million price tag Thursday.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/22/15 4:34 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:00:36.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
