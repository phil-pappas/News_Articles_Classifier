Noah, a 31-year-old comedian from South Africa, said the Republican presidential candidate reminds him of several African leaders who are nominally president.\n\"You see, as an African, there's just something familiar about Trump that makes me feel at home,\" Noah said, before playing a clip of South African President Jacob Zuma making remarks about some, but not all migrants committing crimes.\n\"You see, that's a light xenophobia with just a dash of diplomacy, which is also the title of Paula Deen's new book,\" he cracked, before then discussing Trump's skepticism about autism and vaccines.\nWhether Trump's remarks during last month's debate were factual depends on your perspective, Noah said. As to whether they were presidential, he played a clip from 2007 reporting that Gambia's president claimed he could cure AIDS with bananas.\nKissing up to Clinton: The 15 most over-the-top emails By Nick Gass\n\"What I'm trying to say is Donald Trump is presidential. He just happens to be running on the wrong continent,\" he said.\n\"In fact, once you realize that Trump is the perfect African president, you start to notice the similarities everywhere, like the level of self-regard,\" Noah remarked, playing clips of former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, whose full title was \"His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular.\"\n\"Luckily, Idi Amin didn't own any casinos,\" Noah cracked as a photoshopped image of Trump's Las Vegas hotel displayed the lengthy honorific.\nTrump is so presidential, Noah remarked, that he's \"already at the level\" of Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for 35 years with \"brutality and repressive tactics.\"\nJimmy Carter: Melanoma has spread to brain By Nick Gass\n\"Actually, now that I think about it, Trump reminds me of one African leader in particular,\" Noah said, displaying an image of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi. \"Weird hair, check. Lavish lifestyle, check. Fringe discredited views about President Obama's origins?\" he asked, playing a 2008 clip of Gadhafi remarking that Obama was African and a Muslim.\n\"Check.\"\nThe other thing, Noah said, is that in 2009, Gadhafi tried to stay in a tent on one of Trump's Westchester County estates during a visit to the United Nations, but as \"lawyers told us we have to mention ... Trump told Gadhafi to take the tent down.\"\n\"And you see, you have to be careful what you say about Donald Trump in public,\" he said. \"Not unlike an African president.\"\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:28:37.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
