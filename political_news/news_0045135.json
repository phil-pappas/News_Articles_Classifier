Photo Credit: AFP Special court dismisses CBI charges A special court on Thursday said the Central Bureau of Investigation had filed a “fabricated and false” chargesheet in the 2G spectrum case. The court also let off former telecom secretary Shyamal Ghosh and three telecom firms – HutchisonMax (P) Ltd, Sterling Cellular Ltd and Bharti Cellular Ltd. They had all been charged with criminal conspiracy under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court ruled that there was no incriminating evidence against the accused, and the CBI should take action against officials who had filed the chargesheet, which was full of distorted facts. SC suspends ban on Maharashtra dance bars The Supreme Court on Thursday put on hold a state law passed last year banning dance bars in Maharashtra. The judgment also provided licensing authorities the power to regulate “indecent dance performances” and added that it was the duty of the state police to ensure the dignity of women was protected. Passed unanimously in 2014, the state law had overruled earlier judgments of the Supreme Court and Bombay High Court upholding the rights of women bar dancers to follow their profession. Following the Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said he favoured a blanket ban on dance bars. SC extends voluntary use of Aadhaar The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the use of Aadhaar for four more government schemes, as long as the Centre makes it clear that the card is voluntary, not mandatory. The Aadhaar card, which was earlier limited to the public distribution system and the supply of LPG and kerosene, was extended to pensions, provident fund, the Jan Dhan Yojana and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. The question of privacy has caused the Supreme Court to be circumspect in allowing the government to link the card with many of its projects. On Wednesday, the Centre had promised the court that no citizen would be denied benefits just because they did not have an Aadhaar card. Kashmir deal almost signed in 2007: former envoy India and Pakistan had reached an agreement on the Kashmir dispute in 2007, but nothing could be signed because of the turmoil that led to President Pervez Musharraf’s ouster from the government, according to Satinder Lambah, special envoy of former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Lambah told Hindustan Times that Pakistan had agreed to discard its long-held position of seeking a referendum for Kashmir. Both countries had also agreed not to redraw borders. In November 2007, Musharraf declared an emergency rule in Pakistan, before being forced to step down and go into exile a year later to avoid being prosecuted. The 2008 terror attack in Mumbai put an end to any further dialogue on the matter between the two countries, Lambah said. Haryana CM asks Muslims to give up beef to live in India “Muslims can continue to live in this country, but they will have to give up eating beef,” Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar told The Indian Express on Thursday. Rejecting the suggestion that preventing people from eating the food of their choice is an infringement of their constitutional right, Khattar said that eating beef hurts the sentiments of Hindus. “They can be Muslim even after they stop eating beef, can’t they?\" he said. \"It is written nowhere that Muslims have to eat beef, not is it written anywhere in Christianity that they have to eat beef.” We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:52:03.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
