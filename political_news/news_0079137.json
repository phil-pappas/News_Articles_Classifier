Photo: Brian Stauffer A sheet of paper can bend, twist, and tear easily. But folded several times, it becomes stiff and can support objects many times its weight. That’s the basic idea behind “origami engineering,” an emerging technique in structural engineering that’s based on a centuries-old Japanese art form.\nResearchers at Georgia Tech, the University of Illinois, and the University of Tokyo have come up with a new, origami-inspired structural-support configuration called “zipper tubes,” long tubes with zigzagged creases. On their own, the tubes are flexible and can bend into a “U” shape. But when coupled together, the structure can be a hundred times stronger than the original material used to make the tubes, says Evgueni Filipov, a graduate engineering student at the University of Illinois. “We’re basically able to eliminate all those twisting, bending, and other types of deformations to make a nice stiff structure, like a beam,” he says. Filipov and his colleagues built their prototypes out of paper, but he says he’s excited about trying the technique with thin sheets of metal or plastic. . . .\nThe zipper pattern is based on an origami technique called Miura-ori folding, in which a sheet of paper is folded into a compact square in such a way that it can be opened and closed in one swift motion. The zig-zag creases not only make the material stronger but also impart a mechanical property. That means the structure can be folded flat for easy storage and then expanded for fast deployment. . . .\nThe researchers believe this zippered tube will especially come in handy during disasters. “If you have a disaster, you might already have the bridges being built somewhere,” he says. “[If] a bridge gets washed away by a hurricane, we can go quickly onsite and deploy a bridge.” Or, the structures could quickly be carried in to construct temporary shelters.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR090_nq_FR_20151007170526.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:21:23.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
