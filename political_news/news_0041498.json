(Patrick Semansky/Associated Press) October 8 at 5:44 PM Cleta Mitchell and Trent Lott’s Oct. 5 op-ed column in support of the Safe Campus Act, “ Bringing justice to campus ,” ignored an important reality of sexual assault on college campuses: Students already can report their assaults to the police, but many choose not to.\nSome students fear retaliation if they press charges against their assailants. Police have a poor track record of handling sexual assaults — only two in 100 accused assailants spend a day in jail. And within many communities of color, there is deep mistrust of law enforcement.\nThis bill would force survivors of sexual assault to report the crime to police before any campus investigation or sanctions could begin. The Safe Campus Act, despite its name, would make campuses more dangerous by allowing schools to shirk their Title IX responsibilities to protect students from assault and would leave many students in an unsafe limbo. Some survivors, failing to get protection and support from their schools, would simply drop out. Some perpetrators, failing to be disciplined, would strike again.\nIt’s disturbing to see support for a law that would push sexual assault further into the shadows.\nFatima Goss Graves , Washington\nThe writer is senior vice president for program at the National Women’s Law Center.", "external_links": ["https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:16:17.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
