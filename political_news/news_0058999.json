The assembly later adopted English and Twi as official languages for deliberations. \nThe President said assembly members are to serve the people in the various electoral areas and communities to improve their general living conditions, and make them part of the decision-making process and governance at the local level. \n'You are expected to explain policies for a better understanding to the ordinary Ghanaian in a participatory democracy that the country has adopted', he said. \nPresident Mahama stressed that, the role of the assembly member is a very crucial one, and that, the district assembly system was to enhance the quality of Ghana's democracy. \nHe reminded assembly members to work for the public good and not for their personal interest, adding that, government will continue to play a major role in developing the assemblies through the provision of logistics, staffing and office accommodation. \nThe President emphasized the need for assemblies to generate the needed revenue not only for recurrent expenditure, but also for funding development projects, because some assemblies have the potential to generate revenue for these purposes, 'but this is not fully exploited'. \nEarlier in a welcome address, Madam Modesta Bokuma, Co-ordinating Director, urged them to study the Standing Orders and the Local Government Act to be abreast with the functions of the assembly, else they would find it very difficult to work effectively and efficiently. \nShe advised them to approach their job functions with a unity of purpose devoid of needless wrangling, in order to help move the development agenda of the municipality forward at a faster pace. \nMr. George Mensah Akpalu, former Chief Executive for the municipality, the clergy, heads of departments and teeming supporters of the assembly members were among the packed assembly hall to grace the occasion. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:03:42.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
