A total of 4,020 home sales closed in the quarter, up from 3,708 a year ago. The median sale price was $136,000, up 6.7 percent from $127,500, GRAR officials said. New listings were up 9.6 percent and pending sales were up 3.9 percent from a year ago. The inventory of homes for sale was down 8.3 percent to 5,596.“Buyers were active during the summer months, most likely hoping to take advantage of lower mortgage rates still available before the looming increase, anticipated before the year’s end,” said Andy Burke, GRAR president, in a statement. “In turn, this encouraged once-hesitant sellers to place their homes on the market.“We have seen a trend toward a longer selling season over the last several years, and this is another sign that trend is continuing,” Activity was particularly strong in the northern part of Monroe County, with Webster, Irondequoit, Parma and Hamlin showing gains of 15 to 24 percent in closings over last year, GRAR reported. Pittsford saw the biggest jump in sales in Monroe County, at 41.5 percent Sales were down 2.8 percent in Ontario County, but up in the following counties in the Rochester region: 18.2 percent in Genesee County; 9.2 percent in Monroe County; 14.3 percent in Livingston County; 15.2 percent in Orleans County; and 5.5 percent in Wayne County. \nThe city of Rochester saw 378 closings during the quarter, down 6.9 percent.

The Rochester Home Builders’ Association released its building permit report from January through September on Thursday. The organization said that building permits through the third quarter of 2015 versus 2014 were up in all categories; single family, townhomes and multifamily homes. “We are actually observing several areas of work shortages in our professional trades and the workforce in general,” said Joe Sortino, chairman of the Rochester Home Builders’ Association and president of Sortino Properties Inc., in a statement. ”It has been a great year for many of our builders, and the home improvement/remodeling sector is strong as well.” Monroe County saw 13 more permits with 650 single-family-home permits issued. Wayne County reported 20 fewer permits at 18. Ontario County showed an increase of 96 permits, bringing the total to 273.“The market is very strong throughout our industry,” said Rochester Home Builders’ Association CEO Rick Herman. “Whether consumers are looking for an entry level home, move up home or planning on downsizing, all markets are moving quickly and we anticipate this activity through the end of 2015.”    ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:08:35.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
