The process has enabled Lord Carter to benchmark what each hospital should be doing in each department.\nThe biggest savings were identified in general medicine, followed by obstetrics and gynaecology.\nAnalysis Image copyright Getty Images By Hugh Pym, BBC health editor\nLord Patrick Carter, a Labour peer as it happens, is advising Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt on how hospital budgets can be better spent.\nIn a nutshell, Lord Carter believes that just as there is variation in levels of care around the NHS, as identified by the Care Quality Commission, there are also variations in the use of money by hospitals - some are doing it well and providing good value for the taxpayer, some are not.\nHe is a firm believer in good leadership leading to high-quality patient care and the most efficient use of resources.\nIf hospitals all adopted the best practice for different surgical procedures and treatments, he argues, then outcomes for patients would be better and money would be saved.\nRead more from Hugh\nSupport is also being provided to Lord Carter by Prof Tim Briggs, a leading orthopaedic surgeon, who will help hospitals identify the most effective surgical products and techniques.\nIt comes at a time of mounting pressure on NHS finances. In the first three months of this financial year, a deficit of nearly £1bn has already built up - more than the overspend for the whole of last year.\nLord Carter said: \"The route to better care is to empower NHS leaders, so giving them the data and support they need means they can improve how they care for patients and make savings which can be reinvested in front-line care.\n\"Patients will be the real winners.\"\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt added: \"We are giving the service £10bn extra this Parliament so it is vital to use that money to secure the best outcomes.\"\nBut Jennifer Dixon, head of the Health Foundation think tank, said: \"The complexity of the task at hand cannot be underestimated. Staff are working flat out and need space and support to achieve change.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/525B/production/_86238012_83552033.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/media/images/83349000/jpg/_83349444_hi003320082.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33071066", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34589128", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5D41/production/_86237832_229ccdfc-40e9-4233-ad7e-740eeb6b20fc.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:05:27.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
