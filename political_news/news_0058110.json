Rep. Sheila Butts proposed bill comes at a time when anti-Islamic sentiment has been surfacing at schools across the country. If enacted, the bill would ban schools from teaching students younger than 10th grade about Islam or other topics the state decides constitute religious doctrine. When you have to pass this type of non-issue law, it pretty much tells you about the lack of intelligence but whole lot of religious cult hatred of your base. I thought you wanted religions out of schools. So why are you complaining. unless you have a Bigoted Agenda. I'm a good grrrl, I am. Posts: 887 Oh good, because less education and understanding is exactly what these people need. Sure.... Wait, this lady's name is Butt? Too funny. Did she pull this legislation out of her last name? Thanks from Camelot and Asimov I'm a good grrrl, I am. I thought you wanted religions out of schools. So why are you complaining. unless you have a Bigoted Agenda. Come on, there is a huge difference between teaching and preaching. School is exactly where things like this should be studied, to broaden the horizons of the students and keep them from growing up like the closed minded adults in the area Quote: Originally Posted by Lyzza Come on, there is a huge difference between teaching and preaching. School is exactly where things like this should be studied, to broaden the horizons of the students and keep them from growing up like the closed minded adults in the area What prompted this was that the Teachers curriculum was requiring students to write: paraphrase \"Allah is the only god\" Is that preaching or teaching? I thought you wanted religions out of schools. So why are you complaining. unless you have a Bigoted Agenda. Again with the strawman. Never said a word about religion in schools. I commented on how the legislatures took a nonissue and rallied the base against Islam again. This is not an issue. It's like every other \"complaint\" about public schools by born again evangelicals; it doesn't exist. More wasted tax dollars on issues that don't exist. paraphrase \"Allah is the only god", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:53:40.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
