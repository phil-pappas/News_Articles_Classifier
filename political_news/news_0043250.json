This is one of the clueless governments that has ever ruled Ghana. The entire country is in distress,” the executives said in a statement. \nThe PPP has therefore cautioned the NDC in the KEEA constituency to have the fear of God and to respect Dr. Nduom who they describe as someone who has an international reputation and whose credibility transcends partisan political and ethnic lines. \nBelow is the full statement from the Progressive People’s Party. \nWe the executives of the Progressive People's Party (PPP) in the KEEA are shocked that anyone from our municipality would go into the public arena to attempt to throw mud at Dr. Papa Kwesi Nduom. Dr. Nduom is a KEEA statesman with an international reputation whose credibility transcends partisan political and ethnic lines. \nAs an entrepreneur, his contribution to creating jobs for the youth in KEEA and all over the country has been immense. \nSo for NDC Executives to consider this man who has served his nation with distinction to be envious of anyone is disingenuous. We are certain that judging from the negative reactions pouring in from all over the world to their misjudged attempt at mudslinging, they must be ashamed of themselves. For all that this kind hearted man has done for KEEA, the NDC Executives have sown themselves to be an ungrateful lot. Politics is not everything. \nDr. Nduom spoke the truth when he cautioned politicians including President Mahama not to use the name of God in vain and not to be false witnesses. Indeed the mistake Ghanaian voters made in voting for John DramaniMahama to become President cannot be placed at the doorstep of our Lord God. It was human error of the worst kind, one that must not be repeated. \nWe wish to quote Dr. Nduom: \n\"As we continue to pray, Master, let not your people use Your name in vain. \nTeach us not to bear false witness. \nTeach us all to pray for humility, incorruptibility, diligence and the courage to take the righteous path. \nTeach our people to know that it is they who vote and that no free manna will fall from the heavens and that whom we give our vote to will determine our well-being on this earth. \nMy Lord God, make our hearts pure and our minds fertile for the truth and help us make wise choices so that we can vote for leaders who will help us make excellent use of natural gifts you have put here on part of the world called Ghana. \nThese and others I ask and pray for in the name of Jesus. Amen.\" \nWe are wide Awake!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:56:12.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
