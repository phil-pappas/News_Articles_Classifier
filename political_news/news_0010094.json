The budget has been submitted to the Parish Council for review and placed on the parish government's website for public viewing .\nParish government operations are pegged at $75 million; the capital budget is about $15 million.\nThe budget includes money that passes through parish government but goes to other agencies and organizations, such as the library system, coroner's office, St. Tammany Association for Retarded Citizens, Council on Aging St. Tammany, registrar of voters and assessor's office.\nThe council's Finance Committee next week will begin holding budget review hearings at which parish department heads will answer questions about their operations and spending plans for 2016. The hearings, in the Parish Council chambers on Koop Drive, will be from 6 to 8:30 p.m. Monday and Tuesday (Oct. 26, 27), and 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Wednesday (Oct. 28). The leaders of outside agencies that receive funds through parish government will present their budgets to the council on the night of Nov. 2.\nThe budget follows the calendar year.\nThe parish budget submitted to the council included a message from Brister in which she said her administration would continue to focus on public health, infrastructure and drainage, and the enhancement of the \"tremendous quality of life we have come to expect in St. Tammany Parish.\"\nSpecial projects include development of an advanced campus along Louisiana 434 north of Lacombe, a cultural arts district south of Covington, and Safe Haven, the behavioral health campus near Mandeville formerly known as Southeast Louisiana Hospital.\nBrister told the council her administration has made efforts to ensure the parish is \"fiscally responsible and conservative.\"\nSince taking office four years ago, her administration has reduced the parish government's debt by $36 million, Brister said. She noted Standard & Poor's recent upgrades of two parish bonds as evidence of the parish's financial stability.\nThe capital budget represents the money required to maintain existing infrastructure as well as design and build new roads and drainage projects, Brister said.\nThe capital budget includes $7 million spread across the 14 Parish Council districts for road and drainage improvements, $4 million for parishwide road projects and $3 million for parishwide drainage projects.", "external_links": ["http://www.stpgov.org/files/Public%20Information/2016_Budget_Book.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:01:16.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
