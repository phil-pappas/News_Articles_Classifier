DOESN’T”T HAPPEN. You’re a kook and a conspiracy buff.” – George Carlin\nWHY DIDN’T SLAVE OWNERS WANT THEIR SLAVES TO BE LITERATE?\nSlave owners did not want their slaves to learn to read and write as this would give them knowledge. Knowledge is powerful and one thing the owners did not want was knowledgeable slaves. The owners thought it was best to keep them all ignorant, plus the fact it would have cost money to educate slaves, and they would not waste money on slaves.\nNOW, ASK YOURSELF WHY YOU’VE NEVER BEEN TAUGHT ABOUT THE FED?\nThe answer is the same, and you my friend, are the slave. Frankly, we are all slaves. The world has let our current situation spiral out of control so long that even someone with the most intimate knowledge of the inner workings of what is happening is STILL a salve to one of the 13 most powerful families on the planet that run all the central banks. Call them the Banksters, The New World Order, The Illuminati, or whatever else you please. There is no conversation within their halls about what they call us: Property.\nIn the first video below, Glenn Beck interviews Edward G. Griffin, author of The Creature from Jekyll Island. While that might sound like a fictional book, it is far from one. I would argue it is the BEST book in print for the layman to break out of the pre-existing limits of debate that have been set FOR you, and acquire a true understanding of why central banking has enslaved us all, why the New World Order is VERY real, and why there is reason to prepare. The world better hope and pray that the Greatest Military Coup Ever That Whistleblower “Drake” Says is Coming Across the All the G5 Countries is Real. else we are all in for a very rough time just around the corner. The book deals with:\nWhere does money come from? Where does it go? Who makes it? The money magicians’ secrets are unveiled. We get a close look at their mirrors and smoke machines, their pulleys, cogs, and wheels that create the grand illusion called money. A dry and boring subject? Just wait! You’ll be hooked in five minutes. Reads like a detective story — which it really is. But it’s all true. This book is about the most blatant scam of all history. It’s all here: the cause of wars, boom-bust cycles, inflation, depression, prosperity. Creature from Jekyll Island will change the way you view the world, politics, and money. Your world view will definitely change. You’ll never trust a politician again — or a banker.\nG. Edward Griffin is a writer and documentary film producer with many successful titles to his credit. Listed in Who’s Who in America, he is well known because of his unique talent for researching difficult topics and presenting them in clear terms that all can understand. He has dealt with such diversified subjects as archeology and ancient earth history, international banking, internal subversion, terrorism, the history of taxation,\nIn just 15 minutes, by the time the video is over, if you didn’t already know why this situation is so grave, you’ll at least have an idea. After the video, once you have a little bit better understanding of the nightmare of a situation we are in, when you read the article below and find out that families like the Rothschild’s are worth an estimated $500 TRILLION DOLLARS, there is an AMAZING second full-length documentary on the New World Order.\nHumans are Free Reports:\nThe shadow forces behind the New World Order (NWO) are following a slow-paced agenda of total control over mankind and our planet’s resources. David Icke coined it the “ Totalitarian Tip-Toe ,” because “ they ” are making very small steps towards our complete and definitive enslavement.\nAs a result, the masses remain relatively unaware of the fact that their liberties are being gradually taken away, while the power of the NWO octopus grows steadily.\nTHE SHADOW FORCES BEHIND THE NWO AGENDA:\nSomewhere near the very top of the pyramid , an extremely elitist organization known as the Council of the 13 families orchestrates all of the major world events. As the name suggests, the Council consists of the top 13 most influential families on Earth.\nCHECK OUT OTHER STORIES BY THE UN-SILENT MAJORITY HERE:\nCHECK OUT THE NEW GOOGLE+ PAGE HERE:\nAn increasingly number of people is becoming aware that 99% of the Earth’s population is controlled by an “elite” 1%, but the Council of the 13 families consists of less than 1% of the 1% “elite” and nobody on Earth can apply for membership.\nIn their opinion, they are entitled to rule over the rest of us because they are the direct descendants of the ancient gods and consider themselves royal. These families are:\nRothschild (Bauer or Bower)\nBruce\nCavendish (Kennedy)\nDe Medici\nHanover\nHapsburg\nKrupp\nPlantagenet\nRockefeller\nRomanov\nSinclair (St. Clair)\nWarburg (del Banco)\nWindsor (Saxe-Coburg-Gothe)\n(Personally, I suspect that this may not be the complete list and some very powerful lineages are still unknown to us).\nThe Rothschild dynasty is unquestionably the most powerful – visible – bloodline on Earth and their estimated wealth is around $500 trillions !\nCHECK OUT OTHER STORIES BY THE UN-SILENT MAJORITY HERE:\nCHECK OUT THE NEW GOOGLE+ PAGE HERE:\nThey exercise their power through the world banking empire , which is almost entirely owned by them.\nThe most important institutions that work hard to establish the NWO and completely enslave our species, are:\nThe City of London (finance, controlled by the Rothschilds) – NOT part of the UK;\nThe US Federal Reserve (finance – private bank, owned by the Rothschilds) – NOT part of the USA;\nThe Vatican City (indoctrination, deception and scare tactics) – NOT part of Italy;\nWashington D.C. (military, mind programming, brainwashing and depopulation) – NOT part of the USA;\nAll of the above institutions function as individual states, operating under their own laws, hence there is no court of law on Earth that could ever prosecute them.\nThe multitude of Secret Societies in existence today, operate as branches of a mega corporation, which is owned by the Council of the 13 families.\nEven though they have been handsomely rewarded for their work, the members of these secret societies are not members of the “elite” bloodlines, they don’t know who their masters are and they have no idea what the real agenda is.\nTHE BRAINWASHING\nAnother mass-enslavement tool that they are using against us, is the so called educational system . Schools are no longer what they used to be and children are learning to memorize without thinking and obey without questioning .\nIn fact, this established educational system is extremely expensive to keep operational and obsolete in the age of the internet.\n“Why obsolete?” you may ask. Because the internet gives us free access to almost infinite amounts of information.\nSo why are we still paying huge amounts of money for governmental education? Because the world’s “elite” require that our children learn conformity and inside-the-box thinking .\nWHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?\nMankind’s faith is hanging in the balance right now, as the control of the NWO octopus spreads. On the one hand, we are very close to our complete enslavement, while on the other hand, we could easily crumble to the ground their pyramid of power, by simply uniting against their deception in a peaceful revolution of minds, hearts and souls.\nI’ve asked myself for years what is their greatest weapon of enslavement. Is it poor education combined with constant indoctrination? Is it the fear generated by religion? Is it the fear of being punished (jailed or killed) by the system, or is it the invisible enslavement of the monetary system?\nIn my opinion, all of the above combined had a huge impact on our society and the way we think, but their biggest weapon is hands-down the financial system!\nCURRENCY SLAVES\nThe financial system has stealthily enslaved our species and now we are being used as currency slaves . We work from 9 to 5 every day, in boring and depressing environments, not stimulated by anything creative or constructive.\nIn most cases, the sole motivation for going to work, is the next paycheck — and no matter how hard we work, we never seem to have enough money.\nHave you ever wondered why mega-corporations (reaping $billions/year in profits) pay dozens of millions to their CEOs and as close as possible to the minimum wage to the rest of the employees?\nThis has been carefully designed, because a person that is constantly “on the edge,” will never have time for self-education, introspection and — eventually — spiritual awakening.\nIsn’t this our main purpose on Earth? To become spiritual beings (and by spiritual, I obviously don’t mean religious) and complete the incarnation cycle ?\n“They” don’t need educated people, who are capable of critical thinking and have spiritual goals. No, this kind of people are dangerous to the establishment!\n“They” want obedient “robots,” just intelligent enough to operate the machines and keep the system running, but stupid enough never to ask questions.\nMONEY IS THE EYE OF THE “DEVIL”\nAll of the world’s biggest problems have their roots deeply embedded in the financial plague: wars are profitable, diseases are profitable, Earth’s plundering is profitable, human slavery and inhumane working conditions are profitable.\nOur leaders have been corrupted by money and mankind’s collective mission on Earth has been hijacked by money.\nSo why do we need the financial system, in the first place? Actually, we don’t need it (at least, not anymore). The planet doesn’t charge us a cent for using its natural resources and we have the technology to extract them without physically working a day.\nThe solution\nMore to the point, there are brilliant minds “out there” discussing the concept of a resource based economy for decades . One example is mister Jacque Fresco , a brilliant industrial designer and social engineer, who spent most of his life designing the future.\nCHECK OUT OTHER STORIES BY THE UN-SILENT MAJORITY HERE:\nCHECK OUT THE NEW GOOGLE+ PAGE HERE:\nThe cities proposed by Mr. Jacque Fresco will be built by autonomous construction robots and will be eco-friendly & self-sustainable, earthquake & fire proof. Learn more here .\nOther people are already discussing the transition plan towards the economy of the future, where money are no longer required and all individuals will be offered the best conditions to reach their highest potentials — all for the benefit of our species, as a whole.\nSo, my question is: are we ready to embrace the future and escape the control of the “elite” in a world without money, or are we going to allow the New World Order to happen?\nIn the second video, which is a full documentary, you’ll learn more about the history of the New World Order as it pertains to modern times and what’s going on in the news today. From Kabalists, to Gnostics, Knights Templars, Rosicrucians, Jesuits, Freemasonry right down to the Illuminati people speak of today. If you enjoy learning, and want to get a true understanding of how evil is at work right in front of you daily, then hopefully you can stream this video right to your television and watch it three or four times. It is ABSOLUTELY that good, and as we established above, knowledge is power.\nFOR JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF HOW POLITICS, WARS, PLANET X, GLOBAL DEPOPULATION, AND THE ILLUMINATI FIT TOGETHER:\nPt. 1: Illuminati Infiltrate NASA, Conceal Largest Lie in History, & Will Depopulate\nPt. 2: Nazi’s and Illuminati Directly Responsible For the U.S. Space Program, but Why\nPt. 3: Secret Societies Arranged For Underground Bunkers For Them, Not You.\nPt. 4: Why Are The Illuminati Planning To Crash the Global Economy\nPt. 5: What Is The Illuminati Doing To Usher in Global Martial Law?\nPt. 6: 74 NASA Scientists Dead: Largest Cover-up in Human History Continues\nPt. 7: What Dark Secrets Are The Georgia Guidestones Hiding From Humanity\nPt. 8: Former Illuminati Confesses on Obama, Space Program, Denver, and Aliens\nPt. 9: Planet X Accidentally Disclosed by NASA At Recent Conference\nPt. 10: Everything We Have Been Taught About Human Origins Is A Lie\nPt. 11: Secret Identity of Georgia Guidestone’s Founder Revealed\nSource: http://thefugitiveprinciple.com/these-13-families-rule-the-world-the-shadow-forces-behind-the-nwo-politics/", "external_links": ["http://humansarefree.com/2011/08/economy-of-future-rbe.html", "http://i0.wp.com/thefugitiveprinciple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Rothschild-2-1024x512.jpg?resize=614%2C307", "http://humansarefree.com/2014/02/old-souls-and-completion-of-incarnation.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2013/11/11-ways-to-improve-creativity-and-think.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2014/07/the-reptilian-aliens-and-council-of-13.html", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/XBt67W29YAo?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent", "http://unsilentnews.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Rothschild-2.jpg", "http://i1.wp.com/thefugitiveprinciple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Illuminati3.jpg?w=650", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/HL6v8nzFiUk?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent", "http://humansarefree.com/search/label/NWO", "http://i0.wp.com/thefugitiveprinciple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Pyramid-1024x576.png?resize=614%2C346", "http://humansarefree.com/2013/11/jfk-killed-after-shutting-down.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2014/09/the-top-of-pyramid-rothschilds-british.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2014/04/mankinds-forbidden-history-holds-answer.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2013/01/a-transition-plan-towards-resource.html", "http://i1.wp.com/thefugitiveprinciple.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Rothschild.jpg?resize=526%2C374", "http://humansarefree.com/search?q=education", "http://humansarefree.com/2013/11/complete-list-of-banks-ownedcontrolled.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2014/10/exposing-shadow-forces-behind-nwo.html", "http://www.thevenusproject.com/about/resume", "http://humansarefree.com/2014/02/you-cannot-afford-college-education.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2011/09/history-of-house-of-rothschild-complete.html", "http://unsilentnews.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Rothschild.jpg", "http://humansarefree.com/2013/04/the-dark-secrets-of-vatican.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drn7LaKoeaQ", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/106067833169540314982/106067833169540314982/posts", "http://humansarefree.com/2013/11/6-secrets-they-dont-want-you-to-know.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2013/11/the-british-crown-empire-and-city-of.html", "http://humansarefree.com/2014/04/college-is-waste-of-time-and-money.html", "http://www.thevenusproject.com/", "http://thefugitiveprinciple.com/these-13-families-rule-the-world-the-shadow-forces-behind-the-nwo-politics/", "http://unsilentnews.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Pyramid.png"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:59:55.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
