Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has denounced candidates who are overly poll-tested, a line of attack that has been used against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the past and one he had in his prepared text as a veiled reference to her at the Iowa Democratic Party Jefferson-Jackson Dinner on Saturday night. But Mr. Sanders’s campaign, flush with cash from low-dollar donors, has hired a pollster of its own, his senior adviser Tad Devine confirmed. Mr. Sanders has brought on Ben Tulchin, who polled for Howard Dean, the insurgent Democratic presidential candidate of the 2004 cycle. “I wanted to hire a pollster, and we decided we didn’t need polling until we got to the stage where we would be doing media, and we convinced Bernie that we needed targeting data,” Mr. Devine said in an email. “He is not a big consumer of polling, so he did not see the need for it, but I think he understands it in terms of targeting media buys and for voter contact that it has value and can save us money because we won’t waste resources by, for example, buying the wrong shows on TV.” Mr. Sanders plans to begin airing advertisements on television in the coming weeks, Mr. Devine has said. His campaign began with a smaller budget that has grown as his donation poll has gotten larger, fueled by his army of donors contributing small amounts. Fri.
