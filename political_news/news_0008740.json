The judge said the lawyers for the families have raised “grave” concerns but additional evidence is needed. \nThe case will continue. \nDozens of families and children sued the Texas Department of State Health Services after local authorities refused various foreign identifications. The parents, from Mexico and Central America, are not U.S. citizens. The Constitution guarantees the right of citizenship to their children because they were U.S.-born. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:06:19.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
