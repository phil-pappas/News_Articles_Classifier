The appointments are for a term of three years and are made on the recommendation of Parliament. \n\"Mr Murdoch is a former Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has served as High Commissioner to Canberra and is a former Chief Executive of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. His wealth of public sector and diplomatic knowledge will lend a depth of experience to the IPCA,\" Ms Adams says. \n\"The IPCA has continued to be an independent check on the conduct of the police under the leadership of Sir David Carruthers,\" Ms Adam says. \n\"Mr Murdoch and Ms Macaskill are both highly respected in their fields and their appointments will ensure the IPCA has essential experience in both governance and management.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:16:30.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
