In parishes like Terrebonne that have experienced layoffs due to falling oil prices, 1,336 people receive assistance under the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The program is 100 percent funded by the federal government, so no state money flows to the people who use the program to purchase food.\nSuzy Sonnier, the secretary of Children and Family Services, said in a statement that the state will no longer allow people between the ages of 18 and 49 without dependent children to use the program if they haven't found work for three months. The changes are consistent with changes made to the program in the 1990s, but states like Louisiana with higher-than-average unemployment rates can apply for waivers from those rules.\nSonnier said the changes are being made to put pressure on people to go back to work. To be eligible for food assistance, a person needs to work at least 20 hours a week or participate in job training.\n\"We continue to seek opportunities for SNAP recipients to increase their self-sufficiency,\" Sonnier said. \"We are striving to reduce reliance on public benefits, increase the number of clients participating in education or workforce activities and connect Louisiana employers with ready and willing-to-work job candidates.\"\nAble-bodied people without dependents who are unable to find at least 20 hours of work a week would lose their benefits on Jan. 1.\nBut Jan Moller, the director of the Louisiana Budget Project, said the changes will not just affect people who aren't willing to work. They will also impact people who can't find a job, don't have transportation to a job or have been laid off in recent months due to economic conditions such as falling gas prices that are unique to oil-and-gas industry states like Louisiana.\n\"From our perspective, we are leaving federal dollars on the table and not creating a single job for anybody and not saving the state a single dime,\" Moller said. \"All we're doing is taking food off the table for people who are unemployed, poor and can't find a job.\"\nTerrebonne Parish President Michel Claudet worries that people being laid off in his part of the state due to falling oil prices are going to be most affected by the changes. Sales tax revenue fell 14 percent last month, Claudet said, and while the parish has the second-lowest unemployment rate, the layoffs for oil workers have become regular news.\n\"One of the ladies that works in my area, she has a son who's in his 30s and worked for oil companies for numerous years. He's been laid off for four months and unable to find an additional job,\" Claudet said. \"Now he's living with the mother, with the wife and child, in order to make ends meet. Those are the kinds of things that are happening right now.\"\nHere's a look at the number of people in areas in and around New Orleans that benefit from the food assistance program.\nFood assistance recipients Region Recipients Algiers 367 New Orleans 7,771 Jefferson East 619 Jefferson West 4,168 Plaquemines 150 St. Tammany 1,341 St. Bernard 564 St. John the Baptist 790 St. Charles 427 Department of Children and Family Services Kevin Litten is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.
