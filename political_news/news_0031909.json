Generally, the first 25 per cent of the pot is tax-free and the remainder is subject to tax.\nA free guidance service - Pension Wise - was introduced alongside the reforms, offering a one-off 45-minute guidance session in person or over the telephone together with information online.\nPromoted stories The committee said Pension Wise was created to fill a potentially dangerous gap in support for consumers, including many people who are unable or unwilling to pay for independent financial advice.\nBut it described the Pension Wise website as \"not fit for purpose\", adding: \"It is static, offering no opportunities for personalisation and lags well behind many private services.\"\nThe report called on the Government as a \"matter of urgency\" to ensure the website provided a calculator so people could work out what their income might be as well as examples tailored to people's individual circumstances.\nConsideration should also be given to the possibility of offering customers two or more Pension Wise guidance sessions rather than just one, the MPs said.\nFrank Field, the committee chairman, said: \"These reforms have been in operation for six months now; it is evident that that has been long enough for the scammers to get going, working on defrauding people out of their life savings. It should be long enough for Government to have published some data about how the reforms and the attendant guidance and advice are working.\"\nHe added: \"We have seen all too clearly, too many times, what happens when financial information is not properly provided and regulated. We, literally, cannot afford another financial mis-selling scandal.\"\nA Treasury spokesman stressed how the Government had been clear that any attempt to exploit people who had worked hard and saved for their retirement was unacceptable, which was why it was working with the police, regulators and other bodies to raise awareness and take action to protect consumers.\nShare article \"Six months since its launch, Pension Wise has been a real success story with 1.5 million visits to the website and over 20,000 guidance appointments; we've already committed to making this data available on a regular basis.\n“We're continuing to build on this success, promoting the service through a national marketing campaign and our local guiders are considering ways to make Pension Wise even more useful for consumers,” he added.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-19T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:15:49.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
