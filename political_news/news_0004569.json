He campaigned on renewable energy, organic agriculture and measures to mitigate the environmental impact of industry.\nMr Meacher took a lot of flak for his proposal in 1999 for a ban on second homes to prevent long-time residents being priced out of rural areas, after it was revealed that he and his wife owned a number of properties.\nHis increasingly \"green\" rhetoric – including attacks on genetically modified (GM) food – were an increasing cause of irritation to Mr Blair, and he was tipped as a candidate for the sack at each of the PM's reshuffles until he was finally removed in 2003. His survival until then was credited by some to his impressive technical grasp of complex environmental issues and to Mr Blair's preference to keep him occupied with government business rather than campaigning from the backbenches.\nMr Meacher voted in favour of the Iraq War in 2003, but later described it as \"the biggest political mistake of my life\", saying he had believed Mr Blair when he claimed to have evidence of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction.\nHe became a vociferous backbench campaigner for openness about the causes and consequences of the war, as well as on issues like nuclear disarmament, income inequality, civil liberties and climate change.\nHis pitch for the leadership after Tony Blair stood down included promises to scrap Trident, renationalise the railways and curb City bonuses, but lasted only a matter of days before he stepped aside to give fellow left-winger John McDonnell a clear run. In the event, Mr McDonnell was unable to secure enough MPs' nominations to get onto the ballot paper and Mr Brown was crowned unopposed.\nUnlike some other MPs who nominated Mr Corbyn purely to \"widen the debate\" in this year's leadership election, Mr Meacher was a committed supporter of the new Labour leader and hailed his victory for offering the right \"a very real threat that they've not encountered for the last 30 years\".\nHe recently sparked controversy by suggesting Lord Mandelson should be thrown out of the party for publicly discussing the removal of Mr Corbyn as leader.\nShare article Born in Hemel Hempstead in 1939, Mr Meacher was educated at Berkhamsted School in Hertfordshire and took a first in classics at Oxford University before studying at the London School of Economics.\nHe had two sons and two daughters from his first marriage in 1962 to Molly – now Baroness Meacher – and wed again in 1988 to wife Lucianne, who survives him.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-21T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:22:26.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
