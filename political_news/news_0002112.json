McFarland\nPublished October 23,\nI did not watch the Benghazi hearings, unlike many others, in hopes of catching Secretary Clinton out, with my ears perked up for some admission that could sink her presidential ambitions.\nSecretary Clinton did not disappoint in her performance on Thursday.\nShe admitted to no wrongdoing, nor to breaking any laws.\nMistakes were made by others, the fault lies elsewhere.\nSecretary Clinton was far more adept at bobbing and weaving than the members of Congress who questioned her were at pinning her down.\nShe put up with hours and hours of questions, and no one laid a glove on her.\nSecretary Clinton was far more adept at bobbing and weaving than the members of Congress who questioned her were at pinning her down.\nShe brushed off blame by saying security decisions were handled at lower levels of the State Department professional staff, not by the secretary.\nShe didn't receive Ambassador Stevens' requests for more security -- implying that if only she had things might have turned out differently.\nIt was a masterful performance. She showed enormous discipline and nearly super-human stamina.\nShe let nothing slip. But in the end she let everything slip. She got a perfect score, but failed the test.\nShe didn't mean to, but she showed us a glimpse into her soul.\nIt was chilling.\nWe now know that when Secretary Clinton met the plane carrying the bodies of the four Americans who died at Benghazi she lied about what happened.\nShe stood over the flag-draped coffins of four dead Americans and blamed their deaths on an Internet video, which caused a demonstration outside the consulate to turn into a deadly attack.\nShe looked into the eyes of the families of the fallen heroes and swore she would bring the videomaker to justice. But she was lying .\nShe knew they died from a planned terrorist attack from an Al Qaeda-like group. That's what she told her family and foreign leaders according to newly released emails.\nWhy? Because the Obama administration had an election to win eight weeks later, and a terrorist attack that killed four Americans didn't fit into that plan.\nPresident Obama asked voters to reelect him because he had killed Usama bin Laden. Al Qaeda was on the ropes. Qaddafi was dead and the Libyan war a success. The wave of war was a receding. President George W. Bush's War on Terror was over because Obama and Clinton had won it.\nA terrorist attack that killed Americans at Benghazi did not fit into that campaign narrative, so it had to be retold and spun into a different story. It wasn't radical Islamist terrorists, but a spontaneous demonstration that got out of control in reaction to an obscure Internet video.\nIn the end, the Benghazi hearings probably didn't change many minds.\nSecretary Clinton's supporters will say it was a waste of time, a politically motivated witchhunt.\nSecretary Clinton's detractors will say she never answered the questions.\nBut for me it wasn't the questions or the answers that mattered.\nIt wasn't about negligence or criminality or incompetence.\nInstead it was -- and still is -- about character. And Secretary Clinton has been found wanting.\nKathleen Troia \"K.T.\" McFarland is a Fox News National Security Analyst and host of FoxNews.com's \"DefCon 3.\" She served in national security posts in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations\n+ Follow FoxNewsOpinion on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/FoxNewsOpinion"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:36:57.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
