(AP) - The latest on the fatal beating of a 19-year-old inside a church (all times local):\n10:45 a.m.\nAn attorney for a woman charged with manslaughter in a deadly assault on her teenage son at a New York church says he believes other people caused the fatal injuries and she didn't have the emotional strength to intervene.\nLawyer Devin Garramone said Thursday the confrontation \"spun out of control\" and Deborah Leonard \"didn't have the temerity\" to stand up to others in a church where she'd worshipped for 30 years.\nNineteen-year-old Lucas Leonard died and his 17-year-old brother, Christopher, was seriously injured after being beaten Sunday at the Word of Life church in New Hartford. The police chief has said a spiritual \"counseling session\" turned violent.\nThe boys' parents are charged with manslaughter. Four other people, including the boys' 33-year-old sister, face assault charges. All have pleaded not guilty.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:37:33.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
