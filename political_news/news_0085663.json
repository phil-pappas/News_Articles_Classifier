One man's injury is another man's opportunity. And Schofield is the benefactor.\nCoach Gary Kubiak announced Friday that starting left tackle Ty Sambrailo would be out Sunday versus Minnesota with a shoulder injury. The blowback effects two spots on the offensive line with Kubiak moving starting right tackle Ryan Harris to left tackle and the 6-foot-6, 301-pound Schofield getting the start at right tackle.\nWATCH: Why is Michael Schofield starting at tackle?\nNot only will it be Schofield's first start, it'll be his first career NFL snap.\n\"I'll definitely have some butterflies. I'm sure everyone does in their first game. I've just got to go out there, play with confidence and play with good technique,\" said Schofield, in his second season with the Broncos.\nAn almost identical situation happened to Schofield during his redshirt sophomore year at the University of Michigan. He wasn't supposed to get much action that season, but the starting left guard went down with an injury in Week 1 and it was his job from that point on.\nThat's where a lot of his motivation comes from this week. Despite struggling in training camp and during the preseason, Schofield is confident he can do the job.\n\"They drafted me last year in the third round, so I've got to prove I was worth that pick and come out there and dominate,\" he said.\nAdvertisement WATCH: Can Michael Schofield hold up against the Vikings?\nHe found out he was getting the start Wednesday. Immediately, he reached out to Harris and right guard Louis Vasquez for advice.\nBut Schofield knows when he hits the field Sunday, it'll all be on him. Also, new Broncos tackle Tyler Polumbus, who was signed Wednesday after being released by Atlanta, will be available if needed.\nAlong with the added pressure, Schofield has a lot of of pent up frustration. He watched the team move Vasquez from right guard to right tackle instead of him last season when coach John Fox reshuffled the offensive line at mid-season. And, this year, after being an early favorite to start at right tackle, he was quickly passed by Harris and former Bronco Chris Clark in training camp. Clark was subsequently traded.\nSchofield treated it like an indictment of his play and said he's on a mission to prove his worth.\n\"This is a great opportunity for Michael. As a player, that's all you ask for â€” work, work, work and then someday, okay, hey, here we go. Then you find out,\" Kubiak said. \"It's Michael's turn.\"\nSchofield isn't the only offensive linemen with a new challenge this week. Harris will play left tackle in a regular season game for the first time since 2013.\nWATCH: What will the Broncos do if Evan Mathis can't play?\nHe's played on both sides of the line throughout his NFL career but admitted it's not an easy switch. All of the terminology is backwards and then there's the added pressure of protecting Peyton Manning's blindside against the Vikings' top pass rusher.\nSambrailo sustained his injury late in Sunday's victory over the Lions. The Broncos offensive line had perhaps its best game of the young season though the running game remained stalled. They allowed one sack versus the Lions after allowing seven in the previous two games.\nHarris isn't looking for any pity. The rest of the line isn't either.\n\"You play in the NFL, things aren't going to be perfect, ever,\" Harris said. \"That's in life, too, whether you're a sports writer or a fan, things in life don't go perfectly and you have to be ready to adapt. The team that can adapt the best is going to win on Sunday and is going to win the Super Bowl.\"\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:05:33.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
