As in early September before Fiorina's spike in support, Trump and Carson are the first choice candidate of about half of the potential Republican electorate. All told, nearly two-thirds of Republican voters choose Trump or Carson as either their first or second choice for the nomination. \nNo other candidates made significant gains since the last CNN/ORC poll conducted just after the Republican debate hosted by CNN and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. \nOverall, Trump's 27 percent leads the field, followed by Carson at 22 percent, both head and shoulders above their nearest competition. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are tied for third place with 8 percent support each, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul each at 5 percent. Fiorina, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz each have 4 percent support, while Ohio Gov. John Kasich is at 3 percent. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum stands at 2 percent and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham holds 1 percent. \nThe new poll comes amid a flurry of polling being released about a week before the GOP candidates will again meet on the debate stage. The polling criteria set by the organizers of that debate, set to take place October 28, appear likely to result in 10 candidates taking the main stage. Aside from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who ended his campaign shortly after last month's debate, it's likely to be a rematch of those who debated in Simi Valley. \nFiorina's decline comes across the demographic and political spectrum, with her support now topping out at 8 percent among those with college degrees. Last month, she stood at 22 percent among the same group. Fiorina has dropped 11 points among women and 12 points among men, fallen 18 points among independents, 17 points among those age 50 or older, and 15 points among conservatives. \nThe poll finds Republican voters increasingly satisfied with their field of choices, 32 percent say they are \"very satisfied\" with the group of candidates running for president, up from 23 percent in July. Republicans also remain more enthusiastic about the presidential race than Democratic voters. In the new poll, 68 percent of Republican voters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president in next year's election, compared with 58 percent among Democratic voters. \nThose enthusiastic voters are even more strongly behind Trump and Carson than Republican voters generally, while less enthusiastic Republicans are more likely to say they back Bush. Trump's support among the enthusiastic voters is 30 percent, with Carson at 25 percent, while Bush's support dips to just 3 percent. Among those who say they are \"somewhat enthusiastic\" or less, 22 percent back Trump, 16 percent back Carson and 15 percent back Bush. \nThere are some signs in the poll that Carson's numbers get a boost if turnout in GOP primaries and caucuses follows the same patterns it has in the past. Carson runs about evenly with Trump among the groups that make up the largest blocs of GOP primary voters: conservatives, self-identified Republicans and white evangelicals. Carson also nearly matches Trump's support among those voters with college degrees, with 24 percent backing Trump, 23 percent backing Carson and 13 percent backing Rubio. \nA gender gap has reemerged in the data in the last month, with Carson matching Trump's support among women (23 percent back each) with Bush behind at 9 percent, Huckabee at 7 percent and Fiorina and Rubio each at 6 percent among GOP women. \nTrump has larger edges over Carson among men (31 percent to 21 percent, with Rubio at 10 percent) and independents who lean toward the Republican Party (32 percent Trump to 19 percent Carson). \nThe CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,028 adults. Results among the 465 registered voters who say they are Republicans or independents who lean toward the Republican Party have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:26:32.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
