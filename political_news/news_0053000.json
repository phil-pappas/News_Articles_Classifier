Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull declared the purchase of 1100 new armoured vehicles for $1.3 billion to replace the Army's ageing land drovers as vital to better protecting Australian troops from the threat of terrorist roadside bombs.\nBut the comments were overshadowed after dumped former defence minister Kevin Andrews delivered a series of tweets stamping his authority on the deal ahead of the announcement.\nMr Turnbull said the vehicle project awarded to Bendigo-based Thales Australia would see the Hawkei follow the successful heavier blast-proof Bushmaster, which has saved soldier's lives in Afghanistan and Iraq and has been successfully exported to other countries.\n\"The reality is that IED's [roadside bombs] are a feature of the modern battlefield and regardless of the context in which the ADF is operating, that type of threat is almost certainly going to be there and these vehicles are able to operate in every terrain,\" Mr Turnbull told reporters at the Army's Monegeetta vehicle testing grounds.\nThe deal, to build about 1000 new blast-proof Hawkei vehicles, will also sustain at least 170 jobs, according to Defence Minister Marise Payne. \"It is a time of rapid change and whether you are responding to violent extremism or the increasing lethality of individuals on the battlefield and that is what the Hawkei is a response to, you need to be prepared to change and adapt to take on your opponents,\" Mr Turnbull said.\nDefence Minister Marise Payne said the project not only provided Australian troops with improved protection but it would also sustain at least 170 jobs.\n\"The fact that it is a lighter vehicle than the traditional Bushmaster, the fact that it has a degree of mobility in very high-risk areas and has a significant degree of blast and ballistic protection for our serving members means that it should be very attractive on the international market,\" she said.\n\"We will work closely with Australian defence industry to make the most of those opportunities wherever and whenever we can,\" she said.\nI was pleased to take the #Hawkei submission to the NSC some months back, at which point it was approved #auspol pic.twitter.com/yZegzN8h5E\n— Kevin Andrews (@kevinandrewsmp) October 4, 2015 Mr Andrews who was dumped by Mr Turnbull in a post-leadership-coup reshuffle however said he was the one who got the approval from cabinet's powerful national security commitee for the project in a series of tweets.\n\"I was pleased to take the Hawkei submission to the NSC [national security committee] some months back at which point it was approved,\" Mr Andrews said.\nMr Andrews took a swipe on being dumped from the ministry after the September leadership coup saying it would not assist the \"stability of the defence force in Australia and its leadership\".\nUpgraded protection The Hawkei weighs seven tonnes and provides upgraded protection from landmines, roadside bombs and gunfire.\nIt can carry up to six soldiers, achieve a top speed of 110km/h and has a range of more than 1000 kilometres.\nThe locally-developed Hawkei was named as preferred tenderer two years ago after defence was dissatisfied with earlier vehicles developed in a joint project with the US.\nThe Bushmaster has been exported to The Netherlands and Britain.\nSpeaking before the official announcement, Labor leader Bill Shorten said \"big defence contracts\" should stay in Australia.\n\"Ideally they should be built and... the money should be spent in Australia,\" he said.\n\"We want make sure that we have the best quality equipment for our service people, but we want to make sure that – all things being equal – the money gets spent in Australia.\"\nThales Australia chief executive Chris Jenkins described the Hawkei as a \"highly-capable vehicle which will serve the country well\".\n\"We want to thank the many companies in Australia and overseas [who] have been with us on this long journey and who have played a significant role in shaping the Hawkei and contributing to its success,\" Mr Jenkins said.\nThe contract involves the delivery of 1100 vehicles and 1000 trailers with a 3½-year production phase to begin from mid-2017 and the first deliveries to begin towards the end of 2017.\n​", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016", "https://twitter.com/kevinandrewsmp/status/650796203957841920", "https://twitter.com/@primroseriordan", "http://t.co/yZegzN8h5E", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hawkei?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:03:36.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
