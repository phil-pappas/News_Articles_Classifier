That is a big change from the primaries in August, when accusations of fraud were rampant and many polling places were closed because of flooding and rain.\nAn estimated 32 million Argentines were eligible to vote in Sunday's presidential election. Voting is obligatory, but there are many exceptions, such as citizens over 70 not being required to participate.\nThe South American country still uses paper ballots, meaning many polling places nationwide must count votes manually. Initial official results are were expected until 11 p.m. local time, and voting officials have warned it could be several days before a victor can be declared.\nNone of the major candidates reported any irregularities in voting.\n5:20 p.m.\nAs polls close in Haiti, the head of the Organization of American States' 125-member observer mission says the country appears to be \"moving in the right direction\" with its elections.\nCelso Amorim offered few specifics about why he is giving a positive assessment but voting has been relatively orderly across the nation of some 10 million people, although there were some signs of confusion and logistical problems.\nHaitians are choosing between 54 presidential hopefuls and a slew of legislative and municipal candidates they hope will lift the nation out of chronic poverty and turbulence.\n2:00 P.M.\nThe continuing appeal of former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is on display as he votes in the country's capital.\nThousands of people turned out to show support as he arrived at a voting center near his house in Tabarre with his favored presidential candidate, Maryse Narcisse .\nThe crowd chanted, \"Aristide is our blood!\" as people pushed each other for a view.\nHe smiled and waved at supporters and urgent them to vote for his Lavalas party.\nAristide campaigned with Narcisse last week. It was a surprise appearance by the former leader who returned to Haiti in 2011 after seven years in exile following his ouster in a violent rebellion in 2004.\nStill some of his loyalists said Sunday they're backing another candidate, Moise Jean Charles . It's a sign of how his movement has splintered.\n1:45 p.m.\nThe future of President Cristina Fernandez is one of the biggest questions in Argentina today. The 62-year-old leader is barred from running for a third term, but only added to the mystery when asked about it while voting Sunday.\nIn her words, \"I'll do what I always do,\" and used the word \"militar,\" which can mean serve or work but has the added connotation of an activist.\nFernandez's chosen successor is front-runner Daniel Scioli , the governor of the Buenos Aires province. Many Argentines believe that if Scioli wins, Fernandez will continue to call the shots from behind the scenes, as his government will include many Fernandez loyalists.\nScioli bristles at such suggestions, pointing to his long career in politics which included a stint as vice president to Nestor Kirchner , Fernandez's predecessor and late husband.\n12:25 p.m.\nA polarized Argentina is selecting a successor to President Cristina Fernandez on Sunday, and undecided voters are key to the race.\nAmong those waiting to the last minute is Anai Roy , a 20-year-old college student. She says she still hasn't decided who to vote for as she goes into a polling place in Buenos Aires.\nIn her words, \"I'll decide who I vote for when I'm inside.\"\nDaniel Scioli is the anointed successor Fernandez and he goes into the election with about a 10 point lead in the polls.\nTo win, a candidate needs least 45 percent of the vote or 40 percent and a 10-point spread over the nearest competitor. Short of that, there will be a runoff in November between the top two candidates.\n11:30 a.m.\nColombian President Juan Manuel Santos says he hopes Sunday's vote is the final time his countrymen vote with an armed conflict underway.\nHe made the comment while casting his own vote. It's a bit of promotion for Cuba-based peace talks his government is holding with rebels — negotiations that some critics bitterly oppose.\nThe presidency isn't at stake in the vote, but key mayoral and gubernatorial posts are.\nThe most important is in the capital, Bogota. There polls show 61-year-old economist Enrique Penalosa ahead. The former mayor has been campaigning on a bicycle. He's been leading the Liberal Party 's Rafael Pardo and two other candidates.\n10:50 a.m.\nGuatemalans are choosing a president amid political upheaval that forced the last elected leader from office.\nInsurance salesman Alexander Pereira was the first to vote Sunday at one polling station.\nHe says that \"the important thing is that the next government avoids corruption.\"\nComedian and political outsider Jimmy Morales is leading in most polls, ahead of former first lady Sandra Torres .\nFormer President Otto Perez Molina was forced to resign as he was jailed on corruption charges following mass street protests.\n10:25 a.m.\nHaitian voters have begun choosing between more than 50 presidential candidates, and the process generally has been orderly so far this morning.\nThere are some early signs of confusion, though.\nAt a voting center in Port-au-Prince's Martissant slum, an elections supervisor yelled at dozens of people trying to force their way in: \"No voting two times!\"\nPeople shouted back that they were being prevented from voting once.\nAt a polling center in the Petionville neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, police gave the unruliest people in line short zaps with a Taser as brief scuffles broke out.\nResults aren't expected before late November. And with so many candidates, a Dec. 27 runoff between the top two finishers seems inevitable.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:41:50.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
