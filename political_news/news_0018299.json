A tragedy is the mums and dads who never came home from work that day. A tragedy is people jumping from the towers after the planes hit. \n\"My friends, we cannot let that man inflict his security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating ideology on the country we love.\" \nMr Corbyn faced criticism during the leadership campaign over remarks made in the wake of the 2011 killing of the al Qaida chief by US special forces that it was a \"tragedy\" that he had been assassinated rather than put on trial. \nOn Iranian TV in 2011, Mr Corbyn complained that there had been \"no attempt whatsoever that I can see to arrest him and put him on trial, to go through that process\". Promoted stories \nHe went on: \"This was an assassination attempt, and is yet another tragedy, upon a tragedy, upon a tragedy. \n\"The World Trade Centre was a tragedy, the attack on Afghanistan was a tragedy, the war in Iraq was a tragedy. Tens of thousands of people have died. Torture has come back on to the world stage, been canonised virtually into law by Guantanamo and Bagram. \n\"Can't we learn some lessons from this? Are we just going to sink deeper and deeper? \n\"The next stage will be an attempted assassination on Gaddafi and so it will go on. This will just make the world more dangerous and worse and worse and worse.\" \nIn further attacks on the opposition, Mr Cameron turned his fire on Richard Murphy, an economist advising Mr Corbyn. \nThe Prime Minister said: \"His book is actually called The Joy of Tax. I've read it. It's got 64 positions - and they're all wrong. \n\"This is actually serious. I tell you: our party's success in growing our economy and winning the economic arguments has never been more vital. \n\"Nothing less than the security of every single family in our country depends on it.\" \nTurning to what makes him \"angry\", Mr Cameron added: \"It's not just that their arguments are wrong, it's the self-righteous way they make them. \n\"The deficit-deniers, who go around saying we're hurting the poor. Hang on a second. \n\"Who gets hurt when governments lose control of spending and interest rates go through the roof? \nWho gets hurt when you waste money on debt interest and have to cut the NHS? Who gets hurt when taxes go up and businesses start firing rather than hiring? \n\"No - not the rich, it's poor people, working people. Yes, the very people Labour claim to be for. Share article \n\"Well let's just remember: Labour ideas don't help the poor, they hurt the poor. That's right, Labour: you're not for working people, but hurting people. \n\"If you want a lecture about poverty, ask Labour. If you want something done about it, come to us, the Conservatives.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:39:14.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
