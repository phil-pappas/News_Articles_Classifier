Four-in-10 Republicans surveyed (40 percent) now said that it is better for their party to run both branches, compared to just 24 percent in 2014. Just 26 percent of Republicans said it is better to have different parties controlling, while 30 percent said it made no difference to them.\nBy comparison, Democrats remained essentially unchanged from last year, 43 percent expressing a desire to control both branches, while 47 percent answered in the same way last year. Less than two in ten Democrats (17 percent) said split control was ideal, while 35 percent said it made no difference.\nA plurality of independents (45 percent), meanwhile, said it makes no difference whether one or two parties control Congress or the White House. It's a slight increase from last year, when 39 percent said it made no difference.\n2016\nLife in top tier tests Rubio By Daniel Strauss\nHistorically, the party whose president is in power has favored consolidating control between both Congress and the White House. During the presidency of George W. Bush, 45 percent of Republicans supported their party having control of both, compared to 18 percent who wanted different parties in control, while Barack Obama's presidency has seen an average of 42 percent of Democrats backing control of both, with just 15 percent wanting the other party in control of Congress. It should be noted that in both parties and in both cases, a greater share said that it made no difference to them.\nOverall, just 24 percent of Americans preferred divided government, keeping in line with historical trends over the last dozen years, while 33 percent favor the same party and 38 percent saying, again, that it makes no difference.\nThe poll was conducted Sept. 9-13 via landlines and cellphones, surveying 1,025 adults nationwide with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.gallup.com/poll/186089/republicans-prefer-one-party-government.aspx?g_source=Politics&g_medium=newsfeed&g_campaign=tiles"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:04:58.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
