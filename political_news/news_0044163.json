(Patrick Semansky | The Associated Press) Comments \nWASHINGTON (AP) â€” Jim Webb's campaign says he is considering leaving the race for the Democratic nomination and running for president as an independent. \nThe former Virginia senator's campaign says in a statement that he'll \"discuss his candidacy, the campaign and his views of the political parties\" during a press conference Tuesday. \nDuring the first Democratic debate last week Webb complained repeatedly about how little time he had to answer questions. He said Thursday he felt the debate had been \"rigged in terms of who was going to get the time on the floor.\" \nFormer secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton is the frontrunner in the race for the Democratic nomination, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in second place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:06:37.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
