The Prime Minister will buy and wear the poppy on Thursday, the penultimate day of the visit by Chinese president Xi Jinping, even though the flower has an unfortunate significance for China.\nThe poppy is a reminder of the Opium Wars between China and Britain in the 19th century.\nMr Cameron has already been accused of offending China by wearing a poppy on his lapel during a visit to the country in 2010.\nMr Xi has welcomed Britain's advances\nWhen asked by Sky News whether he would wear the poppy, Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said: \"He's not going to be swayed by the Chinese president being in town.\n\"He will follow the usual process he does when he purchases his poppy.\"\nMr Xi arrives in Britain on Monday for a four-day state visit, which will include a state banquet at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday.\nThe visit has already been mired by controversy over the country's human rights record. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had threatened to raise the issue with the president at the banquet if he was not given an audience at a separate meeting.\nChina's UK ambassador warned Mr Corbyn the visit was not designed for a discussion about human rights.\nLiu Xiaoming told the Andrew Marr show: \"You think (the) Labour Party will raise this issue at a state banquet? I don’t think so. I think the president is here for co-operation, for partnership. He is not here for debate about human rights.\"\nJust hours ahead of Mr Xi's arrival, campaigners set up a protest against Chinese investment in the proposed Hinkley nuclear power station. An announcement is expected during Mr Xi's visit on the deal with a final decision on the new plant.\nLast month George Osborne unveiled a £2bn Government guarantee to secure Chinese backing for the EDF Hinkley Point C plant.\nCampaigners say it would be a \"bad investment\".\n:: China Growth Slows To Lowest Levels Since 2009 \nConcerns over Chinese investment in Britain’s nuclear sector have been raised by the intelligence services.\nAccording to a report in The Times on Monday, spies are expected to examine the computer systems used at the plants built by Chinese firms amid fears there could be a threat to national security.\nMr Osborne has recently visited China to drum up support for a number of projects including High Speed Rail and nuclear power.\nMr Xi's visit has been hailed by David Cameron as the start of a \"golden era\" for British and Chinese relations.\nMr Xi, in turn, has welcomed the Government's advances as the \"western country that is most open to China\" as a \"visionary and strategic choice\".\nIt has also been announced that Jack Ma, founder of the company known as China's answer to eBay and thought to be the richest man in the country, has joined a panel of business figures to advise Mr Cameron on business opportunities in China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:20:18.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
