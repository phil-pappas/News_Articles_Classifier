Gov. Andrew Cuomo came to Genesee County for the announcement, joining leaders of the company, Greater Rochester Enterprise Inc. and Genesee County Economic Development Center.“This $700 million investment is an enormous vote of confidence in the Upstate economy and sends the message that there is opportunity in every corner of this state.” Cuomo said in a statement. “Today’s announcement is an example of how we are combining this region’s natural strengths with our vision to develop New York’s entrepreneurial future and make the Empire State a true leader in developing the clean energy technologies of tomorrow.” Construction of the 130,000 square-foot facility is slated to begin no later than the second quarter of 2016 and is expected to be completed in 2017, officials said. It will require two phases during which the company will create at least 600 new, full-time jobs over the next five years. “STAMP, the site of this expansion, is strategically located between Buffalo and Rochester, which enables 1366 Technologies to draw on the highly-skilled and talented workforce available in our region,” said Mark Peterson, president and CEO of GRE. “1366 Technologies’ decision to expand its operations here not only marks the largest business attraction success story in our organization’s history, but it also brings two great cities even closer together, strengthening our efforts to make Upstate New York a hot-bed for high-tech development.\" The company said it plans to ramp up quickly to employ 300 people. 1366 Technologies aims to deliver solar at the cost of coal, officials explained. The company combines technology with lean manufacturing processes to make a new class of silicon wafers, the building blocks of solar cells, at a fraction of today’s cost. “The facility in Bedford, Mass. was our proving ground. New York brings us to commercial scale. The technology is ready and 1366 is squarely positioned to lead in an industry undergoing rapid global growth,” said Frank van Mierlo, CEO of 1366 Technologies. “We are extremely proud to become part of the Upstate New York community and are committed to the region’s vibrant future.” To encourage 1366 Technologies to invest and establish operations in New York, the Cuomo administration offered incentives through various state and local resources including Empire State Development Corp.; New York State Energy Research and Development Authority; New York State Homes and Community Renewal; New York Power Authority; and Genesee County Industrial Development Agency. In September 2011, 1366 was also issued a $150 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy to build a commercial-scale manufacturing facility.
