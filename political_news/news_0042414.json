Bobby Jindal has improved his Iowa polling, rising from 4 percent support in August to 6 percent support in September, according to a poll released Sunday (Oct. 5) by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal.\nThe poll, which was conducted after the second GOP debate on CNN, shows Jindal tied for fifth place with U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio in the field of 17 Republicans vying for the party's nomination. The three tied for fifth are polling behind Donald Trump (24 percent), Ben Carson (19 percent), Carly Fiorina (8 percent) and Jeb Bush (7 percent).\nPundits noted Sunday that the polling data appear to be the best news for Jindal out of the field of candidates because of his steady improvement. He was registering at 1 percent when pollsters for Marist University asked about him in July.\n\"You'd say here, that maybe it's Bobby Jindal that has to feel the best about this,\" said Chuck Todd, the moderator of NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Above 5 percent -- somewhere, being Iowa, that's good news for him.\"\nIn a separate poll of potential Republican voters in New Hampshire, Jindal is still struggling to break 5 percent. He's pegged at 3 percent in that poll, but Jindal has by far spent much more time focusing on Iowa.\nYou can read the NBC News/Wall Street Journal Iowa poll conducted by Marist University here. It included interviews with 431 Republican voters in Iowa between Sept. 23 and Sept. 30. The margin of error was plus or minus 4.7 percent.\n. . . . . .
