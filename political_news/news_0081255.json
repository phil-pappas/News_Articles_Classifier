Daniel Webster for speaker, several lawmakers said following a Wednesday afternoon meeting -- a blow to Rep. Kevin McCarthy in his bid for the position. Chaffetz: I don't expect to win speakership \nUtah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz is running for House speaker -- but even he doesn't think he'll win in a key vote later this week. \n\"I want to fight to win, but at the same time, it's clear that Kevin McCarthy has the majority of support within our... House blocks attempt to end Benghazi... \nThe decision is a major rebuke to the House leadership under Speaker John Boehner, and McCarthy, the current majority leader looking to win the speaker's job. \nRep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said it took several votes to determine the winner of the endorsement. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, had \"some support,\" McCarthy had \"no support\" and Webster had the most support, he said. \nThursday, the Republican conference will vote on who to nominate as their speaker candidate. But that vote only requires a majority -- and the crucial hurdle for McCarthy will be whether he can get 218 votes on the floor when the full House votes Oct. 29. \n\"It's a healthy debate we'll have a vote on the floor and in conference tomorrow,\" McCarthy said Wednesday. \"Just like going through any other primary - (it) will be the power of ideas.\" \nPressâ€Žed about not getting to 218 on Thursday, McCarthy replied, \"You don't need to get to 218 until you get to the floor.\" \nBut if the Freedom Caucus maintains its unity through the floor vote, it could force McCarthy -- or the eventual winner - through multiple ballots for the first time in nearly a century. \nIn a statement, the group emphasized its members desire for change. \n\"It is clear that our constituents will simply not accept a continuation of the status quo, and that the viability of the Republican Party depends on whether we start listening to our voters and fighting to keep our promises,\" the group said. \"We accordingly believe that, under the present circumstances and without significant changes to Conference leadership and process, Rep. Daniel Webster would be best equipped to earn back the trust of the American people as Speaker of the House.\" \nRep. Matt Salmon promised \"over 30 votes\" would go to Webster. \n\"Our intention is to go all the way to floor unless real changes are made to how the House is run,\" Labrador said. \"Right now our intention is to stick together all the way to the floor.\" \nDecision not unanimous \nWebster has been considered a long-shot candidate for the position. In January's Speaker election, he only got 12 votes in his bid to unseat Boehner. \nChaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (whose hearing room the caucus met in to make its choice), announced his own longshot bid for speaker over the weekend, though he as called himself an \"underdog\" in the race and spoken of McCarthy's popularity. \nAs he entered the House floor for a vote, he was asked by CNN for his reaction to the House Freedom Caucus not to endorse him. \n\"I need to talk to them. Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Chaffetz said without stopping. \nThe group was not unanimous in its vote, Labrador said, but did meet the more-than 80% threshold. The caucus' rules state that if 80% of the members agree on a position, the entire group will stand behind it. \"He wasn't my first choice but I promised all along I'd go along with the group,\" Salmon said of Webster. \nThe caucus met for nearly two hours before reaching its decision. \nAlready, however, there appears to be some division coming out of the meeting. Not all Freedom Caucus members appear to be on the same page for taking this fight to the floor. \n\"I don't think we've committed to anything on the floor yet,\" Rep. David Brat, R-Virginia, told reporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:18:17.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
