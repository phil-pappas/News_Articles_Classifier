Haley and got this response:\nOctober 2, 2015\nDear Ms. Smith,\nThank you for your recent message to Governor Haley’s office regarding refugee resettlement. The refugee resettlement program is established under federal law and, before they enter the United States, refugees are processed and screened by both the United States Department of State and the United States Department of Homeland Security . A letter from Governor Haley to the Chairman of the Spartanburg County Legislative Delegation regarding the refugee program can be found here, and the South Carolina Department of Social Services page related to the program can be found here.\nIf you would like to discuss this issue further, please do not hesitate to contact me at 803.734.0324.\nThank you again for you message and interest in this issue.\nSincerely,\nDavid Glaccum\nPolicy Advisor\nOffice of the Governor\nThat certainly contradicts Senator Jeff Sessions’ statement yesterday which we posted which detailed :\nWe do not have adequate resources or records and will not conduct any meaningful investigation of each of the thousands of applicants.\nWe do not have access to any Syrian government database to learn the backgrounds of these refugee applicants.\nWho do you believe? Haley’s spokesperson, or Senator Jeff Sessions, who had face to face time yesterday questioning four Administration officials responsible for administering America’s refugee programs?\nTea Party news on Twitter Subscribe to our Tea Party news RSS feed", "external_links": ["http://www.spartanburgteaparty.org//feed/feed://beforeitsnews.com/rss/0000000000000104.xml", "http://b4in.net/img/rss_sm.png", "http://twitter.com/TeaPartyBIN", "http://www.spartanburgteaparty.org/2015/10/01/sen-sessions-statement-after-todays-refugee-hearing/"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:37:44.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
