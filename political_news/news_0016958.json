Paul Ryan (R-WI) for Speaker of the House should think twice when it comes to passing President Obama's trade agenda, as Ryan was one of the strongest advocates to grant Obama fast-track trade authority under the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which only gives Congress an up or down vote – without issuing any amendments – on a trade deal. Earlier this summer, Breitbart News reported about the secrecy and controversy surrounding Obama's pending trade agenda, which includes the recently finalized Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), as well as the Trades in Services Act (TiSA) and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Breitbart News exposed the secretive nature of the trade deal, highlighting that it was being kept in a secured room on Capitol Hill. The press and public are not able review the list of the members of Congress that actually read the deal prior to voting on it , and in fact, members of Congress are not allowed to even bring their staff with them or take notes out of the room .", "external_links": ["http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/10/obamatrade-secrecy-log-of-which-members-of-congress-actually-read-bill-in-secret-room-also-private/", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/22/republican-congressman-calls-on-u-s-trade-representative-to-release-trade-deal/", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/11/paul-ryan-likely-strong-arm-obama-trade-deal-speaker-house/"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:15:53.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
