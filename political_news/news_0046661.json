Both Mississippi senators Roger Wicker and Thad Cochran, Republicans, voted for the bill. The House of Representatives approved a similar bill in July. “We have a responsibility to protect American families,” said Wicker in a statement. “Violent criminals who are in our country illegally should not be encouraged to find refuge in so-called ‘sanctuary cities.’ This legislation would have been an important step toward preventing crimes like the one recently highlighted in San Francisco. There should be consequences for undermining the enforcement of our immigration laws.” NewsMS Posted October 21, 2015 - 7:01 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
