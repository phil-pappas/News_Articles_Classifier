Walsh reacted coolly to sharp rhetoric let loose by Wynn Resorts chief Steve Wynn on a conference call, where he said the legal battle he’s engaged in with City Hall is “laughable” and comedic “in a perverse way.”\nWynn told analysts this week that Boston is unwilling to accept regulators’ decision to award the license for the $1.7 billion Everett casino.\n“It may sound laughable at this point and in a perverse way it is a comedy,” Wynn said. “Boston ... for some reason is unwilling to except the decision of [regulators] gracefully and keeps trying to use various tactics to say that we are in Boston, not in Everett.”\nWalsh yesterday said he didn’t see anything funny about the situation.\n“This is a serious issue for the people of Boston and I know it is a serious issue for Mr. Wynn as well,” he said. “We have a lawsuit going, but we’re still going to work to see where we can find some middle ground.”\nBoston has been embroiled in the ugly legal battle with Wynn for months, suing the state’s gaming commission to stop the project and also asking a court to put a stop to a state environmental certificate approved last month that the Las Vegas casino mogul needed to start construction.\nWynn has fired back with a lawsuit of his own, accusing unknown defendants of defaming the company by providing subpoenas to the media related to the city’s lawsuit.\nThe heated legal maneuvers aside, Wynn told analysts the Everett casino project is moving forward and expected to open in 2018.\n“It did cause us delays,” Wynn said, “but happily they’re pretty much behind us now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:00:13.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
