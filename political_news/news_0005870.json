Kevin McCarthy’s bid for speaker of the House of Representatives: \nIf, as expected, Kevin McCarthy is chosen to succeed John Boehner as speaker of the House of Representatives, it should be good news for McCarthy’s home state of California. It can’t hurt to have your own in high places. \nBeyond that, we’ll see. An optimist would say Rep. McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, might have a useful perspective on the needs of his party since he has seen up-close the damage hardliners did to Republican power here. \nLast year, when he ascended to the position of House majority leader, it was hoped by those same optimists that McCarthy would be open to pushing through some form of balanced immigration reform since life in an agricultural district has given him a practical grasp of the economics of the issue. \nWe’re still waiting. \nNow the question is whether Americans looking at the prospect of Speaker Kevin McCarthy should expect him to be the solution to the problems in Washington, D.C., that have Congress wallowing in a 15 percent national approval rate. \nDon’t hold your breath. \nOf course, becoming the favorite to win the House-wide election for speaker is not the achievement of a lightweight. McCarthy, 50, has big-league political skills. But could be considered damning with faint praise. \nAs Associated Press congressional reporter Andrew Taylor noted pointedly: McCarthy “has risen to the upper reaches of House leadership mostly on the basis of his people skills and political smarts rather than his policy chops.” \nAnd therein could lie the problem. \nHe is a prodigious capitol networker - first in Sacramento, where he was chosen as Republican Assembly leader as a freshman, and Washington, where he joined the House leadership in his second term. There is no doubt he is a political climber. The face of politics for politics’ sake. \nWhat he hasn’t been - maybe he just hasn’t had time to be - is much of a legislator. His official, online biography doesn’t even credit him with a single specific bill. \nThis may not make McCarthy worse than many in Congress, in fact, it doesn’t. But it also doesn’t necessarily make him better for the nation. \nBoehner was pushed out by arch-conservatives whose obstructionism has hurt the GOP and the governing process. McCarthy will need at least some support from the “Freedom Caucus” to become speaker and to do anything productive once he gets there. In exchange for that the hard-line bloc will expect him to do their bidding and will likely be furious if he doesn’t.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:58:01.108+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
