This is in addition to salary increases that some MBIE employees received in September during the remuneration round. \n“Managers would also have the opportunity to recommend additional increases, in addition to the minimum guaranteed two per cent,” says Ms Wareham. \nMBIE believes the offer put to the PSA is a fair, reasonable and sustainable offer because: \n• a two per cent increase is greater than current inflation levels \n• all members have the potential to receive an additional discretionary increase \n• providing a guaranteed increase to employees who are meeting performance expectations matches the PSA’s claim for a salary increase for all members – a significant concession by MBIE to help both parties reach agreement \n“The PSA have not yet issued a strike notice for MBIE’s essential services. However, based on the information they have provided to the media, we believe the disruption to MBIE service delivery, and to daily operations, will be minimal and contingency plans are in place,” says Ms Wareham. \nThis means all immigration at airports around New Zealand will remain open and adequately staffed during any industrial action. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:54:01.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
