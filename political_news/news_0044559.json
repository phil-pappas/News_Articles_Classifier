X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nParents should consider buying their daughters gym membership and a pair of trainers for Christmas, a Conservative MP has said. \nNigel Evans insisted mothers and fathers have a \"huge responsibility\" when it comes to encouraging more women and girls to get involved in sport. \nBut the MP for Ribble Valley conceded his present suggestion might not make parents the most popular people in the house on Christmas morning. \nSports minister Tracey Crouch said she would not \"dictate\" what parents should buy for their children, adding they should be as \"supportive as possible\" when their daughters want to get involved in sport.
