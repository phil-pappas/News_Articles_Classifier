But his performance was widely panned, prompting questions about whether he will continue his campaign. \nChafee, a former Republican who became an independent before joining the Democratic party, has said he would carry on his campaign as long as he can keep raising important issues. \nChafee raised just $11,000 in the most recent fundraising quarter. Most of his money has come from more than $360,000 that he has loaned his campaign.
