Cardno said its independent expert, Lonergan Edwards & Associates, valued the stock between $3.74 and $4.13 per share.\n\"The offer significantly undervalues Cardno, does not provide an adequate premium for control of Cardno, and is assessed as neither fair nor reasonable by the independent expert,\" Cardno said today.\nCardno said Crescent's intentions were not clear, whereas it was taking action to improve its recent performance. The company yesterday said it was planning to offload up to $90 million worth of assets as part of moves to get its financial house in order as it continues to fight headwinds in the oil and gas sector.\n\"Crescent is attempting to obtain control without having to make a full takeover for Cardno, with potentially adverse implications for non-Crescent shareholders,\" the company said.\nCardno yesterday said divesting businesses would bring in between $50 and $90 million to free up cash for \"strategic deployment\", which may include a share buyback, further acquisitions or a debt reduction. The company also found $20m of annualised savings through back office efficiencies.\nCardno has been facing numerous headwinds and has seen its share price decline from around $8 at the end of 2012 to $2.95 yesterday, after bottoming out at $2.30 in September.\n“It is no accident that Crescent has launched their offer at this time,” Cardno chairman John Marlay said.\n“Cardno’s share price was trading at close to five year lows reflecting, amongst other factors, the very challenging market conditions being experienced by many operators in the sector,\" he said.\nThe company has said it is likely to book a $3m to $6m hit to its pre-tax profits this year relating to the corporate costs of responding to an offer by Crescent Capital Investments.\n\"“The board believes that, despite the recent decline in performance, Cardno is a good business in terms of the quality of its clients, its professional services capability and the expertise of its people,\" Cardno said.\nCardno recently posted a loss of $145.17m in the year to June 30. The result included a post-tax non-cash impairment charge of $195.5m, associated with the reduced carrying value of Cardno's business in the US and the write down of part of the Ecuadorian business, which is for sale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:21:51.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
