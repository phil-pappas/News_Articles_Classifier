Rabbi Teitelbaum condemned Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for attacking President Barack Obama during the prime minister’s speech to Congress. \nLast year prior to the Gaza war, three youths were kidnapped and murdered by Arab terrorists. The rabbi followed the tragic news by questioning how much blame can be placed on the parents for sending their children away to study in the first place. \nDespite this, he sticks by the same principal in which the first Satmar Rabbi Joel practiced: prayer. \nWhen there is prevalent danger of Jewish individuals in Israel, the community must come and pray for their safety.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:34:52.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
