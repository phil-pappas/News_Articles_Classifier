Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., the chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, walks into a hearing room in September to interview a former aide to Hillary Clinton.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Oct. 13, 2015 | 6:34 p.m. EDT + More The Republican-led committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacks is facing an existential crisis, but after months of attacks from Hillary Clinton and Democrats about its partisan nature, the most substantial threats to its credibility have come recently from within the GOP ranks.\nCompounding the headache caused by Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's comments linking the investigation with Clinton's fall in the presidential polls, a former Republican staffer over the weekend accused the committee of focusing its attention exclusively on the former secretary of state – seemingly bolstering longstanding criticism of the panel in a way that could undercut its ongoing efforts.\nRELATED\nTrey Gowdy, Benghazi Committee Chairman, Denies Retirement Report \"There is a part of the public that looks at a congressional investigation and assumes it will be political,\" says Eleanor Hill, who was staff director for the bipartisan, bicameral Sept. 11 investigation and now advises on congressional investigations as a partner with King & Spalding law firm.\n\"When you have allegations like the ones that have come out, I think that strengthens the impression,\" she says.\nThe latest charges come from Maj. Bradley Podliska, a former Air Force Reserve officer who was dismissed by the committee in June. He told CNN on Sunday that he lost his job in part because he complained the probe appeared to be politically motivated.\n\"I knew that we needed to get to the truth to the victims' families. And the victims' families, they deserve the truth – whether or not Hillary Clinton was involved, whether or not other individuals were involved,\" Podliska said. \"The victims' families are not going to get the truth and that's the most unfortunate thing about this.\"\nCommittee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., has strongly denied Podliska's assertions, which by Monday included allegations that Gowdy had broken federal law by disclosing information from mediation and counseling related to Podliska's employment dispute.\n\"He was a lousy employee and that was evidenced by the fact that he mishandled classified information, and he wouldn't do what his supervisors instructed him to do,\" Gowdy said on MSNBC, saying Podliska's allegations were \"a damn lie.\"\nClinton's camp, already on the offensive after McCarthy's comments, piled on over the weekend.\n\"This Republican whistleblower's account from inside the Benghazi Committee may provide the most definitive proof to date that this taxpayer-funded investigation has been a partisan sham from the start,\" said Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign.\nRep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee's top Democrat and a frequent critic of his Republican counterparts' work, said the accusations proved the committee was a witch hunt.\n\"They show – from the inside – that Kevin McCarthy's stark admission was true: Republicans have been abusing millions of taxpayer dollars for the illegitimate purpose of damaging Hillary Clinton's bid for president,\" Cummings said in a statement. \"These are extremely serious whistleblower charges by one of Chairman Gowdy's own handpicked investigators.\"\nThe New York Times on Monday reported that the committee's priorities appeared to have shifted over time, suggesting that the investigation had become focused on Clinton's email account to the exclusion of its initial plans to interview Defense, intelligence and White House officials and to hold hearings on larger issues related to U.S. presence in Libya. GOP staffers denied any change in focus and told the newspaper that Clinton's handling of State Department emails on a private server has complicated their efforts to collect all relevant information in a timely manner.\nRELATED\nPundits React to Kevin McCarthy, Hillary Clinton and Benghazi But Podliska's account of GOP committee members holding weekly \"wine Wednesday\" gatherings and of staffers forming a \"gun-buying club\" at which they discussed their firearms on committee time may contribute to the perception that Republicans lengthened the investigation for political purposes.\nOn the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate, and just nine days before Clinton is scheduled to testify before the committee, the Podliska disclosures and the fallout from McCarthy's unforced error threaten to undercut the committee's credibility.\nHill says Gowdy's committee failed to compensate for the extreme partisan environment that would coincide with a presidential election campaign.\n\"If you are going to do an investigation that has political overtones in an election year, you have to do one that's fair and that's balanced,\" she says.\nMajor special investigations such as the ones formed to investigate the Iran-Contra affair or the 9/11 attacks bent over backwards to do their work in a bipartisan fashion, to ensure their final result would stand up to scrutiny.\nTevi Troy, a former White House aide under President George W. Bush, said the Benghazi committee never had a chance.\n\"I don't believe this particular series of hearings could have played out much differently,\" Troy says. \"But the McCarthy comments made things much worse.\"\nBoth Troy and Hill agreed the committee could still salvage its work by ensuring both sides focus on asking substantive questions when Clinton comes to testify – particularly on questions of classification of information – and produce a final report that gives both sides a chance to weigh in.\nThey also have to prove the cost of the now 17 month-long investigation – which has cost more than $4.5 million – can be justified, given the number of other congressional investigations looking into the attacks.\n\"There could be credible findings coming out of it,\" Troy says. \"The question is whether or not they could be accepted as credible by the media and by the American public.\"\nTAGS: Congress Clinton, Hillary", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60th%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=GOP%20Delivers%20Self-Inflicted%20Wounds%20to%20Benghazi%20Committee", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/us/politics/clinton-emails-became-the-new-focus-of-benghazi-inquiry.html?_r=0", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60th%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60th%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/10/politics/benghazi-committee-investigation-political-hillary-clinton-brad-podliska-lawsuit/", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60th%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=GOP%20Delivers%20Self-Inflicted%20Wounds%20to%20Benghazi%20Committee", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60th%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe60th%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=GOP%20Delivers%20Self-Inflicted%20Wounds%20to%20Benghazi%20Committee&summary=A%20fired%20Republican%20staffer%20adds%20fuel%20to%20accusations%20the%20Benghazi%20committee%20is%20partisan%20in%20nature.&source=U.%20S.%20News"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:06:41.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
