The free, 12-week class offered by a local YMCA \"still sticks with me,\" says Neebe, adding that \"Tai Chi made me a lot more aware of my walking characteristics.\"\nHis doctor knew Neebe, an avid skier and hiker, previously fell and fractured his ankle. That put him at risk for another fall. That fall \"was frustrating and slowed me down,\" Neebe says. But he was lucky, confined to a boot for a few weeks. \"It could have been a lot worse,\" he admits.\nFalling is a huge problem for adults 65 and older: \"Every 13 seconds, an older adult is treated in an emergency department for a fall,\" says Dr. Debra Houry, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. \"Every 20 minutes an older adult dies from a fall.\"\nNeebe's internist, Frank Floyd, M.D., medical director at United Health Services ' Endwell primary care clinic, knows all too well the bad outcomes for patients. Years ago, Floyd's grandmother fractured her hip, and \"she never recovered from her injury from that fall,\" he says. Today, Floyd is vigilant in screening his older patients for falls risk.\n[ BROWSE: Best Hospitals for Geriatric Care ]\nFloyd's employer, the Binghamton, New York-based, 916-bed hospital and health care system UHS, is tackling an issue that has been akin to a hidden epidemic and one rarely touched by hospitals or health systems. Each year, one third of seniors fall, and falls are the leading cause of unintentional injury deaths among older adults.\nAnd in Broome County, where Binghamton is located, the prevalence of falls was off the charts – about the highest in the state – before the nonprofit UHS put in place an evidence-based strategy in 2012 to address them. \"Falls was top of the list\" of problems in the county, notes Claudia Edwards, director of the Broome County Health Department.\nWorking with the local health department and others in the community, UHS has played a key role in significantly reducing the falls rate in Broome County by 25 percent between 2010 and 2013. Since September 2012, UHS has screened nearly 17,500 older patients for falls, along with educating and referring or providing interventions to reduce patients' risk of falling. UHS saw hospitalizations and ER visits for fall-related fractures decline 12 percent across Broome County in 18 months following implementation. As a result of UHS' success, the CDC is expanding the program nationwide.\n\"Screening for the risk of the problem is such a crucial aspect of the whole process,\" notes Edwards, adding that \"it's not an easy process to pull this off.\"\nBut UHS has been able to pull it off. Falls are not an issue many hospitals and health care systems address. It's challenging, and under the traditional payment system there was no incentive to focus on fall prevention. Fixing people who had fallen is lucrative under fee-for-service medicine.\n\"The U.S. spends $34 billion a year on direct medical costs alone,\" Houry notes. \"Falls also result in significant medical costs and are among the 20 most costly medical conditions.\" Consider that in 2012, the average cost for a hospitalization for a fall in Broome County ran $23,136; the typical ED visit for a fall cost nearly $3,000.\n[ READ: Doctor Shortage: Who Will Take Care of the Elderly? ]\nWith the advent of Obamacare, the calculus on medical care has changed. The Affordable Care Act put a premium on prevention and lit a match to the traditional fee-for-service system. Instead, health insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, increasingly are putting hospitals at financial risk or creating incentives for institutions to keep people out of the hospital and avoid readmission. For example, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield has introduced a pay-for-performance incentive if 75 percent or more of UHS patients who need screening get it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:39:27.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
