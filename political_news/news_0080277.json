The president took to his national stage and said “somehow, this has become routine” and “we’ve become numb to this.” As WND reported , he then called for “common-sense legislation” to water down gun rights. \nBut as O’Reilly pointed: What about Chicago, the city with some of the toughest gun control laws yet highest gun-related violence rates? \n“You don’t even mention the carnage in Chicago,” he said, speaking directly to Obama. “You mention the individual things, like what happened in Oregon. But Chicago, it’s like it doesn’t even exist.” \nO’Reilly then chastised the president for failing to think of the self-defense needs of those who live in communities with limited or long-distance police forces. \nThis infallible argument for armed self-defense presents real stories of Americans fighting back against criminals – and surviving because they were armed. “America Fights Back: Armed Self-Defense In A Violent Age” is a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered if concealed carry can actually save and protect. \n“I have a right to protect myself because there are crazed animals like the guy in Oregon,” he said. “There are people like that who will come after innocent people for no reason. And you are going to deny me protection? If I live out in a rural Oregon [community] … where the nearest cop is 40 miles away? I can’t have a gun to protect my family?” \nO’Reilly then recommended the president to focus on criminal gun usage and consider 10-year minimum sentences for those who use firearms during the commission of crimes. \n“That’ll cut down on gun crime right away,” O’Reilly said. “But it will never stop the individual nuts.” \nHe also said, again speaking to Obama: “Let’s be honest here and stop politicizing” the issue.
