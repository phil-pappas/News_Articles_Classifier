This ability of the system to cope with fast variations in demand and/or generation is the system flexibility. The ENTSO-E Scenario Outlook & Adequacy Forecast (SO&AF) 2015 report provides for the first time information at Pan-European level about the potential lack of flexible generation in the expected power system operation, by use of residual load assessments. Residual load is characterized by very sharp ramps, and very diverse and unpredictable profiles for similar days. This represents a new challenge for the power system. Residual load is a useful indicator to show the flexibility and ramping needs for adequate power system operation. ENTSO-E analysis in the SOAF of the shows that the need for flexibility, in fact, is strictly correlated with the volume of RES ramps observed. Against this evidence, it is fundamental that the market design - and price signals in particular - enhance system flexibility via new investments and market actors' behaviours. Introducing balancing responsibility for all RES generators , as well as designing cost-reflective imbalance prices would be a decisive market factor to stimulate flexibility in a cost-efficient manner. Generators, including RES, would be incentivised to adjust their position in day-ahead and intraday markets, therefore reducing the need for greater TSOs reserves to deal with imbalances and uncertainty. distributed by This content was issued by ENTSO-E - European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity on the 2015-10-08 and was initially posted on www.entsoe.eu.
