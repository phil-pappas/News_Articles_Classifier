Charlie Baker is planning to testify at a public hearing on his proposal to let the state add up to a dozen new or expanded charter schools each year outside the existing cap in Massachusetts.\nThe Republican governor unveiled the bill last week and will try to persuade members of the overwhelmingly Democratic House and Senate to agree to the changes.\nBaker has said his bill would focus new charter school growth in districts that are performing in the bottom 25 percent statewide.\nBaker will offer testimony in favor of his bill at a hearing before the Legislature's Education Committee on Tuesday morning.\nMassachusetts Teachers Association President Barbara Madeloni has said Baker's bill would help create a two-tiered education system — one truly public and the other private, but financed with public dollars.\nBaker's bill would also let the schools give preference to high-need and low-income students, as well as students learning the English Language and those with learning disabilities.\nBaker, a long-time supporter of charter schools, has said the legislation will help give every child the opportunity for a high-quality education. The new or expanded schools he is proposing would not count against the current charter school cap of 120 schools.\nAbout 80 charter schools currently operate in Massachusetts.\nMore than 37,000 students were placed on waiting lists for charter schools for the 2015-16 school year.\nCritics like Madeloni said the proposal — which echoes the language of a proposed 2016 ballot question — could allow the state to add new charter schools each year until no district public schools remain.\nThey also say charter schools will to find ways to underserve those with the most needs and then use inflated claims of success to grab an ever-larger share of public education funding.\nBoston Mayor Martin Walsh also is planning to testify.\nA proposed 2016 ballot question that would allow the state to add 12 new charters schools outside the existing cap could strengthen Baker's hand in any negotiations with Democratic legislative leaders.\nThere is also a pending lawsuit by lawyers representing five Boston students aimed at lifting the charter school cap.\nOther bills to be heard by the committee would to create a moratorium on new charter schools, improve state reimbursements for charter schools, and ensure \"charter school transparency and public accountability.\"\nBaker said his bill would let charter schools use a weighted lottery system that provides additional weight to high-need and low-income students, as well as students within a particular geographic zone.\nThe bill would also let charter schools enter into voluntary agreements with districts to participate in district student enrollment systems that take into account parental preference. The legislation would create new opportunities for charters to partner with districts in turning around lowest-performing schools.\nThe first charter schools opened in Massachusetts in 1995.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:18:28.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
