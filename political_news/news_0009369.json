But a focus group of a \"cross-section\" of Florida voters on Fox News, conducted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz, showed that Bernie Sanders was the night's victor . Several of the voters described Sanders as \"strong,\" \"straightforward\" and \"for the people.\"\nAnother focus group conducted by the left-leaning, millennial-focused Fusion network also showed that Sanders \"was the most popular candidate among a group of young registered Democrats.\"\nMore from the Washington Examiner Bush prepares for general election fight with Clinton \"I would have taken her to task for that and if she wins the nomination and I win the nomination.\"\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 10/14/15 8:14 AM CNN's own post-debate focus group of voters in Nevada found the same result with a majority of participants saying Sanders won the debate.\nA separate Facebook user poll conducted by CNN asked users after the event, \"Who won the debate?\" An overwhelming majority, 75 percent, said Sanders.\nAn unscientific poll at the conservative Drudge Report website asked, \"Who won the first Dem debate?\" and got more than 4 million votes by Wednesday morning. More than half, 55 percent, said Sanders.\nBut political reporters and commentators came away from the debate with a different impression.\n\"By the end of Tuesday night's debate, Mrs. Clinton had seized every opening to try to accomplish her chief goal: re-establishing trust with Democrats who have come to doubt her honesty and political competence after months of difficulties and shifting policy positions,\" read a post-debate analysis by the New York Times.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Violence in Israel a story of Israeli retaliation for the press Many news reports on the actions of Israeli security forces downplay the violent acts of the Palestinians.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/14/15 9:00 AM NBC's \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd wrote on Twitter after the debate that Clinton \"was easily the most polished and prepped candidate on stage\" and said \"it wasn't even close\" in terms of who won.\nOn the next morning's edition of MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" each panelist and host declared Clinton the winner.\nA headline at the liberal Slate website said Clinton \"Won the CNN Debate With a Surprisingly Spectacular Performance.\"\nConservative radio host and writer Erick Erickson tweeted, \"I'm still amazed the other four candidates made Hillary Clinton come off as the likable, reasonable, responsible Democrat.\"\nRon Fournier, a columnist for the National Journal, was less generous in his analysis but he still saw Clinton as the winner.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Putin: U.S. has 'mush for brains' Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed America for its lack of cooperation in the sky over Syria.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/14/15 11:17 AM \"She won,\" Fournier wrote. \"She sur­vived and won with a per­form­ance that was as dis­hon­est as it was im­press­ive, that be­nefited from a friendly crowd and weak field.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:08:56.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
