Byrd-Bennett added in a written statement that she had “devoted my entire professional life to public education and, while there is no excusing or downplaying my misconduct, I believe I have done a lot of good, including in Chicago.”\nByrd-Bennett pleads guilty: ‘I am terribly sorry’\nBrown: Byrd-Bennett should save the apology, tell the truth about CPS corruption\nClaypool outlines steps to prevent another Byrd-Bennett scandal\nCPS approves more legal spending for Byrd-Bennett aides\nFeds: Byrd-Bennett said ‘tuition to pay and casinos to visit’ led to kickbacks\nShe entered her plea less than a week after a 43-page indictment revealed details of damning emails she and codefendants Gary Solomon and Thomas Vranas exchanged, beginning in 2012 before she even took the helm at the country’s third largest school district.\nByrd-Bennett’s family and friends filled an entire row of U.S. District Judge Edmond Chang’s courtroom, including her daughter, the sitting clerk of courts of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and the mother of the young twins who were to benefit from the scheme.\nStanding between her attorneys, Byrd-Bennett did not speak much during the 40-minute-long hearing, except to answer the judge’s questions. When asked how she wanted to plead, she said quietly, “I plead guilty.”\nAfterward, Byrd-Bennett kissed her daughter.\nSolomon, 47, of Wilmette, and Vranas, 34, of Glenview, also face counts of bribery and conspiracy to defraud the United States, and are due in court Wednesday afternoon.\nProsecutors said they would recommend a prison sentence for Byrd-Bennett of roughly seven and a half years — on the condition that she fulfills her promise to “fully and truthfully cooperate” with them, presumably at least against Solomon and Vranas. The judge won’t be bound by that recommendation at Byrd-Bennett’s sentencing hearing, though, and that day will not come until her cooperation is finished.\nThe wire fraud count Byrd-Bennett pleaded guilty to carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. Her punishment is likely to be lower than that. She was permitted to return home to suburban Cleveland, where she has been staying since stepping down from her $250,000-a-year job at CPS in April.\nByrd-Bennett, 66, admitted in her 21-page plea agreement that she steered CPS contracts to SUPES and Synesi in exchange for a cut of the gross revenues. She hid the agreement from CPS, and had Solomon submit a false termination letter saying she left the companies the day before CPS hired her as the district’s second in command.\nShe admitted introducing Synesi and CPS employees, tipping her hand on requests for proposals yet to be issued by the school district and persuading a vendor to be a SUPES sponsor in August 2012 while she was still chief education officer.\nShe also acknowledged that she planned to collect 10 percent of a $2.09 million no-bid contract awarded to SUPES by the school district in October 2012 the same day she was formally elevated to CEO.\nShe admitted she later sought a $225,000 settlement payment to SUPES and a $225,000 extension of that contract — both in January 2013. She also helped SUPES land a no-bid $20.5 million contract to train principals in June 2013, a month after she recommended closing 50 schools she said the district could not afford.\nMeanwhile, she expected Solomon and Vranas to funnel payments for her into funds for her twin grandsons, according to the plea agreement. Solomon allegedly told her each contained about $127,000 — her cut of the October 2012 contract.\nWhile Byrd-Bennett didn’t pocket any money, she said she expected to land a job with SUPES after she left CPS, as well as gain access to the funds set up for her grandchildren and a “signing bonus” worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. She also accepted basketball and baseball tickets, airplane tickets, meals and other personal items.\nFinally, in an email about the Chicago Executive Leadership Academy sent June 15, 2012, Byrd-Bennett told Solomon and Vranas, “I will work hard to get us this and expanded work.”\nProsecutors said they would dismiss the other 19 counts Byrd-Bennett faced, including those tied to emails like the one the grand jury said she sent Solomon on the first day of the historic 2012 Chicago teachers strike.\n“I have tuition to pay and casinos to visit (:” Byrd-Bennett allegedly wrote.\nWhen the hearing ended, Emanuel spokeswoman Kelley Quinn issued a statement that sought to distance her boss from his former hand-picked schools chief.\n“Today, Barbara Byrd-Bennett took responsibility for putting her own financial gain ahead of what was in the best interest of the children she pledged to serve,” Quinn wrote. “This continues to be a matter for the courts. The mayor and Chicago Public Schools’ leadership will continue to focus on our students, teachers and principals so that we can continue the progress that is being made in classrooms across the city, and enact further safeguards to help prevent this type of abuse from happening again.”\nCPS halted the $20.5 million SUPES deal in April after the grand jury investigation became public. The district had already paid all but about $7.7 million to Solomon and Vranas. They since have sold off parts of the three education-services companies they owned to Joseph Wise, who operates four charter schools in Chicago.\nThe parent group, Raise Your Hand, also renewed its calls for an elected school board to replace the appointed board that unanimously approved all the SUPES deals.\n“It’s another sad stain on our district, but the story here is larger than one corrupt individual, and highlights the need for a more transparent and accountable Board of Education,” they wrote.\nFormer Chicago Board of Education President David Vitale called Byrd-Bennett’s guilty plea “very sad for her” and said he was “very disappointed she got caught up in this, did what she did and hurt the district. It obviously has not helped the system.”\nBut Vitale said he has no regrets about having presided over a Board of Education that unanimously ratified the $20.5 million no-bid principal training contract at the center of the scandal. In fact, he argued that CPS got its money’s worth.\n“We had a commitment to provide professional development for principals. This was a contract that went through the purchasing process and was presented to us in an appropriate manner. The programs itself was, in fact, implemented. There were a couple of bumpy spots in the first year that were improved in Year Two,” Vitale said.\n“Different principals have different points of view about how good the program was. But, on balance, we got what we paid for. The whole thing was not a fraud. That’s somebody else’s story. There may be fraudulent activity behind this. But the contract itself provided professional development services. We got those services.”\nPressed on whether he has any regrets about the oversight role he was supposed to play either in hiring Byrd-Bennett or in approving the contracts she recommended, Vitale said: “You had somebody serve as our CEO who did a remarkable job improving the district. It’s very disappointing that she put the district in this situation. But she had no history of this before we hired her.”\nContributing: Fran Spielman\nFormer Chicago Public Schools CEO Barbara Byrd-Bennett apologized to students, parents and educators in a statement to the media as she exited federal court Tuesday. | Ashlee Rezin/For the Sun-Times\nBarbara Byrd-Bennett indictment", "external_links": ["https://www.scribd.com/embeds/284089208/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5hJYs9ccj8?feature=oembed", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/BYRDBENNETTTALKSTOMICROPHONES.jpg", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/284089208/Barbara-Byrd-Bennett-indictment", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/BYRDBENNETTTALKSTOMICROPHONES-1024x682.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:13:57.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
