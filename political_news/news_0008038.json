Kerry has stated that one of his goals is to reinforce maintaining the status quo on Jerusalem’s Temple Mount. Jordan oversees the Islamic Waqf, a religious trust that administers the Temple Mount. \nMeanwhile, the Quartet of Middle East peace mediators, which includes the U.S., E.U., Russia, and the U.N., met in Vienna on Friday and urged both the Palestinians and Israelis to tone down their rhetoric and ease tensions. The group called on Israel “to work together with Jordan to uphold the status quo at the holy sites in Jerusalem in both word and practice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:18:37.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
