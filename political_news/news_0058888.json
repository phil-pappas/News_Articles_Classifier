But even by our standards of succor, the news release from Milpitas Mayor Jose Esteves this week was extraordinary. You may remember that Steve McHarris, the former director of planning and neighborhood services, filed a personnel complaint against City Manager Tom Williams. McHarris left the city in April and took a job with San Jose's planning department. \nThe McHarris complaint was investigated by the outside law firm of Amy Oppenheimer. And the city's news release said the investigation found \"no violation of any laws.\" A council subcommittee consisting of the mayor and Councilwoman Marsha Grilli, both Williams supporters, concluded that relationships between the city manager and the city's employees and department heads were \"strong and positive.\" The news release included more fulsome praise about Williams bringing efficiencies and closing a $12 million structural deficit. \nSo all is hunky-dory under a manager who has led the city since 2006. But it may be worth pointing out that the folks who wound up on the wrong side of the city manager -- including McHarris, ex-City Attorney Michael Ogaz and former Human Resources Director Carmen Valdez -- have all left the city. At last notice, they weren't putting out any news releases. Advertisement Bonilla won't run against Glazer again for Senate Assemblywoman Susan Bonilla won't run next year against fellow Democrat and state Sen. Steve Glazer, who defeated her in the 7th State Senate District's special election earlier this year. \nIn a Facebook post last week, Bonilla, D-Concord, indicated she doesn't want a do-over of that ugly race. \n\"I believe our efforts are best spent in uniting our collective voices to help achieve a better quality of life for our entire community,\" she wrote, adding that having \"our community experience a negative and divisive election based on lies, personal attacks, and defamation of character is harmful and damaging.\" \nGlazer, D-Orinda, beat Bonilla by 9 percentage points in the May special election to fill the vacancy left by Mark DeSaulnier's election to Congress last year. The contest between the centrist Glazer and union-backed liberal Bonilla saw tremendous independent spending and a corresponding avalanche of negative advertising that soured many of the district's voters. Valley supporters get ready to raise money for Bush Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush is Bay Area-bound, with fundraisers scheduled Tuesday in San Francisco and Woodside. \nBush first will attend a luncheon reception at the Pacific Heights home of tech entrepreneur and investor Trevor Traina and his wife, Modern House Wines proprietor Alexis Traina, in San Francisco. Later, he'll attend an evening reception at the Woodside home of money manager Paul Edwards and his wife, Woodside Elementary School District trustee Silvia Edwards. \nA ticket to either costs $2,700, though raising $10,000 confers co-host status -- with access to a photo reception -- and raising $27,000 earns a place on the California finance committee with the photo op and a ticket to a future debate. Both fundraisers will be closed to the media. \nOther co-chairs of the Bay Area events include Cavalry Asset Management managing partner John Hurley and his wife, Kamilla, of San Francisco; brokerage and banking mogul Charles Schwab and his wife, Helen, of Woodside; and Sequoia Capital partner and former U.S. Ambassador to Portugal Tom Stephenson and his wife, Barbara, of Atherton. \nCo-hosts so far include Thumbtack general counsel Katie Biber Chen, of San Francisco, who was general counsel to Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign; venture capitalist Bill Draper, of Atherton, former president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States and a longtime Bush family friend; William Grayson, of San Francisco, a senior adviser at Bernstein Global Wealth Management; Ed Hearst, of Danville, an attorney and government affairs executive; Greg Johnson, of Hillsborough, chairman and CEO of Franklin Templeton Investments; Jay Kern, of Ross, a founder and general partner of Kern Whelan Capital; attorney Josh Lipshutz, a partner at Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher; and Carole McNeil, of Belvedere, widow of late real estate mogul Robert McNeil. \nThough Bush has seemed to be the odds-on favorite of establishment Republicans, and while the super PAC backing his campaign raised a record $103 million in the year's first half, Bush currently ranks fifth in an average of seven national polls compiled by Real Clear Politics, behind Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio and Carly Fiorina. He's sixth in Iowa behind Trump, Carson, Fiorina, Ted Cruz and Rubio, and fifth in New Hampshire behind Trump, Fiorina, Carson and Rubio. Memorials scheduled to honor Don Edwards Former U.S. Rep. Don Edwards, who died early this month at age 100, was not the kind of man to go out with a huge funeral. But his friends are not about to let him depart quietly. On Wednesday, Rep. Zoe Lofgren's staff has booked an hour in the House for special orders, or honors, for Edwards. This is expected to be shown on C-Span at the close of regular business. \nAt 2 p.m. on Oct. 25, there will be a memorial for Edwards at the Mission Ranch, 26270 Dolores Street in Carmel. (If you intend to go, email deborahemcfarland@gmail.com .) In Washington, D.C., there will be a memorial in Room 2237 of the Rayburn Office Building on Nov. 3 at 10:30 a.m. There will also be a memorial in San Jose, which is expected to occur early next year. At our deadline, no firm date had been set. \nThe Edwards family has requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the Citizens Committee to Complete the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, www.bayrefuge.org , P.O. Box 50991, Palo Alto, CA 94343. \nInternal Affairs is an offbeat look at local and state politics. This week's items were written by Scott Herhold, Josh Richman and Paul Rogers.
