Expanding Social Security.As Isaiah J. Poole wrote at The Campaign for Americas Future, Unless you listened carefully, you might have missed the expanse of daylight between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders when asked about their plans for Social Security at the CNN Democratic debate Tuesday. Its a gap that is alarming people who are fighting to protect and strengthen Social Security. Clinton was asked is she would support Sanders plan to increase Social Security benefits how much the wealthy pay toward the program from their income taxes. Only the first $118,000 is taxed for it. Clinton said she strongly supported Social Security and opposed privatization efforts, but when asked if shes raise benefits, replied, I want to enhance the benefits for the poorest recipients of Social Security particularly widowed and single women. As Poole wrote, What alarmed Social Security activists is that underneath Clintons positive language  fully support, enhance  appears to lie support for policies, including from leading conservatives like Pete Peterson  that would actually undermine Social Security. Republican Paul Ryan, the House Ways and Means Committee chair, uses the same language to protest the poorest people, but would reduce benefits for the top 70 percent of wage earners while maintaining benefits for the bottom 30 percent, Poole said. The last thing we need right now is to fear a Trojan horse from a presidential candidate who says she fully supports Social Security. And that's just one example. She's a neoliberal. She's not a democrat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:34:25.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
