This report will be provided within the current 2015/16 financial year.\" Promoted stories \nShe added the Geoff Ellis, the boss of DF Concerts, had confirmed that she had been \"quite right in thinking\" that a possibility he highlighted of T in the Park having to move elsewhere due to high relocation costs may have meant it could have left Scotland. Share article \nScottish Conservative culture spokeswoman Liz Smith said that response raised more questions than answers. She added: \"If it is correct that the £150,000 was used only to pay for costs relating to the venue hire and consultants' fees then why, three months after the event, is it not possible to have a detailed breakdown of how this public money was spent in these two items. These costs must have been known at the time of the event. \n\"The cabinet secretary has confirmed that DF Concerts are ‘working their way through a post event debrief process’ but she also confirms that the report which details how the money was spent will only be shared in confidence with the Scottish Government. I am sure the public will question this on-going lack of transparency about the use of public funds.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:08:46.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
