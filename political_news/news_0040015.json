And I think we need to make sure that success is coming not only to certain parts of our town, but we have to have opportunity coming to every corner of our city,\" she said. \nClodfelter believes his recent endorsements from former candidate David Howard gives him the edge. \n\"We feel like we're very well positioned for the second primary. I was very pleased to pick up David Howard's endorsement, who was the third-place finisher. We always had very common positions on the issues and what we thought the city should be doing. I was very proud that he agreed to come on board. I think we can push it across the line.\" \nThe winner of Tuesday's second Democratic Primary will face Republican Edwin Peacock in November's General Election.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/05/clodfelter-roberts-to-face-off-tuesday-in-second-primary/73426676/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:40:53.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
