Mr Laidlaw said he was happy to consider new initiatives that support this outcome. \n\"We certainly need more flexibility in the way local government is funded and there is a variety of options that need to be explored. The concept of special economic zones is one possible way to introduce more flexibility. Although there are questions about how the system would operate, where boundary lines would be drawn, and how the environment would be safeguarded, the initiative-along with others-is worthy of further exploration,\" Mr Laidlaw said. \nHe congratulated the New Zealand Initiative for their policy work to improve the quality of local government in New Zealand. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:02:09.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
