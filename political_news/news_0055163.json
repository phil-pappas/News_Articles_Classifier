Flanagan is the first Republican to announce interest in challenging her. \nFlanagan, of Brookline, is in his third term in the House and his first as majority leader. \nHe says he met with representatives from the National Republican Congressional Committee in Washington, D.C., to discuss a potential candidacy and plans to spend the next few weeks talking with voters in the district to decide whether he should run.
