Boxer was ready with her answer. \n\"I saw it happen in California. She's very appealing and very articulate,\" Boxer answered. \"But what she's selling is not optimistic...She's the symbol of corporate greed and Wall Street excess.\" \nBoxer noted that Fiorina didn't even pay her staff before she repaid a million-dollar loan to herself for the costs of her failed 2010 Senate bid. \n\"When you step on people like that, it comes back to haunt you,\" she said. \"She did it to people at HP, she shipped their jobs overseas...and she climbed up that ladder until she got fired.\" \nMoving to a more personal level, Boxer mused, \"You know, there's a song, I think it's 'the more you see her the more you love her.' It's the opposite with Carly Fiorina. The more you know, the less you like.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:12:44.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
