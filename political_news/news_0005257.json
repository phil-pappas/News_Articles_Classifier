The NACC marked its ninth anniversary yesterday. Vicha said NACC members all agreed that the rice-pledging scheme was the most complicated corruption scandal. \"Some NACC [members] encountered some unexpected situations,\" he said, refusing to elaborate. The anti-graft agency is probing five issues in connection with the subsidy programme including a corruption allegation against former deputy prime minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong over the sale of rice to Indonesia, a kickback allegation against the Public Warehouse Organisation chief and the rice distribution corruption allegation against former commerce minister Boonsong Teriyapirom. The NACC has compiled some cases into a book titled \"Opening a File of Thais' Expensive Lessons from 10 Corruption Scandals\". The scandals include the corruption allegedly involved in the Public Health Ministry's median drug-price list; the procurement of fire trucks; the Ratchadaphisek land-deal case against ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra; the two- and three-digit lottery scheme; and cases of unusual wealth. The NACC is also probing allegations that ex-PM Yingluck Shinawatra illegally paid compensation to protesters in political rallies. In another high-profile probe, the graft agency has questioned all witnesses in the allegation against ex-PM Abhisit Vejjajiva and his then-deputy Suthep Thaugsuban over the bloody crackdown on red shirts during political demonstrations in 2010. The case will wrap up soon once the Department of Special Investigation submits certain documents to the NACC, Vicha said. Statistics show that since 2007 to this year the NACC had completed investigation into 26,530 complaints from a total of 37,578. Of the 11,048 outstanding complaints, 8,836 are in the fact-finding stage, 2,212 are being investigated, 1,076 have been submitted to investigative panels and 1,086 have had investigative panels look into them. The damage incurred from more than 50 graft scandals that took place in state agencies from 2007 until this year allegedly amounted to Bt403 billion. In addition, 30 corruption cases involving state enterprises amounted to Bt121 billion in damages, while 110 local government corruption case caused Bt168 billion in damages, according to the commission. NACC president Panthep Klana-rongran defended the agency over complaints it operated with double standards, insisting it adhered to the law and worked based on facts and evidence. \"It is just an opinion. Some cases met with delay because of difficulties in finding evidence,\" he said. Vicha said the NACC upheld the principles of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. \"If the NACC handles any corruption cases illegally, we will be probed by the UN,\" he said. 273 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:17:37.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
