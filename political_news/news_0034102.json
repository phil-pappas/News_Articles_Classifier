In fact, I started painting from the age of three. So, even though I studied engineering, art has always been at the back of my mind. Hence, I chose what I loved after seven long years of corporate employment. \nYou have a wide range of artistic ventures from photography to illustrations for children’s books , how difficult is it to make this shift continuously? \nFor me, what matters is the idea! The medium of execution is secondary. When an idea strikes, I try to choose the best way possible to execute or portray it. It could be through photographs, paintings or an installation. So the moment I identify the medium, my adaptation from one form to another is pretty easy. \nWhat is the driving force behind such impeccable work? \nYou draw inspiration from anything and everything around you. It’s as simple as that. They say, “Steal like an artist ,” and that’s what I try to do. I get inspiration from everything: music , poetry, movies, random conversations, small talks. In fact, I would like to quote Jean Godard: “It’s not where you take things from, it’s where you take them to.” \nWhat triggered the series ‘Unposted Letters’? \n‘Unposted Letters’ is a series of doodles portrayed in a very simple form, yet with varying underlying attributes. Each doodle is a creative representation of said or unsaid feelings, thoughts or opinions. For example, every relationship goes through various phases: love, hate, anxiety, thrill, ecstasy. Each doodle is a capture of such an instance framed with a pinch of surrealism. The doodles have been inspired from everyday life and people around me. Unposted Letters encourages a viewer to think for himself or herself. So, it could mean different things to different people. \nIn these times of commercialisation, what does art mean to you? Has it otherwise generally retained its essence? \nArt is associated with ‘ storytelling ’. It remains an honest medium to raise an opinion. No matter how much commercialisation has seeped in, this basic thing has not changed. In fact, commercialisation has helped art evolve and reach a greater audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:11:29.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
