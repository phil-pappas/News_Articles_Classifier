We assess that that is not an easy task.\n\"We go in this with the full force and activity of the enterprise network, and we will use every means at our disposal to assist any commercial operator that expresses an interest to realise the objective of the continuance of the steel industry in Scotland.\"\nThe Lanarkshire plants process steel from Tata's plant in Scunthorpe.\nAsked if the Scottish plants can be a viable business on their own, Mr Ewing said: \"Perhaps it is possible to purchase steel more cheaply than it was from Tata.\nShare article \"There are different models here, we are not looking for a buyer for the whole of Tata.\"\nHe added: \"I really do not want to raise expectations but I would refer to the case of Ferguson's shipbuilders where people told us 'the game's a bogey, you won't succeed'.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-21T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:31:54.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
