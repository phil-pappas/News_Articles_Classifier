At a time when the city is already reeling under a severe water shortage and facing 20 per cent water cuts, this has resulted in further loss with leakages and contamination in the surrounding western suburbs.\nAccording to the civic officials, the Veravali reservoir tunnel from Adarsh Nagar to Yari Road in Versova has been damaged after the Farhad housing society at Bandivali Hill Road in Jogeshwari (W) dug an illegal borewell. The tunnel supplies water to areas such as Andheri (W) and Jogeshwari (W).\nCivic officials said the borewell is nearly 170 metre deep. The housing society members tried to dig even deeper, and as a result, severely damaged the underground tunnel. After receiving complaints of water shortage and contamination, the civic hydraulic department undertook the area's survey, and located the punctured tunnel.\n\"The society residents were ignorant of the fact that they have damaged the tunnel. They thought they have found a new, gushing source of water as they dug deeper. The contractor, too, was ignorant about the damage,\" said Sanjay Mukherjee, Additional Municipal Commissioner.\nHe added, \"Ignorance of rules, however, cannot be an excuse. The BMC has filed a complaint against the Farhad Society at Amboli police station for causing damage to the public property. The cost of tunnel repairs will also be recovered from the society as per the municipal rules.\"\nMeanwhile, the civic body has approached the Groundwater Surveys and Development (GSD) agency inPune to access the water table level of the area. \"The repair of the tunnel is an expert's job and we have contacted a company for this. They will assess the damage and let us know the cost of repairs,\" said Ramesh Bambhale, Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Water works).\nIn February 2010, the digging of an illegal borewell at Marve Road in Malad (W) had damaged a 3,000 mm diameter underground water tunnel, running from Liberty Garden to Charkop. The repairs took almost a month, and cost the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Rs 4.60 crore.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/1/104164532788541805272/posts"], "published": "2015-10-09T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:38:43.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
