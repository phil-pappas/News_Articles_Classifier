Now according media reports a former Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer and observer for the Vyapam recruitment tests was found dead under mysterious circumstances on a railway track in Odisha ’s Jharsuguda district . The deceased Vijay Bahaudur, who served as an observer for the Vyapam recruitment tests, was travelling from Puri in Odisha to Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh along with his wife by the Puri- Jodhpur Express. \nThe Central Bureau of Investigation has so far registered over 80 first information reports and launched over 10 preliminary inquiries into the Vyavsayik Pariksha Mandal (Vyapam), or the Madhya Pradesh Professional Examination Board (MPPEB) scam. \nThe scam, involving several admission-cum-recruitment irregularities, has 40 deaths linked to it so far. According to the report, Bahadur was returning to Bhopal from Puri after attending a reunion of 1978 batch IFS officers. It seemed that he died after falling from a moving train. However, the post-mortem report in the case is said to be awaited. \nIronically, Bahadur’s death is similar to the death of Namrata Damor, a second year student in medical college, who was linked closely to the Vyapam scam. Damor had reportedly also gone missing in 2012, after which a missing complaint was filed. While the police had found an unidentified, mutilated body on the railway tracks in Ujjain on the same day, but no one had claimed her body then. However, later, her brother, had identified her photo, after which the body was exhumed. \nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court had in its observation had clearly noted that no new deaths had been reported in the alleged scam after it directed the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) to take over investigation in the case. However, the death of Bahadur now seems to have only made the case murkier and proving to be a big headache for MP Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. \nThe opposition too have taken seriously the sudden mystery death again. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said larger forces were at play in the Vyapam scam. “It is the most amazing, shocking, multi-states death case. Never before so many deaths have occurred in one case. We were happy that after the Supreme Court intervened, there was a dramatic and sudden drop in deaths, and that tells its own story” Singhvi told ANI. \n“It is clear indication of a larger conspiracy. It is a clear indication of the larger forces at work because you cannot have so many deaths in so many states of unconnected people related to one big scam,” he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:38:48.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
