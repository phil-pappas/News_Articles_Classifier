Since the city [ Gov. Rick Snyder's appointed dictator, emergency manager Ed Kurtz ] switched their water source from Detroit to the Flint River, tap water contains double the amount of lead. This is a result of the more corrosive water coming into contact with service lines and city pipes, requiring stricter treatment than the city is providing. Lead levels in Flintâ€™s drinking water are so high they are defined as hazardous waste, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).", "external_links": ["http://www.sciencerecorder.com/news/2015/10/04/tap-water-flint-michigan-classified-hazardous-waste/", "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/04/flint-michigan-lead-water-children-health"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:51:11.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
