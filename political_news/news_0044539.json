Ferndale voters are being asked if they want to approve a park district that would increase property taxes to build and maintain parks and trails. Staff The Bellingham Herald i Order Reprint of this Story FERNDALE \nIt’s time for voters to decide if they want to pay for a new permanent taxing district within Ferndale city limits to raise money for parks and trails. \nIf approved, the proposition on the Nov. 3 ballot would create a metropolitan park district that would generate an estimated $581,000 per year for improving, maintaining and acquiring parks and trails. \nThe city will levy 50 cents per $1,000 of a home’s assessed value for the district if the measure is approved. That would cost the owner of a $250,000 home $125 a year. \nAbout three quarters of the money raised from the park district would be spent on capital projects. Some examples of those projects, according to the city website, include rebuilding the Pioneer Park main stage, the Star Park Playground project, a new skate park or a new fenced dog park. \nAbout 20 percent of the revenue raised from the park district would be used on parks maintenance, and no more than 5 percent of revenue may be expended on administrative costs. \nThe measure was put on the November ballot despite some concerns from City Council members. \nIn December 2014, the Parks, Recreation & Trails Advisory Board recommended the city create a metropolitan park district that used the same boundaries as the Ferndale School District. City Council, however, instead voted 6-1 to move forward with a smaller park district within city limits. Council member Cathy Watson accounted for the the only “no” vote. \nCity Council decided to put the measure on the ballot in February 2015 in a 6-1 vote. This time, it was council member Jon Mutchler who opposed, saying he was not sure where the support for the measure was coming from. \nWatson still opposed the idea, but she and other council members decided to leave the choice up to voters. \nIf voters approve the measure, City Council would act as the district’s board. \nReach Wilson Criscione at 360-756-2803 or wilson.criscione@bellinghamherald.com .
