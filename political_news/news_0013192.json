He missed a tackle on a 59-yard pass play and also gave up a touchdown.\nJennings had knee surgery in February and was cut from the Bears in August. He signed with former Bears coach Lovie Smith and Tampa Bay shortly after.\nFrom the Tampa Tribune :\nBucs coach Lovie Smith said in the wake of the Bucs victory over Jacksonville that he was “disappointed” in the way Jennings finished the game. A few days later defensive coordinator Leslie Frazier hinted that changes might be coming.\nJennings had a league-leading nine interceptions and 55 tackles for the Bears in 2012 .", "external_links": ["http://www.tbo.com/sports/bucs/bucs-will-start-mike-jenkins-at-cb-instead-of-tim-jennings-20151025/", "http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JennTi20.htm"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:52:47.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
