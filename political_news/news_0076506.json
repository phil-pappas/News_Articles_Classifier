(Sentinel Books) more > By David Sherfinski - The Washington Times - Thursday, October 8, 2015 \nRetired neurosurgeon and 2016 GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson applauded House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Thursday for making what Mr. Carson called an “unselfish” move in withdrawing his bid to be the next House speaker. \n“I say kudos to Representative McCarthy for putting others before himself,” Mr. Carson said on CNN shortly after Mr. McCarthy announced the stunning decision to GOP colleagues. \n“It’s a very unselfish move, and done for the right reasons,” Mr. Carson said. \n“This is not something that we see very often in Washington, and I hope it’s a trait that will be emulated by others as time goes on because…we have a lot of problems that have to be solved and none of us should put ourselves ahead of those problems,” Mr. Carson said. \n“I hope that this will open the process and that even more names [will] be thrown in, and that they will all have an opportunity to express…their vision for the country and how their leadership style will be manifested, and then allow members to vote,” he said. \nGOP Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah and Daniel Webster of Florida were two others who had also been in the running before a GOP conference vote scheduled for Thursday was postponed after Mr. McCarthy ’s shocking announcement. \n“I like them both,” Mr. Carson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:58:33.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
