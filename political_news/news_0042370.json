The move marks a recognition that gun control supporters, often galvanized by mass shootings that claim mostly white lives, have tended to neglect the kind of gun violence that ravages minority and urban neighborhoods. In addition, advocates have usually allied with law enforcement even as they signal to white, suburban gun owners that the government isn’t after their hunting rifles — a tactic that indirectly identifies urban minorities as the problem.\n“The movement is too white, said Marc Morial, head of the National Urban League. “There’s no input from communities of color.”\nBut in recent months, gun control advocates have started looking for ways to better align their goals with those of Black Lives Matter and the criminal justice reform movement, which is politically ascendant as Republicans and Democrats alike look for ways to reduce swollen prison populations.\nGroups aligned with Black Lives Matter have started taking part in weekly conference calls with Washington’s top gun control advocates. A group related to the Center for American Progress has been distributing new talking points to get away from language that they say alienates black communities. And on Tuesday, the Joyce Foundation will hold community meetings in Richmond, Virginia, to discuss the intersection of gun violence, policing and mass incarceration — with gatherings planned for Milwaukee and Stockton, California, in the coming months.\nBlack Lives Matter in contact with the White House about sentencing reform By Eliza Collins\nGun control proponents say they need to address the reality that urban blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately victims of gun violence — and that tough-on-crime punishments dating back decades helped drive the current problem of mass incarceration among those groups.\nOne new approach some groups are adopting is to heighten the intensity among existing supporters, not so much as find new ones.\nThat’s essentially taking a page from the NRA’s playbook. After the shooting deaths of 26 students and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary, polling showed 80 to 90 percent of Americans supported a 2013 Senate proposal to close loopholes for background checks. But swing senators said opponents of any new gun laws called their offices 10 times more frequently than proponents. Since then, the gun violence prevention movement has made overcoming this intensity gap a top priority.\n“The success of the gun lobby is that their supporters are passionate,” Morial said. “Not just that they’re numerous, they’re passionate.”\nBlack and Hispanic lawmakers have been some of the top supporters of more gun restrictions in Congress, and polls show substantial support among those communities.\nBut among activists, building trust has been earnest but slow going.\nBlack Lives Matter and its allies have placed a “huge underemphasis on black-on-black violence,” said Ladd Everitt, spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. At the same time, Everitt added, gun control supporters need to acknowledge that “there’s a lot of deep distrust of law enforcement, sometimes warranted.”\nEveritt concluded, “So maybe both sides need to do a little bit of soul searching,”\nLaw enforcement groups have historically been the most politically potent advocates for new gun restrictions. Today, the momentum is toward reining cops and prosecutors in.\n“What we have seen not work is increasing penalties on people who are found to be in possession of illegal firearms,” said Samuel Sinyangwe, an analyst and data scientist at Campaign Zero, a Black Lives Matter ally that grew out of the Ferguson protests. “Those policies are in the spirit of many of the mandatory minimums that have gotten us to a system of mass incarceration.”\n2016\nGeorge W. Bush unleashes on Ted Cruz By Eli Stokols\nThe tough-on-crime trend of the 1990s, characterized by the broken windows theory of policing and three strikes sentencing provisions, were in response to the “explosion of gun violence driven by crack,” said Van Jones, a former White House adviser now heading up #cut50, which is pushing for drastic reductions in the prison population. “So you push down on the guns and you push up on the sentencing around drugs.”\nJones added, “It didn’t work on either end, at least not in the way that people had hoped.”\nThose types of approaches are still favored by some of the most visible advocates for gun control, like former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. His Everytown coalition — which is working with Morial and other black leaders around the country — is trying to match the financial and organizing power of the NRA. But in a bid to rid New York of gun violence during his tenure, he angered many blacks and Hispanics with the “stop and frisk” police technique.\n“It can often be easier to just say, ‘We’re going to have strong enforcement on people who are illegally carrying guns,’” said Chelsea Parsons, vice president for guns and crime policy at the Center for American Progress. “You inadvertently alienate the community you’re trying to help.”\nIn a bid to further avoid alienating blacks, Hispanics and people suffering from mental illness, some younger advocates are arguing for new talking points.\nThe movement’s most central message, for example, is that measures like background checks will help keep guns “out of the hands of dangerous people and criminals.”\nInstead, advocates should call for guns to be kept “out of the hands of people convicted of violent or gun-related crimes,” recommends a guide distributed to various gun control groups by CAP’s Generation Progress for Gun Violence Prevention.\n“Words like ‘dangerous people’ are subtly but clearly color-coded,” says Lauren Footman, an organizer for the group, in the handout.\nWhile some of the groups involved in the regular conference calls said they were open to tweaking their language, others said the “dangerous people” line has proven effective in a diverse range of communities.\nThat said, the specter of threatening-looking blacks with firearms has helped build consensus on gun restrictions.\nMorial recalled how the Black Panther Party staged a protest of a proposed ban in California on openly carrying loaded weapons. As the Legislature considered the bill, the black militants marched on the state Capitol with loaded shotguns and rifles, wearing berets and black leather jackets.\nThe Legislature promptly passed the measure, and then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, a supporter of Second Amendment rights, signed it in 1967.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:30:42.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
