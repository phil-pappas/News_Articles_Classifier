Rama Rao and MIM Floor leader Akbaruddin Owaisi rocked the Telangana Legislative Assembly on Tuesday during the debate on farmers’ suicides.\nMr Owaisi accused the Treasury benches of taking farmers suicides lightly by laughing at him when he raised the issue, forcing Mr Rao to retort: “The government is very serious on this issue. But you are playing to the gallery by saying that we are laughing and media is watching” and asked him to speak “seedha-saadha” (straight to the point).\nThis infuriated Mr Owaisi, who said, “What do you mean by seedha-saadha? Am I talking teda (twisted). You are an educated and US-returned man. Don’t use such words. They don't suit your stature. Tell your party members about seedha-saadha, but not me.”\nMr Rao shot back, “I only meant that you should speak to the point like other Opposition leaders did earlier. We never objected or interrupted them. Mr Owaisi, you have the same rights as other members. You don’t have any special privileges.” Earlier, Mr Owaisi took a dig at Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, saying, “If the government is sincere, it should ensure that all farmers in state should also shine like CM.”\nStates: Telangana nation Current affairs Telangana Akbaruddin Owaisi K.T.
