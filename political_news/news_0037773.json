The warm, moist, subtropical climate, combined with waterlogged drywall and other building materials, has created the ideal breeding ground for colonies of mold and mildew. For residents of the greater Houston area – which is no stranger to severe flooding – Mold Inspection Houston provides scientific testing and assessment services as step one in terminating a mold infestation.\nTime is of the essence when recovering from the immediate aftermath of a flood. In warm climates, mold and bacteria only need 24 to 36 hours to colonize a flooded interior space. Property owners must first remove any standing water, pumping it out or soaking it up as quickly as possible. Of course, an extended power outage preventing these cleanup activities following a flood will mean that mold can take firm hold, infesting many homes and businesses.\nDragging furniture and other movable items outside into the sun – if possible – makes water removal easier. In addition, many items can be saved from the landfill if dried quickly enough. Mold generally does not thrive in direct sunlight. Calling in a clean-up crew is a good idea when water is a few inches deep or more, as the task of drying out or removing carpets can be too much for one person.\nFans and dehumidifiers can go a long way toward shunting moisture out of interior spaces. Experts also recommend removing baseboards and molding to ensure the wall's entire surface has an opportunity to dry out. Cutting a few small openings along the bottom of the drywall helps dry the inside of the wall where mold colonies especially like to grow. Small infestations (less than 10 square feet) of mold can be cleaned with hot, soapy water, as long as the surface is dried quickly thereafter. Bleach is not usually recommended, and it can damage some items. For people with health conditions, however, a more potent cleaner like bleach may be necessary.\nMold Inspections\nWhether it's a new home purchase or recovery from a flood, Mold Inspection Houston provides the same level of courteous, professional service to all clients. The company employs licensed and certified inspectors to conduct all testing and assessment. Do-it-yourself test kits from retail stores simply cannot match the experience and expertise of a professional mold inspector.\nA visual survey is only the first step of Mold Inspection Houston's three-pronged approach. The company also takes air and surface samples in all areas likely to harbor mold growth. Home and business owners can rest assured that if mold is growing anywhere inside the structure, it will be found and isolated.\nMold Testing\nFor a microorganism, mold can wreak a surprisingly large amount of havoc. Colonies of mold can literally eat away at building materials, sometimes compromising structures to the point that a complete rebuild is the only option. Mold spores dispersed in the air can likewise contribute to a variety of health problems. Common reactions to mold exposure include skin irritation, coughing and sneezing, watery eyes and headaches. Some people have more severe allergic reactions to certain species of mold, which could require hospitalization and certainly makes the environment unlivable; likewise, people with asthma, COPD or other breathing problems are often highly intolerant to mold spores.\nMold Remediation\nFollowing the initial inspection and samples testing, property owners receive a detailed report on everything found Mold Inspection Houston's professionals. Should those findings include an active mold infestation of larger than 10 square feet, the company can offer reliable advice on what comes next. After years of experience in mold testing and inspection, Mold Inspection Houston has established many strong relationships with the best mold remediation providers in the metro area. The company can recommend the appropriate remediation provider to deal with every type of mold problem.\nAbout Mold Inspection Houston\nAt Mold Inspection Houston, we offer complete mold testing services for residential and commercial customers.
