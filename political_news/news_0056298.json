Brenda Rindge/Staff × It took almost 35 minutes for North Charleston mayoral candidate John Singletary to use his campaign catchphrases at a candidate forum Monday. \nTo stay up-to-date on the race for North Charleston’s next mayor, information on the Palmetto Politics app or to sign up for our newsletter, go to palmettopolitics.com . “I would stop the corruption process,” Singletary said in response to a question about how construction contracts could be equally distributed in the city. “Presently the way jobs and contracts are given out, it’s through public corruption, nepotism, cronyism.” Singletary has used those words at nearly every forum and interview, charging that Mayor Keith Summey favors family and friends when it comes to handing out jobs and city contracts. Summey did not attend the forum because he had a prior commitment, said city spokesman Ryan Johnson. While previous forums have drawn capacity crowds to venues throughout the city, less than 50 attended Monday’s event, which was sponsored by the Southeastern Chamber of Commerce and held at Charleston Southern University. “I guess people feel like they’ve heard what they need to know,” said resident John Dailey, who attended one of the other forums. “I just came to see if they’d say anything different.” For about an hour, Singletary, Clifford Smith and the Rev. Chris Collins answered questions about the economic development in the city. All talked about the need for the city to support local businesses. “We have to establish a small business program at City Hall,” Smith said. “There’s a way to get some of these contracts to local businesses. We have talented carpenters, electricians, plumbers, dry wall people, bricklayers.” They also discussed the necessity of improving infrastructure. “We develop communities, we put up apartment complexes, but we don’t build roads, so when we go out after work and try to get home, we are in traffic one to two hours to try to get four or five miles,” Collins said. “We can’t allow development without some kind of control on the roads.” The nonpartisan election is Nov. 3. The election will be determined by a simple majority. Reach Brenda Rindge at (843) 937-5713 or @brindge on Twitter.
