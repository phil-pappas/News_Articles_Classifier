More than 4.35 million meals have been provided to communities where the company has a presence since the giving initiative began in 2010.\nExperience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: http://www.multivu.com/players/English/7639751-faurecia-fuels-food-drive-2015/\nEvery September, Faurecia's more than 20,000 employees at 48 locations in North America have responded to the call for helping those, who face food insecurity, in a variety of creative methods. From bake sales, car washes and dunk tanks to golf outings, sports tournaments and fundraiser lunches, employees participated in a variety of activities to help collect non-perishable food items and money for families in need during National Hunger Action Month. Hundreds of volunteers mobilized across Faurecia sites to organize these special activities, which were used to drive teams toward their donation goals.\nThis year's theme was \"Nourish our Neighborhoods.\" The message inspired employees to also give more than 360 hours of their own time. They volunteered to pack food in bulk, sort boxes and cans, and to serve meals to families in their hometowns.\nTraditionally, Faurecia's sites competed against each other to foster good-spirited competition, but this year, the company focused on self-improvement and determined the winner of the 2015 FUELS challenge by calculating the highest percentage over the site's 2014 total. The U.S./Canadian facility that was most successful in beating its own 2014 collection record was the Auburn Hills, Michigan Technical Center (FIS) improving 500 percent in the past year. Its partner food bank, Gleaners Food Bank of Southeast Michigan , will receive an additional $5,000 donation\nas a result.\nThe overall top collecting sites in Canada and the U.S., and the food banks they supported are:\n- Auburn Hills Technical Center in Auburn Hill, Michigan (Gleaners Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan )\n- Simpsonville Plant (FAS) in Simpsonville, Kentucky (Dare to Care)\n- Lansing Plant (FIS) in Lansing, Michigan (Greater Lansing Food Bank)\n\"This is the sixth year of Faurecia leadership for FUELS. Each year I am more impressed than the last by our employees' efforts to support the communities we call home,\" said Faurecia North America President Mark Stidham . \"We're very proud of the Faurecians who dedicated their time and energy to help fight the hunger crisis. One in seven Americans is struggling with hunger, and our efforts and contributions will assist in nourishing those in need. I'm excited to see how FUELS will evolve in the future - knowing how committed our employees are, the impact will be unquestionably significant. I am also encouraged by how our FUELS effort brings the Faurecia team together with a true 'team spirit' focused on a desire to achieve a common objective!\"\nFUELS is just one of Faurecia's ongoing efforts to improving lives in local communities. Other efforts include a dedication to STEM, providing shelter, ending hunger and participating in other charitable partnerships. The FUELS initiative, started by Faurecia North America in 2010, is now a global Faurecia program, inspiring a number of countries outside North America , including China , France , Germany , India and Spain , with other countries to join the program this year.\nGo to FaureciaFUELS.com to learn about Faurecia activities in your community and to access photos, videos and complete collection totals from the FUELS campaign.\nAbout Faurecia\nFaurecia is the world's seventhâ€“largest automotive supplier, with four Business Groups: Automotive Seating, Emissions Control Technologies, Interior Systems and Automotive Exteriors.
