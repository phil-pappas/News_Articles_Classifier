They always take an extra few sentences in conversation to say how they store their guns (e.g., separately from the bullets, in a safe, etc.), and they dont balk at the idea of having to take safety classes  because theyve likely already elected to do so if they werent required. Theyre deeply offended by the idea that so many people abuse the right (or privilege, as they prefer to see it) to bear arms and believe (correctly, no doubt) that if the club were more exclusive, gun owners would be more respected if only for the fact that being a gun owner would be earned  a badge, if you will, of accomplishment. (4) Responsible gun owners dont fear: background checks or reference checks or waiting periods or registration or physical/mental exams or smart gun technology or the government. They say, bring it. . . . (3) Responsible gun owners dont need to own weapons of war: military style assault rifles and high capacity magazines. They are willing to sacrifice personal ownership of these types of guns for public safety. They know that they can enjoy these particular weapons in a more secure environment, like gun/shooting clubs. . . . (2) Responsible gun owners know that the NRA is no longer an organization they should support, that its rotten to the core. Theyve withdrawn their membership, if they were ever members in the first place. They may have been members at one time, when this Wayne La Pierre was spokesperson: . . . (1) Responsible gun owners know an America that markets bulletproof backpacks is not one in which we want to live. You really have to question someone of these militia gun toting anti-American groups and understand these are the domestic terrorists who threaten our freedoms; not some imaginary threat living in the Middle East.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:53:19.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
