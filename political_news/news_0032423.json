This is the second year the First Lady has participated in the initiative.\n\"HopeLine from Verizon is an incredible program, and I trust that these donations over the next month will make a noticeable difference for victims of domestic violence across the state,\" said First Lady Karen Pence . \"I am very grateful for the efforts of state employees. Last year they dropped off 1,200 phones in HopeLine boxes around the government center campus. I am looking forward to watching our progress throughout the month of October as we continue to work together to make a difference and bring awareness to domestic violence.\"\nThe phone drive, launched in conjunction with domestic violence awareness month, will collect no-longer-used cell phones and accessories from any provider for survivors of domestic violence. HopeLine provides new phones equipped with 3,000 anytime minutes to those in need through participating domestic violence agencies, and give grants to agencies that assist victims and survivors of domestic violence. The donated phones are refurbished and recycled in an environmentally safe way with proceeds going towards the financial support of domestic violence awareness and prevention initiatives.\nSince 2001, HopeLine from Verizon has collected more than 11.4 million phones nationwide and has donated more than $29 million in cash grants to domestic violence organizations nationwide.\n\"HopeLine from Verizon's goal is to collect 1 million no-longer-used wireless devices this year. With the generous support and donations through the First Lady's drive here in Indianapolis , we are on our way to achieving that goal,\" said Lauren Love-Wright , Verizon's region president for Indiana .\nDonation boxes will be located among Indiana's state agencies as well as in the Indiana Statehouse outside the Office of the First Lady, Room 215, and the Office of the Governor, Room 206.\nMedia Contacts:\nKara Brooks\nkbrooks@gov.in.gov\n317-232-1622\nTrevor Thomas\ntrevor.thomas@verizonwireless.com\n248-915-3680\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/273831\n releases/first-lady-karen-pence-hosts-hopeline-from-verizon-drive-with-proceeds-to-benefit-survivors-of-domestic-violence-in-indiana-300154014.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-lady-karen-pence-hosts-hopeline-from-verizon-drive-with-proceeds-to-benefit-survivors-of-domestic-violence-in-indiana-300154014.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=CG19607&Transmission_Id=201510051011PR_NEWS_USPR_____CG19607&DateId=20151005", "http://www.verizon.com/about/responsibility/hopeline", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151005/273831", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/273831"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:31:56.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
