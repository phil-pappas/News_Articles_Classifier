The foreign minister and U.N. peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous announced the delay to reporters after a high-level U.N. meeting on the crisis. \nPresident Catherine Samba-Panza this week rushed home from the U.N. General Assembly of world leaders as the death toll in the capital, Bangui, rose into the dozens and aid officials said it was too dangerous to help the wounded and recover bodies. \nThe U.N. humanitarian agency on Thursday said the number of people displaced by the new fighting has now exceeded 40,000 in Bangui alone. At least 42 deaths have been confirmed in Bangui since Saturday, but the head of the national Red Cross has said that death toll is far from complete. \nDespite the chaos, pressure is on to hold elections. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund said they can only support the country's transitional government for so long, said a European diplomat who attended Thursday's closed-door meeting. \nThe diplomat told The Associated Press that only four of the 18 countries there pledged money — a key aim for the gathering, the first major one to focus on the country's future beyond elections. Those pledging were the U.S., Britain, Japan and Luxembourg. \nYet everyone at the meeting was very clear that elections need to happen, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. \n\"We cannot go backwards,\" Foreign Minister Samuel Rangba told reporters. He repeated the plea he made late Wednesday in a speech to the nearly empty U.N. General Assembly chamber, saying the U.N. must lift an arms embargo to allow his government to import weapons to keep order. \n\"You can't support a country without the military and public force necessary to establish the authority of the state,\" Rangba said. He said government officials would be talking with the U.N. sanctions committee for his country in the coming days. \nHe also called for a stronger mandate for the U.N. peacekeeping force in Central African Republic, which was established last year as the unprecedented sectarian violence killed untold thousands of civilians. \nRangba called the new violence a \"putsch\" and blamed supporters of two former leaders, Michel Djotodia and Francois Bozize , for causing it. U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon told Thursday's meeting that the latest fighting was \"designed to destabilize the country.\" \nRangba called the situation in Bangui quiet Thursday as U.N. and French troops helped to maintain order in the capital. \nThe foreign minister promised the elections, once they can be held, will be inclusive. He said the government was working on arrangements with countries sheltering refugees from his country so that they would be able to participate in the vote. Tens of thousands of Muslims fled the country.
