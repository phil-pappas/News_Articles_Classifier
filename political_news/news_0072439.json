In the joint raid with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, one U.S. service member died from a gunshot wound after being transported to Irbil for medical treatment.\nThis represents the first U.S. combat death in the fight against the Islamic State.\nThe administration has been clear that the U.S. mission in Iraq is purely to train and advise Iraqi forces.

He denied that a U.S. service member being killed by an enemy gunshot represented any kind of mission creep or an increased role for Americans in battle beyond training and advising Iraqi forces.\n\"Our mission in Iraq is the train, advise and assist mission. This was a unique circumstance,\" Cook said. \"This was a support mission in which they were providing support to the Kurdistan Regional Government. U.S. forces are not in an active combat mission in Iraq.\"\nHe added that missions like this would not begin to happen on a regular basis.\nCook said the hostages were in \"imminent\" danger and many feared that they would be killed within \"hours.\"\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter made the decision that the operation was \"worthwhile\" and in the national security interest of the U.S. because it helped the broader fight against the Islamic State, Cook said. He also said the intelligence gathered during the raid would be beneficial.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obama on #BLM: People 'have to take it seriously' 'The African American community's not just making this up.
