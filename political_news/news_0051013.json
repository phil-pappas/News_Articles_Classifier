Not Illinois, that’s for sure.\nThe Illinois Policy Institute is claiming otherwise, citing “recent research.” But that research was actually based on tax collections from Fiscal Year 2013, when the Illinois state income tax rate was 5%. Today — in Fiscal Year 2016, more than two years later — the state income tax rate has dropped to 3.75 percent. So if you look at tax collections in the first six months of this year, under the new rate, Illinois’ state taxes collections come out to $1,597 per person — more than $60 lower than Wisconsin’s $1,661. That’s just a fact.\nSEND LETTERS TO: letters@suntimes.com . Please include your neighborhood or hometown and a phone number for verification purposes.\nBut beyond that basic inaccuracy, that letter simply ignored some fundamental facts about state taxes — the first being that comparing state tax burdens is like trying to compare apples and mashed potatoes.\nTake Indiana. Their income tax rate is a flat 3.3 percent — which looks pretty good next to Illinois, right? But in Indiana, almost every county imposes its own income tax — which can range up to almost 3 percent, for a total income tax rate of up to 6.3 percent. That’s a whopping 68 percent higher than Illinois.\nAnd while it’s true that people in Illinois pay more in income taxes, per person, than people in Missouri, there’s a very good reason for that: We make more money. The average per capita income in Illinois is $29,666 — above the national average, and substantially higher than the Missouri per capita income of $25,649. So if you want to move to Missouri and pay less, remember that’s because you’re likely to make less.\nThen there’s the huge issue of comparing Illinois’ regressive flat income tax rate with our neighboring states’ progressive rates. In Wisconsin, people in the highest income bracket pay a top rate of 7.65 percent. Iowans pay almost 9 percent on taxable income over $68,000. And people in Minnesota pay a hefty 9.85 percen on taxable income of $154,951.\nHere’s the real point — when you start cherry-picking statistics on state tax rates, you can prove just about anything you want. The real task is figuring out the best, fairest way for a state government to raise the revenues necessary to pay for the services that its people demand. And you can’t develop smart, effective tax policy based on a misleading, simplistic and out-of-date chart.\nBut if you could, I’d choose one from the Tax Foundation (that same place that Illinois Policy Institute cited) that ranked the combined state and local tax burden in every state.\nIllinois comes in at No. 13 — compared with Wisconsin, which had the fifth-highest tax burden in the nation.\nElizabeth Austin, vice president for policy and communications, Innovation Illinois\nDon’t pick on firefighters\nOn the morning of Oct 16, as is my usual practice, I read my morning Sun-Times over coffee. Article after article told of the corruption in our political system both locally and nationally. Dennis Hastert and Aaron Schock to Barbara Byrd-Bennett, all were not satisfied with the huge salaries they receive from the public, but had to violate that public trust and engage in shady deals.\nHowever, the ultimate corruption story was uncovered by city Inspector General Joe Ferguson. It seems that Joe has discovered that some Chicago firefighters and paramedics are wearing their uniforms and gear when moonlighting as extras on the set of the hit show “Chicago Fire.” Outrageous!\nThe gear is the turn-out gear that firefighters wear into burning building as part of their daily duties. That is some pretty gritty business and gets that gear dirty and beat up. The producers of “Chicago Fire” like that and pay those extras more because it gives the show authenticity, but Ferguson takes exception, because the city provides that gear. Imagine the cost to the city treasury? Joe also points out that some of the firefighters and paramedics are trading days off to be available work as extras. One chief was forced to retire and pay back an incredible sum of $1,600, after an exemplary 30-plus-year career. How does that compare to nearly every alderman, senator and representative working at law firms and whatever else they can find to use their influence, for much much more, or million in kickbacks and hush-money.\nAs I read on in the paper, the Chicago Plan Commission signed off on giving George Lucas 17 acres of free prime lakefront land for his “Star Wars” museum. I wonder what that is worth?\nMaybe Ferguson should show the kind of intestinal fortitude that it takes to run into a burning building or be on an ambulance at a gang shooting while the gun fire is still going, and look for some serious corruption in Chicago. But that would put him in the cross-hairs of the big cats in town, and maybe they would figure out how to save some money by getting rid of his office.\nTimothy Hynes, retired deputy dict chief, Chicago Fire Department\nFunny games\nI am wondering how many people, like mem are not buying Lottery tickets because of the funny games the State of Illinois is playing with the state budget? I thought that the money paid out for the winners of the lottery was from money from tickets sold, so what has the budget got to do with paying for the winners?\nTed Schwartz, Brookfield\nExemplary wisdom\nVice President Joe Biden recently displayed exemplary wisdom: He chose not to offer himself as a candidate for president of the United States. It was probably a difficult decision. Regardless, we are reminded that for all things there is a season and that all business relationships come to an end. Furthermore, the only thing permanent is change.\nSuccess in life depends on fit, timing — and luck. It is also crucial that people hoping to be successful recognize that it is important to learn what one is best at and what one likes to do — then spend most of one’s life doing just that. Optimal self-actualization is the result. We can assume that Mr. Biden has given the decision much thought. Despite many losses in his personal life, he has devoted his political career to doing what he believed would most benefit our country.\nProponents and detractors of his candidacy have been myriad. Nevertheless, his choice remains paramount.\nMr. Biden’s complex scenario reminds us of the dying Beethoven’s reported last words (when his publisher brought him 12 bottles of wine): “Pity, pity . . . too late.”\nLeon Hoffman, Lake View", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:49:53.760+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
