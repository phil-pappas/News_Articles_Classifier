It’s not just his frequent insults and puerile doxxing that demonstrate his unseriousness; it’s first and foremost his intolerably silly policy positions.\nJindal has been especially critical, calling Trump an “unserious and unstable narcissist,” who “has no understanding of policy. He’s full of bluster but has no substance.”\nYet again and again, the other 14 Republican presidential candidates have proved themselves to be no less silly on policy issues than Trump. On the occasions when he has staked out new territory on the craziness frontier, the other candidates have quickly tried to meet or surpass him. This was the case, for example, with his hateful comments about immigration (which led to me-too calls to unilaterally ignore the 14th Amendment, among other highlights).
