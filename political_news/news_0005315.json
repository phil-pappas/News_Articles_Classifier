But the New York City mayor has oddly held off endorsing his former boss’s presidential bid — something the entire New York Democratic establishment has done. \nThe mayor, who has sought to position himself as a progressive on the national stage, claimed he “wanted to see more details from the candidates about their intentions before he made a final decision.” \n“I think like a lot of people in this country, I want to see a vision,” said de Blasio in April, on the same day Clinton formally announced her run for the White House. “And again that would be true of candidates on all levels.” \nMayor de Blasio has deep roots to the Clinton world, having worked for Bill Clinton at the federal department of housing and urban development under current Gov. Andrew Cuomo. \nAn organization, founded by de Blasio, is set to host a presidential forum on income inequality in Iowa City in December, sending out a multitude of invitations to all the major Democratic and Republican candidates. But the response was tepid, with Bernie Sanders and Clinton remaining on the fence as to whether they’ll attend de Blasio’s forum. \nOn Monday, Clinton’s campaign released a list comprising of more than 100 New York leaders who will make up her state leadership council. That list includes every Democratic House member from New York and both U.S. senators, all of the statewide leaders and every New York City-wide leader with the exception of de Blasio.
