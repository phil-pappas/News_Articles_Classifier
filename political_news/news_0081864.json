It has run down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is a late parrot. And now for something completely different.\" \nMr Whittingdale, speaking in Manchester during his first conference speech since gaining his ministerial role, said of events in 1990: \"I was trying to persuade Margaret Thatcher to include a passage comparing the symbol of the Liberal Democrats to Monty Python's dead parrot. \n\"As many of you know, I succeeded, although I was never sure that she entirely grasped why it was funny. \n\"But it seems an even more fitting comparison today.\" \nMr Whittingdale, before speaking about broadband, also joked about his previous work on mobile phones. \nHe said: \"The pace of technological change is growing ever faster. Share article \n\"In 1983, when I accompanied Margaret Thatcher on her election tour, I was put in charge of the mobile phone. \n\"There was nothing very mobile about it. It was the size of a brick with a handle - and we soon discovered that journalists in a car behind the battle bus could tune their radio to listen in.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:40:12.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
