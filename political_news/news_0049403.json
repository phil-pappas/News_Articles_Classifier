Working with Paddle8, The Macallan will also spotlight the collection and Rare Cask through curated experiences in three U.S. cities: Austin , Chicago and New York throughout October.\n\"Rare Cask represents the very foundations that make The Macallan so special – our vibrant range of natural color and the outstanding quality of our oak casks – and what better way to share this story than through an interactive experience combined with the Paddle8 auction,\" said Raul Gonzalez , Brand Director, The Macallan, \"By pairing this quintessential single malt with these rare and prized items, we are able to underscore the rarity of the whisky while celebrating all that makes Rare Cask so unique. Bringing the pairings to life through a series of events where guests can experience our live interpretations of complex flavor (the bar), natural color (the library) and exceptional wood (the office) will serve to highlight the complexity and rarity of our prized whisky even more.\"\nPaddle8 has curated the Gentlemen's Accessories sale to appeal to those with exceptional taste, featuring rare and conversation-starting vintage accoutrements for the discerning gentleman. Curated by Alan Bedwell , connoisseur of all things dapper and extraordinary, the auction is open for online bidding today through October 27th . The sale encompasses a selection of unique vintage accessories for the bar, vanity, and desk, including items that celebrate the key qualities of Rare Cask – wood, flavor and natural color. Over the duration of the sale, a selection of these objects-including an automatic 1968 Rolex Airking wristwatch ( $1,800-2,200 ), a glass and sterling silver flask made by Edward Pairpoint in 1871 ( $600-700 ), a French Art Deco champagne bucket from the 1920's ( $800-1,000 ) and a pair of 1940's gold and ruby rooster cufflinks ( $700-900 )-will travel to interactive event experiences throughout the country where attendees will have the opportunity to experience Rare Cask first hand and bid on the auction items. The sale will be open to bidders around the globe at www.Paddle8.com/gents .\n\"I was honored to select objects for this auction that reflect the distinctive qualities of The Macallan whisky. Like the Rare Cask, remarkable accessories have the ability to make life a bit more enjoyable, injecting a flash of elegance into the mundane tasks of everyday life, and this is what I wanted to evoke in curating Paddle8's Gentlemen's Accessories auction,\" remarked Mr. Bedwell.\nIn addition to gentleman's accessories, up for bid is a \"Rare Weekend\" curated by The Macallan, from which all proceeds will go to charity: water, a non-profit organization bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing nations. The \"Rare Weekend\" experience is a two-day getaway in New York City featuring an exclusive tasting of The Macallan's peerless expressions at Rarities – the exclusive lounge inside the Villard Mansion at Lotte New York Palace; a two-night stay for two at the elite Towers at Lotte New York Palace Hotel, including breakfast at Pomme Palais; a private appointment with a personal stylist for a custom suit fitting at the Trunk Club atelier; and airfare and transportation for two to New York City .\nCommitted to sourcing the industry's finest, most exclusive and expensive casks, The Macallan Rare Cask's story starts with majority first-fill 100% sherry-seasoned oak casks, some of the most precious and scarce in single malt whisky. Using in-depth knowledge of the thousands of casks maturing at The Macallan's distillery, the Master Whisky Maker handpicks the finest cut from less than 1% of the casks maturing there. The result is an exquisite whisky with a splendidly rich and resonant hue. Its complexity of flavors is evident in the tasting notes that include spices, raisin, rich oak, vanilla, chocolate and light citrus zest.\nFor more information on The Macallan visit www.themacallan.com and for the Paddle8 Gentleman's Accessories sale, www.Paddle8.com/gents .\nABOUT THE MACALLAN\nFounded in 1824 in the heart of Speyside, The Macallan was one of the first distilleries in Scotland to be legally licensed.
