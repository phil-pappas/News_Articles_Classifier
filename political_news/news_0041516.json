(Photo: KING) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSEATTLE -- Encouragement has turned to let down for the local Draft Biden movement. The Super PAC paid for a television ad and signed up hundreds of thousands of people nationwide, according to organizers. \nAbout 850 volunteers committed to the cause in Washington state, including more than 200 in Seattle, a significant increase in recent weeks. \n\"I'm definitely disappointed,\" said Seattle supporter Jan Hubert of Biden's announcement Wednesday that he's not running. \n\"I understand why he did it. I think for personal reasons and also he looked at the big picture, and he certainly spoke to everyone who he needed to get opinions from before making a decision, but I'm definitely disappointed,\" she continued. \nIt's a sentiment shared by fellow Seattle volunteer Shannon Myrin, who had donated her time phone banking for the movement. The Draft Biden group actively worked to recruit supporters and build a campaign infrastructure had the Vice President announced a 2016 bid. \nBut now, supporters including Myrin and Hubert will have to decide next steps. \n\"For me, I'll be not as enthusiastic as I could have been,\" Hubert said. \"I really have to think about it. Because, honestly, I'm a bit more pragmatic, I want to support a candidate who really has a chance of beating the Republicans because for me, that's the bottom line.\" \nWhile Hillary Clinton remains the front-runner, Bernie Sanders has attracted the most visible support in the Seattle area. \nAn August rally turned out around 15,000 supporters. The Washington For Bernie movement has 3,500 members, according to organizer Mario Brown. Brown is even holding weekend caucus classes to try and help secure delegates for the Vermont senator. \nState Democratic party spokesman Jamal Raad has said it's premature to project who will win Washington's delegates, but adds, \"Any candidate willing to work hard and get volunteers has a shot.\" \nWhile Hillary Clinton still leads in fundraising, the FEC's latest October quarterly report shows Sanders outraised Clinton in the state of Washington during the summer months. \nSanders raised $376,885.41, compared to Hillary's $210,508.94 from July through September in Washington. Nationally, she remains ahead, but Sanders made a significant dent in closing the gap. \nWhile a regional campaign spokesman for Hillary Clinton declined to answer how many volunteers she has in Seattle, he released the following statement on Clinton's behalf in response to Biden's announcement. \n\"Joe Biden is a good man and a great Vice President. Serving alongside him in the Senate and then the administration, I saw first-hand hispassion for our country and our people,\" read the statement in part. \"And I am confident that history isn't finished with Joe Biden. As he said today, there is more work to do. And if I know Joe, he will always be on the front-lines, always fighting for all of us.\" \nStatement from Washington for Bernie Sanders: \n\"Joe Biden has served our nation for more than four decades. His is part of the history Barack Obama presidency and as such, secured his place in history. Although no more can be asked of this public servant, we are certain that he still has much to offer to the Democratic party.\" Read or Share this story: http://www.king5.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/21/local-draft-biden-supporters-deciding-next-steps/74364882/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:59:38.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
