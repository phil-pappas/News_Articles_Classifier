A brief trial is underway in Cedar Rapids.\nThe lawsuit claims the zoo maintains deplorable living conditions that violate the Endangered Species Act. A separate lawsuit challenges conditions for other animals at the facility.\nAnimal advocates laud the effort but the zoo owners say they're animal lovers, too, who have been unfairly maligned.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
