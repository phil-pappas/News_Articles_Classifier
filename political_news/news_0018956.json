Martin O'Malley is a distant fourth in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to the results of a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll released Monday. Just 4 percent of registered voters who identified themselves as Democrats or independents leaning toward the Democratic Party said they would support their former governor in the state's April 26 primary.\nHillary Clinton led the field with 43 percent, with Vice President Joe Biden at 26 percent and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at 20 percent. Biden has not declared his intentions about running, and, as of Monday afternoon, will not participate in the first Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Meanwhile, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb took just 1 percent, and former Rhode Island senator and governor Lincoln Chafee drew an asterisk, indicating less than 1 percent support.\nO'Malley, who served as governor of the state from 2007 until this January, has seen his 2016 numbers remain consistently low in the past two years, even in his own state. In May, O'Malley announced his candidacy in Baltimore.\nIn an indication of how much the race has shifted in the past 12 months, Clinton's lead was substantially larger in last October's Maryland poll, when the former secretary of state bested Biden 63 percent to 9 percent. O'Malley, meanwhile, was pretty much in the same spot with 3 percent support.\nThe poll was conducted Oct. 7-11 in English and Spanish, surveying 490 Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters via landlines and cellphones, with a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/washington-post-university-of-maryland-poll-oct-7-11-2015/1843/"], "published": "2015-10-12T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:17:32.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
