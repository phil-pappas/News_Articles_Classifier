Bob Dixon, R-SPringfield CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSen. Bob Dixon's war chest looks awfully small compared to the other Republican candidates running for governor. \nEx-Navy Seal and author Eric Greitens has more than $2.2 million on hand to spend, according to his quarterly campaign finance report filed Thursday with the Missouri Ethics Commission. \nFormer state House Speaker and U.S. attorney Catherine Hanaway's report shows she has more than $1.5 million to spend. \nLt. Gov. Peter Kinder has $275,973 on hand. Businessman John Brunner's campaign has $256,562. \nDixon has not even a third of that. The two-term Springfield senator has $82,548 in cash, according to his latest campaign finance report. \n\"My cash is not going to stack up with the other candidates,\" Dixon told the News-Leader on Thursday. \nStill, Dixon's not sweating it, he said. \nWhen Dixon announced his campaign in July, he didn't have much more than a banner, he said. In the meantime, his campaign has worked to build infrastructure across the state, Dixon said. \nNow, his campaign will be able to focus solely on fundraising, he said. \n\"I am really excited about the campaign,\" Dixon said, later adding, \"There is just a groundswell of support.\" \nDixon also pointed to the $160,664 in in-kind donations his campaign received during the last quarter, an amount that leads the Republican candidates. Dixon said leaning on in-kind contributions has been a regular strategy of his going back to his Senate and House campaigns. \nDemocratic candidate Secretary of State Chris Koster has more than $5 million in cash on hand, according to his latest campaign finance report. He received $1.5 million in the last reporting period. \nAccording to their campaign reports, the Republican candidates for governor received the following contribution amounts during the last period: \nBrunner: $291,432 \nGreitens: More than $1.4 million \nHanaway: $171,260 \nKinder: $267,000* \n*Kinder switched campaign committees during the last period. This is the amount he raised during that period, according to his campaign staff, although it is not clearly reflected in his report.
