The Senate and House each voted on Wednesday to approve a government spending bill before the midnight deadline.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Sept. 30, 2015 | 5:05 p.m. EDT + More Congress managed to avoid a government shutdown Wednesday, as both the House and Senate voted to approve legislation that supplies funds for federal operations through Dec. 11.\nSenate lawmakers voted 78 to 20 Wednesday morning to pass a continuing resolution that keeps federal spending at its current levels, with 32 Republicans joining the entire Democratic caucus in supporting the measure. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans running for president, skipped the vote.\n\"This bill hardly represents my preferred method for funding the government,\" Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \"But it's now the most viable way forward after Democrats' extreme actions forced our country into this situation.\"\nThe House followed suit Wednesday afternoon, voting 277 to 151 with 91 Republicans joining House Democrats in favor of the legislation. That vote followed one on a procedural measure that would defund Planned Parenthood; the measure passed separately from the continuing resolution and won't have any effect on the funding that keeps the government running.\n\"I understand that so far we have lacked the votes in the Senate to include defund language in the continuing resolution,\" Rep. Martha Roby, an Alabama Republican and sponsor of the measure, said on the House floor Wednesday afternoon. \"I realize this is a last-ditch effort to do this and the chances of this correction maneuver succeeding in the Senate are low, but I believe ... that we have to fight until the very end.\"\nThe funding bill now heads to President Barack Obama on the final day of the fiscal year and with funding for the government set to expire at midnight. Its passage followed months of partisan bickering over cuts that were set to go into effect, as well as an effort to defund Planned Parenthood by conservatives.\n[ READ: Will Congress Shut Down the Government? ]\nThe White House and congressional leaders said negotiations on a broader deal, which will likely include an increase in the debt ceiling, would begin \"very soon.\"\n\"We'd like to settle a top-line for both years so that next year, we could have a regular appropriations process,\" McConnell, R-Ky., said Tuesday. \"The president and [House] Speaker [John] Boehner and I spoke about getting started into discussions last week, and I would expect them to start very soon.\"\nMcConnell and Boehner reportedly told Obama they would prefer to deal without Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, but Reid promised he would be at the table.\n\"Sen. Reid will welcome Sen. McConnell to the negotiating table whenever Sen. McConnell is ready,\" Reid spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said. \"Sen. Reid has been urging Republicans to begin this process for months instead of waiting for the last minute. But better late than never.\"\nAll year, Democrats and Obama vowed to block any major appropriations bills that did not include relief from the sequester caps laid out in the 2011 Budget Control Act, which demanded steep cuts across both domestic and defense discretionary spending. Those cuts were meant to be too painful for either party to stomach, and a 2013 deal put off the worst for two years.\nRELATED\nKevin McCarthy, Boehner's Likely Successor, Will Face the Same Challenges But with Republicans finding a way to circumvent the caps on defense spending by increasing the Overseas Contingency Operations fund – largely intended for wartime needs – they had little interest in meeting Democrats' demands to boost spending on the domestic side of the ledger.\nThe release of a series of sting videos purporting to show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the illegal sale of fetal tissue added yet another wrinkle to the already stalled process. Conservatives in both the House and Senate insisted they would prevent any funding measure from passing if it did not curb the federal funding – estimated at $450 million – the women's reproductive health organization receives each year.\nBut with Democrats promising to block any legislation that did so, Republicans have turned to reconciliation, a part of the budget process that requires just a simple majority for a measure to pass the Senate, rather than the 60 votes that is typically necessary. Some House committees began working on bills this week that would eliminate Planned Parenthood dollars as well as slashing most of the funds that pay for implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\nWhile Wednesday's action will keep the government funded for the next several months, the Dec. 11 deadline will be far more difficult to meet. In addition to preventing a default by raising the debt ceiling, which denotes the amount the Treasury can borrow to meet existing obligations, lawmakers must also fund critical transportation programs and extend certain tax breaks expiring at the end of the year.\n\"I worry about a shutdown in December, yes,\" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer told reporters Tuesday, adding that he hoped Boehner's impending resignation at the end of October would allow him to deal with Democrats.\n\"We need to agree on a number that abandons sequestration which nobody really believes will work,\" said Hoyer, D-Md. \"We need to come to a budget agreement and I've been urging the majority leader to do that for the last few months, and I'm hopeful that within the next 30 days we will accomplish that objective.\"\nUpdated on Sept. 30, 2015: This story has been updated to include Wednesday's House vote.\nTAGS: politics Senate federal budget", "external_links": ["http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrcb4%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Congress%20Votes%20to%20Avoid%20Government%20Shutdown", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrcb4%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrcb4%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Congress%20Votes%20to%20Avoid%20Government%20Shutdown", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrcb4%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrcb4%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Congress%20Votes%20to%20Avoid%20Government%20Shutdown&summary=A%20funding%20resolution%20that%20will%26nbsp%3Bkeep%20the%20government%20from%20shutting%20down%20at%20midnight%20is%20on%20its%20way%20to%20Obama%27s%20desk.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdrcb4%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:02:40.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
