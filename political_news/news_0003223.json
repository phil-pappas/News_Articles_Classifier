Any hopeful who averages 2.5 percent will be rounded up to 3 percent and included, according to CNBC.\nCandidates who qualify for the event but fall below that threshold will be invited to the undercard debate at 6 p.m. EDT.\nThe polls to be considered are those conducted by NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, CNN and Bloomberg, released between Sept. 17 and Oct. 21, CNBC said.\nIf the debate were held now, the candidates included in the prime time debate would be billionaire businessman Donald Trump, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former executive Carly Fiorina, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\nQualifying for the undercard debate, if it were held now, would be Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, former New York Gov. George Pataki and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, each of whom get 1 percent in at least one poll.\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore would be kept offstage under the rules.\n___\nAP News Survey Specialist Emily Swanson contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow Laurie Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman\nFollow Emily Swanson on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/EL_Swan\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/EL_Swan", "http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:41:18.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
