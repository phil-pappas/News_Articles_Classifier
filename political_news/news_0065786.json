Prosecutors said Khazaee stole and shared with contacts in Iran materials related to the Air Force F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the F-22 Raptor and other U.S. military jet engine programs.\nKhazaee, a former employee of defense contractors including Pratt & Whitney, pleaded guilty in February to violating the Arms Export Control Act. The 61-year-old asked for leniency, writing in a letter to the judge from a Rhode Island detention center that he was remorseful.\nIran has said there are 19 Iranians in U.S. custody charged with violating U.S.-imposed sanctions. It was not immediately clear if Khazaee is one of the 19.\nIranian officials have hinted at a possible prisoner exchange involving the release of Americans held in Iran, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian , a dual citizen who has been detained for more than a year on espionage charges and was recently convicted in a verdict not yet made public.\nHowever, Iran's judiciary has rejected the idea of an exchange.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:30:54.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
