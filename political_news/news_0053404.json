Edward Baker of Oregon, a friend of President Abraham Lincoln, died leading his 1,700-member brigade across the Potomac, 40 miles north of the capital, up a steep ridge known as Ball’s Bluff and headlong into a withering Confederate artillery fire. Baker remains the only senator ever to die in a military engagement. Baker was born in England in 1808 and arrived in Philadelphia with his Quaker parents when he was 9 years old. By the 1830s, he had become a prominent lawyer in Illinois, where he and Lincoln drew close.\nIn 1844, he won a House seat, defeating Lincoln for the Whig nomination. At the start of the Mexican War in 1846, he raised a regiment of troops. To lift congressional support for the unpopular war, he appeared in the House chamber in uniform before resigning his seat and rejoining his troops.\nAfter the war, Baker moved to another Illinois district, where he easily won another House seat. By 1852, he had left Congress to take up a lucrative law practice in San Francisco. He earned national fame in 1859 with his eulogy at the funeral of Sen. David Broderick of California, who had been killed in a duel with a former chief justice of that state, David Terry.\nBy 1860, Baker had moved to Oregon, where he attained a Senate seat from the Legislature. When the Civil War broke out, he once again raised a militia unit and appeared before his Senate colleagues in uniform.\nBaker died before he could witness the stampede of his troops back over the 70-foot cliffs to the rock-studded river below. Nearly 1,000 Union soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. The debacle led to the formation of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, armed with broad investigatory powers.\nSOURCE: WWW.SENATE.GOV ; “COLONEL EDWARD D.
