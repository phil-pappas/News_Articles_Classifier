The fall annual Town Meeting starting 7 p.m. in the Dartmouth High School auditorium will tackle 20 articles. Asked about important items, Town Administrator David Cressman said, “Police station, police station, police station. There are some other issues but this is the major one.” The town wants to borrow $8.4 million to rehabilitate and renovate the closed police station at 249 Russells Mills Road, as recommended by the police building committee. “It involves borrowing money through a debt exclusion and needs Town Meeting approval and a vote from the electorate next April,” said Finance Director/Treasurer Gregory Barnes. “This is obviously an estimation. It is the town’s hope that the actual bid is within the cost estimated.” Officials are also looking to fund the fiscal 2016 capital plan that supports school and town building improvements, technology upgrades and the final stage of the DPW highway garage expansion. “From the financial standpoint, the capital articles are the biggest,” Barnes said. “Each year, we’ve been aggressively trying to fund capital improvements to the extent possible.” This time, the town is looking to make energy efficiency improvements in town buildings ($90,000), replace election machines ($73,000), and fund an analysis of the Cornell Pond dam ($50,000). On the school side, partial roof replacement at the middle school is expected to cost $750,000, technology and infrastructure upgrades $352,589 and HVAC upgrades $300,000. The police department is seeking to replace old cruisers ($69,155) and DPW’s continuing garage expansion seeks an additional $2.7 million to complete the project that will create two new mechanics bays and a centralized location to service the town’s fleet. This year the town received $1.18 million in Chapter 90 funds; the capital request adds another $600,000 to help maintain the town’s 220 miles of roadway, Barnes said. In other articles, the Community Preservation Committee seeks to transfer $290,511 to the Open Space Reserve Fund; appropriate $140,342 to fund the police union collective bargaining agreement; add a deputy harbormaster position to be paid up to $25 per hour; and file a home rule petition for an additional wine and beer license. The Finance Committee has opposed an article to accept a state statute that would create a real estate tax exemption on the value of improvements made to create or renovate living space for persons 60 years or older. The majority of the board felt the policy does not provide support for those with financial hardships, complicates the tax code and could lead to costs related to monitoring compliance, according to a statement in the warrant package. Many of the fall Town Meeting articles address general housekeeping — from supplementing the full day Kindergarten program and the Greater New Bedford Regional Voc-Tech High School budget to amending a general bylaw governing window accent lighting. The key to fiscal success in town government is not just to invest in capital improvements but to update infrastructure. That is a challenge at a time when technology changes frequently and in a town where buildings like Town Hall are aging out and require more money and maintenance for their upkeep, Barnes said.
