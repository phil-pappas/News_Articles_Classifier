(Photo: AP) Los Angeles: Sixty-one wingsuit skydivers have flown into the record books, creating a diamond-shaped formation while soaring over California before breaking apart and floating to the ground.\nThe group set the record for the largest such formation Saturday at Skydive Perris, 80 miles (130 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles, Taya Weiss, the jump's lead organizer, said Tuesday. It shattered the old record set by 42 flyers in June.\nWeiss said the record was verified by a panel of judges from Fdration A ronautique Internationale, the international group that keeps track of skydiving and other aviation-related records.\nOne judge on the ground witnessed the jumpers leap from three separate aircraft at 13,500 feet (4,110 meters), create the formation and then break apart at 5,500 feet (1,680 meters). Two other judges reviewed photos of the jump later and confirmed Monday it was official.\n(Photo: AP)\n\"It was an absolutely incredible experience,\" said Weiss, who was also one of the jumpers. \"We're a very small community, although we're growing, and to get everyone together from all over the world, especially to achieve such a difficult goal, is very rewarding.\"\nWingsuit flyers from 12 countries - including the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia, Russia, Poland, South Africa and Israel took part. Weiss said the flyers actually broke the old record twice Saturday. After 50 people went out for a first jump there was time for a second one, so 11 more joined in.\n(Photo: AP)\nSkydive Perris was the site of another record earlier this month when 202 divers linked up to form the world's largest sequential skydiving formation.\nWingsuit diving differs in that skydivers wear special suits with pressurized wings attached to their bodies, allowing them to glide horizontally while they fall at a slower rate than regular skydivers.\n Wingsuit skydivers California World Also Read Bizarre: Japanese hotel offers special ‘crying rooms’ for women Oxford looks for origin of ‘numpty’ Edward Snowden gets 3 more years in Russia: Lawyer As AirAsia passengers' bodies are found, grieving relatives faint", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sky-diving-2.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/wingsuit-skydivers_0.jpg", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151021/world-americas/article/61-wingsuit-skydivers-set-formation-record-over-california", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/sky-diving-1.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/wingsuit-skydivers_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:28:04.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
