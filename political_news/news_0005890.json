(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) UPDATE: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) abruptly dropped out of the race to replace John Boehner (R-Ohio) for speaker. The House GOP Conference meeting in which Republicans were set to select their nominee for the House floor vote on Oct. 29 has been postponed.\nEarlier:\nA House Republican Conference divided against itself meets Thursday to pick a new standard-bearer, launching the process of electing a new House speaker in the midst of a congressional session for the first time in 26 years.\nThere is little question about how the first step in the process, a secret-ballot vote of the nearly 250 conference members, will play out: Majority Leader Kevin O. McCarthy is expected to win the requisite majority and become the party’s nominee to succeed outgoing Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio).\nBut there is much drama about how the process will end.\nTo claim the speaker’s chair, McCarthy will have to claim a majority of those present and voting in an Oct. 29 vote on the House floor. No Democrats are expected to support a GOP nominee, so to guarantee victory, McCarthy will have to win the support of 218 of the 247 voting Republicans.\nMcCarthy’s hopes of uniting Republicans took a blow Wednesday when a close-knit group of roughly 40 hard-line conservatives, the House Freedom Caucus, said it would back a low-profile Florida lawmaker, Rep. Daniel Webster, instead.\n[ House conservatives spurn McCarthy, flex muscle ahead of speaker vote ]\nThe group said it intended to vote as a bloc in Thursday afternoon’s party election and left open the possibility that they might unite against McCarthy on the House floor in three weeks, denying him the speakership.\nIn a statement announcing their endorsement, the Freedom Caucus suggested their position might change if “significant changes to conference leadership and process” were made, and that their numbers give them leverage to demand those changes from the next speaker.\n“He has three weeks to make systemic changes,” Rep. Raúl Labrador (R-Idaho) said of McCarthy. “Not just talk about the changes, but to show exactly what he’s going to do.”", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/@mikedebonis"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:58:31.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
