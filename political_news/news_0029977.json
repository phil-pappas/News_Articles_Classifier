The test is seen by the U.S. as part of the regime's \"usual provocative efforts.\" \nIn May, the regime published photos of what it said was leader Kim Jong Un standing in front of a submarine at sea, launching a missile, but U.S. intelligence experts said there was no electronic, infrared or satellite data to suggest a launch had occurred and that only the on-board ejection system was tested. \nSo far, there is no international notice for ships to remain out of any particular area in anticipation of a test, the official added. North Korea could also fire some short-range missiles, a more typical maneuver by the regime. Several U.S. officials said some type of \"show of force\" by the regime has been planned, but the exact timing remains to be seen. \nU.S. and international monitors are also closely watching land-based missile launch sites and known nuclear test facilities for any indications of activity.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:16:00.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
