Share article \nShe called on the council to \"stop this circus of travelling around everywhere and having to adapt to different buildings and venues\", adding she had had great difficulty even finding the meeting room as there had only been one sign. \n\"We have been doing this for 18 months. I think meetings need to be accessible,\" she said. Promoted Stories Loud speaker crashes down - and just misses councillor during meeting Sorry, an error occurred.
