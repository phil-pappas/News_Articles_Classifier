Promoted stories \nMs Hyslop has claimed she authorised the payment as festival organisers had said they may move T in the Park out of Scotland due to costs associated a planning application and changing the location of festival earlier this year, or downgrade it to smaller, one-day city based events. \nLabour MSP John Pentland, a member of the education and culture committee, said Ms Hyslop should be recalled to \"face the music\". \nHe added: \"T in the Park is an iconic Scottish cultural event that has entertained millions and boosted the local economy. It's a fantastic event that we should all be rightly proud of. However, questions still remain unanswered about the SNP Government handing £150,000 worth of taxpayer cash to the event. \n\"We have seen suggestions that the event would not have been viable, would have to have been a one day event, or would have to have been moved out of Scotland without public cash. None of this seems credible. Share article \n\"But the SNP Minister took it to a whole new level last week by saying she had no relationship with Jennifer Dempsie whilst swapping Facebook messages with her. It’s insulting to the Scottish Parliament and to the Scottish people. \n\"The fact that the Culture Minister had not read the economic impact assessment put to her suggests proper due diligence was not carried out.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:18:59.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
