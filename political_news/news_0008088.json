Ranga Reddy district tops the list with nearly 4,000 missing documents.\nThese valuable documents, categorised district-wise, could not be traced during digitisation of property records. The collectors were asked to inquire and trace the missing documents.\nIf those documents are not traced, it would not be possible to issue Encumbrance Certificate (EC) and Certified Copies of such properties.\nMissing papers shock Telangana, steps taken to trace them\nThe state government was shocked to find after the verification by revenue department revealed that as many as 11,990 documents were missing covering all the 10 districts of Telangana state.\nWhile Ranga Reddy district topped the state with 3,995 missing documents, it was followed by Karimnagar with 2,450 documents and Nizambad 2,360. The other districts include Nalgonda (990), Warangal (650), Khammam (400), Medak (300), Mahbubnagar (250), Hyderabad (110). In Adilabad, only 15 documents were missing.\n“All the missing documents must be traced because the state government is planning to extend the facility of ‘Anywhere Registration’ to the entire state. Without records, it would be difficult to launch the initiative. In a way, these missing documents are blocking this initiative,” said an official of the revenue department.\nDuring registration of any property at sub-registrar offices, a copy of registration certificate would be provided to the owner and the government keeps other copy with it for record purpose. All these documents are stored in state data centre and are being digitised. However, officials are hopeful of tracing these documents.\n“Based on our records, we are issuing notices to such property owners and asking them to furnish the document copy available with them. Those documents are being scanned by us and stored at data centre. In this way, we could trace about 11,000 missing documents and hopeful of tracing the balance documents also,” the official added.\nStates: Telangana property registration Encumbrance Certificate Revenue department Telangana Also Read Mist stations to cool marathoners Man falls from hotel window, dies on spot Telangana State works towards return of residents stranded in Nepal K Chandrasekhar Rao shifts house over bad vastu", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/TeluguMatrimony_Textlink_620x40px.gif", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151025/nation-current-affairs/article/over-11000-property-registration-documents-go-missing", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/documents%20missing_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/documents%20missing_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:59:20.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
