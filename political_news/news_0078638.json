And they both drew a huge audience to a single episode of \"60 Minutes.\"\nThe two drew 20 million viewers to a September episode of CBS' staple Sunday night show. And Trump had that in mind when asked about Putin on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\n\"I think the biggest thing we have is that we were on '60 Minutes' together and we had fantastic ratings. One of your best-rated shows in a long time,\" he joked. \"So that was good, right? So we were stable mates.\"\nOtherwise, he said of Putin, \"I think we are very different\" -- even though they'd get along.\nRead More \"I think that I would at the same time get along very well with him. He does not like Obama at all. He doesn't respect Obama at all. And I'm sure that Obama doesn't like him very much,\" Trump said. \"But I think that I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now.\"\nHe told host John Dickerson of Russia's recent air assaults in Syria: \"And as far as him attacking ISIS, I'm all for it. If he wants to be bombing the hell out of ISIS, which he's starting to do, if he wants to be bombing ISIS, let him bomb them, John. Let him bomb them. I think we probably work together much more so than right now.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:30:57.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
