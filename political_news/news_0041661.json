Minority Affairs and Environment minister Asim Ahmed Khan, 39, has been removed on basis of prima facie evidence said Kejirwal. The Delhi CM said, “Audio clip of Khan was submitted to us last day. We have taken action against him on basis of prima facie evidence within 24 hours.” Stating that AAP is committed to its Zero tolerance policy against corruption he said that the case will be referred for CBI inquiry. \nAs per allegation, Khan demanded Rs 6 lakh as bribe for an illegal construction in his constituency Matia Mahal. This is the first incident when Kejriwal had taken proactive measures and sacked his own partymen on serious charges. Bali Maran MLA Imran Hussain will replace Khan. Kejriwal added that he had started a new culture of by taking suo-moto action against its own minister and BJP should follow it. “BJP should take action against Vasundhara Raje (Rajasthan CM) and Shivraj Singh Chauhan (MP CM). \nBJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar had expressed doubts over sacking, “His is always in fight mode, sometimes with PM modi, sometimes his own partymen. We will answer Kejriwal in Delhi .”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:49:11.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
