Martinelli & Company of Watsonville, California , today announced a voluntary nationwide recall of certain lots of Martinelli's 8.4 oz. mini glass bottles of Gold Medal Sparkling Cider, Sparkling Cider Northwest Blend, Sparkling White Grape, and Sparkling Red Grape, due to the possibility of small glass chips at the top of the bottles occurring when opening the bottle, which could possibly enter the beverage. Consumers could potentially be cut or injured if a chip occurs.\nOnly certain lots of the 8.4 oz. bottles, typically known in the trade as \"mini-bottles,\" of Martinelli's Gold Medal Sparkling Cider, Sparkling Cider Northwest Blend, Sparkling White Grape and Sparkling Red Grape are affected by this recall. The recalled products have a \"Best Before\" date of after March 1, 2018 , but before September 12, 2018 , on the front label of the bottle. A complete list of the product names, item numbers, \"Best Before\" dates, UPC codes, and images for the products affected are included in Exhibit A attached.\nThe company announced this recall after internal testing identified the potential for some bottles to chip when being opened. This recall is being done out of an abundance of caution.\nNo other Martinelli's beverage or size bottle is impacted. The 750 ml \"champagne\" and the 10 oz. bottles are not included in this recall.\nAll recalled products are being removed from store shelves.\nConsumers who have purchased the product can return the product to its place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-800-662-1868 at any time, 24 hours a day.\nS. Martinelli & Company is committed to ensuring the quality and safety of all of our products.\nThis recall is being conducted with the knowledge of and in cooperation with the Federal Food and Drug Administration.\nContact Number: 1-800-662-1868\nEXHIBIT A\nProduct name/description :\n12256 Martinelli's Gold Medal Sparkling Cider (12 pack)\nProduction Date\n\"Best Before\" Date\nSKU/UPC\n3/05/15\n05 Mar 2018\n4124400256\n3/06/15\n06 Mar 2018\n4124400256\n3/07/15\n07 Mar 2018\n4124400256\n3/25/15\n25 Mar 2018\n4124400256\n3/26/15\n26 Mar 2018\n4124400256\n3/27/15\n27 Mar 2018\n4124400256\n4/02/15\n02 Apr 2018\n4124400256\n4/03/15\n03 Apr 2018\n4124400256\n4/04/15\n04 Apr 2018\n4124400256\n4/06/15\n06 Apr 2018\n4124400256\n4/07/15\n07 Apr 2018\n4124400256\n4/08/15\n08 Apr 2018\n4124400256\n4/09/15\n09 Apr 2018\n4124400256\n4/10/15\n10 Apr 2018\n4124400256\n4/11/15\n11 Apr 2018\n4124400256\nProduct name/description :\n46256 Martinelli's Gold Medal Sparkling Cider (4-6 pack bundles)\nProduction Date\n\"Best Before\" Date\nSKU/UPC\n3/02/15\n02 Mar 2018\n41244 46256\n3/03/15\n03 Mar 2018\n41244 46256\n3/04/15\n04 Mar 2018\n41244 46256\n4/13/15\n13 Apr 2018\n41244 46256\n4/14/15\n14 Apr 2018\n41244 46256\n4/15/15\n15 Apr 2018\n41244 46256\nProduct name/description :\n99957 Martinelli's Sparkling Cider Northwest Blend (12 pack)\nProduction Date\n\"Best Before\" Date\nSKU/UPC\n3/20/15\n03 Mar 2018\n41244 99057\n3/21/15\n21 Mar 2018\n41244 99057\n3/23/15\n23 Mar 2018\n41244 99057\n3/24/15\n24 Mar 2018\n41244 99057\n3/25/15\n25 Mar 2018\n41244 99057\n4/15/15\n15 Apr 2018\n41244 99057\n4/16/15\n16 Apr 2018\n41244 99057\n5/05/15\n05 May 2018\n41244 99057\n5/06/15\n06 May 2018\n41244 99057\n5/07/15\n07 May 2018\n41244 99057\n5/11/15\n11 May 2018\n41244 99057\n5/12/15\n12 May 2018\n41244 99057\n5/13/15\n13 May 2018\n41244 99057\n5/14/15\n14 May 2018\n41244 99057\n5/15/15\n15 May 2018\n41244 99057\nProduct name/description :\n99925 Martinelli's Sparkling White Grape (12-pack)\nProduction Date\n\"Best Before\" Date\nSKU/UPC\n5/07/15\n07 May 2018\n41244 99025\n5/08/15\n08 May 2018\n41244 99025\n5/09/15\n09 May 2018\n41244 99025\nProduct name/description :\n99926 Martinelli's Sparkling Red Grape (12 pack) – (flint glass)\nProduction Date\n\"Best Before\" Date\nSKU/UPC\n5/28/15\n28 May 2018\n41244 99026\n5/29/15\n29 May 2018\n41244 99026\n5/30/15\n30 May 2018\n41244 99026\n9/02/15\n02 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/03/15\n03 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/04/15\n04 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\nProduct name/description :\n64926 Martinelli's Sparkling Red Grape (4-6 pack) – (flint glass)\nProduction Date\n\"Best Before\" Date\nSKU/UPC\n8/31/15\n31 Aug 2018\n41244 99026\n9/01/15\n01 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/02/15\n02 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/04/15\n04 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/05/15\n05 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/08/15\n08 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/09/15\n09 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/10/15\n10 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\n9/11/15\n11 Sep 2018\n41244 99026\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277414\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277413\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277412\n releases/notice-of-voluntary-recall-of-certain-martinellis-84-oz-sparkling-beverages-due-to-potential-for-glass-fragments-300160684.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/notice-of-voluntary-recall-of-certain-martinellis-84-oz-sparkling-beverages-due-to-potential-for-glass-fragments-300160684.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277414", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151015/277412", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277412", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151015/277414", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151015/277413", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY29781&Transmission_Id=201510151514PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY29781&DateId=20151015", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151015/277413"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:09:46.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
