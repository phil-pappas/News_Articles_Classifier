The money is in the custody or a court-appointed trustee after President Barack Obama in 2012 ordered Iranian assets blocked, including those of Bank Markazi.\nEach family was expected to receive about $5 million after attorney fees.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:06:39.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
