The thought of not being able to sink your teeth in something sweet and comforting can be daunting for most. Keeping this in mind, Deborah Schipper, a foodie with a big sweet tooth, came up with the Cake Cleanse. She had struggled with skin issues, and varying hunger and energy levels and wanted to create a program that made cakes, brownies and pancakes a healthy affair. Deborah has written a book with over 100 recipes using healthy ingredients like dates, coconut milk, greek yoghurt, banana, stevia and no artifical sugars. She offers a detailed four-week plan for those interested and says the cleanse has helped her with most of her health issues. While desserts made of nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables is not new, could following a cleanse help?\nCleanse is a fancy term\nSugar is not the problem when dieting explains Suman Agarwal, celebrity nutritionist and fitness consultant. The issue is the fat and carbohydrates consumed. “Following a cleanse one can lose two to three kilos but it’s not possible to stick to it and maintain the weight. The juice cleanse that became popular a while back has the same problem, as the weight comes back. The Cake Cleanse might work for 10 days if someone wants a change from their regular fare. In fact, I always tell my clients to treat themselves once a week as sometimes the body needs energy food,” says Suman. “Cleanse is just a fancy term used as a fad. Cleansing the body can actually be done in one day by drinking salt water, eating ghee rotis, practising yoga asanas and cleaning your gut. In India, we all follow so many fasts that we cleanse the body in our own way,” she adds.\nTaste may differ\nDhvani Shah​, mother and child nutritionist says today homemakers are coming up with several sugar-free and gluten-free food options. “However, such trends are only followed in metro cities and not in small towns and rural areas. This diet is not going to give any additional health benefits. We cannot assure appropriate nourishment through dessert and cakes. Such diets only assure that the harmful effects are negated. Also, cakes made of the abovementioned ingredients are not delicious in taste and thus can take time for children to develop the taste. Such programs work better in western countries as they follow the trend of packaged food, muffins, colas and sugary drinks. However, that’s not the case in India as homemade food is still popular and the diet followed in India is not a processed one,” she adds.\nSweet Talk\nSophie Choudry, Actress, singer and former VJ\nI have a sweet tooth, but I’m health-conscious so I am very excited about the fact that there are people making healthy raw cakes that taste incredible! In fact, you can get all kinds of sweet treats made with natural sugars from dates, nuts, coconut, raw cacao, banana, chia seed puddings, walnut and raw cacao truffles with a dash of whey protein. One of my birthday cakes was a raw strawberry cake which means there was no flour, sugar, no baking involved. It’s more like a frozen cake with only nutritious ingredients! I don’t like stevia at all, so I like treats made without it!\nDiandra Soares, Model\nAll diet stuff tastes awful, for example — diet mayo, diet cola, diet chips — so honestly I don’t believe these cakes will taste like the real stuff anyway! If I want dates and bananas and yoghurt — that I eat anyway, if I want cake then cake should taste like cake, full of the real deal. Anyway, I don’t believe in diets!\nCandice Pinto, Model\nI believe in eating everything but in proportion, I work out to be healthy and fit. Everyone’s body is built and made differently. Keeping in mind one’s lifestyle, programs are made by trainers and nutritionists. Whether it’s dates or bananas or fruits — everything has some sugar and our body needs it. I would rather be eating a good dessert or something sweet, satisfy myself and burn it out at the gym than try a Cake Cleanse.\nDeepti Gujral, Model\nI’m the last person to follow diets as I don’t believe in them. I try to stay away from junk and processed food but I do occasionally have cravings. Instead of trying a cleanse, one needs to maintain a good lifestyle that involves eating home cooked food in moderate quantity and exercising regularly. The ingredients in the cake recipes sound healthy but dry fruits too have hidden sugars and fat, and should not be overdone. I’d rather eat right kind of foods and not starve myself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:15:26.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
