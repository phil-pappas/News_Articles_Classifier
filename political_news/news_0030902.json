Martin O'Malley; former Navy Secretary and U.S. senator Jim Webb; and, former Rhode Island governor and U.S. senator Lincoln Chafee.\nClick here to watch CNN's live stream of the debate.\nClinton seeks to move past her email woes. Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's 2008 White House campaign said \"this will be a win for her no matter how you look at it,\" as long as the issue of Clinton's email doesn't dominate the debate.\nSanders hopes to broaden his appeal, and poses the biggest challenge to the weakened front-runner and former secretary-of-state Clinton. Sanders has energized liberals with his call for a \"political revolution.\"\nMuch of the focus of the debate will be how Clinton and Sanders engage one another. Both have gone long stretches in the campaign without mentioning each other's names.\nFollow @TheBrodyFile and @AmberCStrong to get live updates from the debate.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AmberCStrong", "http://go.cnn.com/?stream=cnn", "https://twitter.com/TheBrodyFile"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:33:44.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
