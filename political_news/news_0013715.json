The government has sold out home buyers who are forced to compete with cashed up foreign buyers, who have a favourable exchange rate, and many who have access to low interest rates from overseas,\" says Mr Tabuteau. \n\"We can only conclude if any New Zealand government in the future wants to ban or put taxes or stamp duties on foreign property purchases, the government could well be sued under the TPPA Investor State Dispute Settlement clause. \n\"Minister Groser and Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce simply refused today to answer New Zealand Firstâ€™s questions about the TPPA. They evaded the questions on banning property sales to foreigners, and they avoided specific questions on how the TPPA will benefit the regions,\" says Mr Tabuteau. \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
