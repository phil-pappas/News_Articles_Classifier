(AP Photo/Charles Sykes, FILE)\nAssociated Press Oct. 18, 2015 | 6:43 a.m. EDT + More NEW YORK (AP) — Tracy Morgan returned to a familiar stage, hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" in his first appearance on the show since a vehicle crash that left him in a coma.\n\"I was in a terrible car accident more than a year ago. It was awful, but it also showed me how much love and support I have in this world,\" the comic said in his opening monologue.\n\"People are wondering, 'Can he speak? Does he have 100 percent mental capacity?'\" he asked. \"The truth is, I never did. I might even be a few points higher.\"\nIn one sketch, he was joined by \"30 Rock\" co-stars Tina Fey, Alec Baldwin, Jane Krakowski and Jack McBrayer. Fey broke character to inject a serious note: \"We're so happy you're OK. We're even happier you're ready to make people laugh again.\"\nMorgan also brought back a couple of his familiar characters — Astronaut Jones (stranded on Mars, a la Matt Damon in \"The Martian\") and animal expert Brian Fellow (joined by a real camel, who mostly cooperated).\nMorgan suffered severe head trauma in June 2014 when a truck on the New Jersey Turnpike slammed into the back of the limo van he was riding in. Comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair, a mentor of Morgan's, was killed in the crash. Morgan was in a coma for two weeks. Three other passengers suffered serious injuries.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
