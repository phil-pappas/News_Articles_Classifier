(Photo: Via Facebook) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- A plastic cross has been taken down from a playhouse at a Mecklenburg County park after a woman complained that she was offended by a symbol of Christianity in a public park. \nCounty Parks and Recreation Director Jim Garges agreed and the cross came down from the structure in the children's playground at Park Road Park. \n\"You know, obviously we had to take the cross down,\" Garges said. \nWhen the playground was first opened it was dedicated to the children and teachers who died in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut. \nGarges said local kids played a role in deciding what the playground would look like. \n\"I think the intention of the church was something the kids wanted to reflect in the community, but we have to keep a separation between church and state.\" Removing that plastic red cross from the memorial to the victims of Sandy Hook is petty. The @MeckCounty St. Mary's Cross erected in 1880's — Bill James (@meckcommish) October 13, 2015 \nCounty Commissioner Bill James took to Twitter calling the removal of the cross, \"petty.\" So, what other 'Crosses' are on @MeckCounty govco land? How about St. Mary's Chapel in Thompson Park? pic.twitter.com/8OjgZfe99G — Bill James (@meckcommish) October 13, 2015 \nJames pointed out that there is an entire chapel built right in the middle of the county's Thompson Park near uptown. \nIn an interview, James said, \"The steeple is on Mecklenburg County property. There is a stained glass window with a cross in it. Is she going to take those down too?\" \nParks Director Jim Garges said he believes he did the right thing. \n\"It doesn't tarnish why we did the playground. The playground is there to remember the children and families that were so impacted,\" Garges said.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/13/small-cross-taken-down-from-charlotte-public-park/73899434/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:43:19.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
