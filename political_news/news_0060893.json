Hillary Clinton will attend the dinner, but has not yet set her schedule for earlier in the day. \nThe rally is free and open to the public, but RSVPs are encouraged . It begins at 3 p.m. It’ll be Bill Clinton’s first appearance in Iowa of the 2016 campaign season. (He was last here in November, 2014, to campaign for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Braley.) \nAll five major Democratic Party candidates will attend the “JJ” dinner, which historically has marked the beginning of the final stage of the Iowa caucuses campaign. Candidates often use the event to wow their supporters with star power and show off their grassroots organizational strength to other candidates and the media.
