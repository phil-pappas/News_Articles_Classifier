Photo: Mario Anzuoni/Corbis\nSome exciting news from Alanis Morissette (man, we do not get to say that enough): She’s launching a monthly self-help podcast called “Conversations With Alanis,” where she’ll \"dive into science, neurobiology, music, travel, social commentary, maybe a tiny bit of politics, and feminism. The conversations will touch on topics that move the guest and Alanis herself toward philosophizing in real time, as well as illuminate any teachings, ideas, and models already established,\" per the iTunes description.\nThe first episode is a deep, thoughtful conversation about Katherine Woodward Thomas, the woman who taught us how to consciously uncouple .
