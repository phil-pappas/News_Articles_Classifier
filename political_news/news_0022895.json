Chris Christie speaks during a news conference, Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. \nA super PAC supporting Governor Christie in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination is spending nearly $700,000 on a new television ad this week, taking its total spending to nearly $6 million. \nAmerica Leads has spent half of the $11 million it raised as of June 30, according to records filed this week with the Federal Election Commission. \nThe group, which is run by former Christie aides, spent $703,000 this week producing a new ad for cable-television markets, and purchasing online ad space on Facebook and Google, it reported to the FEC. \nThe ad buy came a day before Christie sets out again for New Hampshire, the first state to hold a presidential primary. Christie has visited the state more than any other this year, banking on its GOP base to give his campaign much-needed momentum. He will hold six town halls this week highlighting a new, populist, anti-Washington campaign theme. \nThe 30-second ad consists of footage from Christie's speech declaring his candidacy this summer. With his family in the background, Christie runs down his work managing the Superstorm Sandy recovery, passing balanced budgets as required by law every year, and enacting measures to \"reform\" the state pension system. \nThe ad is called \"Reformer\" on YouTube, and dovetails with one of Christie's familiar campaign themes attacking the dysfunction in Congress and offering himself as a tested leader who can achieve compromise. \nAs a super PAC, America Leads can raise unlimited amounts of money to promote Christie’s candidacy. The benefit for donors is that they can circumvent the contribution limits they would face in giving directly to Christie’s campaign. By donating to America Leads, donors may give as much as they want – and the PAC, in turn, spends it on Christie-themed advertising. \nThe benefit for Christie is that he can effectively outsource one of the most expensive components of the presidential campaign – buying television ads – to an outside group run by close associates. Phil Cox, who was executive director for the Republican Governors Association when Christie was chairman, runs the super PAC. \nThat kind of deep-pocketed support has helped Christie remain in contention for the GOP nomination despite a tough summer in which he failed to drive up his low poll numbers. A national poll of Republicans released Tuesday by Public Policy Polling found Christie with 2 percent of support in a crowded GOP field led by businessman Donald Trump. \nBut America Leads has not been among the top fundraisers or spenders this year. Right to Rise, a super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, is spending $6 million on television ads just in Iowa – the same amount America Leads has spent all year. \nIndependent spending groups have become a staple of political campaigns since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v. FEC in 2010. Super PACs have unleashed hundreds of millions of dollars into the political arena since that ruling, in contests from the presidential race to state elections and local council races. \nEmail: rizzo@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:58:04.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
