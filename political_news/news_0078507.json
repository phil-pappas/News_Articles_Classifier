Trump said Friday that he would \"absolutely\" put Carson in his Cabinet if he were to win the presidency. \"I would put him -- I'd love to have that,\" Trump said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" Trump called Carson a \"nice man\" and said so far the two have had a \"very good relationship,\" seemingly ignoring a roughly two-week span in September during which the two traded jabs on faith and energy. The real estate mogul said that while Carson would be \"qualified\" to win the GOP nomination and presidency, he wouldn't do the job as well as a President Trump. He doubted Carson's abilities as a tough negotiator. \"I would say it's not his wheelhouse, but that I don't know,\" Trump said. However, there's still room for Carson in Trump's Washington. \"Certain elements of the administration, I think he'd be very good,\" he said, ignoring a question about what those roles would be. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:46:13.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
