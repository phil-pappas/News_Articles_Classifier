Justin Amash, a Tea Party Republican from Michigan, introduced the amendment to remove the provision, which was rejected by voice vote. A roll call vote was called, which made clear that removing the multi-million dollar rider was unpopular not only with the Republicans, but more so on the Democratic side. Two Democrats were for it, while 173 opposed the Amash amendment. Republicans opposed to it totaled 133.\nThe controversy spiked earlier this week as some conservative groups that support repealing the oil export ban said they would have to withdraw that support due to the rider. Many referred to the rider as part of a \"back-room deal\" that spoiled the original bill.\n  Seth Rogen to Ben Carson: 'F--- you' Rogen expressed his exasperation about Ben Carson's recent string of controversial comments.\nBy Joshua Axelrod • 10/09/15 5:19 PM Lobbyists for refiners say the provision was an attempt to make the bill immune to a presidential veto, which the White House said is a certainty. The bill would require 290 votes in the House to make it veto proof.\n\n\nTop Story Book: Valerie Jarrett got Joe Biden 'psychiatric help' for 2016 Ed Klein's book claims   hard for Biden to enter the race.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 10/09/15 1:43 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:01:42.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
