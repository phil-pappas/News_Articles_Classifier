His three-point list of her “perceived weakness” begins by stating that the Government would benefit from a fall in unemployment, before highlighting two personal flaws.\nThese read: “A more general insensitivity: a belief that you do not care for people – all of this linked with so-called ‘cuts’.”\nFollowed by: “A hectoring, strident, bossy, dictatorial personality (which does not survive an encounter with you).”\nBut Ingham, one of Lady Thatcher’s closest advisers, goes out of his way to point out that he does not believe this image of the Prime Minister is fair.\nAlthough Ingham added: “I do not believe it is possible for a woman in a still male-dominated media to deal conclusively with the hectoring, strident, bossy point.” he wrote.\n“Just comfort yourself with the thought that wherever you go on tour it is the women, of all ages, who want to hail you as their equivalent of the female four-minute mile, however they vote.”\nMr Collins, the only historian to have studied the papers to date, said the Prime Minister showed few signs of having heeded this advice in the speech she delivered at Blackpool.\nHe added: “It is nothing he wouldn’t have said to her before, albeit a very clear and strong note.\n“Her public image was so fixed that she couldn’t win - if she had suddenly shown a softer side, people would not have believed it.”\nThe Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust is gradually overseeing the release of her private files through the Churchill Archive Centre in Cambridge.\nShare article The latest release follows the opening of her official files from the same year at the National Archives in Kew.\nMembers of the public will be able to browse the archive from Monday by visiting www.margaretthatcher.org.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-10T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:59:46.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
