The Minister’s plan unfortunately leaves any changes of this nature out.\" \nThe Minister of Health released a plan yesterday with 22 recommendations to address childhood obesity. Mr Mearns; \"The Minister seems to be ignoring his own experts, such as the Prime Minister's Chief Science Advisor who co-chaired the World Commission on ending childhood obesity which recommended major restrictions on unhealthy food marketing to children as well as a number of regulatory changes.\" \nThe Minister’s recommendations focus on education and health promotion but no regulation of sugar content, marketing of junk foods or any taxes on sugary drinks, all of which the World Health Organisation recommended in their Interim Report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity. \n\"The Minister is tinkering around the edges of the problem, rather than tackling the key drivers of our children’s health crisis, and the plan he has laid out is not enough to curb that crisis.\" says Mr Mearns \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:28:03.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
