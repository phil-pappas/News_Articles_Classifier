Edgar Hoover Building, the headquarters of the FBI, in August. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post) October 22 at 5:54 PM The Oct. 17 front-page article “ Decaying Hoover Building a symbol of inefficiency ” gave the impression that the FBI headquarters is staffed only by agents, especially by reporting that a gift shop on the eighth floor is “accessible only to agents and their friends and family whom they escort upstairs.” It may be a small matter to those who never worked for the FBI, but it denigrated the FBI employees who comprise the majority of the staff at the headquarters.\nI am a retired FBI employee. The contributions of the many staff workers who put the mission before the working conditions are often ignored by the media. Most of the staff spend their entire careers in the Hoover Building, while the agents are usually there for a few years. The building was already outdated when I entered duty in 1981, and I find it shameful that it is taking so long to relocate the FBI.\nSarah Zeigler , Dumfries", "external_links": ["http://xml.apache.org/xslt"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:32:51.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
