(Picture Courtesy: AFP) Melbourne : A cancer-causing parasitic worm responsible for the deaths of about 26,000 people a year that could help patients recover from their chronic wounds, Australian researchers have claimed. James Cook University (JCU) scientists at Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine (AITHM) have discovered that the parasitic worm that kills tens of thousands of people every year may also supercharge recovery from wounds. The oriental liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini is caught by eating south-east Asian fish raw. It infects millions of people in south-east Asia and kills 26,000 people each year due to a parasite-induced bile duct cancer it causes, known as cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). JCU scientists, Michael Smout and Alex Loukas found that a growth factor secreted by the one centimetre-long worm drives wound healing and blood vessel growth. However an unfortunate consequence of this accelerated wound repair over many years is an increased risk of developing liver cancer. \"The discovery means it's possible the growth factor could be used to accelerate the healing of chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers and to develop a vaccine against the worm-induced cancer. \"The vaccine would obviously benefit the people directly at risk of cancer, but the growth factor would also benefit the developed world as a possible wound healing agent,\" said Smout. \"Diabetes is a big problem as we live longer and get heavier,\" he said adding?\"There are increasing numbers of inflammatory diseases such as diabetes and associated non-healing wounds.\" Smout said the parasite could live for decades in the human body before CCA develops and it had an incentive to keep its host healthy while chewing away at its cells. He said scientists are still learning how this growth factor controls healing, and ultimate development of the discovery as a healing agent or vaccine was still a number of years away. parasitic worm cancer causing worm cancer Opisthorchis viverrini Also Read Cancer drugs get nod without trials Vitamin D may reduce progression of low-grade prostate cancer Not getting enough Vitamin D?
