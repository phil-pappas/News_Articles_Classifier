The rally appeared to be the most significant in size in the country after a call for protests against Islam in America this weekend. \nUsama Shami, president of the Islamic Community Center, says rally organizers are displaying their bigotry. \nRally organizer John Ritzheimer says he is not against Muslims, but he is against what he calls their ideology. He led a rally at the mosque in May after two former congregants were killed when they tried to attack an anti-Islam event in Texas. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:17:34.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
