That debate was hosted by ABC, and featured current Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and President Obama, who was a senator at the time.\nBut while the Tuesday night debate set a record for Democratic debates, its viewership was still much lower than two Republican debates hosted separately by Fox News in August and CNN in September.\nFox's debate drew 24 million viewers while CNN's got 23 million. Both debates are believed to have received a boost in public interest by billionaire businessman and former reality TV star Donald Trump.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Republicans set up viewing room for Planned Parenthood videos House Oversight Committee has received the footage Chaffetz subpoenaed from the videos' producer.\nBy Paige Winfield Cunningham â€¢ 10/14/15 2:31 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:33:05.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
