More CofE apologises for bishop’s sex assault \nThe Chinese president spent Thursday evening at Chequers, David Cameron’s official country home, discussing foreign policy issues. \nDowning Street said Mr Cameron and Mr Xi discussed security issues over dinner at Chequers, including “the importance of the South China Sea” — a reference to Beijing’s military build-up in the region. \nMr Xi then headed north to bestow his blessing on Mr Osborne’s northern powerhouse project . \nConfirmation that Hainan Airlines will operate a flight between Manchester and Beijing is the key announcement of Mr Xi’s trip north, which will also take in a meeting with some of the city’s leading football stars. \nThe Hainan Airlines flight is the first year-round connection between an airport outside London and the mainland and could contribute £50m annually to the city’s economy. Birmingham operates summer charters. \nBut despite the hoopla surrounding the visit, just £4m of new investment from China is likely to be announced on Mr Xi’s tour with the prime minister. \nGrandiose talk of an economic link between China’s attempt to revive the ancient Silk Road and Mr Osborne’s plan to rejuvenate the north of England has yet to be matched by serious cash. \nBeijing Construction and Engineering Group (BCEG) is providing £4m development financing to help kick-start the building of apartment blocks at Middlewood Locks, on desolate land on the Manchester-Salford border. It will be the lead contractor. \nLast month Hualing Group agreed to invest a reported £60m in Middlewood Locks, Thorpe Park, in Leeds and a digital campus in Sheffield in a deal with developer Scarborough Group. \nBCEG in 2013 spent £12m on a 20 per cent stake in Airport City, a new commercial district close to the airport that would cost £800m to build in full. \nMr Cameron said: “We are committed to rebalancing our economy and building a northern powerhouse. China is a key trading partner for the UK and the partnerships being made today will see real investment going into the north.” \nThe University of Central Lancashire is setting up a joint innovation and entrepreneurship campus with the Shenzhen government in south-eastern China. Liverpool and Nottingham universities already have campuses in China. \nNorthern council leaders will showcase £24bn of potential infrastructure projects to Chinese businesses, before dining with Mr Cameron and Mr Xi at Manchester town hall, alongside business and community leaders. \nMr Xi is also visiting the National Graphene Institute , which hopes to commercialise the superstrong, superlight material. \nBut his personal highlight will be a trip to Manchester City’s training facility. There the football fan will meet former stars from City and United, including Gary Neville and Denis Law. \nMeanwhile, Mr Osborne will on Friday claim that his drive to re-energise regional city government has “unstoppable momentum” after the north-east and Tees Valley signed an agreement to take on new powers. \nBoth areas will vote for a directly elected mayor in 2017 and take on a range of new powers as part of the government’s plans to take power out of Whitehall and hand it back to local people. \n“The old model of trying to run everything in our country from the centre is broken,” Mr Osborne will say. \nMeanwhile Sir Danny Alexander, the former Liberal Democrat Treasury chief secretary, declined to comment on Bloomberg reports he was in the running to join the board of China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. \nMr Osborne is understood to have put Sir Danny’s name forward, but Treasury insiders said it was very early in the process and it was not even clear that Britain would have a seat on the board.
