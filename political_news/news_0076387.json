Wiley Hayes Contact Reporter Carroll County Times Protest draws equal support, opposition on Rothschild editorial \nA coalition of interfaith groups protesting a recent opinion piece , which was written by Commissioner Richard Rothschild, R-District 4, and defended presidential candidate Ben Carson's comment that a follower of Islam can not be president, attracted a crowd that was anything but one-sided. \nZainab Chaudry, Maryland outreach manager for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a national group whose stated mission is to advocate for justice and mutual understanding of the Islamic religion, was flanked by representatives of The ACLU of Maryland, the Jewish Voice for Peace, the Interfaith Action for Human Rights and a handful of supporters. They faced off against a similar number of Rothschild supporters. \n\"His Islamophobic rhetoric was disturbing to all who cherish American values,\" Chaudry said before a news conference outside of the Carroll County Office Building in Westminster. \"It's especially important as an elected official not to exhibit prejudice and judgment.\" \nThe coalition presented a letter to Commissioners Dennis Frazier, R-District 3, and Richard Weaver, R-District 2, that asks the other commissioners to publicly and officially repudiate Rothschild's comments. \nBefore the news conference, she questioned the commissioner's commentary, which she called \"hate-filled\" and \"un-American.\" \n\"This kind of misunderstanding contributes to fear and hostility,\" Chaudry said during the news conference, \"and extremists end up defining the remaining Muslims in the world.\" \nA coalition of interfaith groups protesting a recent opinion column by Commissioner Richard Rothschild, R-District 4, that defended presidential candidate Ben Carson's comment that a follower of Islam could not be president, attracted a crowd that was anything but one-sided. \n\"Those are lies,\" interrupted Bruce Holstein, Rothschild's campaign manager. During the news conference, Holstein held a cardboard sign that read \"Rothschild is Right, CAIR is Wrong.\" Before the news conference he said the claims made by the council and its affiliates about the column were unfounded. \n\"Most of what they are talking about they made up,\" he said. \"Then they proceeded to denigrate his argument. We need to focus on Islamic law, and that is incompatible with the Constitution.\" \nRothschild said in the opinion piece, which appeared Monday in the Carroll County Times , that because the country was founded on Judeo-Christian values, there are fundamental differences in these faiths that would make it irreconcilable for a president to \"obey Islam and take an oath to God to defend the Constitution.\" That president \"will either be violating his oath to Islam, or committing perjury when he swears to uphold the Constitution,\" Rothschild wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:37:03.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
