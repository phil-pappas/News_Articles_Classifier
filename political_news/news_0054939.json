The agenda included two hours of debate time plus four commercial breaks and no opening or closing statements.\n\"We thought that the only way to make sure that candidates are heard early and late was not to rely on the moderators,\" he said, referring to the push for opening and closing statements.\nThe letter came after a heated call between the campaigns and the Republican National Committee over the debate's format.\nNeither Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski nor Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks immediately responded to requests for comment. But Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to express his anger.\n\"The @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party,\" he said. He accused the network of trying to lengthen the debate in order to sell more ads. Trump has complained often about the second debate, hosted by CNN, which stretched on for a marathon three hours.\nCNBC spokesman Brian Steel said in a statement that the network was aiming to host \"the most substantive debate possible,\" but was open to changing the format.\n\"Our practice in the past has been to forego opening statements to allow more time to address the critical issues that matter most to the American people,\" he said. \"We started a dialogue yesterday with all of the campaigns involved and we will certainly take the candidates' views on the format into consideration as we finalize the debate structure.\"\nTrump and Carson have developed a unique rapport, with little fighting between the two despite the fact that Carson has been gaining on Trump in opinion polls.\nThe topic of debates has been a contentious one throughout the campaign, with both Democrats and Republicans sparring over who is included on stage and how much time they're allotted.\nDuring the first Democratic debate this week , former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb complained repeatedly about how little time he had to answer questions. He said Thursday he felt the debate had been \"rigged in terms of who was going to get the time on the floor.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:24:20.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
