I am determined to ensure performance continues to improve across the NHS.”\n– Vaughan Gething AM, Deputy Health Minister Last updated Wed 30 Sep 2015 Health NHS Cardiff Wales Newport Swansea North Wales South Wales Gwent Mid and West Wales", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:00:21.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
