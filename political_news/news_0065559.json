The aircraft, equipped with the latest night-vision sighting equipment, reportedly made five 15-minute assaults on the hospital’s main building housing the emergency operating room and recovery rooms, firing its array of howitzer cannons, 30 millimeter machine canons and other heavy weapons that included both high-explosive tips and anti-personnel rounds designed to scatter death in a wide pattern.\nThis is, in other words, not a precision targeting weapon, but a weapon’s system designed to spread death over a wide swath.\nIt explains why the building itself was not leveled, as happens when, for example, a drone first Hellfire missiles at a building. Rather, the hospital was set on fire by incendiary weapons, and the people inside were killed by a spray of bullets and anti-personnel flechettes.\nBad enough to attack a hospital, but to attack it with a weapons system designed to slaughter as many people as possible is almost beyond comprehension.\nThe hospital in Kunduz was a well-known and long-established institution with a distinctive shape operating in a city that until recently was under full government control. That the US/NATO command did not clearly know the function of that structure is inconceivable, despite US government efforts to claim that a specific provision of the hospital’s coordinates to US forces by Medicine Sans Frontieres days before the attack “must have” gotten waylaid somewhere along the way.
