The fiscal year ends June 30, 2016.\nFirst-quarter property tax collections came in at $38.6 million, an increase of 5.83 percent over the $36.5 million during that same period last year. Most property taxes are paid in December when mortgage companies release the funds and in February, when they're late.\nOverall tax collections are expected to come in at $729 million.\nHowever, delinquent collections were down, with $8.5 million collected during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, compared with $11.6 million in fiscal 2015, a decrease of 26.5 percent.\n\"It causes me a little bit of concern, but my heartburn's not going to flare up until another three or four months, when I see where delinquent collections are,\" Lenoir said.\nEvery morning he gets an email showing where his staff's status on collections.\n\"We're not where we hope to be in delinquent collections. And my folks are working as hard as they can, so I know it's not a function of effort,\" he said.\nIt's possible that last year's delinquent collections took care of the low-hanging fruit, making collecting money this year more difficult.\nThe office holds delinquent taxpayer workshops that are well attended, but now they're bumped up against the folks who are really struggling, he said.\n\"We're doing everything we can. We're working with them,\" Lenoir said.\nThat's how Commissioner Steve Basar views it.\n\"The economy doing better, people are doing better, that's why collections up. People who were behind have caught up or they're never going to catch up,\" Basar said.\nLenoir came to the commission intent on making sure it was kept apprised throughout the year on the county's collections.\nThere was confusion at the end of the budget season, when it was learned that the trustee's office collected $22 million more than had been projected.\nIt wasn't the first time, he said, his office had come in $20 million ahead of projections, but commissioners seemed unaware of the numbers.\nHe's glad to see a renewed interest in the quarterly reports.\n\"Since it got so much conversation, I wanted to remind commissioners that we do these reports every three months,\" Lenoir said. \"I think it just started to take root with commission. That's super encouraging.\"\nFollow more politics and policy coverage from the InforMemphis team on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/informemphis", "http://www.twitter.com/informemphis"], "published": "2015-10-25T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:12:40.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
