They need only to examine the lyrics of his latest album, and view his behaviour in the past five years to see that Chris Brown is a troubled individual who is not a motivational speaker or role model that some would paint him to be or would like him to be,\" says Bob McCoskrie, National Director of Family First NZ. \n\"If Chris Brown speaks the way that youth in NZ speak, as Tariana Turia argues, then we’re in big trouble. Chris Brown’s endorsement by the Maori leaders will simply ingrain those messages.\" \n\"We firmly believe in rehabilitation and redemption and a second chance, Chris Brown is on his ‘umpteenth’ chance. His lyrics and actions demonstrate that he still has a long way to go in his rehabilitation - part of which is admitting and renouncing his crimes and attitudes, and changing his attitudes and language towards women.\" \n\"Maybe one day Brown will prove to us that he respects women, and that his words to young people will be words and attitudes that show respect and value - that reject sexual violence and the objectification and denigration of women. Hopefully that day will be soon,\" says Mr McCoskrie. \nThe government should reject his visa application. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T14:45:15.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
