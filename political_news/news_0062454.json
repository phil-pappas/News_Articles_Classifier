It’s the most sensible, cost-effective way to reduce pest numbers and allow native forests and wildlife to thrive” said Mr Hackwell. \nJust last week, the Department of Conservation released news that an aerial 1080 operation in the Eglington Valley has led to record survival rates for short-tailed bats in the area. 99% of the bat population survived, which is a great improvement on survival rates observed without pest control (50-60%) in a beech mast (seeding) year. \nInitial results from Auckland Council's 1080 programme in the Hunua Ranges look promising. The drop is expected to significantly reduce the number of rats and stoats in the region, helping to protect a range of native species, including the endangered kōkako and native Hochstetter’s frog. \nKevin Hackwell praised the police for putting in significant resources that have allowed this arrest to be made. \n\"New Zealanders responded very calmly to the threat, which indicates the public understand that those who use 1080 are very careful and take the appropriate precautions.\" Hackwell said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:04:57.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
