Bill Flores on Monday emailed colleagues telling them he plans to run for House speaker.\nThe third-term congressman from Texas is chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservatives that predates the upstart and more confrontational Freedom Caucus. Flores said he would withdraw from the contest and endorse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan if the Wisconsin Republican changes his mind and runs for speaker.\nThe email reads:\n\"In a few minutes, I will distribute the letter included below to all of our House GOP Conference Colleagues. As you will note, the letter announces my intention to run for Speaker of the House. In this regard, I would like to ask you for feedback to the following questions:\n  Donald Trump, No Labels hero On  \nBy Byron York • 10/12/15 9:49 PM \"1. Will you please provide feedback to me regarding this initiative?\"2. Would you be willing to support me for Speaker?\"3. Would you be willing to serve as part of the Flores for Speaker Whip Team?\"4. It is important to invite our Freshmen to participate in this process and I would appreciate your recommendations regarding Freshmen Members that we should ask to join our Flores for Speaker Whip Team.\"5. Will you please pray for God's wisdom and healing for our Conference?\" House Republicans are looking for a candidate for speaker who could unite their conference and win at least 218 votes on the floor for the position. Few seem interested in the position since House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California stunned members by withdrawing from the race.\nMcCarthy's exit prompted House Republicans to beg Ryan to reconsider his longstanding opposition to running for an elected leadership position. It's unclear how much support Flores could muster, although his short tenure in the House would likely be a major hurdle in rounding up the votes.\nSpeaker John Boehner of Ohio has said he will remain in office until the House elects his successor.\nTop Story Trump, the No Labels frontrunner On  \nBy Byron York • 10/12/15 9:49 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:12:38.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
