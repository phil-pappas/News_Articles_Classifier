Councils just use their monopoly position to come up with these tax schemes on a whim, not seeming to realise if they keep piling costs on to business they will fold. Then all of the community – including the council themselves – will be worse off.” \n“I hear Councils say they want to encourage economic development. If they were serious about this they would look to cut costs rather than forever seeking ways to increase them, letting businesses focus on growth and creating jobs rather than navigate the never-ending rolls of red tape and new tax,” Mr Baines concludes. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:27:24.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
