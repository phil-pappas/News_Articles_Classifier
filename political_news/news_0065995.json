Promoted stories \nCllr Perry, pictured below, said he is looking ahead to the announcement on the Government’s Comprehensive Spending Review on November 25 to see what the council will have to face in the future. \nAhead of the meeting he said it was vital they planned ahead for predicted additional budget pressures. \nHe added that the council was facing its \"greatest financial challenge yet\" and said: “Therefore, it’s essential we start preparing as early as possible for the financial picture ahead – taking into consideration the prospect of further likely cuts in our grant from Government, alongside the additional pressures we expect to face on our budgets, by the end of the decade. \n“On-going demand for social care to address the complex needs of growing numbers of older people, and vulnerable children and adults in Hampshire, continues to be a major factor in our financial considerations. \n“As we head towards 2020, we must also bear in mind the future cost implications of the national living wage when it’s introduced next year, particularly in the area of adult social care. \n“With growing pupil numbers across Hampshire, the provision of secondary school places will also significantly influence our budget forecasts. \n\"Taking all these factors into account, it represents the greatest financial challenge we face yet, and coming at the end of a previous eight years of austerity in the public sector. Share article \n“None of us can predict the future with any certainty, and indeed, not until the Government’s autumn statement which will cover a period, many of us hope will be the final years of austerity for the public sector. \n\"However, as we head towards 2020, it’s unlikely there will be any let up in the downward pressure on local government budgets that we have been seeing over the last decade.” Promoted Stories Hampshire County Council will meet tomorrow to decide whether to axe 450 jobs to save £98m   skeptik 6:23am Wed 21 Oct 15 \nParish councils, town and city, county, regions, commons and nearly 900 unelected lords (in a democracy ?) a very long list that would rival any attempt at designing the most perfect nonsense. Why is it that successful countries around the world do so with a fraction of the interference we put up with. Cuts to services paid for and expected by the taxpayer and yet do we see cuts to the huge drag anchor we call administration. We talk of modernization as long as it is not us, 'we have always done it this way'. I hope the young people of this great nation can see better ways because left to the old guard of my turn in the job nothing will ever change and that applies to all parties . The young should be asking or debating democracy and better ways of getting a deal for their limited monies. It is your future you can shape it better than the self seekers that politics attracts now.
