President Obama meets with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan in the Oval Office on Thursday.\nBy Teresa Welsh Oct. 23, 2015 | 5:57 p.m. EDT + More Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called his country \"an old and indispensable friend of the United States\" but said friends need to \"renew their relationships from time to time\" in a Friday speech in Washington, D.C., that struck a cooperative, yet subtly defiant, tone.\n\"America's objectives are convergent with Pakistan's. Our extensive cooperation on counterterrorism can be intensified and improved, especially by promoting mutual trust and confidence,\" Sharif said. \"I am visiting Washington to reaffirm and reinforce our important relationship.\"\nRELATED\nExperts Tell John Kerry What to Focus on After Iran Nuclear Deal Sharif spoke at the U.S. Institute of Peace a day after he met with President Barack Obama to discuss a range of bilateral issues, most notably Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear weapons cache and its cooperation in peace talks between Afghanistan and the Taliban. But while the two leaders released joint statements on girls' education, climate change and trade, as well as a vague call to enhance their military-to-military relationship, they did not announce any agreements with regard to Pakistan's nuclear program or a timeline for continued talks with the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nAn official White House summary of the meeting said Obama \"stressed the importance of avoiding any developments that might invite increased risk to nuclear safety, security or strategic stability.\" Some in Washington fear Pakistan has been increasing its nuclear arsenal, which could provoke further instability with its longtime regional rival India, also a nuclear power. An analysis released Thursday showed Pakistan's stockpile has grown to between 110 and 130 warheads from an estimated 90 to 110 in 2011.\nSharif said Friday that Pakistan respects international law with regard to its nuclear activity, but he stopped short of saying he intended to restrict the program.\n\"Pakistan is fully committed to the objectives of nonproliferation and disarmament,\" Sharif said. \"Pakistan is also participating in global efforts to prevent and combat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n[ READ: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Decries Violence, Says Mahmoud Abbas Is to Blame ]\nThe prime minister spoke about Pakistan's involvement in the peace process between the Afghan government and the Taliban, characterizing the role his country was asked to play as contradictory.\n\"I have again conveyed to President Ashraf Ghani that, if he desires, we are prepared to assist in reviving the talks between Kabul and Afghan Taliban. But we cannot bring them to the table and be asked to kill them at the same time,\" Sharif said.\nPakistan successfully brokered a first round of talks between the parties in July, but a second round was derailed after revelations that Taliban leader Mullah Omar had died two years ago. The Afghan government is wary of Pakistan's role as mediator, convinced it is secretly protecting Taliban.\nRELATED\nEritrean Mistaken for Assailant Killed in Israeli-Palestinian Violence\nSharif in his remarks Friday insisted that the 14-year failure of military force in Afghanistan demonstrated that a negotiated peace was the best option. Just last week, Obama seemed to acknowledge the precarious wake left by U.S. military involvement when he announced that American troops will remain in Afghanistan beyond 2016, a reversal of his plans to withdraw combat forces.\nThe U.S. and Pakistan struck an uneasy alliance in the course of the U.S.-led war on terror, during which Pakistan was the beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. aid. But relations have cooled in the wake of the 2011 U.S. special forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden, who had been hiding for years in a safe house in Abbottabad.\nSharif touted his accomplishments in reducing domestic terrorism since his election in 2013 but acknowledged the terrorist attack in Peshawar that killed 145 people in December. He also said he has made \"sincere efforts\" to repair relations with India. The two countries have a border dispute regarding the Kashmir region both claim as their own territory.\n\"There is no alternative for the two countries but to resume a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues,\" Sharif said.\nTAGS: Pakistan Taliban", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh8nn%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh8nn%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Pakistani%20Prime%20Minister%20Indicates%20His%20Country%20Won%27t%20Bow%20to%20U.S.%20Pressure", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh8nn%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh8nn%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Pakistani%20Prime%20Minister%20Indicates%20His%20Country%20Won%27t%20Bow%20to%20U.S.%20Pressure&summary=Prime%20Minister%20Nawaz%20Sharif%20gave%20no%20indication%20he%27s%20planning%20to%20restrict%20Pakistan%27s%20nuclear%20program.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://fas.org/blogs/security/2015/10/pakistan-notebook/", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh8nn%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Pakistani%20Prime%20Minister%20Indicates%20His%20Country%20Won%27t%20Bow%20to%20U.S.%20Pressure", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZeh8nn%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:03:38.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
