Many have to give up because it is so hard to have regular contact with their babies throughout the day and keep up their milk supply. \n\"Jonathan Coleman’s denial today in Parliament that extending paid parental leave would help mums breastfeed to 26 weeks shows how out of touch he is with the realities faced by New Zealand families who are trying to do the best for their children. \n\"If National was serious about fighting obesity, they would support my Member’s Bill to extend paid parental leave to six months,\" Sue Moroney says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:24:12.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
