Nationalists' leader at Westminster, said he hoped to use an Opposition Day Debate to call for Britain's nuclear deterrent to be scrapped.\nThe move would highlight the damaging split that has opened up within Labour since Mr Corbyn, a staunch opponent of nuclear weapons, was elected leader.\nMr Robertson outlined his intention as the Nationalists launched a concerted attack on Labour at the start of their conference in Aberdeen, which is being used as a launchpad for next year's Holyrood election campaign.\nUnderlining her determination to win an unprecedented second majority at the Scottish Parliament, Nicola Sturgeon said Labour was \"divided and in disarray\".\nStewart Hosie, the SNP's deputy leader, echoed the theme, telling conference delegates the party was the real opposition at Westminster and its 55 MPs had \"filled the vacuum left by a deeply divided Labour Party\".\nLabour abandoned plans to hold a debate on Trident at its conference in Brighton last month, with the shadow cabinet split on the issue and trade unions concerns about the impact of scrapping it on defence industry jobs.\nPromoted stories Labour's position was thrown into further disarray when Mr Corbyn said he would not push the nuclear button under any circumstances as Prime Minister.\nScottish Labour is set to debate Trident at its conference in Perth later this month, with opponents of the Clyde-based missile system hopeful that members will vote against its renewal and send a powerful message to the UK party.\nHowever, even if Labour does unite to oppose Trident, David Cameron's majority means the deterrent is certain to be renewed when MPs vote on the 'main gate' decision next year.\nMr Robertson told the conference: \"Labour weren't prepared to have a specific debate on Trident at their conference.\n\"I'm also happy to help Jeremy Corbyn and ensure that there is an early debate and vote at Westminster aimed at opposing Trident renewal.\n'Hopefully Jeremy will join the SNP in the lobbies as he has often done in the past in opposing Trident, although I am not holding my breath that he can bring his colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party with him.\"\nAs Westminster's third biggest party, the SNP expects to secure opposition debating time before the Christmas recess.\nA debate on Trident, which enjoys significantly lower support in Scotland than the UK as a whole, would have the potential to embarrass Labour just at the SNP seek to portray the party as weak and divided on a range of issues.\nMs Sturgeon underlined the message in her opening speech to conference, which she used to dampen supporters' hopes of an early rerun of last year's independence referendum and, instead, focus the party on next May's election.\nShe told delegates: \"There is much that I hoped the SNP and Jeremy Corbyn could work together on.\n\"But over these last few weeks, it has become glaringly obvious that he is unable to unite his party on any of the big issues of the day.\n\"Labour is unreliable, unelectable and unable to stand up to the Tories.\"\nMr Hosie also looked ahead to the election, promising a manifesto for \"reform\".\n\"With a manifesto stuffed full of good ideas, a membership of over 110,000 and a party unified from top to bottom, I expect us to campaign – and to deliver – another majority SNP Government,\" he said.\nA poll yesterday showed the SNP was on course to win a majority.\nThe YouGov survey put support for the Nationalists on 51 per cent in the constituency vote for Holyrood, 30 points ahead of Labour.\nShare article The Tories were just two points behind Labour on 19 per cent.\nMore than 3500 SNP delegates gathered at the start of the conference, the biggest in the party's history.", "external_links":
