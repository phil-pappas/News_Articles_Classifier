He said he made the trip to Annapolis on Monday, again, to voice a chief concern shared by state lawmakers: “It’s time to get the sick and dying off the battlefield of the drug war.” Public hearing on cannabis bills set for Monday (Rema Rahman) \nHe wasn’t the only one who admitted to using marijuana before Maryland allowed it to be available for medicinal purposes under state law. Operations are expected to be up and running next year. \nStephanie Pietry, who said she was a housewife from Severna Park, testified that she used medical cannabis to treat anxiety and depression. \n“The side effects are laughter and happiness,” she said. \nThe council also heard from a physician in Annapolis who spoke about how medical marijuana could be administered to patients. \nDr. William Tham told the council that medical marijuana could be available as an oil or as a product that could be inhaled as a vapor. (Rema Rahman) \nTham discredited a notion relayed by Police Chief Tim Altomare at a work session last week that the maximum medical marijuana allowed by the state — 120 grams over 30 days — is comparable to a doctor prescribing up to 300 OxycontinÖ pills. \n“It’s comparing apples to oranges,” Tham said. “There’s no medical basis to that.” \nLegislation backed by County Executive Steve Schuh’s administration initially prohibited growing, processing and dispensing of medical marijuana under every zoning classification in Anne Arundel County. \nWhen it became apparent that measure did not have enough votes to pass the County Council, Schuh secured support from four of the seven council members on an amendment to the bill that would place restrictions on where operations may locate. \nThat amendment was approved by five members of the council, including Council Chairman Jerry Walker, R-Crofton, who also co-sponsored a dueling measure. \nOther changes include prohibiting medical marijuana from being grown and processed within 1,000 feet of a residential dwelling or school and prevents dispensaries from being within the same distance in areas north of Route 50 and east of the South River. \nIt would also only allow dispensaries in commercial or industrially zoned parcels and not within one mile of each other. State law allows up to two dispensaries per state senatorial district. \nOther provisions of the amended bill require armed security at growing operations, prohibit window and counter displays of medicinal pot and prevent on-site recommendations from a physician at a dispensary. \nWalker also introduced an amendment — that passed — that changed the zoning classification for stand alone dispensaries in a certain industrial-zoned areas from special exception to condition use, which does not require a public hearing. \nWalker said the amendment intended to help a certain person who has already begun the process of establishing such a business. \nAnother measure, sponsored by three county councilmen — Chris Trumbauer, D-Annapolis, Andrew Pruski, D-Gambrills and Walker — mirrors elements of a bill approved by the Baltimore County Council. It would prevent dispensaries from being within 1,000 feet of elementary, middle and high schools or within 2,500 feet of each other. \nThat bill was supported by several people who testified, saying the administration’s bill would be too restrictive. \nIn other business, a $290,000 cut to Central Services was restored to pay for a procurement study being conducted by Ernst & Young. Council members earlier this month took issue with the administration starting the work before the it secured the appropriation, which goes against county code. \nCouncilman Derek Fink, R-Pasadena, introduced an amendment to restore the cut, which was passed unanimously. Fink said he had been assured by the administration that such a process would not happen again. \nThat also delays a vote on that bill to Nov. 2. The measure would also send $2.5 million of a federal grant to the county Fire Department to add 52 new positions. \nAdministration officials said the delay would not be problematic. \nThe council also delayed voting on adopting the latest school utilization chart, which determines if housing developments are halted based on school capacity. The latest chart listed Annapolis High School as closed, meaning it’s over capacity for students — spurring the city to develop an adequate public facilities test for schools. \nCouncil members took issue with changing the status of Lakeshore Elementary School in Pasadena, which went from closed to open based on it being at capacity instead of over capacity. \nThe council unanimously passed an amendment to keep Lakeshore listed as closed, but did allow a change in Eastport Elementary’s status to open based on a recently agreed upon construction project there. \nThis story has been updated to reflect the status of the delayed vote on medical cannabis bills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:27:54.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
