The patent is scheduled to expire in 2029.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130917/NE80755LOGO\nThis patent, a continuation of our core sd-rxRNA platform patent, broadly covers the overall structure and modifications of our self-delivering technology in addition to covering an alternative delivery strategy wherein a hydrophobic conjugate is not utilized.\n\"We have been diligent and proactive with our approach to broadly protect our valuable corporate assets,\" said Dr. Geert Cauwenbergh , President and CEO of RXi Pharmaceuticals. He added, \"We are very pleased to receive this notice of allowance from the USPTO for expanded protection of our novel platform. This opens up additional business development and partnering opportunities with our sd-rxRNA platform as we vigorously pursue these initiatives to build shareholder value.\"\nAbout RNAi\nTherapeutics that use RNA interference, or \"RNAi,\" have great promise because of their ability to \"silence,\" or down-regulate, the expression of a specific gene that may be overexpressed in a disease condition. Building on the pioneering work of RXi's Scientific Advisory Board Chairman and Nobel Laureate Dr. Craig Mello , the Company's first RNAi product candidate, RXI-109 (an sd-rxRNA compound) is the Company's first clinical development candidate. RXI-109 silences Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), which plays a key role in tissue regeneration and repair and is initially being developed to reduce or inhibit scar formation in the skin and in the eye. RXI-109 is currently being evaluated in Phase 2a clinical trials in dermatology and a Phase 1/2 trial is planned to initiate this year in ophthalmology.\nAbout sd-rxRNA®: Novel RNAi Compounds with Built-In Drug-Like Properties\nsd-rxRNA compounds are novel RNAi compounds with enhanced properties for therapeutic use including: efficient spontaneous cellular uptake, stability in vivo , reduced potential for immune stimulation, and potent, long-lasting intracellular activity. All cell types tested (primary, neuronal and non-adherent) internalize sd-rxRNA compounds uniformly and efficiently, resulting in potent and long lasting silencing. Efficient cellular uptake is observed both in vitro and in vivo , including tissues like skin, retina, lung, spinal cord and liver.\nAbout RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation\nRXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NASDAQ: RXII) is a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing innovative therapeutics primarily in the areas of dermatology and ophthalmology that address high-unmet medical needs. Our discovery and clinical development programs are based on siRNA technology as well as immunotherapy agents. These compounds include, but are not limited to, our proprietary, self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA®) compounds for the treatment of dermal and ocular scarring. It also includes an immunomodulator, Samcyprone™, a proprietary topical formulation of diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), for the treatment of disorders such as alopecia areata, warts, non-malignant skin tumors and cutaneous metastases of melanoma.\nRXi's robust pipeline, coupled with an extensive patent portfolio, provides for product and business development opportunities across a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas. We are committed to being a partner of choice for academia, small companies, and large multinationals. We welcome ideas and proposals for strategic alliances, including in- and out-licensing opportunities, to advance and further develop strategic areas of interest.
