Soto and State Representative Dwight Dudley (D- St. Petersburg) on Tuesday filed SB 6-C and HB 3C. This legislation is in response to the recent battles following the Legislature’s redistricting of both Congressional and state Senate seats, both of which were successfully challenged as unconstitutional. \n“I have heard inquiries from countless constituents as to why no penalty exists for violating the Fair Districts Amendments,” said Soto. “This bill gives assurances to the people that if legislators violate their pledge to uphold the Constitution, real penalties await them.” \n“It’s about time we hold the people accountable who have defiantly, flagrantly and maliciously wasted millions of taxpayer dollars in order to perpetuate their own incumbency. Considering that stealing a piece of bubblegum can result in a sixty-day jail sentence and a $500 fine, we must create commensurate penalties for those who take millions while making a mockery of our democracy,” said Representative Dudley. \nUnder the legislation, those found to have violated the Fair Districts Amendments could face penalties up to $5,000, as well as censure, reprimand or expulsion from the legislature. The bill has been filed for the 2015 C Special Session which began Monday.
