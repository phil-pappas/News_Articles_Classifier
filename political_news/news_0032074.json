Spinnaker Support is pleased that the multi-year litigation between Oracle and Rimini Street has finally been resolved by trial. After hearing weeks of testimony regarding actions taken by Rimini Street, the U.S. District Court in Nevada has returned a verdict of damages totaling nearly $53 million . The jury found Rimini Street liable of 93 counts of copyright infringement with respect to PeopleSoft documentation, JD Edwards software and documentation, and Siebel software and documentation. The jury also found Rimini Street and their CEO Seth Ravin liable for violating state computer fraud and abuse acts in California and Nevada . Additionally, Oracle plans to ask the court for post-trial injunctive relief and restitution regarding attorney's fees. These motions will be heard in the coming weeks. The totality of these verdicts could potentially create a material impact on Rimini Street's future business capabilities.\nIt is important to note that the specific business practices of Rimini Street, surrounding unauthorized download and cross-use of materials in violation of customer license agreements, were the sole focus of this trial. The viability and legality of the third-party support industry were never in question. \"This suit is about one third-party support vendor that violated our copyrights,\" Oracle CEO Safra Catz testified, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal's CIO Report. \"This is about Rimini Street.\" As other Oracle executives publicly expressed before and during the trial in published reports, the Rimini Street case was not intended as a broad assault on third-party support. Third-party support, when done properly, is absolutely permitted.\n\"It's business as usual. For us, the innocence or guilt of any single competitor is immaterial. We remain laser-focused on delivering great software support at the right price point,\" said Matt Stava , CEO of Spinnaker Support. \"Rimini Street has admitted guilt and the court has spoken.\"\nIncreasingly more organizations are adopting third-party support, such as Dunn- Edwards\nCorp., a Los Angeles -based paint manufacturer. \"We switched to a third-party support model for our SAP system because we are stable and because we wanted to redirect savings to more strategic programs,\" stated Peter Girgis , VP & CIO of Dunn-Edwards Corporation. \"After narrowing our search to the two top players in the space, we ultimately chose Spinnaker Support because of their culture, people, and proven delivery model. Spinnaker Support was just a better overall fit for Dunn- Edwards .\"\n\"We have successfully served nearly 450 clients who appreciate the safe, distraction-free environment that we provide for them,\" continued Mr. Stava. \"Besides delivering third-party support the right way, our financial strength allows us the flexibility and scalability needed to embrace growing market demand. Third-party support is now mainstream. Organizations deserve an alternative to SAP and Oracle-provided support, such as the one Spinnaker Support uniquely delivers.\"\nAbout Spinnaker Support\nSpinnaker Support provides third-party support, managed services, and consulting for SAP, Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Database, Siebel CRM, and JD Edwards software applications.
