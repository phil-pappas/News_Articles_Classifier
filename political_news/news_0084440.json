The billionaire owner of the Portland Trail Blazers and the Seattle Seahawks has already provided more than $1.7 million for a similar measure on the Washington ballot in November. \nThe Obama administration has recently stepped up efforts at the federal level to combat the international ivory trade, which leads to the killing of some 35,000 elephants a year in Africa. The Humane Society said more than 1,200 rhinos were killed last year in South Africa, out of the 29,000 remaining in the wild. \nBackers of the measure said they hope to constrict the trade by persuading the states to also ban the buying and selling of these products. \n\"We need a full-court press to deal with the trade in these endangered and threatened species,\" said U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., adding that illegal poaching is used by \"some of the most despicable thugs on the planet.\" \nBlumenauer, Metro Council President Tom Hughes and former state Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, are chief sponsors of the measure, which needs 88,184 signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot. \nThe National Rifle Association opposes the Washington initiative, saying it unfairly destroys the market value of firearms with ivory features. An NRA lobbyist also testified against a bill in the 2015 Oregon Legislature that would have banned trade in ivory and rhinoceros horns. \nScott Beckstead, Oregon director of the Humane Society of the United States, said the initiative has exemptions for such things as antiques but added: \"I'm not sure the NRA would be appeased no matter what we do.\" \nBeckstead also said Allen has agreed to help on the campaign here as well, but he declined to say whether he would provide the lion's share of support as he has in Washington. Alexa Rudin, a spokeswoman for Allen's company, Vulcan, said Allen is \"absolutely supportive\" of the Oregon initiative but is focused now on the Washington measure and has nothing to announce about what he might do in other states. Vulcan is the company that manages Allen's business and charitable activities. \nThe bill in the Oregon Legislature passed the Senate but died in the House without a vote. Some supporters of the measure say then-House Majority Leader Val Hoyle, D-Eugene, killed it because she didn't want to further anger the NRA. \nAt the time, gun-rights activists were trying to recall Hoyle after she helped shepherd passage of a bill expanding background checks to cover private gun transfers in Oregon. \nHoyle said Monday that she told supporters of the bill that she was \"not going to pick a fight with the NRA\" over a bill that did not have the votes to pass. \"If the votes were there, the speaker would have moved the bill,\" she said. \n-- Jeff Mapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:29:47.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
