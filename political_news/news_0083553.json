He will be hosting a show titled I Can Do That, where celebrities will be seen taking on challenges. This, however, is not Farhan’s maiden television stint, as he had hosted a celebrity talk show called Oye! It’s Friday earlier.\nDrawing from his own challenging experience in connection with the new show he said, “I couldn’t speak on stage or entertain people. Even after Dil Chahta Hai, when people asked me to come on stage and share my experience, I would make excuses saying I am not well and couldn’t do it.”\nFarhan says that the concept excited him enough to come on board immediately. He says, “This is a concept that Indian audiences have not seen before. If I had to make the jump to TV, I had to be excited about it. I am open to experimenting on TV as I believe it is a very powerful medium.”\nSo who would he like to challenge first and to what? “I would like to give my dad (Javed Akhtar) the challenge of following an exercise regime strictly, so that he can stay healthier for long.”\n Farhan Akhtar I can do that Bollywood entertainment Also Read Aishwarya Rai Bachchan stuns in latest magazine photoshoot Actors enjoy freebies Brad Pitt gives Angelina Jolie 3£ Thorntons toffees as wedding gift Taylor Swift, Harry Styles getting back together?", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Farhan%20Akhtar.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Farhan%20Akhtar.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151002/entertainment-bollywood/article/look-who’s-television", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:49:31.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
