On average, 14 women are killed each year by a member of their own family4. 50% of the 126 family violence deaths in Aotearoa New Zealand from 2009 to 2012 were caused by intimate partners5. 73% of the deaths were women killed by their male intimate partners. \nThis is a call-to-action for everyone, particularly men, who can make a positive social difference in this area.
