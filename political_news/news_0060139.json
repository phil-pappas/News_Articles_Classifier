A dozen staff and volunteers sit at tables in the middle of the room entering data into laptops. Between Clinton’s strong debate performance last week and her rally here the day after, there are thousands of new supporters to enter in the campaign’s database.\n“Especially coming off the debate, there is a ton of energy,” Jorge Neri, Clinton’s Nevada organizing director, told me as he surveyed the hubbub. “Our job is to engage those folks and turn that energy into action.” Nevada, Neri believes, is “really Hillary country.”\nClinton is certainly hoping that’s the case. Nevada is shaping up as the linchpin of her strategy to become the Democratic nominee, and she has built the biggest organization here of any candidate, Democrat or Republican: offices in Las Vegas and Reno (a third, in the Vegas suburb of Henderson, will open soon), 22 paid staff, and more than 3,000 volunteers. Clinton’s Nevada operation began staffing up in June; her top Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, just hired a state director and opened a Nevada office this month .", "external_links": ["http://lasvegassun.com/news/2015/oct/12/clinton-joins-union-protest-at-trump-hotel-in-las/"], "published": "2015-10-23T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:22:44.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
