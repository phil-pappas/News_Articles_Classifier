L. Douglas Wilder writes that President Barack Obama has been “overly cautious,” especially on racial matters. BOB BROWN/TIMES-DISPATCH \nWilder’s memoir, “Sonof Virginia: A Life in America’s Political Arena,” was released Thursday. ADVERTISEMENT Wilder criticizes Obama in new memoir By ANDREW CAIN Richmond Times-Dispatch Richmond Times-Dispatch \nFormer Gov. L. Douglas Wilder says that if he had endorsed state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds for governor in 2009, as President Barack Obama urged him to do, it would have helped weaken gun control laws. \nWilder’s new memoir, “Son of Virginia,” was released Thursday, the same day that a gunman killed nine people at a community college in Oregon. \nWilder, a Democrat, notes in the book that in 2012, Deeds, D-Bath, and state Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, helped Republicans push through a repeal of his governorship’s signature law that restricted handgun purchases to one per month. \n“Interestingly, now Senator Kaine, former chairman of the Democratic Party, and President Obama are calling for stricter gun laws,” Wilder writes. \n“It is refreshing to see the scales fall from their eyes, but it would have been more refreshing to see it before all these national tragedies occurred.” \nAmy Dudley, a spokeswoman for Sen. Timothy M. Kaine, D-Va., said Friday: “Senator Kaine has a clear record of publicly supporting common-sense safety measures like background-records checks and the one-gun-a-month limitation, dating back to his days on the Richmond City Council.” \nObama reiterated Friday that the gun issue is the most frustrating of his presidency. Congress rejected a package of gun restrictions Obama proposed after the 2012 massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn. \nDeeds said in a telephone interview that Wilder is “a historic figure” and that he has “a lot of respect for the journey he’s taken.” \nHe also told of meeting with Wilder in Richmond in 2009. He said Wilder told him of the phone call in which Obama had asked him to endorse Deeds. \nDeeds says Wilder then posed a rhetorical question: “What’s the president done for me?” \n*** \nIn the memoir, published by Lyons Press, the nation’s first elected black governor traces his historic journey, but he also sharply opines on current events. \nFor instance, Wilder, who enthusiastically endorsed fellow Democrat Obama’s 2008 bid but did not endorse a candidate in 2012, criticizes the nation’s first African-American president for being “overly cautious,” especially on racial matters. \n“Too often he was a president whose main goal seemed to be not making anyone mad,” Wilder writes. \nWilder criticizes as “infuriating paternalism” Obama’s September 2011 speech to the Congressional Black Caucus in which the president urged the group to “stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying” and press on. \n“Blaming the failure to get his economic proposals through Congress on black ‘whining’ and chastising the members as if they were bad children was the kind of aloof dismissal that became Obama’s signature style,” Wilder writes. \nHe adds: “This was not the ‘hope and change’ president we had expected.” \nWilder also criticizes Obama — who has nominated Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — for not giving serious consideration to a black candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court in order to balance conservative Clarence Thomas. \n“I have never understood why President Obama didn’t see the need to elevate a second African-American to the court,” Wilder writes, “one who had felt the pain of legal segregation, denial and disparagement.” \n*** \nWilder writes about former Gov. Bob McDonnell with an element of fondness, although the Republican, who defeated Deeds in 2009, signed the repeal of the one-gun-a-month law in 2012, a move that Wilder terms “a sad commentary on how our national conversation about guns has deteriorated.” \nWilder notes that McDonnell, who backed the one-gun-a-month bill as a member of the House of Delegates, pledged to repeal it if it hit his desk as governor. But Wilder writes: “That wasn’t reason enough for me to change my principled stance against Deeds.” \nWilder writes that McDonnell was “a pretty good governor” and that the likelihood McDonnell would have sought national office if not for his corruption scandal “made his abrupt fall from grace all the more tragic.” \nWilder was a character witness for the Republican at the sentencing phase of his trial. McDonnell is free pending the outcome of his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nWilder writes that as a lawyer, he had no doubt that McDonnell “was guilty of some wrongdoing, whether deliberately or carelessly.” But he says he was not sure that McDonnell’s actions “rose to a level of criminal and moral turpitude” that federal prosecutors claimed. \nWilder also writes that he did not care for how the former governor’s defense tried to make McDonnell’s wife, Maureen, a scapegoat. “In many respects, his defense was an embarrassment, his conviction a self-inflicted wound.” \nWilder says that as he watched U.S. District Judge James R. Spencer sentence McDonnell to two years in prison, he was struck by the notion that “we hadn’t seen the last” of Virginia’s 71st governor. \n“Redemption is a favorite theme in American life,” he writes. \n*** \nThe book’s title: “Son of Virginia: A Life in America’s Political Arena,” is an allusion to Wilder’s famous line during his January 1990 inaugural address in which he proclaimed: “I am a son of Virginia.” \nWilder, whose paternal grandparents were slaves, was born in 1931, the seventh of eight children, and was raised in Richmond’s segregated Church Hill neighborhood. \nHe dedicates the volume to his mother, Beulah Olive Wilder, “a learned woman” who was “fierce about education.” \nYoung Wilder’s mother assured him that the Declaration of Independence applied to him, which gave him “the confidence to think of myself as an equal.” \nHis father, Robert Judson Wilder, an insurance salesman, was distant but dignified, never leaving for work without wearing a tie and homburg hat. His father paid the poll tax with which the Democratic Byrd Machine sought to impede blacks and poor whites from voting — and he cast his ballots for Republicans. \nWilder writes that his father’s example imparted an important lesson: “You had to be the person you wanted others to respect.” \nAfter he graduated from Virginia Union University in 1951 with a degree in chemistry, Wilder served in the Korean War and earned a Bronze Star. \nIn the book, Wilder relates harrowing and grisly memories of combat. He recalls how he saw comrades shot to death or capriciously blown to bits by mortar fire. \nWilder writes of a friend, Jim Cunningham, whose job was to repair communications equipment. While walking together one day, they “noticed a change in the air” — detecting the approach of a mortar shell. \nCunningham yelled “Move!” He pushed Wilder to the ground and fell on top of him. \nWilder felt the percussion of the shell. Moments later, he pushed at Cunningham, saying: “We can get up now.” \n“Then I saw his face, which was turning white,” Wilder writes. “He said ‘I’m done for’ and he died. He saved my life and lost his own.” \nWilder writes that he suffered nightmares about combat for 10 years after he returned from Korea in 1953. \nFirst his mother, then later his wife, Eunice, would wake him as he cried out in the night, tormented by dreams that he was “trapped in a hole, the Chinese coming to get me.” \n“The Korean War made a man out of me,” Wilder writes, “but no one leaves the battlefield completely whole.” \n*** \nUpon his return from the service, in which he fought for Koreans’ freedom, Wilder had to leave Virginia to find a law school that would admit an African-American. He enrolled at Howard University in Washington. \nHe writes that he might have become bitter, but nine months after his return the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark school desegregation decision in Brown v. Board of Education restored his faith in America and inspired him to pursue a career in law. \nWilder established a successful legal practice, and then, in 1969, he won election to the state Senate. He became the first African-American to serve in the chamber since Reconstruction. \nHe served in the Senate for 16 years, before he won historic victories for lieutenant governor in 1985 and for governor in 1989. \n*** \nWilder and his wife divorced in 1978 after having two daughters and a son. He does not detail their split in the book, but looking back at age 84, he expresses regret that he spent so much time on his law practice and politics, to his family’s detriment. \n“At the time, I felt I didn’t have a choice,” he writes. “I feel differently about that now.” \nWilder writes that he never considered remarrying. \n“Faced with a choice between pursuing a serious relationship or remarriage and being fully immersed in public life, I chose the latter.” \n*** \nWilder, who served as governor from 1990 to 1994, takes pride in having steered through a recession without raising taxes. \nHe writes that his failed effort to bring the Washington Redskins to Alexandria’s Potomac Yard was the greatest “personal and professional disappointment” of his term. \nHe also acknowledges that his brief run for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination was deeply unpopular in Virginia. \n“In retrospect, I can see that my run for president hurt my standing with Virginia voters,” he writes. “The polls were evidence of their displeasure, and I accept that. The people spoke.” \nWilder also recounts his effort, early in the new century, to change Richmond’s charter in order to allow for a popularly elected mayor. In January 2005, at the age of 73, he became the city’s first popularly elected mayor in 56 years. \nWilder writes that he was “elected as a change agent” and that in one term as mayor, he “paved the way for a renewal.” He expresses no regrets about butting heads, as in his September 2007 effort to evict the Richmond school administration from City Hall. \n*** \nIn his ninth decade, Wilder still hopes to accomplish another major goal: the establishment of a U.S. National Slavery Museum. \nIn the book, he retraces how he and others involved in the effort looked first to Jamestown and Richmond before announcing in 2001 that they would seek to develop the museum on 38 acres overlooking the Rappahannock River in Fredericksburg. \nThe effort in Fredericksburg collapsed, amid fundraising problems, tax bills and court battles. \nWilder unveiled a new plan last year to establish the museum at the site of the former First African Baptist Church in downtown Richmond. The church, which Wilder attended as a child in Church Hill, now is part of the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System. \nWilder now hopes that the museum will be ready to open in Richmond in 2019, to mark the 400th anniversary of the first slaves arriving in Jamestown. \n“This is not a personal crusade,” he writes, “but a national necessity.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:19:58.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
