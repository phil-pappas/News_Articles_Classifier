You can get all the details here .\nIn response I got a note from a long time veteran of and scholar about Congressional operations. He adds this point about the proportionality of the Benghazi investigations:\nOne additional fact demonstrates the skewed priorities of the Republican-controlled Congress.\nIn 2001-2 Congress created a Joint Inquiry by the House and Senate intelligence committees that held 22 hearings [9 public and 13 closed] into the 9/11 attacks. [See H Rpt 107-792, p. 2]\nSo far, various panels have held 20 hearings on Benghazi, with the 21st to come on Oct. 22 when Hillary Clinton testifies.\n22 to 21 suggests equal significance, doesn't it?\nSo after an attack in which 3,000 people are killed, followed by wars in which many times more die, the Congress holds a total of 22 hearings. This isn’t what I’ve been calling false equivalence , but it might qualify.\nAnd after an episode in which four Americans are killed, but which there is apparent partisan advantage, it holds 21.\nThe next time you hear a cable pundit saying that the real problem in current politics comes from “extremists on both sides,” and you’ll probably hear that the next time you turn on the TV, I hope you’ll consider those 22/21 numbers, and others in this latest post .  \nMore Notes From The Atlantic Orbital View: The Other American in Space 7:23 PM ET Quoted 6:30 PM ET Here Is a Short Dog in Tall Grass 5:29 PM ET Turning Pigs Into Organ Donors 4:48 PM ET Track of the Day: 'Jesus Walks' (version one) 4:20 PM ET Notes Home Most Popular On The Atlantic Kevin Morefield The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy Ross Andersen Astronomers have spotted a strange mess of objects whirling around a distant star.

Graham , Molly Ball , Priscilla Alvarez , Tyler Bishop , and Matt Ford Running commentary and analysis as the candidates face off in Las Vegas\n11:08 p.m.: From a rhetorical standpoint, Bernie Sanders’s straightforward closing statement about standing up to the wealthy, along with his return to his oft-used phrase “in my view” throughout the night, emphasized his self-conception as an outsider. He has always been an advocate for political revolution, whereas most politicians are far more conciliatory—at least on the campaign trail. — Tyler Bishop \n\r \r 11:03 p.m.: Everyone in tonight's debate performed passably well, including Hillary Clinton. But given her enormous advantage in name recognition, I'd say that everyone else won by standing on stage beside her, and she lost insofar as she was forced to square off against rivals for the first time in a setting that made them appear like equals. Bernie Sanders in particular showed that he could hold his own next to her. He'll presumably have some money pouring in as a result. But guessing at how the average viewer will respond to these debates is always speculative, and I'll be curious to see if the polls move as a result of an event that didn't include Donald Trump or, presumably, the viewership that comes with him. — Conor Friedersdorf \n\r \r Continue Reading Phil Toledano If You’re Not Paranoid, You’re Crazy Walter Kirn As government agencies and tech companies develop more and more intrusive means of watching and influencing people, how can we live free lives? \nI knew we’d bought walnuts at the store that week, and I wanted to add some to my oatmeal. I called to my wife and asked her where she’d put them. She was washing her face in the bathroom, running the faucet, and must not have heard me—she didn’t answer. I found the bag of nuts without her help and stirred a handful into my bowl. My phone was charging on the counter. Bored, I picked it up to check the app that wirelessly grabs data from the fitness band I’d started wearing a month earlier. I saw that I’d slept for almost eight hours the night before but had gotten a mere two hours of “deep sleep.” I saw that I’d reached exactly 30 percent of my day’s goal of 13,000 steps.

By which I mean: a few dominant, sober-sided media outlets; a news cycle punctuated by evening network-news shows, morning (and sometimes afternoon) newspapers, weekend newsmaker talk shows, and weekly news magazines; and political discourse that shared enough assumptions about facts and logic that journalists felt they could do their jobs by saying, “We’ve heard from one side. Now let’s hear from the other.”\n\r \r I can barely remember any of that, and I got my first magazine job (with The Washington Monthly ) around the time of the Watergate break-in and subsequent Woodward-and-Bernstein scoops, when all parts of the old-style journalistic ecosystem were still functioning.\n\r \r Continue Reading Stephen Voss ‘We Need an Energy Miracle’ James Bennet Bill Gates has committed his fortune to moving the world beyond fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. \nIn his offices overlooking Lake Washington, just east of Seattle, Bill Gates grabbed a legal pad recently and began covering it in his left-handed scrawl. He scribbled arrows by each margin of the pad, both pointing inward. The arrow near the left margin, he said, represented how governments worldwide could stimulate ingenuity to combat climate change by dramatically increasing spending on research and development. “The push is the R&D,” he said, before indicating the arrow on the right. “The pull is the carbon tax.” Between the arrows he sketched boxes to represent areas, such as deployment of new technology, where, he argued, private investors should foot the bill. He has pledged to commit $2 billion himself.\n\r \r Continue Reading Mansi Thapliyal / Reuters Why ‘Mom’ and ‘Dad’ Sound So Similar in So Many Languages John McWhorter The story of a strange linguistic coincidence \nIs there anything inherently “doggy” about the word “dog”?

These words have nothing in common, and none seem any more connected to the canine essence than any other. One runs up against that wall with pretty much any word.\n\r \r Except some. The word for “mother” seems often either to be mama or have a nasal sound similar to m , like nana . The word for “father” seems often either to be papa or have a sound similar to p, like b, in it—such that you get something like baba . The word for “dad” may also have either d or t , which is a variation on saying d , just as p is on b . People say mama or nana , and then papa , baba , dada , or tata , worldwide.\n\r Continue Reading Christopher Griffith The Planet-Saving, Capitalism-Subverting, Surprisingly Lucrative Investment Secrets of Al Gore James Fallows The former vice president has led his firm to financial success. But what he really wants to do is create a whole new version of capitalism. \n“When i left the White House in 2001, I really didn’t know what I was going to do with my life,” Al Gore told me this summer, at his office in the Green Hills district of Nashville. “I’d had a plan”—this with a seemingly genuine chuckle rather than any sign of a grimace—“but … that changed!” After the “change,” via the drawn-out 2000 presidential election in which he won the vote of the populace but not that of the Supreme Court, for the first time in his adult life Gore found himself without an obvious next step. He was 52, two years younger than Barack Obama is now; he hadn’t worked outside the government in decades; and even if he managed to cope personally with a historically bitter disappointment that might have broken many people, he would still face the task of deciding how to spend the upcoming years.\n\r \r Continue Reading Gus Ruelas / AP / Zak Bickel / The Atlantic The Game at 10: Reflections From a Recovering Pickup Artist Kathy Gilsinan A decade since the book pushed “pickup artistry” into the mainstream, Neil Strauss has some mixed thoughts on its legacy.\nWhen Neil Strauss’s blockbuster book about pickup artistry came out a decade ago, I was a Midwestern ingenue in New York City, and I read it mostly as a defensive measure. A nice Ph.D. student named Jon had mentioned The Game , and was demonstrating how it worked by means of “The Cube” routine, where you ask a woman to imagine a box standing in the desert, and you tell her about herself based on how she describes it. (The cube represents the woman’s ego or something—so if it’s big, it means she’s self-confident; if it’s transparent as opposed to opaque that means she’s open as opposed to guarded; if it’s pink that means she’s bright and energetic … basic non-falsifiable horoscope-type material she can read herself into and then find you perceptive.)

But they've failed to reckon with history. Fifty years after Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s report “The Negro Family” tragically helped create this system, it's time to reclaim his original intent. \nBy his own lights, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ambassador, senator, sociologist, and itinerant American intellectual, was the product of a broken home and a pathological family . He was born in 1927 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but raised mostly in New York City. When Moynihan was 10 years old, his father, John, left the family, plunging it into poverty. Moynihan’s mother, Margaret, remarried, had another child, divorced, moved to Indiana to stay with relatives, then returned to New York, where she worked as a nurse. Moynihan’s childhood—a tangle of poverty, remarriage, relocation, and single motherhood—contrasted starkly with the idyllic American family life he would later extol.\nContinue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity.\nEvery day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth.\n\r \r Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After , which was published earlier this year.\n\r \r Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?\n\r \r Continue Reading Latest Notes Orbital View: The Other American in Space Quoted Here Is a Short Dog in Tall Grass Turning Pigs Into Organ Donors Track of the Day: 'Jesus Walks' (version one) More Most Popular On The Atlantic Kevin Morefield The Most Mysterious Star in Our Galaxy Ross Andersen Astronomers have spotted a strange mess of objects whirling around a distant star.
