Ten Republicans voted against the bill, and 37 Democrats, including Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico, voted for it. New Mexico’s other two House members, Republican Rep. Steve Pearce and Democrat Ben Ray Luján, voted along party lines, with Pearce voting for it and Luján voting against it.\nThe $612 billion bill – covering new ships, aircraft and pay raises for military personnel – would authorize an increase in spending that President Barack Obama had requested, but he strenuously opposes the way Congress did it.\nLawmakers increased defense spending by padding a separate war-fighting account with an extra $38.3 billion. That account – for overseas contingency operations – is not subject to spending limits.\nDefense Secretary Ash Carter opposes the defense policy bill passed by the House on Thursday.

Obama and his Democratic supporters say no. Republicans argued that the bill authorizes money for national security amid global threats.\nRep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said the bill is critical for the troops and for national security.\n“This is no time for political games,” Thornberry said during House debate. “This is the time to come together and pass a bill that helps provide for the country’s security.”\nRep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said using the war-fighting account employs a strategy to “sneak around” the ceilings Congress imposed to check spending. Hoyer said the special account is handled on a year-to-year basis.\n“That’s why the Pentagon is opposed to it,” Hoyer said. “That’s why the joint chiefs believe this is bad fiscal policy for the military. … Such an approach to funding undermines the Pentagon’s long-term planning process, which is based on multiyear budgets.”\nThe bill would maintain restrictions on transferring terror suspects out of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, provide a 1.3 percent pay increase to service members, authorize lethal assistance to Ukraine forces fighting Russian-backed rebels, extend the ban on torture to the CIA and authorize the president’s request for $715 million to help Iraqi forces fight Islamic State terrorists.\nSeparately, the House backed a bill to block implementation of the Iran nuclear deal until Tehran pays some $43 billion in damages that U.S. courts have awarded to victims of Iranian-sponsored terror.\nThe bill passed on a 251-173 vote, but is unlikely to clear the Senate or become law.\nObama has threatened to veto it, saying it undermines the international accord that provides Iran billions in sanctions relief in exchange for constraints on its nuclear program.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a07_jd_02oct_defense-400x330.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:48:09.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
