During the first presidential debate, Webb spent much of his time complaining about how little time he was given to speak.\nRelated: The GOP's Benghazi Kerfuffle Couldn't Have Come at a Better Time for Hillary Clinton\nAfter declaring his candidacy in July in an online announcement, Webb made few public appearances and raised very little money. He struggled to crack 1 percent in the polls. VICE News tried repeatedly to contact Webb's campaign over the last months and nobody ever responded.\nWebb's campaign team sent out a press release to the media before Tuesday's event titled \"Jim Webb To Consider Independent Run.\" He made his announcement on Tuesday standing at a podium bearing a Webb 2016 poster, an indication, perhaps, that he planned to continue his campaign outside the Democratic party.\nRepublicans used Webb's announcement as an opportunity to hammer the Democrats for being too liberal. \"With Senator Webb's departure, it's clear the Democrat Party is moving further to the extreme left and far away from mainstream Americans,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement to VICE News. \"After all, a self-avowed socialist is the leading candidate of the Democrat Party in key early states and Hillary Clinton is flip-flopping on issue after issue just to keep up.\"\nFollow VICE News on Twitter: @vicenews", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/vicenews"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:09:13.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
