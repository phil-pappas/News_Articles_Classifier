I'm tired of being told pensioners cost too much, I'm tired of our young people being told they're not good enough, I'm tired of immigrants being scapegoated for the mistakes of bankers and politicians.\n\"I'm tired of being told that pain and misery are necessary for a stronger economy, for a long term economic plan.\"\nShe added: \"The Scottish Government spends millions every year mitigating and protecting our citizens from their Tory cuts, millions of pounds we would rather be spending on health, on education. The Scottish Government has spent Â£35 million alone ensuring no one person in Scotland has to suffer the bedroom tax.\nShare article \"It has rejected the economic madness of austerity. We have continually invested in our public services and in our people. We recognise the only way to build a fair society is to tackle inequality not to create it.\n\"So if any Conservatives happen to be watching I would say it is only by investing in people and by allowing people to reach their potential then we will have what I call a real long term economic plan.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-17T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:41:37.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
