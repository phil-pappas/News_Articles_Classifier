They just like to see competition. \nIs it something about Virginia politicians? Voters here are paying far more attention to a race a year off than they are to the ones they'll vote in three weeks from now, the student pollsters at Christopher Newport University are finding. \nOn top of that, CNU's latest poll found the two Virginians running for president in 2016 — former Gov. Jim Gilmore and former Sen. Jim Webb — aren't particularly popular. \nMore than 80 percent of Virginia voters are following news of the race for the White House at least somewhat closely, with half saying they are following it very closely, the latest poll by the university's Wason Center for Public Policy reported. \nA week ago, just one-third of voters surveyed told the CNU students that they were following the races for the House of Delegates and state Senate. \n\"Two-thirds to three-quarters are really engaged with an election that's more than year away, but less than a quarter to a third are engaged in an election where they'll be voting in less than a month,\" said Wason Center director Quentin Kidd. (Frances Hubbard) \n\"There's a lot of democracy to be seen with the presidential race — there's not a lot of democracy to be seen with the House of Delegates or state Senate races,\" he added. \nIt's not that Virginians don't like their politicians, even though only 22 percent rated Gilmore or Webb favorably, said Kidd. \nThe car tax repeal promise that swept Gilmore into the Governor's Mansion in 1997 didn't repeal the entire car tax, and left a big hole in the state budget, leaving his reputation with voters tarnished. Webb was a one-term senator, elected in 2006 after the popular incumbent, George Allen, appeared to bully a Webb campaign worker with a racially charged insult. Read the story \n\"Different politicians, a Mark Warner or a Tim Kaine who Virginians know better, would probably fare better,\" Kidd said of the lack of home state support for Gilmore and Webb. \nThe reason for the lack of interest in the 2015 state election, Kidd says, is simple: a lack of competition rather than a lack of good feeling toward Virginia politicians. \nInterest in the presidential race is hotter now than usual this far ahead of Election Day because so many candidates are battling so fiercely, and nobody seems to have a lock on either party's nomination, he said. \nIn most of Virginia, on the other hand, incumbents have a lock on their House of Delegates or state Senate seats — only a handful of races are really competitive. \nTwo, in fact, are on the Peninsula. Newport News' 94th House District has trended Democratic in recent national and statewide elections, but re-elected Del. David Yancey, R-Newport News, with a 1.5 percentage point margin over his Democratic challenger in 2013. \nJust to the north, no one has held the 93rd District now represented by Del. Monty Mason, D-Williamsburg, for more than one term since 2009. \n\"I think it's different here,\" said Kidd, who lives in Newport News \"Every day, when I check the mail, I'm getting fliers from Yancey and (Democratic challenger Shelly) Simonds. … I think people here are paying more attention.\" \nThe outsider effect also boosts interest, said Kidd. The CNU poll found GOP contenders Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are the top choice of more than half of Republican or Republican-leaning voters. Roughly the same percentage of those voters would pick one of the three as their second choice. \nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton's support has dropped to 40 percent of likely Democratic voters, down from 80 percent in April. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who calls himself a democratic socialist and who is officially an independent, has gained the support of 23 percent of Democratic voters, matching the proportion of Republicans backing Trump. \n\"Trump, Sanders and Fiorina are speaking to a huge constituency, made up of voters who think no one is listening,\" said Hollins University political scientist Ed Lynch. \nOn the Republican side, those are voters who are upset that large GOP majorities in Congress aren't thwarting President Barack Obama's agenda more, he said. \nOn the Democratic side, the most partisan supporters are feeling disappointed, as often happens in the final couple of years of a two-term president, he said. \n\"This is the Sanders constituency. Of course, administrations that have been successful also have large numbers of party supporters, which is why (Vice President Joe) Biden would shoot to the top of the polls if he announced,\" Lynch said. The CNU poll shows Biden winning the support of 23 percent of Democratic voters. \nWhile the lack of competition in most General Assembly races turns voters off, it's not the only problem, Lynch said. \n\"Neither party has given its campaign an identifiable theme in 2015,\" he said. \"Add to that the fact that voters have to wade through advertisements for clerk of circuit court, board of supervisors, etc., and it's easy to see how tempting it is to shut out the noise by ignoring this year's elections.\" \nLynch said most voters think solutions to what they feel is wrong with the country are more likely to be found in Washington than in Richmond. \n\"So, the focus on 2016, at the expense of 2015, is part a defense mechanism, part emotion and part rational analysis,\" he said. \"Pretty hard to beat that combination.\" \nRess can be reached by phone at 757-247-4535 \nDemocrats debate \nThe Democrats' presidential hopefuls debate Tuesday night for the first time.
