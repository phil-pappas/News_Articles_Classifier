GOP candidates declared Hillary Clinton the likely Democratic nominee and expressed enthusiasm for their prospects of beating her in the general election.\n\"I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad,\" Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, tweeted .\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal bashed Clinton and her top Democratic rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, as unelectable.\n“Democrats are now left with a socialist or a candidate under FBI investigation. Let's embrace our conservative principles, and we will win,” Jindal tweeted .\nMike Huckabee used the opportunity to promote a video of what he said is his elect-ability against Clinton.\nBiden not running for president By Gabriel Debenedetti and Nick Gass\n“. @HillaryClinton will likely be the D nominee. I'm the only GOP candidate who defeated the Clinton Machine,” he tweeted with a link to a video that reflected on his time as governor of Arkansas.\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s communications director Tim Miller called the announcement good news for his boss.\n“Joe not running. Good for Jeb #analysis,” he tweeted . “Pretty astonishing given Hillary's flaws - exposed in 07 and since - that not one prominent Dem took a run at her,” he continued .\nWhile Biden's decision undoubtedly affects their race Democrats heaped praise on the vice president and veered away from making it about themselves.\n\". @VP is a good friend and a great man. Today and always, inspired by his optimism and commitment to change the world for the better. -H,\" Clinton tweeted , signing off with an \"H\" to signal that she wrote the post personally.\nSanders issued a statement with high praise for the vice president, a former Senate colleague.\n“Joe Biden, a good friend, has made the decision that he feels is best for himself, his family and the country. I thank the vice president for a lifetime of public service and for all that he has done for our nation,” Sanders said in the statement. “I look forward to continuing to work with him to address the major crises we face.”\nThe 250 days of pointless Biden speculation By Nick Gass\nWithout Biden in the fold, analysts believe Clinton’s support will increase. According to a ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday, without challenge from the vice president, Clinton's support rises from 54 percent to 64 percent while Sanders bumps up just 2 percent from 23 percent to 25 percent.\nIn a separate statement, Clinton expressed confidence that ``history isn’t finished with Joe Biden.''\n``As he said today, there is more work to do,'' Clinton said. ``And if I know Joe, he will always be on the front-lines, always fighting for all of us.”\n<div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Timodc/status/656867629559336960", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/clinton-rebounds-democratic-race-gaining-sanders-biden-alike/story?id=34580456", "https://twitter.com/GovMikeHuckabee/status/656868867541626880", "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/", "https://twitter.com/BobbyJindal/status/656875527890833408", "https://twitter.com/Timodc/status/656868324534546432", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/656883793354182657", "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/656882880044371968", "https://twitter.com/VP/"], "published": "2015-10-21T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:19:45.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
