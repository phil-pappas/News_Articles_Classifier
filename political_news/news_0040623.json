This comes after the BSA executive board decided to allow homosexual leaders in the organization. \nWestminster Presbyterian's Pastor Mike Honeycutt said in a statement that BSA, in a sense, left the church with their decision making, not the other way around. \n\"Disassociating themselves with over 140 families, it's sad,\" said pack leader and Cub Scout father, Brian Cope. \nCope has a hard time leveling with Westminster Presbyterian's decision to part ways with Boy Scouts of America and Pack 205. In July, BSA amended its policy to allow gay leaders. \n\"I certainly respect the church's decision or their right to decide that's what makes this country great, but I think their lack of communication-- of what I can only assume as their reasoning-- I just see that as cowardly,\" said Cope. \nPastor Mike Honeycutt said in a statement: \nThe BSA National Executive Board ratified a resolution that significantly departed from the path we walked together for nearly three decades. In that sense, they left us; we did not leave them. In spite of the current BSA provision for chartered organizations to continue to select local leaders whose beliefs are consistent with their own, \"THE ANNUAL CHARTER AGREEMENT\" requires the chartered organization (WPC) to \"Conduct the Scouting program consistent with BSA rules, regulations, and policies.\" Those two statements are in direct conflict with each other. \nCope believes the church could still essentially handpick leaders. \nLater in the statement Pastor Honeycutt said, \n\"This has been one of the most gut-wrenching decisions we have ever had to make. We have sincerely sought to act wisely and with compassion for those who are affected by this decision. In truth, we wish we could have stayed with the BSA.\" \nCope told NBC Charlotte the troop should not have a problem landing with another charter soon.  //www.wcnc.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/22/rock-hill-church-parts-ways-with-boy-scouts/74432048/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:36:45.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
