The views of President Obama on this issue are irrelevant to any discussion about private gun ownership.\nAmendment II A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\nThe second part of the Second Amendment speaks for itself when the Constitution says: ” The right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.” This is the final word on the subject as the Constitution has clearly spoken.

And to the best of my knowledge, this current President has never publicly repudiated his\nBrian Terry killed by a “Fast and Furious” gun supplied to the drug cartels by the Obama administration.\nhalf brother. Subsequently, this President is fine with terrorists owning guns, just not the American people. And just in case you may have forgotten your recent history, this President’s administration got caught sending guns to the Mexican drug cartels in Operation Fast and Furious. But again, this President, who arms drug cartel members, would deprive American citizens of the same right.\nNot convinced? Please read on….Who will ever forget when CBS released documents that implicated Holder, who used the BATF as he tried to undermine the Second Amendment, by shipping guns into Mexico and hoping that that the worst would happen and the fatalities would be blamed on the Second Amendment. However, the worst did happen, but not in the form desired by Holder as Border Patrol Agent, Brian Terry, was killed with one of these guns. Instead of getting the desired result, Holder drew the ire of the American people, at least those who are awake. Make no mistake about it, this was a gun control agenda.\nThe New York Daily News Needs to be Boycotted Until This Communist Rag Fails The New York Daily News is demanding that the State Department declare the National Rifle Association to be a terrorist organization.

That must change now !”\nClinton and Obama On Gun Control Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s position on gun control puts her at odds with the staunchly pro-gun GOP, and the push for gun control laws at the federal level has been historically unsuccessful. Source: Wall Street Journal, “Anywhere, Anytime Gun Culture” , May 6, 2014\nPresident Obama’s views on gun control are decidedly turning to gun confiscation as he cited his desire to follow in the footsteps of Australia and Great Britain.\n “We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours — Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it” . President Obama\nIt is now crystal clear, the President plans to take our guns!\nHistory Speaks Will American Listen? History shows that bad things — very bad things — happen when a government confiscates the guns of its citizens. It is an undisputed fact that gun control and gun confiscation has preceded every instance of genocide in the 20th century. How quickly we forget the lessons of history, or, perhaps we never bothered to learn the true lessons of history in the first place.\nIf we ever allow government to subvert the Second Amendment, we very well could be witnessing a prelude to an American genocide for specific targeted groups, for there is nothing as dangerous to a totalitarian regime as an educated and well-armed populace.\nWhat Happens After Gun Confiscation? Before we passively allow the Obama administration strip away our last line of defense from an increasingly totalitarian government, by acquiescing to the United Nations and American advocates for gun control, perhaps we should examine the end game resulting from past gun control efforts:\n1. In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves against their ethnic-cleansing government, were arrested and exterminated.\n2. In 1929, the former Soviet Union established gun control as a means of controlling the “more difficult” of their citizens. From 1929 to the death of Stalin, 40 million Soviets met an untimely end at the hand of various governmental agencies as they were arrested and exterminated.\n3. After the rise of the Nazi’s, Germany established their version of gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who were unable to defend themselves against the “Brown Shirts”, were arrested and exterminated. Interestingly, the Brown Shirts were eventually targeted for extermination themselves following their blind acts of allegiance to Hitler. Any American military and police would be wise to grasp the historical significance of the Brown Shirts’ fate.\n4. After Communist China established gun control in 1935, an estimated 50 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves against their fascist leaders, were arrested and exterminated.\n5. Closer to home, Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayans, unable to defend themselves against their ruthless dictatorship, were arrested and exterminated.\n6. Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves from their dictatorial government, were arrested and exterminated.\n7. Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million of the “educated” people, unable to defend themselves against their fascist government, were arrested and exterminated.\n8. In 1994, Rwanda disarmed the Tutsi people and being unable to defend themselves from their totalitarian government, nearly one million were summarily executed.\nThe total numbers of victims who lost their lives because of gun control is approximately 70 million people in the 20th century. The historical voices from 70 million corpses speak loudly and clearly to those Americans who are advocating for a de facto gun ban. Governments murdered four times as many civilians as were killed in all the international and domestic wars combined. Governments murdered millions more people than were killed by common criminals and it all followed gun control.\nCommissar Obama Has Been On a Mission to Seize American Guns Since His Election In the 1970’s, the civilized world criticized the Soviet Union for their designation of a new mental illness called “Political Schizophrenia”. Soviet style political schizophrenia was deemed to be inappropriate by ICD-9 because the Russians were labeling anyone who disagreed with the government as being mentally ill. And in Mother Russia, if you were deemed to be mentally ill, you were subsequently “treated” in the Gulag.\n Obama Employs Soviet Style Mental Health Gun Controls Under Obama’s new proposed gun regulations, anyone who has a diagnosable, or is potentially diagnosable for being mentally ill, can have their gun confiscated . Vice President Biden even feels that they can violate HIPPA privacy regulations in requiring the states to report who has been treated for a mental illness.\nWhat is interesting to me is that the Obama administration is not even trying to distinguish between mental illnesses in terms of who should, or should not own a gun. In the eyes of the Obama administration, all mental illnesses are created equal. A person with a phobia is just as dangerous as a sociopath. One in six Americans have a “diagnosable anxiety disorder”. This is completely understandable given the economic and political times that we live in. However, under the new proposed guidelines, all of these people would be ineligible to have a gun in their possession even though there is not a shred of research which indicates this population would be inclined towards gun violence any more than any other population.\nPsychiatric Guidelines to Judge Mental Illness The Obama administration has a new partner in crime and it is the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The APA created the new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (5th Edition) which was recently adopted. DSM 5 is highly controversial and has sparked outrage from the mental health practitioners. As many of these practitioners point out, the new DSM-V makes a pathology out simple and normal behaviors such as the grieving for the loss of a loved one .\nParticularly disturbing is that the new manual targets i nternet users and conspiracy theorists. If someone is judged, by some vague set of criteria, to spend too much time on the internet, they could be judged to be mentally ill and ineligible to own a gun. How are you receiving this information? The chances are that you are, at least according to Obama and Biden, giving in to your internet addiction and reading this article. Under the new Obama guidelines this would be grounds for gun confiscation. The alternative media is predicated on internet readership and listenership. These would be among the first groups to oppose a martial law crackdown. Subsequently, this is just another backdoor method to disarm citizens who would oppose the abject tyranny being imposed upon America. And these facts sum up what is truly behind the Obama administration’s latest attack upon gun ownership because they want to prey upon a defenseless nation by disarming as many of us as possible before the purges can begin in earnest.\nThis is the new political schizophrenia. We will see confinements among the alternative media and the veterans for things like A DHD, grieving, normal anxiety, bad eating habits , etc. All of these behaviors and more have been categorized as pathologies under the Obama administration and a supportive American Psychiatric Association. Any trick in the book to get our guns, isn’t that correct Commissar Obama?\nSecretary of State, John Kerry, signing away America’s freedom, security and longevity by putting his name on the UN Smalls Arms Treaty in violation of the Constitution which states that any treaty must be approved by the Senate on a two-thirds vote.\nDon’t forget that Secretary of State, John Kerry, signed the UN gun confiscation treaty with Obama’s full support. The entire OBama administration has been about seizing our guns. Why? What do they have planned that they are afraid of the private ownership of guns?\nPerhaps we should listen Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, when he lamented from the Gulag that they did not forcibly resist the rogue government that would eventually imprison them. There is is wisdom in his words when he said “we did not love freedom enough”, or we would have resisted by whatever means possible.\nMr. Obama, America will not make the same mistake as Sozenhenitsyn and His Russian Comrades The Obama administration is on a very slippery slope. The American people will not tolerate the evisceration of the Constitution, in particular, the Second Amendment. Again, I say, as did the Texans told Mexico nearly two centuries ago. And as the Minutemen at Lexington and Concord said to the British when they were told to surrender their arms:", "external_links": ["http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2014/08/CSS-Offical-New-Logo2.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/12/genocide-4.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/10/solzenitzen-we-did-not-love-freedom.jpe", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2012/12/21/the-nra-speaks-the-only-thing-that-stops-a-bad-guy-with-a-gun-is-a-good-guy-with-a-gun/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/12/29/back-to-the-future-what-history-teaches-about-gun-confiscations/genocide-4/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/12/genocide-5-150x150.jpg", "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/dsm-5-new-mental-illness-bible-list-internet-addiction-illnesses-article-1.1020979", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/08/malick-barack-obama-340x161-890x395_c.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/10/come-and-take-it-3.png", "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/04/new-york-daily-news-state-dept-must-designate-nra-terrorist-organization/", "http://jpfo.org/filegen-a-m/deathgc.htm", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/12/genocide-2.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/08/malick-barack-obama-340x161-890x395_c-300x133.jpg", "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/shrinks-critics-face-new-psychiatric-manual-article-1.1344935", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/10/tj-fear-the-people.jpe", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/12/29/back-to-the-future-what-history-teaches-about-gun-confiscations/genocide-5/", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/10/01/statement-president-shootings-umpqua-community-college-roseburg-oregon", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/12/29/back-to-the-future-what-history-teaches-about-gun-confiscations/genocide-3/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2012/12/genocide-3-150x150.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2015/08/26/obama-administrations-direct-connection-and-material-support-for-known-terrorists-intent-on-destroying-america/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2013/08/obama-gun-control.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2014/07/brian-terry.jpg", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/documents-atf-used-fast-and-furious-to-make-the-case-for-gun-regulations/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2012/12/29/back-to-the-future-what-history-teaches-about-gun-confiscations/genocide-2/", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/01/03/obama-administration-proposes-new-executive-actions-on-gun-background-checks/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2014/07/un-gun-control-kerry.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2014/07/un-gun-control-kerry-300x225.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:39:51.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
