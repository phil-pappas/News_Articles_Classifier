Wayne Miller Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 12:43 PM » RELATED CONTENT • State leaders to shake up Eleanor Slater management CRANSTON, R.I. – An “interim management team” has been retained to oversee operations at the troubled Eleanor Slater Hospital while a national search for permanent leaders is conducted, the Rhode Island Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH) announced on Friday. The move, which has been months in the planning, follows an Aug. 20 unannounced state Health Department review of the hospital that found conditions that put patients in “immediate jeopardy” and led to a Sept. 4 compliance order. Unsatisfactory management of the hospital was first publicly disclosed early this year, after Govenor Raimondo appointed Elizabeth Roberts secretary of Health and Human Services, with responsibility for BHDDH. The interim team, from Burlington, Mass.-based Applied Management Systems, will be led by Thomas Souliotis, former chief executive officer at Worcester City Hospital, and Dr. Elinore F. McCance-Katz, former chief medical officer for the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Souliotis will assume the title of “advising CEO,” and McCance-Katz, advising chief medical officer. “We are taking a hard look at the way we are currently operating across all of Rhode Island’s health and human service agencies,” Roberts said in a media release. “As we are doing at the Department of Children, Youth and Families, we are moving quickly with Eleanor Slater to improve outcomes for patients in our care and make the key reforms needed to recruit high-quality, permanent leadership for the hospital system.” According to BHDDH director Maria Montanaro, her department’s plans to meet the terms of the compliance order have been accepted by the Health Department. “These include bringing in Applied Management Systems to meet the provisions of the compliance order concerning analysis of staffing needs and staff training, as well as taking internal steps to address staffing of patient care units,” Montanaro told The Journal on Friday. gwmiller@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:37:37.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
