Updating him on progress, Eleanor Laws, QC, said the prosecution was “on track” but added that there would be thousands of pages of unused material relating to children’s homes. \nLoading article content \nThe date of Monday, December 7, had already been set to decide if the peer, who suffers from dementia, is well enough to stand trial. \nMs Laws said: “Both parties agree the defendant is unfit to plead and unfit to stand trial. There is no merit in putting off the determination.” \nDefending, Nicholas Purnell, QC, said he was keen to “preserve” all his client’s rights but suggested that there was no reason not to decide the matter now. \nHowever, the judge insisted that regardless of whether it was agreed between the lawyers, it was for him to make the ruling and the evidence should be aired with a “short opening” in court. \nHe said: “Plainly there is a public interest in these matters and the public are entitled to know the evidence on which the finding has been made. \n“Should the medical reports be made available to the press? That is a question we will need to address on December 7. \n“Are the press entitled to see the reports, what can the press report on the hearing and what, in the fullness of time, should the jury be told?” Promoted stories \nThe judge also agreed that yesterday’s hearing could be reported. \nA provisional trial date has been set for Monday, February 22, for a trial of facts, although a further possible date has been reserved for Monday, April 11. Share article \nJanner is accused of 15 counts of indecent assault and seven counts of a separate sexual offence over a series of incidents from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. \nTwenty-one of the alleged offences relate to children aged 16 or under at the time.
