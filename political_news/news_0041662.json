They will have their student ID, both perfectly legal, but they still won’t be able to vote unless they go get another ID from Union South,” McDonell said. \nUW officials said in a statement that they offer a separate ID for voting, but there are concerns with revising their regular student ID cards. \n“Adding the signature, as is required to be voter ID compliant, in combination with other information on the card increases the identity theft risk to students,” the statement said. \nCopyright 2015 by Channel 3000 .
