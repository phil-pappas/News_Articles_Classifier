However when discussing her TV show - 'If Katie Hopkins Ruled the World' - she has claimed she isn't trying to play a pantomime villain.\nBut Lord Sugar said: \"Her niche is to be obnoxious and controversial and it's a shtick. She's just trying to make herself famous. She's chosen a niche in the market for herself. She's become Piers Morgan on steroids, if there could be such a thing.\"\nShare article Lord Sugar also said it was hard to work out a contestant's personality when choosing them for the BBC show, which returns for its 11th series later this month.\nHe said: \"You don't know what the real characters are like until you get into the Apprentice process and I think we're a bit more streetwise now.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-03T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:26:30.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
