Freelancers, consultants and independent workers are finding more and more opportunities in the marketplace.\nBy Andrew Soergel Oct. 9, 2015 | 12:40 p.m. EDT + More Amanda Boleyn, like millions of freelancers and independent consultants who don't work in traditional corporate structures, sometimes has a hard time telling people what she does for a living.\n\"I've been doing this for three and a half years, and my parents are still like, 'We're still not sure exactly what you do,'\" says Boleyn, an independent consultant and self-described \"solopreneur.\" \"I say, 'I work with people on behaviors and leadership and change management.' And still people are like, 'What does that even look like?' There's so much to it.\"\nBoleyn, who graduated from the University of Iowa in 2010 and spent a about two years in the corporate sector with Target and Wells Fargo before stepping out on her own, is a consultant who specializes in \"creating clarity and consistency within the organizations\" she works with. She also launched a podcast earlier this year geared toward female entrepreneurs.\nEssentially, she's building a brand and managing her own business of one. That means maintaining financial accounts and connecting with clients and \"being strategic and purposeful\" with her time, all without the safety net and familiarity afforded to corporate employees with a more predefined structure.\nRELATED\nUnemployment Is Low But More Workers Are Leaving the Workforce \"I can do almost anything I want to do, and I'm not getting held back by processes. But the freedom is a double-edged sword, because you have so many choices that you almost get paralysis,\" Boleyn says. \"If I'm working a project, a typical day is going in and working with clients. If I'm at home, I'm following up with emails or working with the podcast or following up with a client. It varies, and it ebbs and flows.\"\nBoleyn is part of a growing pool of workers foregoing the traditional 9-to-5 office job in favor of independent opportunities that bring more freedom and flexibility, though the size of the freelance economy has been notoriously difficult to pin down. A recent study conducted by MBO Partners estimates the economy currently holds about 30.2 million independent workers 21 and over, and that number is expected to balloon more than 25 percent to nearly 38 million by 2020.\nA separate, more lofty freelance report conducted by research firm Edelman Berland estimates the U.S. already holds a whopping 53.7 million independent workers. And an independent workers' organization called the Freelancers Union maintains a similar estimate of 53 million. To put that number in perspective, that's more than 40 percent of the 121.8 million full-time employees in the U.S. counted in September.\nBut all those estimates are several times that of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which projects the economy in September held less than 9.2 million self-employed workers at unincorporated establishments.\nSo what gives?\nThe technical definition of what is and isn't considered freelance labor helps explain the disparity. The government typically counts independent workers who have incorporated their services – meaning their personal finances are generally separated from those of their company, giving them legal distinction as a corporate entity – as wage and salary workers. So consultants and freelancers who have filed that incorporation paperwork haven't historically been counted by the government as true independent workers.\nAnd the Current Population Survey used by the Labor Department each month to calculate jobs numbers in the U.S. could skip over individuals who work full time but moonlight or freelance on the side. A recent study conducted by the Aspen Institute's Economic Opportunities Program notes that the phrasing of particular questions in the survey \"restricts respondents who may be combining employment with self-employment, and therefore, may result in underreporting of self-employment activity.\"\nRELATED\nThe Problem With the Labor Department's Unemployment Indicators Certain types of consulting firms also outsource individuals who could theoretically be considered independent workers but who ultimately work for a larger institution, further blurring the line between what is and isn't independent labor.\nBut even though there isn't always a clear-cut definition for economists to work with, it's clear that opportunities are plentiful for self-starters looking to move outside of traditional office positions, and the sector is only going to continue growing.\n\"A lot of people will say [the rise in independent labor is because of] the economic downturn. But a lot of our research says at least 50 percent of them do it out of choice – not of economic necessity,\" says Rajeev Jeyakumar, CEO and co-founder of freelance employment site Skillbridge. \"They prefer things like flexibility, the ability to choose what they work on, the control and the diversity.\"\nJeyakumar and fellow co-founder Saalim Chowdhury launched Skillbridge to better connect freelancers looking for work with corporations looking to outsource projects. Jeyakumar says there's demand on both ends, but it's usually difficult for freelancers and interested firms to get on each other's radars.\n\"It was all done through very informal networks. I often had friends email me and ask if I knew anyone available for a three-month project. And clients would email me and ask if anyone was available. It was the most inefficient thing,\" Jeyakumar says of his experiences with freelance connections in the days before Skillbridge. \"The shame for the economy is there's a lot of work and productivity [that] is lost. If you talk to most of our freelancers, they say they spend about 50 percent of their time looking for work. That's 50 percent of their time that they'd like to help a company grow.\"\nChowdhury compares the Skillbridge program to popular online dating apps like OkCupid. Businesses and freelancers fill out profiles, and Skillbridge is able to connect parties whose paths may not otherwise cross.\n\"You see the job numbers, and the job numbers are all about employment. But this interim space is growing, and it's growing rapidly,\" Jeyakumar says. \"About 80 percent of our corporate executives say their use of contractors and consultants is increasing.\"\nRELATED\nBringing 'Sexy' Back to Infrastructure Both the MBO Partners report and the Edelman Berland study estimate about 60 percent of freelancers work in that realm by choice, and both cite flexibility and freedom as primary reasons why workers choose to go solo. Interestingly, the MBO report estimates about half of freelancers say they make more money in their current gig than they would in a traditional office job, and the Edelman Berland survey found that about half of the workforce segment wouldn't return to a corporate job no matter how much it paid.\n\"There are many people who go to work at their 9-to-5 and love it, and they're happy. And that's absolutely fantastic. The world and the economy needs those people,\" Boleyn says. But for her personally, she says, \"I always knew in some capacity I wanted to do something on my own, but I had no idea what that looked like or what that was.\"\nBoleyn began working in a corporate role at Target soon after she graduated from college with a finance degree and a certificate in entrepreneurial management. After about a year, she took a risk and jumped over to a third-party recruiting role at Wells Fargo.\n\"I lost all my benefits. I took a $10,000 pay cut. But this is where I believe fate comes in, and it's all about the choices we make,\" she says. \"Had I not left Target to go to Wells Fargo, I wouldn't have had the weekend off that I attended a conference called 'Succeed Faster,' where I met my first client.\"\nThat client, in turn, steered Boleyn toward her first independent consulting gig – a sales training project with AT&T.\n\"There were no guarantees when I left Wells Fargo that the project would continue beyond six weeks. I didn't know what I was getting into,\" she says. \"I went into a room in San Diego with people twice my age and 80 percent male. I was 24 years old, and I was going, 'What did I just do?'\"\nBut a little more than three years later, Boleyn independently maintains about half a dozen major clients. And she's had enough freedom in her schedule to launch her podcast, \"She Did It Her Way.\" The program regularly features high-profile female entrepreneurs who have taken similar leaps of faith.\n\"I know there are people out there that don't step out of their comfort zone, whether they're risk-averse or they have these fears,\" Boleyn says. \"My passion is to always open people's eyes to the possibility of going out and creating and getting up every morning and loving what they do, and finding happiness in the journey along the way.\"\nTAGS: economy consultants", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzmn1%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.shediditherwaypodcast.com/", "https://www.mbopartners.com/state-of-independence", "https://www.freelancersunion.org/about/sara-horowitz.html", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzmn1%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Fortune%20Favoring%20the%20Freelance%20Economy&summary=Freelance%20work%20is%20difficult%20to%20define%2C%20but%20a%20growing%20pool%20of%20independent%20workers%20seeking%20more%20freedom%20is%20tough%20to%20ignore.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzmn1%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Fortune%20Favoring%20the%20Freelance%20Economy", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzmn1%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Fortune%20Favoring%20the%20Freelance%20Economy", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzmn1%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.aspeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/content/images/1099%20backgrounder%20FINAL%20090815.pdf", "http://www.slideshare.net/upwork/2015-us-freelancer-survey-53166722/1", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdzmn1%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:17:55.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
