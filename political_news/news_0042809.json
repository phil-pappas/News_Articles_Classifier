Who Will Be the Next Speaker? With other lawmakers reluctant to step up to the plate, the next speaker of the house may well be the current speaker. Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. waved goodbye to his candidacy for House speaker on Wednesday.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Oct. 8, 2015 | 6:05 p.m. EDT + More With Rep. Kevin McCarthy out of the race to succeed Rep. John Boehner as speaker of the House, all of Capitol Hill is openly speculating about who might win the job .\nMcCarthy's stunned lawmakers by withdrawing from consideration Thursday just moments before the closed-door nomination process was to begin. After that shock, few lawmakers were willing to go on the record as to whom they might ultimately support to take up the gavel.\nRELATED\nMcCarthy Drops Out of Speaker Race The two other candidates -- Reps. Daniel Webster of Florida and Jason Chaffetz of Utah -- said they were still running. Webster, who Wednesday earned the endorsement of the approximately 40-member Freedom Caucus, got a dozen votes in January, when the House reelected Boehner at the beginning of the new term.\nRep. Dave Brat of Virginia, a member of the Freedom Caucus, spoke highly of Webster, whom he says could unite the caucus as someone who \"doesn't have the most conservative score.\"\n\"When he was speaker [of the Florida House of Representatives], the outcomes were very good,\" Brat says. \"He's good on process. It seems to me our group is putting up somebody who's principled and could work with both sides, be fair to both sides.\"\nNone of the Republicans who spoke with U.S. News Thursday said they saw Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as the next speaker.\nInstead, a number of other names began to circulate: Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price of Georgia, who planned to run for majority leader if McCarthy was elected speaker, Majority Whip Steve Scalise of South Carolina, former Chief Deputy Majority Whip Peter Roskam of Illinois, Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions of Texas, former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Cole of Oklahoma, Rep. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia and Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon.\nScalise, who normally would have had an advatage given that he's already in a leadership position, instead has struggled as the caucus has taken a cue from the GOP presidential contest and is giving more weight to candidates who aren't seen as close to Boehner.\nOne idea that gained steam Thursday was the possible election of a \"caretaker\" speaker who would serve for a brief period – a few months or perhaps through the end of next year, when the congressional term ends. Such a candidate presumably could get the support of otherwise skeptical lawmakers and could be willing to make the difficult changes many say are necessary without worrying about his or her own political future.\nAmong those named were retiring Rep. John Kline of Minnesota, the chairman of the Education Committee, and Rep. Candice Miller, chairwoman of the Administration Committee.\nRELATED\nKevin McCarthy Shocks the Hill by Bowing Out of Speaker's Race Few of those with the leadership experience and clout have been willing to jump into the fray.\nSouth Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Benghazi Committee, continued to resist calls for a run Thursday, shouting \"No!\" to reporters asking if he might change his mind.\nBoehner has reportedly taken it upon himself to try to persuade Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to run, despite Ryan repeatedly saying he didn't want the job. Ryan would reportedly be McCarthy's first choice as well.\n\"While I am grateful for the encouragement I've received, I will not be a candidate,\" Ryan said in a statement. \"I continue to believe I can best serve the country and this conference as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.\"\nIt's a sentiment echoed by many others.\n\"I don't know who's interested and willing to take on that chore,\" says Rep. Hal Rogers of Kentucky, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who also took himself out of consideration.\n\"It takes a lot of gumption and finesse and talent to bridge the gap,\" Rogers adds.\nIn fact, the next speaker might end up being the current speaker: Boehnersaid in a statement he would stay on until his successor was elected.\nHouse leadership said they plan to meet Friday morning to chart a path forward, but it's unclear that a House divided will be able to find the 218 Republicans votes – an absolute majority of the full House – needed to select a new speaker.\n\"Clearly the guy who was most likely to [get to 218] was Kevin McCarthy,\" says Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida. \"The Freedom Caucus, in essence, is forcing John Boehner to stay on as speaker.\"\nTAGS: McCarthy, Kevin Congress politics Chaffetz, Jason Republican Party", "external_links": ["http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0s48%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0s48%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=With%20McCarthy%20Out%2C%20Who%20Will%20Be%20the%20Next%20Speaker%3F", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0s48%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=With%20McCarthy%20Out%2C%20Who%20Will%20Be%20the%20Next%20Speaker%3F&summary=With%20other%20lawmakers%20reluctant%20to%20step%20up%20to%20the%20plate%2C%20the%20next%20speaker%20of%20the%20house%20may%20well%20be%20the%20current%20speaker.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0s48%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0s48%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=With%20McCarthy%20Out%2C%20Who%20Will%20Be%20the%20Next%20Speaker%3F", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0s48%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:07:57.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
