This was because there had been a considerable backlog and he said the numbers would go down as it was cleared. \nHe said more resources would be put into the appeal process so it could be carried out more quickly. \n\"We pay a lot of attention to public opinion in New Zealand,\" he said. \"Trans-Tasman harmony is very important to Australia and Australian leaders but the concerns have emerged largely from those temporary factors and the delays.\" \nTurnbull said both countries' immigration ministers would get together \"very soon\" to review the situation. \nKey said the discussion was \"frank, honest and constructive\". \nDeportation of New Zealanders and the rights of New Zealanders at Australian detention centres played a large part, he said. \n\"It's not the first time in the history of New Zealand and Australia that there have been points of contention.\" \nHe hoped the Australian Government would take on board New Zealand's call for compassion for some of the affected New Zealanders. \nTurnbull also announced today that New Zealanders who have lived in Australia since childhood may be given access to the Australian student loans programme from next year. \nHe said legislation to introduce this measure would be introduced into Australia's Parliament next week. \nIt would give access to Special Category Visa holders who first entered Australia as a dependent child and who have lived in Australia for at least 10 years. \nIf the bill passes, about 2600 New Zealanders would be eligible for loans to help them study at university or other tertiary training institutions. \nWork was also underway in both countries to explore how the two countries could share data to best support student loan debt recovery programmes. \nThe controversial Australian deportation law change, which was introduced last December, means non-Australians who have incurred a prison sentence of a year or more can be deported. \nThe law is retrospective and cumulative and, since its passage, immigration officials have been actively dredging through old records and rounding up Kiwis, sometimes in dawn raids. \nMore than 200 New Zealanders are held in seven detention centres. This includes New Zealanders who were brought to Australia by their parents and have lived there their whole lives. \n- by Matthew Theunissen of The Herald on Sunday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:40:15.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
