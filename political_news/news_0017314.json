Ex-lawmakers find plenty of use for money In this, Nov. 10, 2008 file photo, former Congressman Mark Foley, R-Fla., is interviewed in New York. Members of Congress can pretty much do whatever they want with leftover campaign cash when they leave office except use it for personal expenses. In Foleyâ€™s case, he has given away about $360,000 since 2010, when he began remerging into public life. The amount is roughly what his $1.2 million has earned through investments.
