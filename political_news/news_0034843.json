I knew that now going into this race,\" Rubio said before Cavuto cut him off to ask about Crist's run for Congress against GOP Rep. David Jolly.\n\"I know, I know,\" Rubio said smiling. \"Well, some people can't live without it I guess. I'll let the voters in that area decide. I think they know we don't need more of Charlie Crist.\"\nMore from the Washington Examiner Muslims oppose U.K.'s tough new counter-extremism program The initiative removes passports of teenagers whose parents suspect of having connections to extremists.\nBy Daniel Chaitin â€¢ 10/20/15 12:40 PM Related Story: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/article/2574118/ Rubio made his name initially after trouncing Crist , who ran as an independent, in the 2010 race by 17 points.
