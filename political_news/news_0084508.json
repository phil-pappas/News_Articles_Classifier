But current law allows the organizations bankrolling the committees to shield the names of donors. \nThe proposal would require the organizations to reveal their major donors. \nJonathan Wayne, who drafted the proposal, says it’s more significant than typical ethics commission legislation. But he says it’s designed to address a “troubling trend” in state elections. \nThe proposal was met with resistance by commission member Richard Nass. He says it could become an administrative “disaster.” \n___ \nInformation from: Portland Press Herald, http://www.pressherald.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:40:13.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
