Cuomo announced his own Common Core Task Force, intended as a total “reboot” of the standards — and effectively displacing a 2014 Regents report on the same subject.\nThe governor’s action is another sign that when her current five-year term ends in April, it will be time for Tisch to go.\nTisch was appointed to the Board of Regents, which presides over the state Education Department, on April 1, 1996 — almost 20 years ago. She became vice chancellor in 2007, then chancellor in 2009, serving in that position ever since.\nUpon taking the Regents helm, Tisch promised, “We will embrace innovation with a data-driven approach . . . to raise test scores, raise graduation rates, and finally close the achievement gap.”\nBy her own measures — and she’s had plenty of time to prove the wisdom of her approach — Tisch has fallen far short. Last month, statewide test scores showed a mere 31.3% of students proficient in English Language Arts and 38.1% in math on the tough, relatively new Common Core-aligned tests.\nIn June 2012, Tisch bemoaned that “nearly a quarter of our students still don’t graduate after four years.” That is still the case. For students taking up to five years to complete high school, the 2010 graduation rate stood at 77%. Today it is 76.4%.\nMeantime, the achievement gap persists. Four-year graduation rates for 2010 and 2014 — one of the best apples-to-apples indicators we have — show exactly the same 25 percentage point difference between black and Hispanic students compared to white students.\nAs a Regents member, then as deputy chancellor, Tisch touted rising test scores. That house of cards toppled when, after years of documented criticism, even she had to admit that the scores were artificially inflated.\nThough that earlier deflate-gate occurred on her watch, Tisch claimed credit for the forced downward calibration of student proficiency, then rushed new Common Core tests, yielding such a furious backlash that 20% of students opted out this year.\nLess appreciated, but perhaps more important, Tisch’s unsuccessful focus on standards and testing has distracted the department from another major function, district oversight. The crisis in East Ramapo — where the school board has long plundered district funds to provide services to students attending yeshivas — is only beginning to be met with effective action.\nAlso for years, districts have denied adequate services to immigrant children and English Language Learners, yet sanctions were routinely delayed and sporadic.\nIn New York City, state requirements for school librarians, physical education and more have been ignored. Of greatest consequence, the rampant racial and income segregation of the state's schools has been met with mere lip service from the person who should be New York’s leading voice and change agent on the issue.\nAnother, more positive, reason for Tisch to depart is the new era emerging at the state Education Department. The state Assembly, formerly the domain of then-Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Tisch ally, just voted a large turnover in Regents membership, replacing old-guard Tisch supporters with more independent members. The newly hired commissioner, MaryEllen Elia, also deserves to set her own course, untethered from the chancellor’s agenda. This was the case when Tisch’s predecessor stepped down in the wake of a commissioner’s resignation.\nTisch vehemently believes that poor performance should lead to firings and school closures. She argued that position in a letter to the governor’s office last December, stating in no uncertain terms that “if these schools cannot be made to perform, they must be closed and replaced.” She recently repeated the prescription, asking rhetorically, “How long do you stick with a failing school?”\nIt is time for Tisch to take the medicine she has advised for others. How long, indeed.\nBloomfield is professor of educational leadership, law, and policy at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:50:06.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
