It's defended all over by the preacher men and their pick and choose priorities in the bible. Quote: GOD LOVES THE RICH! Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. (1 Timothy 6:17, NIV) Wealthy The Church often implies, perhaps unintentionally, that God despises rich people and that success is something Christians dont handle very well. As part of the Church, we should correct this type of teaching. There are dangers that result from the improper handling of wealth. Jesus did not approve of the rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and refused to share with Lazarus (see Luke 16:19-31). Paul admonished wealthy Christians not to put their hope in riches but to be generous and ready to share (see 1 Timothy 6:17-19). James rebuked greedy rich people who sat on their wealth while their workers wages went unpaid (see James 5:1-6). But these cases do not condemn rich people  they simply point out that their wealth has been mishandled. So how does God feel about the rich? The Bible unequivocally declares, God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16, NIV) The two words world and whoever are inclusive. God loves everybody and does not discriminate against anyone based on race, gender, or social status. Unfortunately, when it comes to the social divide between the rich and the poor, the Church often exhibits a negative bias toward the rich. This is clearly seen in missionary priorities. The church that sends missionaries to a tiny group in the Dominican Republic will rarely consider sending missionaries to the thousands of lost souls living in Monaco, Sweden, or even Beverly Hills. This has resulted in a faulty set of priorities, because people in wealthy nations are just as lost as those living in the Third World. roflmao What a distortion of Christianity. Here, too: Brainwashing, Mind Control, Indoctrination, Oppression, Intimidation, Legalism, False Teaching, and Bondage in the Christian Church. Quote: f you hear a pastor or television evangelist say, \"God told me to tell you,\" hold onto your wallet and run. These are the modern-day money changers similar to those who Jesus threw out of the temple. The modern Christian churches use brainwashing, mind control, indoctrination, oppression, coercion, intimidation, legalism, false teaching, guilt, shame, peer pressure, and other bondage techniques to control members, increase church attendance, and obtain more money. The goal is said to be \"winning souls to Christ,\" but the underlying agenda is the desire for more power, control, and money. These mind control and bondage techniques are not needed to win souls to Christ. In fact, they are very counter productive to soul winning. Matthew 23:4 \"For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. 5 \"But all their works they do to be seen by men.\" Matthew 23:15 \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves. The focus on money in the church is easily seen by reading the website for the church, TV, or radio ministry. The typical website has information for ordering books, tapes, videos, and other materials from their online store. They may have tricky methods to encourage the visitor to give money. They talk more about money than about God, Jesus Christ, or the Holy Spirit. Rarely do any of these churches present a clear or correct gospel message on their website, radio, or TV program. They use special presentations to entice the visitor to give his money, such as: Pledge online. Taking an oath is forbidden in Scripture. A panic plea to give now in order to keep us on the radio, TV, or whatever. Help a poor starving child in some distant land. The child is shown with flies on his face. Support our new building program, new TV studio, or whatever. Mail us your prayer request. They are really looking for your check and will throw the prayer request away. Join our tour of the Holy Land. They are really getting a free trip themselves plus making a profit. Special offers. They know you are more likely to send money if you get a little something in return. The number of church members is directly proportional to the church budget. Getting more new members means getting more money. Money is the prime motivation in Christian churches today. You most likely will not see the gospel printed in the Sunday bulletin, but you will see something about paying your tithing, the church budget, new building plan, or the amount of money collected during last week's service. Collecting the tithes and offerings is one part of the church service that is never forgotten. Jesus spoke and acted harshly with the money changers in the Temple who were making money by fraudulently representing God. Jesus called them a \"den of thieves.\" Matthew 21:12 Then Jesus went into the temple of God and drove out all those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves. 13 And He said to them, \"It is written, `My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you have made it a `den of thieves.' \" 14 Then the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them. The Apostle Paul taught that we are not to put on the yoke of legalistic bondage. Galatians 5:1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty by which Christ has made us free, and do not be entangled again with a yoke of bondage. 2 Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing. 3 And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to keep the whole law. 4 You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace. 5 For we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love. American radio preacher, Donald Grey Barnhouse, said:\"It was a tragic hour when the reformation churches wrote the Ten Commandments into their creeds and catechisms and sought to bring Gentile believers into bondage to Jewish law, which was never intended either for the Gentile nations or for the church. Brainwashing of Humans is Easy and Very Effective Church members come to accept the policies, practices, and teachings in their church as they drift into bondage from the brainwashing techniques used by church officials. This indoctrination is so effective that the member later denies he has been brainwashed. People who have been brainwashed never know it themselves. Humans can easily be taught to believe something that can easily be proven to be absolutely false. Brainwashing can extend to groups of people without a limit in size or scope. Millions of people were brainwashed to believe Communism was the best economic system until the truth was exposed by the fall of the Soviet Union. Cults and false religions have used these techniques with great success for centuries, and Christian churches frequently resort to the same methods. Parents of brainwashed children have engaged reprogramming experts in an attempt to rescue their children from a cult or false religion. Rescue becomes extremely difficult when the oppressed is an adult who is protected by law from outside rescuers. Many parents grew up in Christian churches that used mind control techniques, and they raise their children to receive the same indoctrination generation after generation. They live their entire lives not coming to the knowledge that they have been brainwashed. Brainwashing and Other Mental and Personality Disorders. Cults are classic experts in brainwashing techniques. Members in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) repeat false statements over and over at every church meeting until new members are brainwashed into believing they are true. Testimonies are required in which members are expected to repeat false doctrines by making statements such as \"Joseph Smith was a Prophet of God.\" Jehovah's Witnesses is another cult that uses brainwashing techniques with great success. Any member who dares to leave the organization is shunned by close family members, and this intimidation is as intense as one can possibly imagine. Shunning is a masterful bondage technique. Mind Control in the Cults. Understanding Mind Control Among Jehovah's Witnesses. Top Ten Nutritional Myths, Distortions and Lies That Will Destroy Your Health. The low-fat diet craze is another example of mass brainwashing that has swept the entire world even though the diet has little scientific support. The fear of saturated fats and red meat continues on a massive scale with the strong support of food manufacturers and vegetarians. Saturated animal fats and red meat are very good foods that preserve health and heal the body. It has all been a big fat lie started by vegetable oil manufacturers and vegetarians. There's much more to read from that. And yes, it is an opinion, but one based on hearing the televangelists and following the born again evangelical republican/teabbaging values in voting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:25:34.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
