The term five rivers refers to the country's five main authorities headed by the National Council for Peace and Order and including the Constitution Drafting Committee, the Cabinet, the National Reform Steering Assembly and the National Legislative Assembly. NLA vice president Surachai Liengboonlertchai said the agencies would discuss their roles, such as the NLA, the NRSA and the CDC needing to gather public opinion on charter drafting process. The NRSA would also talk about its role in continuing 37 reforms agenda proposed by the now-defunct National Reform Council, with legislative support from the NLA, he added. Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said the Prime Minister and the NCPO leader Prayut Chan-o-cha would \"deliver some messages\" to the agencies. Prayut had not yet issued any instructions regarding the meeting or confirmed he would preside over it, he said. Wissanu anticipated that NLA president Pornpetch Wichitcholchai and NRSA president Captain Thinnaphan Nakhata would likely lead the meeting. Wissanu has contacted Pornpetch regarding the meeting. Tentatively, the meeting will be held at Parliament, and the participants are allowed to question the premier on the floor. In a related development, People's Council for Reform Network member Buntoon Srethasirote revealed that the network would organise a public forum on the charter draft next month, with the expected participation from the public and business sectors. Participants would review and discuss the recently rejected charter draft in order to create proposals for the CDC, Buntoon said, adding the network looked forward to seeing the new charter accepted by all parties. 260 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:17:38.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
