How is this good for a family? \n\"In the same way New Zealand has spoken out against human rights abuses in our smaller Pacific neighbours, we should be drawing world attention to those being committed by Australia. \n\"John Key says it’s Australia’s business how they treat people from other nations but New Zealanders shouldn’t be treated this way. \n\"We expect better from the Aussies. We fought alongside them and are supposed to have a special relationship. \n\"But no one should suffer this extraordinarily bad treatment by Australia. It contravenes accepted norms of international law for New Zealanders - or anyone. What they are doing is unacceptable, \" says David Shearer. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:10:57.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
