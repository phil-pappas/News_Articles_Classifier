The Iranian Defense Ministry released a photo of a long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile test on Sunday in an undisclosed location.\nBy Teresa Welsh Oct. 15, 2015 | 5:08 p.m. EDT + More Last weekend, Iran successfully tested a long-range ballistic missile that it says is capable of striking Israel. On Sunday, the country's judicial court announced the conviction of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian on espionage charges. This week, Iran sent additional ground troops into Syria, further muddling an already complicated situation.\nThe events suggest Iran is sending a message to the world that, even though it agreed to a landmark international agreement three months ago curbing its nuclear program, the Islamic Republic has not abandoned its tendency to act outside the international system and assert itself on the world stage.\nKelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association, calls the missile test reported Sunday by state television in Iran \"an unhelpful development\" but says it might just be motivated by internal politics.\nRELATED\nWashington Whispers: An Unclear Future for Journalist Jason Rezaian \"It is a violation of existing U.N. Security Council resolutions that prohibit Iran from testing ballistic missiles of this range,\" Davenport says. \"Iran may have been trying to send a message to its hard-liners that are critical of the deal that it intends to retain its independence, particularly in the military realm, and continue moving forward with its ballistic missile development.\"\nThe comments come after France's foreign ministry spokesman on Thursday characterized the launch as a \"worrying message from Iran to the international community.\" House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif, told the White House in a letter a day earlier that it is \"clear that Tehran is testing United States resolve in the wake of the nuclear agreement\" and urged a U.S. and U.N. response.\nU.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power stopped short of any confrontational rhetoric, affirming Wednesday that the test violated a U.N. Security Council resolution \"if the facts are as we believe them to be.\" Iran has always considered such resolutions to be invalid and has violated their provisions numerous times since they were adopted in 2010. The Iranian government also denies the ballistic activity violates the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name for the nuclear agreement.\n\"We do not ask for permission from anybody to increase our defense might and missile capability and are decisively following up our defense plans, particularly in the missile sector,\" Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Hossein Dehqan said following the test .\nPower said the ballistic missile activity won't prevent the nuclear agreement from being officially enacted on Sunday, after which Iran must begin complying with the restrictions placed on its nuclear activity by the U.S. and other world powers under the deal. Once the International Atomic Energy Agency certifies Iran is complying with its obligations, U.N. Security Council resolutions like the one banning ballistic missile activity will be lifted.\nPower wouldn't say whether she believed the Iranian action violated the \"spirit\" of the deal.\nRELATED\nWhat's Next for the Iran Nuclear Deal? \"The JCPOA laid the groundwork for lifting the U.N. Security Council sanctions, and in the UNSC resolution that lifts those sanctions that's where it explicitly says that sanctions on ballistic missile procurement will remain in place for eight years,\" Davenport says. \"But there's nothing explicitly in the deal itself that prohibits ballistic missile development.\"\nMatthew McInnis, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, says this action is typical of an Iran that frequently flouts international norms and regulations. He says Iran will \"continue to push the envelope.\"\n\"The Iranians certainly have done this with the thought that there's not going to be significant pushback,\" McInnis says. \"They don't believe we're going to do anything serious because keeping the deal together is too valuable for the U.S. and the West.\"\nBut, McInnis says, the balance is a delicate one for Iran. They want to show their continued dominance in the region as well as their military strength, but they want the nuclear deal as badly as the U.S. does and must ensure its compliance.\n\"I don't think they want to completely abrogate the deal. They wanted it to begin with and they want to keep it,\" McInnis says. \"They're going to keep testing our limits and, under this president, they're not going to get significant pushback.\"\nDavenport says that in the past the U.S. has responded by sanctioning officials involved in such tests and that the administration could take similar action after this latest ballistic missile activity.\nU.S. officials have repeatedly said the Iranian nuclear agreement was just that: an agreement on Iran's nuclear program. They say there was no expectation its successful completion would lead Iran to be a more responsible actor.\nRELATED\nObama: U.S. Will Work With Russia, Iran to End Syria Crisis Indeed, Iran has indicated it intends to keep up its support for terrorist groups in the region, one example of the nefarious activity the U.S. continues to oppose. Its involvement in Syria, reportedly sending 1,500 troops into the country in cooperation with a Russian-led effort to prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad, shows it is increasingly nervous its ally is in a precarious position. Iran needs a friendly regime in Syria to ensure it a clear path to its Hezbollah proxies in Lebanon.\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani campaigned and won on a message of reform and promises to open the country to the world, but all elements of Iranian society don't necessarily agree with that direction. The missile test, as well as the Rezaian verdict, may be messages from Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to hard-line factions in the country that Iran doesn't intend to turn outward just because a nuclear deal was reached.\n\"I don't think the supreme leader ever really wanted a significant shift in Iranian foreign policy anyway,\" McInnis says. \"I was doubtful that we were going to see a brand new Iran in the region.\"\nRezaian's trial ended in August, and in September the Iranian president indicated Iran may be open to some sort of prisoner swap to exchange the journalist for Iranian assets. McInnis says that, even though Rezaian was convicted, the Islamic Republic may still be open to such an agreement.\n\"But the other thing to remember is President Rouhani does not control the judiciary system there in Iran,\" McInnis says. \"One of the other kind of naive assumptions that some people have about Rouhani's approach and new openness to the West may mean that on â€¦ other things that we worry about with Iran, like human rights and repression of the Iranian people and on judicial actions like the Rezaian conviction, that he has some type of desire and power to change the system or be able to disprove it in some way. In reality, he doesn't really have much power to do so.\"\nTAGS: Iran Rouhani, Hassan", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8hrz%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/10/11/432908/Iran-Hossein-Dehqan-Ballistic-Missile-Emad", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8hrz%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8hrz%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Missile%20Test%20Just%20the%20Latest%20Iranian%20Provocation", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8hrz%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8hrz%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Missile%20Test%20Just%20the%20Latest%20Iranian%20Provocation", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8hrz%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Missile%20Test%20Just%20the%20Latest%20Iranian%20Provocation&summary=Recent%20moves%20suggest%20Iran%20is%20determined%20to%20show%20the%20world%20that%20cooperation%20with%20the%20U.S.%20was%20limited%20to%20the%20nuclear%20deal.&source=U.%20S.%20News"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:23:28.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
