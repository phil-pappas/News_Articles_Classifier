The bright tan is now-dead Kentucky bluegrass that will be replaced. The green is live Kentucky bluegrass. View of north end of gulch, where a new trail is being cut through what will be natural-appearing areas. A buffalo grass mixture is the lawn for the State Library / DOE building overlooking the east side of the gulch. The buffalo grass mixture was installed there a few years ago and at the Dolly-Reed building along Capitol /Wells Avenue. The buffalo grass mixture is mowed; for a few years it was allowed to grow through the spring and summer without mowing or with less frequent mowing. \nThese photos show the current status of Hilger’s Gulch, a Pierre community landmark, as the Daugaard administration prepares to convert much of the Kentucky bluegrass to a mix of native species such as blue grama, buffalo grass and wildflowers, along with prairie shrubs and various small trees. The bluegrass was killed this fall with a chemical and will be re-planted in 2016. The sledding hill and the Governor’s Grove memorial walkway will continue to have Kentucky bluegrass, as will some of the other shoulder-apron areas. The gulch had been undeveloped land prior to then-Gov. Bill Janklow converting it to a walking area some 30 years ago. Some people who live along the gulch’s westside hilltop have opposed the Daugaard plan.
