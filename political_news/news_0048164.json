I've never been drawn on the numbers of seats we will have but I have made a prediction on this one. Promoted stories \n\"I believe we are on course for returning the largest number of MSPs since devolution began; that is the challenge I have laid down to my candidates.\" \nAsked if the Tories can overhaul Labour in the Scottish Parliament, Ms Davidson replied: \"That's not what I want to measure the party against going into this election.\" \nThen she quipped: \"I have no control over what happens to the Scottish Labour Party; the Scottish Labour Party appear to have no control over what happens to the Scottish Labour Party.\" \nMs Davidson noted how around a quarter of her supporters had voted tactically in May but said the list system for Holyrood would allow the party to maximise its support in 2016. \nShe decried Nicola Sturgeon’s talk of a second referendum, which, the Scottish Tory leader insisted was adding to the “fears of employers in Scotland”, who were saying the constant speculation was damaging their ability to expand. \n“Nicola Sturgeon needs to remember she isn’t the First Minister for the SNP, she’s First Minister of Scotland. And Scotland wants to get on,” she declared. \nMs Davidson accused the SNP administration of being “increasingly defined by cronyism and incompetence” that involved cosy meetings secured by ex-advisers now paid by private companies to secure state aid for already profitable ventures and SNP supporters seeing their donations returned ten-fold in government loans as well as policing in chaos and reforms to universities, child law and the rural economy “all with the SNP imprint of central control and illiberal state oversight”. \nReferring also to the row over MP Michelle Thomson’s business dealings, she noted how the build-up of policy failures meant there had been a “crack in the patina” in the Sturgeon government’s “Teflon inevitability”. \nMeantime, the party leader proposed an increase in the Carer's Allowance; one of the new benefits that will soon become the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. \nThe allowance is currently £62 a week but Ms Davidson said she wanted it to be at least the same as the £73 a week Jobseeker's Allowance, which would result in an extra £600 a year in support for carers. Share article \n\"Nobody becomes a full-time carer because of money; they do it out of love,” she explained. “But as well as our recognition and our thanks, they deserve a little extra help and I want to make sure they get it. \n\"That's the kind of practical plan I want to champion at this election and I look forward to the day when we can finally start debating issues like this in Holyrood. I look forward to some grown-up politics,” Ms Davidson added.
