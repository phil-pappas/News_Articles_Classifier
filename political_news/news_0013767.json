But music lawyers and copyright experts say that these cases rarely make it to the courts — often, campaigns simply stop playing a disputed song to avoid more bad publicity. Those cases that do reach the courts seldom result in a judgment, leaving the law somewhat unclear on what rights candidates — as well as musicians — may have. And the use of music in campaigns is not always unauthorized. Mr. Springsteen has campaigned for President Obama , and Kid Rock let Mitt Romney use his song “Born Free” for his 2012 campaign.

But the problematic cases continue, in part because of legal complexities. The letter from Mr. Tyler’s lawyer mentions the Lanham Act, a federal law covering trademark and false advertising — which essentially says the song could be seen as a false endorsement. The letter also said that Mr. Tyler’s right of publicity was violated. But some lawyers and copyright experts say that can be a difficult legal argument to make. “You have to show that people actually think it is an endorsement,” said Sherwin Siy, the vice president of legal affairs at Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group. A representative for Mr. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. In the music industry, even the complaints over copyright use can be politicized. David Israelite, the president of the National Music Publishers’ Association, a trade group that complains loudly about what it says are unfair regulations over music licensing, said that the dispute between Mr. Tyler and Mr. Trump pointed to the need to change the federal consent agreements that govern Ascap and BMI. Those groups issue so-called blanket licenses that give songwriters little ability to refuse permission to someone who wants to license their song. Ms. LaPolt said that the Trump dispute was particularly troubling for Mr. Tyler, who is a Republican but has made an effort in recent years to meet with legislators of both parties over copyright reform. It was also the second time that she has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Trump campaign over “Dream On.” The first was in August, after Mr. Trump played the song at an event in Mobile, Ala. Afterward, Ms. LaPolt said, a number of members of Congress asked her whether Mr. Tyler was supporting Mr. Trump. “It creates this implication that Steven is endorsing the campaign,” Ms. LaPolt said. “But everyone he met with in Washington knows that’s not the truth.” \nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook , Twitter and the First Draft newsletter .
