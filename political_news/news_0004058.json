But Gilliam-Price said the group was disappointed that Davis issued a statement that stopped short of acknowledging that commitment. \nShe and others gathered outside of City Hall to send a message, she said, that the group is “well aware of his neglect” and “will continue to put pressure on him while he’s commissioner.” \nAdam Jackson from Leaders for a Beautiful Struggle said some members of that group were ready to occupy City Hall again. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:51:47.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
