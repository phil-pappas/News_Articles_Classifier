(Photo: Kathy Bolten/The Register) CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nRepublican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee wasted little time Wednesday morning poking at the Democrats who took part in a debate the previous evening. \n“Last night, the best thing was the Democrats debating one another and the other was Hillary debating herself,” Huckabee told about 90 members of the Westside Conservative Club who met at The Machine Shed in Urbandale. \n“Hillary has taken both sides of almost all of those issues and therefore she was able to debate both sides,” Huckabee said as the group chuckled. \nHuckabee is one of 15 Republicans seeking the GOP nomination. His remarks to the breakfast club were part of three-day, seven-town swing through Iowa. The former Arkansas governor has spent 35 days in Iowa since January. \nHuckabee, who won the 2008 Iowa caucuses, has failed to gain traction in the state or elsewhere since entering the race in May. Real Clear Politics poll averages of Iowa Republicans have Huckabee in seventh place. Political outsiders Donald Trump, Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina occupy the first three places in the horse race poll. \nOn Wednesday, Huckabee acknowledged he’s trailing people who have never before held an elected office. Huckabee said while he’s just as frustrated as many Americans with Republicans in Congress, now is not the time for a political newcomer to be in the White House. \n“If you think the country can stand someone learning on the job, then the next time you get on an airplane, look up in the left seat of the cockpit and ask, ‘Has this person ever flown a plane before?’” he said. \nIf someone with no political experience becomes president, “this would be the first time in American history … that we made the criteria for being selected for a job and for being hired to pointing out time and time again that we have zero experience and preparation for that job. \n“I don’t understand why we think that’s a good idea.\" \nFact check: San Diego border fence \nLast week, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee visited the border between the United States and Mexico. He was accompanied by Duncan Hunter, a former U.S. Congressman and House Armed Services committee chairman, and officials with the National Border Patrol Council. \nAt a campaign event in Urbandale on Wednesday, Huckabee said “At the San Diego border, there used to be 480,000 apprehensions a year of illegals. They built a double wall at that border and those apprehensions went down to 30,000 a year, a 95 percent decrease.” \nHuckabee said that the fences, border patrols and electronic monitoring work to keep people from entering the country illegally. \nAccording to a December news release from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in 1986 before the fences were erected, there were 628,370 apprehensions of people entering the country illegally. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2014, there were 29,911 apprehensions. \nIn 1993, 1,000 uniformed agents patrolled the border; now there are 2,500 agents assigned to eight stations located along the border. \nIf elected president, Huckabee said he would replicate the border protection efforts in the San Diego area in other parts of the southwest U.S. \n— Kathy A. Bolten \nSETTING: A large room at The Machine Shed in Urbandale. \nCROWD: About 90 adults, many of whom are members of the Westside Conservative Club \nREACTION: Huckabee was applauded when he said he's campaigned against \"the Clinton political machine and most importantly, I lived to tell about it.” \nWHAT'S NEXT: Wednesday was the second day of Huckabee's three-day swing through Iowa. On Thursday, he'll be in Fort Madison, Mount Pleasant and Donahue. For details, go to DesMoinesRegister.com/candidatetracker.
