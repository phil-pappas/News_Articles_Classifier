Watching the Democratic debate, one thing that most all the candidates want, especially Sanders, Clinton and O'Malley wanted was something called \"Family Leave\" whereas a woman who has a child is entitled to stay home with the baby for up to a year, paid by the employer. I do not understand why the employer should be obligated to give an employee paid leave for up to a year because that person has a child. The employer is running a business and needs people/employees to work. If my employee has a child, that is their responsibility. For good employees, I would provide health insurance, and would be happy to give the person a month off to bond with her child and give her time to make arrangements for the child's care, but then I want that worker back. I do not understand the obligation. This would make me as an employer only wanting to hire men, or women over 40 to try to avoid this. But candidates like Colonel Sanders wants father's of children to get the same \"Family Leave\" benefit. What happens to the workers who have a bunch of kids? Years off? Hillary Clinton told some story about having a sick baby (Chelsea I guess) and her having to go to her trial lawyer job the next day. Well, HIRE SOMEONE to take care of your kid! Or take off work for a few years until your kid reaches kindergarten age and go back to work. Not hard. Explain why this is a good and not a goofy, McGovern like bad idea. Thanks from Jimmyb and Sabcat And yet it's what most of the civilized world calls \"family values\". Because it's of real value to families. I could see three months for the mother OR father. A year is ridiculous, IMO. Location: massachusetts Posts: 4,440 How about the mother's salary, mothers get a check from the government, no means test, they get paid for being mothers.

How about a struggling artists salary, the government pays me to work on my novel. Or an up an coming golf pro salary. The government covers my equipment, green fees, travel, lessons and gives me a salary until I can make the tour. The fuck? Location: Tejas. Posts: 28,816 There isn't a liberal that can produce the authority for the federal government to mandate this leave.

It's real family values, a country has to value family, to fund such a thing.

I done see any positives I took off 5 years to stay home w/ my kids doing consulting, side work and taking classes. In no way did I even think my job should have been held much less that they should have been sending me a weekly paycheck. I was told I could hold my perks held for three months if I wanted and to this day I still have a good relationship w/ the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:55:59.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
