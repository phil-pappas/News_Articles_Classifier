One of the nation's most successful brand names went on sale for the first time this month in 1913 - Camel cigarettes, the first pre-blended, packaged cigarettes. While machine-rolled cigarettes had been around since 1881, Camel was the first brand to become nationally popular. Coincidentally, Camels pioneered the now almost universal 20-cigarette pack. By 1919, with increasing advertising and product availability, cigarettes overtook pipe tobacco in the number of pounds consumed. Shortly after World War II, about 45 percent of Americans smoked. Now, just under 18 percent do so. Cigarette manufacturing remains a big part of the business for the country's 120 tobacco manufacturing establishments. Sales exceed $39 billion annually. Profile America is in its 19th year as a public service of the U.S. Census Bureau.\nSources:\n1900-1950 Tobacco chronology: http://archive.tobacco.org/resources/history/Tobacco_History20-1.html\nTobacco history: http://healthliteracy.worlded.org/docs/tobacco/Unit1/2history_of.html\nBrand history and packaging: http://www.rjrt.com/transforming-tobacco/history/\nRecent smoking statistics: http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/resources/data/cigarette-smoking-in-united-states.html\nGraph of smoking statistics: http://www.gallup.com/poll/28213/latest-gallup-update-shows-cigarette-smoking-near-historical-lows.aspx\nValue of tobacco shipments/ NAICS 312230: http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ASM_2013_31GS101&prodType=table\nTobacco manufacturing establishments/NAICS 312230: http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ECN_2012_US_31I1&prodType=table\nProfile America is produced by the Center for New Media and Promotions of the U.S. Census Bureau.
