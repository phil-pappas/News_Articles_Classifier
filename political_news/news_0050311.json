Igor Konashenkov.\nHe dismissed Syrian opposition claims that the Russian airstrikes killed civilians as \"sheer nonsense,\" saying that the aircraft hit ammunition depots, bunkers and other targets away from populated areas.\nThe ministry has released cockpit video to support its claims, just as the Pentagon did during the two Gulf wars.\nThe precision strikes differed sharply from the two separatist wars in Chechnya, where the Russian military indiscriminately used obsolete, inaccurate weapons, reducing Chechnya's capital to rubble.\nLatakia, the heartland of Syrian President Bashar Assad's Alawite minority, offers the Russian military a safe environment — and a warm welcome from people blaring car horns and chanting \"thanks\" in Russian.\nAt a refugee camp in Latakia, which houses several thousand mostly Alawite refugees from other provinces of Syria, smiling kids shouted: \"Thank you, Putin!\"\nWarmly greeted by the locals and at a safe distance from the frontline, soldiers at the base look calm and relaxed.\nStill, Russian military police manning checkpoints with Syrian security forces thoroughly check incoming vehicles, special forces guard key facilities and Mi-24 helicopter gunships sweep around the base on regular patrols looking for any suspicious activity. Pantsyr air defense systems are deployed at the edges of the airfield, completing the security bubble.\nSoldiers at the base are visibly proud of their crisp new uniforms and comfortable sand-colored high boots, a stark contrast with the drab Soviet-style military attire worn until recently.\nAir force support crew working to attach heavy bombs and missiles under the warplanes' wings, wear shorts and white sports shoes for comfort in very un-Russian temperatures of nearly 30 Celsius (mid-80s F).\nOn a typical day, each jet flies several sorties during the day and at night.\nKonashenkov shrugged off U.S. criticism of targeting moderate rebel groups fighting Assad instead of focusing on the Islamic State group, the main goal declared by the Kremlin.\nHe argued that it doesn't matter which of the myriad militant groups owns facilities making suicide belts and rigging trucks with explosives for suicide missions, which the Russian warplanes target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:28:17.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
