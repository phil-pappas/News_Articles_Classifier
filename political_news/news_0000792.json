If found guilty of unauthorised access, a person faces jail term of up to 10 years or fine or both.\nThe court, while clarifying about the two-layered digital signature certificate, said there could be two OTPs (one on mobile phone and the other in an email), ensuring that it will have to be given to an authorised person/persons in the company and not just the director, which is presently the case. The OTPs should be generated in real time and the RoC server can also have a log system of those who accessed it.\nThe HC gave the directions while hearing a suo moto (on its own) public interest litigation after a court had in March come across a case of corporate fraud, where four directors of a company were removed from the board after they forged the digital signatures of one of the directors and uploaded documents on the RoC website.\nIn an earlier order, the court expressed shock to learn that the RoC did not have a foolproof system of uploading forms on its website.\n\"It appears that these are being issued willy-nilly without sufficient checks and balances and without proper verification or adherence to standard KYC norms. There is also the extremely important and sensitive issue of access to the MCA portal being permitted simply against entry of Director Identification Number without any use of a now industry-standard two-step security protocol to verify the legitimacy of the user logging in,\" the court had said.\nThe court has now posted the hearing to November 26.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/1/100867838964442696762/posts"], "published": "2015-10-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:57:38.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
