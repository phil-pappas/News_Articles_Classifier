And her great mistake was characterized by her pressing that reset button with a great big smile ... that somehow she thought Russia was going to be our friend and ally,\" he said.\nRead More Romney famously told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in March 2012 that Russia was \"without question our number one geopolitical foe,\" at the time earning snickers from the political world for seemingly being out of touch with the global threats facing America.\n\"The 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years,\" Obama told Romney during one of their presidential debates .\nRomney also told Tapper that Clinton's \"misjudgment\" continued by not providing security for Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador who was killed in the Benghazi attack, and in how she handled emails while at the State Department.\n\"There are two parts of the Benghazi hearing and I think she's being trying to conflate the two. One, of course, is what her role was in the terrible misjudgment in not providing security in Benghazi to protect our ambassador. And I think the committee wants to make sure that those mistakes are not made again,\" he said.\n\"And then something that came from the Benghazi hearings but is not really directly related to Benghazi itself, and that is the fact that, unlike any other former secretary of state, she had her own email server. And she was conducting business on the email server and it's very possible that classified information was breached as a result of her misjudgment,\" he added.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:11:36.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
