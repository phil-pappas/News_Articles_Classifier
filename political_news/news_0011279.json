In the meantime, many Americans have found work-from-home jobs through freelance gigs, with 34 percent of U.S. workers now doing some form of contract work. \nAs drivers, designers and consultants flock toward the abundance of gigs in the online marketplace, the so-called \"gig economy\" is reportedly flourishing, giving individuals freedom and flexibility from the daily 9-to-5. However, a new report finds many of these workers are hanging onto their full-time jobs. The evidence shows the percent of American workers who are self-employed may actually be in decline. \nWhile 12.2 percent of American workers were self-employed in 1994, only 10 percent reported being self-employed in 2014, according to the Pew Research Center's analysis of U.S. Census data. That slump suggests that it's getting less popular to go solo, even if the flexible hours and home office do seem more appealing than cubicle life. Moreover, the decreasing share of self-employed persons in the workforce is a trend over time that doesn't seem to have been noticeably hit by the emergence of today's sharing economy. Chart via Pew Research Center \nAlso noteworthy in the Pew report is the fact that the percent of workers who are self-employed with incorporated businesses has risen since 1990, while the percent of workers who are self-employed with unincorporated businesses has fallen. Since businesses in the prior category are more likely to have paid employees, this trend suggests that self-employed workers are becoming more likely to be employers themselves. And that may be a good sign for the state of innovation and entrepreneurship in the U.S. \nWhatever the case may be, 44 million jobs in the U.S. are now held by self-employed workers or people who are employed by self-employed workers, Pew assessed. That total accounts for 30 percent of the total national workforce. \nWhat these stats don't show us is how many workers with full-time jobs are doing work through Lyft, Uber or someone similar on the side. Nevertheless, a July report from The Wall Street Journal looking at Labor Department data showed that percent of civilian workers holding multiple jobs has also been in decline over the past two decades. As a part of the larger U.S. employment picture, this suggests that the Uber-ization of on-demand contract workers may not be having a dramatic impact on the types of jobs that people are working. \nOf course, that's not to say that online platforms haven't played a significant role in enabling self-employed people to find work. In fact, an increasing percent of freelancers in an annual survey conducted by the Freelancers Union have indicated they are finding work through online means. \nIf the jobs America's self-employed workers are performing as designers, drivers or photographers aren't changing, technology may just be changing how they find clients, even if some companies are finding models that rely upon becoming that work-finding platform of choice. Regardless, cases where companies are becoming contractor-dependent do not seem to be inflating the overall number of people who count themselves as self-employed.
