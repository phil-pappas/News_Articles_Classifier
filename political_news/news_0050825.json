The legislation (S.1867), authored by U.S. Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), would establish an international travel notification system to alert destination countries when a convicted child sex predator is traveling to their country. “Human trafficking is a heinous crime that harms the most vulnerable people in our society. It should not be tolerated. This legislation is intended to improve international cooperation to the exploitation of children,” Cochran said. “I commend Senator Shelby for taking the lead on this important legislation, and encourage my colleagues to support its swift passage.” The measure would allow for close monitoring of international travel by convicted sex offenders. In addition, it would establish an Angel Watch Center at the Department of Homeland Security, and coordinate communication between the newly-established Center and the U.S. Marshals Service National Sex Offender Targeting Office. This bill would also streamline the international notification system to help make certain that no registered sex predators are lost in the system when leaving the United States. In addition to Cochran, S.1867 has been cosponsored by Senators John Boozman (R-Ark.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), and Rob Portman (R-Ohio). It has been referred to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Cochran, a member of the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking, also cosponsored the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which passed the Senate in a 99-0 vote in April and was signed into law in May. 10/1/15 Posted October 2, 2015 - 5:09 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
