Microsoft is releasing a new preview of its Windows 10 Mobile software today that allows Cortana to send texts from your PC. If you use a Windows 10 Mobile device then Cortana will notify you of any missed calls, and you can reply straight from your PC.\nThe actual message will be sent as a text from your phone, but this integration means you don't have to pick up your phone to send messages each time. You can type or speak \"text\" into Cortana and you can send a text to any contact as you would normally do from your phone. This works by using the same Microsoft Account on a PC and phone, allowing Cortana to sync data in the cloud and pass it between both devices. If you have multiple PCs then you can disable missed call notifications on each machine. While this is clearly limited to Windows 10 Mobile for now, it will be interesting to see if Microsoft can extend this to Cortana for iOS and Android in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:05:43.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
