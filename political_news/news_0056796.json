Second, elections have consequences, and we are only just now beginning to experience those disastrous consequences.\nOne year ago, President Obama said, “We don’t have a strategy” on ISIS . Nothing has changed from President Obama, and now we are facing the consequences. ISIS is expanding. Over 250 Americans traitors have now joined ISIS in Syria – American jihadists. ISIS is gaining ground, gaining forces, and maintaining its unbelievable powering throughout the region.\nSix years ago, President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made their infamous “reset button” ploy with Russia. It’s been an unmitigated failure.\nVladimir Putin’s insatiable quest for world power has run roughshod over President Obama’s intractable weakness.\nPutin’s self-created crisis in Ukraine has been a debacle, but Russia’s defiant invasion into Syria could be a deadly disaster.\nThe latest situation is set up as a horrific nightmare scenario. Russia, which has long propped up Syria’s beleaguered Assad regime, claims it has decided to strike ISIS. That might sound good until you realize what is actually happening. Putin’s first air strikes in Syria are not against ISIS but the Free Syrian Army , the rebels fighting Assad’s regime.\nTo make matters worse, Putin has demanded that President Obama stand down the U.S. military’s (albeit limited) airstrikes against ISIS.\nSo to get this straight, Putin is going all in against the anti-Assad rebels to protect its puppet government in Syria, without attacking ISIS, while at the same time demanding the U.S. stop attacking ISIS.\nIf that’s not bad enough, here’s where it becomes an incredibly dangerous and geopolitically tense situation. The U.S. is rightfully refusing to back down in the fight against ISIS, but it sets up a situation not seen since Russian warheads were parked in Cuba.\nArmed Russian fighter planes will be flying missions in close proximity to U.S. and allied military aircraft – with differing missions, differing rules of engagement, and different goals. The U.S. is fighting ISIS. Putin’s Russia is fighting to defend Assad and expand its control in the region.\nThese are diametrically opposed goals and missions.\nOne can only imagine the good chuckle Putin had when President Obama mocked Mitt Romney ’s statements about the danger Russia poses to U.S. interests.\nBut this is no laughing matter. It is incredibly dangerous.\nThese are just the beginning of the consequences of more than a half-decade of President Obama’s failed foreign policy and leading from behind.\nFollow @_MatthewClark\nMatthew Clark is Senior Counsel for Digital Advocacy with the ACLJ .
