(AP) - The Wisconsin Department of Justice is reviewing a complaint filed by nine Republican lawmakers alleging that the state elections board routinely violated the open meetings law. \nThe lawmakers sent Attorney General Brad Schimel a letter Wednesday alleging that testimony by Government Accountability Board Chairman Gerald Nichol “raised serious questions” about whether the law was violated. \nThe lawmakers say the board may have had a “walking quorum.” That happens when small numbers of board members have discussions in sufficient numbers to reach a quorum, without everyone being together at the same time. \nGAB spokesman Reid Magney says the board carefully follows the open meetings law, and the communication described by Nichol was designed to avoid a “walking quorum” from occurring. \nDOJ spokeswoman Anne Schwartz says the letter is under review. \n___ AP Interview: Bradley says she won’t coordinate with groups \nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley said Wednesday that she will not coordinate with outside groups as she runs to retain her seat, even though it would be legal. \nBradley told The Associated Press that although she won’t coordinate with groups that have spent millions of dollars on recent state Supreme Court races, she also won’t ask them to stay out of her contest. \n“It’s not my place to tell them what to do and they have a 1st Amendment right to participate,” Bradley said. She added that if the groups do choose to get involved in the race, she hopes they would “maintain a positive message.” \nBradley’s comments came two days after she was sworn in to serve the remaining 9½ months of Justice Patrick Crooks’ term. He died in office last month. Gov. Scott Walker appointed Bradley to the position on Friday, choosing her over two others. \nWhen Walker picked her, Bradley had already announced she was running for a full 10-year term on the court in an election to be decided April 5. Two other declared candidates - 4th District Appeals Court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg and Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald - did not apply for the vacancy. \nBoth Donald’s and Kloppenburg’s campaigns said they would not coordinate with independent groups. \n“But we hope that anyone who tries to persuade voters what to think and how to vote is doing so in an open, transparent way, so voters can judge not only what they are saying, but who is really saying it,” said Donald’s spokesman Garren Randolph.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:20:32.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
