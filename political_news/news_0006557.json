It only applies to Kiwis who have lived in Australia for longer than 10 years, and students in Australia will still be denied the $426.80 a fortnight Youth Allowance and important top-ups like rent assistance.\" \nAustralians living in New Zealand receive full entitlements to interest-free loans and student allowances after 3 years. New Zealanders in Australia are entitled only to 6-months of Youth Allowance or New Start (unemployment) allowance and no support for paying tuition fees. \nThe change does nothing for thousands of New Zealand children who have emigrated with their families to Australia in the last decade. \n\"It’s disappointing that it’s had to take so much public pressure for the New Zealand Government to press the Australians to pass the thing they already committed to. If equality was a priority, I think we would have seen much more much sooner.\" \n\"They announced this Bill three Prime Ministers ago. This is beyond a joke for those families who are having borrow privately just to send their kids to a university or TAFE (polytechnic).\" \n\"We all have family members now living in Australia. How is it fair that their children who have grown up in Australia are denied the human right to education that their peers enjoy?\" \n\"Prime Minister John Key must redouble his efforts to see equality with the Australians. Education must be at the heart of that effort.\" says Mr McCourt. \nThe union would seek support from the National Union of Students Australia to advance the issue on both sides of the Tasman. \nTimeline: \n2001: Howard Government removes HELP student loans and Youth Allowance/New Start student support entitlements from all New Zealanders living in Australia on special category visas (SVCs) \nJune 2013: Gillard Government announces Bill to reinstate eligibility for HELP student loans to New Zealanders living in Australia on special category visas (SVCs) \nFebruary 2014: Newly elected Abbott Government commits to passing HELP entitlement Bill in joint statement with Prime Minsiter John Key \n17 October 2015: Malcolm Turnbull announces the same Bill will be introduced to Parliament the following week, affecting 2,600 New Zealanders living in Australia \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:50:36.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
