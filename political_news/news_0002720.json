In the midst of the fight between Syrian opposition groups and the president, Islamic State fighters emerged and took over various parts of Iraq and Syria, complicating the situation.\nKerry added in his speech that \"in Syria, we see a chance to increase pressure on Daesh [Islamic State fighters] from more than one direction, especially if Russia makes good on its commitment, repeated many times, to help.\"\nRussia has been supporting the Assad regime since the Syrian civil war began, while the US along with Saudi Arabia, have backed the rebel Free Syrian Army.\nCairo-Moscow ties are stronger than they have been in years. In 2014 and 2015, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi visited Moscow four times, most recently last August, when the two countries announced cooperation in building Egypt's first nuclear power plant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:04:43.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
