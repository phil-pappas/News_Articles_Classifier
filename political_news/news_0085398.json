Afghan army generals, as well as U.S. and German troops, moved around the base as they tried to figure out how to drive the militant group from this northeastern city for good. \nDespite 14 years of war and tens of billions of dollars in international aid, for much of the day it seemed that nothing had changed on this base on the front line of the Afghan military’s struggle to keep a frightened nation safe. [ The bloody history of Kunduz, from Afghanistan’s ‘Convoy of Death’ to now ] \nOn Thursday morning, three days after the Taliban overran Afghanistan’s sixth-largest city, government leaders announced that they had largely ejected the militants from the center of Kunduz. But new fighting later erupted throughout the city, signaling to Afghan leaders and residents alike that the war that has devastated the country will not end any time soon, and could worsen in the coming years. \n“No one can predict the duration of war,” said Gen. Murad Ali Murad, deputy chief of staff of the Afghan army, who is commanding the Kunduz operation. \nAt an evening news conference in Kabul, President Ashraf Ghani also tried to prepare the public for more hardship after the Taliban’s advances this week. Although Ghani stressed that Afghan special forces made serious gains in Kunduz on Thursday, he noted that conflict continued in 10 to 13 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. \n“The war is still going on,” said Ghani, who had hoped to persuade Taliban leaders to take part in peace talks. \nAmid growing public alarm, he urged residents to remain optimistic. “Panicking and fear, and becoming perplexed . . . and apprehensive during wartime is helping the enemy,” Ghani said. \nBut here in Kunduz , the grim reality of what is at stake was increasingly apparent. \nAmnesty International said that as part of its Kunduz campaign, the Taliban has carried out mass murder, gang rapes and house-to-house searches for civilians suspected of working for government agencies or international aid organizations. 1 of 19 What the streets of Kunduz look like View Photos Afghan forces battle the Taliban in an effort to retake the city.

In his news conference, Ghani said Islamist militants from Pakistan, Russia and China are mingling with local Taliban sympathizers, compounding the problem. \nAfghan officials reported Thursday that more than 160 Taliban fighters were killed Wednesday night during the army counteroffensive, which was backed by U.S. airstrikes. In one neighborhood on the outskirts of Kunduz, the charred corpses of three Taliban fighters lay on a road next to a stolen Humvee, which had apparently been targeted in an airstrike. \nAfghan military officials have not said how many soldiers have died in the fighting. \nKhan Zari, who is in his 60s, showed up at the base on Thursday looking for the body of his son, a soldier killed this week. \n“My son was recently married, and he only passed two nights with his wife when he headed to Kunduz,” said Zari, who lives in the eastern province of Nangahar. \nWith Taliban fighters still holed up in houses in parts of Kunduz, residents said the city alternated between extended periods of calm and intense street battles on Thursday. \nShortly after dawn, after Afghan forces pressed into the center of the city, a soldier removed a Taliban flag hanging in the town square. Later in the day, however, Taliban fighters retook the square and again hoisted their flag, according to a witness account published in the Stars and Stripes newspaper. \nOn Wednesday, the U.S.-led coalition in Kabul confirmed that American Special Operations troops and NATO military advisers had arrived in Kunduz to assist in the counteroffensive. The U.S. troops were dispatched to Kunduz to “train, advise and assist” Afghan forces, but they are empowered to defend themselves if threatened. [ Map of Afghanistan’s Islamist strongholds ] \nAbout 9,800 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, but coalition officials have declined to specify how many have been assigned to Kunduz. On Thursday, half a dozen U.S. troops in combat gear were seen in a Toyota pickup cruising through the Afghan base. \nAccording to an Interior Ministry official, U.S. military commanders in Kabul are increasingly involved in trying to bolster communication and coordination between Afghan army and police units. Many analysts say that basic military command-and-control procedures broke down Monday as the Taliban advanced. \nThe official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter freely, added that Afghan forces at times this week appeared to be close to the “breaking point” because of declining morale. In frank discussions with coalition commanders, Afghan generals have pleaded for more help from the international community. \n“They are saying, ‘Please give us more weapons, more ammunition, tanks, and then we can fight the Taliban,’ ” the official said. \nCoalition commanders are responding, the official said, with tough talk. \n“The Americans are saying, ‘It’s war, but it’s an Afghan war, and you have to face it, tolerate it, so you can survive and save the country,’ ” the official said. \nThe fighting in Kunduz, Afghan security officials are apparently being told, “is practice for you guys.” \nCraig reported from Kabul.
