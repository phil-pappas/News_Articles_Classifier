The data gathered provides information on the effectiveness of the learning programmes in terms of who they reach, what learning they receive, and what outcomes are achieved. To help FE providers in collecting the correct data for different types of learners, a list of the fields required for each funding model is given in section 17 of the Provider Support Manual. We have also listed information about, and links, to useful ILR data sources below: Learning aim codes Learning aim codes are available from the following sources: Learning aims search An online learning aims search facility is available on the Hub, where you can access and search Learning Aim Reference Service (LARS) data by aims, levels, frameworks & qualifications. Historical learning aim information The learning aims search facility on the Hub is now available, and therefore we will decommission the previous systems LAD (Learning Aims Database) and LARA (Learning Aims Reference Application). If you wish to interrogate the data available in previous academic year, we have made a number of datasets available for download These datasets are available in .mdb format and will cover the following periods: Academic year 2012/13 LARA Academic year 2011/12 LARA Academic year 2010/11 LAD Academic year 2009/10 LAD Academic year 2008/09 LAD The LARS Lite system that was used to support the Funding Information System (FIS) for 2013 to 2014 has now been decommissioned. So that you can search for data for previous academic years, the final LARS Lite data sets produced can be downloaded from here (dated 6 October 2014). Simplified funding rates catalogue 2014 to 2015 The catalogue lists all provision which we have approved for public funding in 2014 to 2015 and the funding rates: Simplified Funding Rates Catalogue 2014 to 2015 HE learning aim request due date 2015 Providers requesting new learning aims for prescribed Higher Education provision for the 2014 to 2015 funding year must submit completed forms together with all relevant approval information to us by Thursday 01 October 2015. This will allow them to be created and uploaded to the Learning Aim Reference Service (LARS) database for the R14 ILR submission that opens on 12 October 2015 and closes on 23 October 2015. We recommend that providers request these aims throughout the funding year to ensure that their ILR submissions are up to date. The form and the guidance are available to download from this page. The completed form should be emailed to the service desk at servicedesk@sfa.bis.gov.uk. ILR specification 2014 to 2015 appendix H A technical specification of the classification and coding system to be used to record non-regulated provision in the ILR for 2014 to 2015: ILR specification 2014 to 2015 appendix H Unique learner numbers (ULNs) A ULN is a 10-digit reference number, used as a single common identifier for UK learners aged 14 and over. Each ULN is issued and held by the Learning Record Service (LRS), part of the Skills Funding Agency. Employer reference numbers (ERNs) ERNs are entered in the employer identifier field in an ILR data collection. They can be obtained from and validated by the Employer Data Service (EDS). The Employer Data Service (EDS) user guide provides information about the employer reference number with the individualised learner record. distributed by This content was issued by Skills Funding Agency on the 2015-10-08 and was initially posted on skillsfundingagency.bis.gov.uk.
