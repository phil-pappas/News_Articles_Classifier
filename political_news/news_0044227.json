I am sure that the close relationship between our two countries will continue under his leadership. \n\"I would also like to acknowledge Stephen Harper whom I had the pleasure of working alongside for many years. He was a strong leader for Canada and I wish him all the best for the future.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:43:08.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
