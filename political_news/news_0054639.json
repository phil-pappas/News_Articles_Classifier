He is planning to attend next month's meeting. \nMr Corbyn was seated between Wang Yajun, director general of the policy planning department of the Chinese foreign ministry, and the Lady Mayoress of London, Gilly Yarrow, the wife of the Lord Mayor. \nThe dress code, which is outlined on the invitations, is evening dress (white tie), decorations, full ceremonial evening dress for serving officers, or national dress. \nIt is intended as guidance, so guests are aware of what others will be wearing, and on occasion, some have worn black-tie instead. Mr Corbyn could have opted for this instead of white tie and tails but it would not have been the norm. \nFollowing the president's speech, the national anthem was played by the orchestra and guests stood but, as is always tradition, did not sing. \nMr Corbyn, who did not join in with singing the national anthem at the Battle of Britain 75th anniversary commemorations, was spared having to test his vocal chords this time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:16:36.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
