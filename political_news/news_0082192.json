President Obama speaks during a meeting with leaders from the Trans-Pacific Partnership at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on Nov. 10, 2014.\nBy Gabrielle Levy Oct. 5, 2015 | 3:47 p.m. EDT + More Monday's announcement that trade representatives from the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim nations had completed negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership was met with cheers from the business community and a muted reception on Capitol Hill.\nThe sprawling free trade agreement, completed after five years of talks, involves countries that together account for 40 percent of the world's gross domestic product. The pact now must be individually approved by each of the 12 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the U.S. and Vietnam.\nOn its face, the agreement aims to ease trade barriers among the countries for exports like automobiles and agricultural products. It also contains provisions regarding the environment, intellectual property and the Internet, and is a key cog in the Obama administration's \"pivot\" to Asia – a strategy in which the U.S. has stressed increasing its attention and presence in the Western Pacific to counterbalance China's growing influence there.\nRELATED\nTrans-Pacific Partnership Becomes a 2016 Election Issue \"In addition to liberalizing trade and investment between us, this agreement addresses the challenges our stakeholders face in the 21st century, while taking into account the diversity of our levels of development,\" the trade ministers of the participating nations said in a joint statement. \"We expect this historic agreement to promote economic growth, support higher-paying jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards; reduce poverty in our countries; and to promote transparency, good governance, and strong labor and environmental protections.\"\nThe deal has been warmly embraced by groups such as Business Roundtable and Business Forward , who say it will open new markets to U.S. exports and boost foreign investment within the U.S.\n\"While we don't yet know all the details of today's agreement, TPP holds the potential to help U.S. businesses, farmers and workers sell more goods and services to 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, which would support American jobs and U.S. economic growth,\" said Tom Linebarger, chairman of the Business Roundtable International Engagement Committee.\nOn the Hill, however, the Obama administration still has plenty of work to do. In June, Congress granted President Barack Obama trade promotion, or \"fast-track,\" authority over the stringent objections of both liberal and conservative lawmakers. The legislation – which limited lawmakers to an up-or-down vote on the finalized agreement – squeaked through in both chambers, with just 218 yea votes in the House and 60 in the Senate.\nReaction Monday to the final agreement was divided along similar lines. No text of the deal had yet been made available to Congress, but many lawmakers made their opposition known based on information leaked out of the Atlanta discussions.\n\"I am disappointed by, not surprised by, the decision to move forward on the disastrous TPP that will hurt consumers and cost American jobs,\" said Sen. Bernie Sanders , the Vermont independent whose insurgent campaign has reshaped the Democratic presidential primary. \"I will do all that I can to defeat the TPP agreement.\"\nSanders also opposed TPP's predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and sides with many liberals and labor unions who blame NAFTA for heavy job losses. His main competitor for the Democratic nomination, front-runner Hillary Clinton , appeared to back away from the agreement in June.\nSee Photos\n5 Things to Know about Congress This Week: 10/2/2015 The Republican primary competitors have been fairly mixed on TPP issues. Among those who can actually vote on the agreement – something that likely won't take place until next year – Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against granting Obama fast-track in June, while Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida supported doing so. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas voted against the legislation, despite his support for free trade agreements, after accusing Senate leadership of cutting a deal to renew the expired Export-Import Bank charter to get wavering Democrats on board with fast-track. GOP front-runner Donald Trump came out against the agreement in May, and has been joined by fellow outsider candidates Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina in opposing the deal.\nWhile Congress has never voted down a deal struck under fast-track parameters, the opposition of both parties' outside wings – which have become increasingly vocal in congressional politics and the presidential campaign – poses a significant challenge for Obama as he tries to secure what would be a signature accomplishment.\nEven some lawmakers who supported fast-track earlier this year were noticeably cool in their statements Monday.\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, voted in June for fast-track but on Monday slammed the agreement as \"woefully short\" of the \"high-standard objectives laid out in bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority.\"\nWhile opponents to the agreement have charged that certain patent protections for pharmaceuticals would make medicines more expensive and erect barriers to development, Hatch has previously suggested the deal won't go far enough to protect intellectual property.\n\"A poor deal risks losing a historic opportunity to break down trade barriers for American-made products with a trade block representing 40 percent of the global economy,\" Hatch said in a statement Monday. \"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the United States should not settle for a mediocre deal that fails to set high-standard trade rules in the Asia-Pacific region for years to come.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell – who sided with Obama in an unlikely partnership to pass fast-track authority – noted Monday there are \"serious concerns … on a number of key issues\" involved with the deal. In a July letter, McConnell complained about a carve-out that would block tobacco companies from being able to sue countries that pass laws restricting their product.\n\"The Trans-Pacific Partnership is potentially one of the most significant trade deals in history and ‎could shape our engagement and commerce with these nations for decades,\" McConnell said Monday. \"This deal demands intense scrutiny by Congress and ... in the months ahead, the Senate will review this agreement to determine if it meets the high standards Congress and the American people have demanded.\"\nRELATED\nGOP: ‘Trade Is Going Forward’\nThe AFL-CIO accused the Obama administration of \"rushing through a bad deal\" after making \"many problematic concessions.\" Ford Motor Co., which has previously favored free trade agreements, also on Monday urged Congress to reject the TPP, referencing previous concerns that the deal would not do enough to guard against countries' manipulating their currencies to gain a trade advantage.\n\"U.S. lawmakers took unprecedented action to set a clear negotiating objective for addressing currency manipulation in all future trade deals. The TPP fails to meet that test,\" Ziad Ojakli, group vice president for government and community relations at Ford, said in a statement. \"To ensure the future competitiveness of American manufacturing, we recommend Congress not approve TPP in its current form, and ask the administration to renegotiate TPP and incorporate strong and enforceable currency rules. This step is critical to achieving free trade in the 21st century.\"\nFor liberals who have long opposed the expanded trade agreement, Republicans' opposition was welcomed, even if it came for reasons different than their own.\n\"Both Democrats and Republicans understand this is a bad deal for U.S. jobs and workers and their wages,\" Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said on a call with reporters Monday.\n\"If there's some members out there who are concerned about the pharmaceutical companies or the tobacco companies and they vote against this deal too, I would welcome their support,\" added Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif. \"I don't think there's anything in this draft that's going to chip away at our large group of votes, and I hope there are a few things that will add to it.\"\nTAGS: NAFTA international trade Obama, Barack Hatch, Orrin McConnell, Mitch 2016 presidential election DeLauro, Rosa Sherman, Brad", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwz4l%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/sensanders/status/651027737034031104", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwz4l%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Trans-Pacific%20Partnership%20Faces%20Uncertain%20Future%20Despite%20Final%20Agreement", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwz4l%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Trans-Pacific%20Partnership%20Faces%20Uncertain%20Future%20Despite%20Final%20Agreement&summary=The%20Trans-Pacific%20Partnership%20got%20a%20cool%20reception%20Monday%20on%20Capitol%20Hill%2C%20even%20from%20some%20who%20helped%20push%20for%20it.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwz4l%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.businessfwd.org/blog/u-s-reaches-deal-on-trans-pacific-partnership-with-11-other-countries", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwz4l%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdwz4l%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Trans-Pacific%20Partnership%20Faces%20Uncertain%20Future%20Despite%20Final%20Agreement"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:37:59.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
