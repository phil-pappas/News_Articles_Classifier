That’s making it harder for some people to meet loan installments on vehicles purchased to work for the ride-hailing app. Uber spokesman Karun Arya said incentive payments are down across Indian cities.\n“Those who bought cars in the last four months are scared of incentives coming down further,” Singh said in an interview, adding he’s provided rides on Uber’s smartphone-based platform for two years.\nCooling incentives highlight the question of how long the San Francisco-based company can fund subsidies to spur expansion in its largest market geographically after the US, Singh said Uber drivers are still earning about Rs80,000 monthly — or more than double the pay of junior retail bankers in India, recruitment specialist ManpowerGroup Inc. estimates.\nUber’s Arya said incentive programs are temporary, often change and differ across the 22 Indian cities where the platform operates. While multiple drivers in New Delhi said the payments were about Rs400 per trip in February, Uber denied the figure was ever that high.\n200,000 drivers \nThe company expects to have more than 200,000 drivers in India by 2016, puts its market share at over 40% and in July said it plans $1 billion of investment in the country to achieve over 1 million trips per day by next year. The drivers are independent contractors working with the platform, rather than employees.\nTaxi apps such as Uber see a long-term opportunity in India’s poor public transportation services, low car ownership levels and 1.3 billion population.\nUber can keep adding customers and drivers even as it pares subsidies given the quality of service it offers and because its pay levels will remain attractive, according to Technopak Advisors Pvt.\nWhile Indian taxi stands provide unclean cars and confusing charging structures, Uber offers transparent pricing and a pick up within a few minutes, encouraging customer loyalty, Technopak chairman Arvind K. Singhal said in an interview.\nAverage monthly white-collar starting pay in India is about Rs24,000, ManpowerGroup Inc.’s India President Srikanth Rengarajan said in an interview. That’s less than half the amount driver Singh says he can earn.\nAs in other nations, Uber faces regulatory hurdles and domestic competition in India.\nUnlike in the US, only for-hire vehicles rather than individuals with private cars are allowed to offer services using a smartphone application. The central government this month also outlined guidelines for how local officials can license app-based ride-hailing service providers. \nThat includes recommended safety measures, after a high- profile incident in December when a woman accused an Uber driver of raping and beating her during a ride home.\n$50 billion \nAmong Uber’s Indian competitors, Local rival Ola, owned by ANI Technologies Pvt., said in September that it will lease cars to boost the number of vehicles in its network.\nDespite challenges, Uber has attracted investments from Microsoft Corp., Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s founder Jeff Bezos, valuing the company at $50 billion.\nAs cabs lured by app-based platforms proliferate in India, drivers are facing stiffer competition for rides. But the money is still good enough to attract workers like 51-year-old Bhag Singh — no relation to Sujas —- who went from earning Rs30,000 a month driving a motorized rickshaw to Rs100,000 with Uber, before a recent dip back to Rs80,000.\nDespite the slowdown, Bhag Singh sees an opportunity for the next generation of his family.\n“My son views it as a career option in case he doesn’t get a good job after he graduates,” Singh said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:29:47.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
