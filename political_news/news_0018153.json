Finally, we have succeeded and Geeta is very happy. We have told her that her travel documents are being prepared,\" he said. The government tracked down her family that lives in Bihar and Geeta identified her father and other family members after seeing the photographs sent to her by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.\nGeeta will be back in India soon. We have located her family. She will be handed over to them only after the DNA test. #Geeta\n— Sushma Swaraj (@SushmaSwaraj) October 15, 2015 Geeta’s story had caught the imagination of Indian media due to its striking similarity to the Salman Khan starrer blockbuster Bollywood movie \"Bajrangi Bhaijaan\", in which a young speech impaired Pakistani girl gets stuck in India.\nIn the movie, the young girl is reunited with her family within a year, while Geeta’s ordeal has lasted for 15 long years. She will be flying back home as soon as her travel documents are in place.\nSpokesperson in the External Affairs Ministry Vikas Swarup said three sets of photographs were sent to Geeta, out of which she has identified one as possibly her parents but added that a conclusive proof of parentage could be only established through DNA testing.\nGeeta's Indian nationality has already been verified and she will brought to India as her \"coming back to India is not dependent on whether or not we discover her parents. She is daughter of India. It is our duty to bring her back to India very very shortly.\"\n\"If the DNA testing verifies that they are indeed her parents then she will be handed over to them. If not, we have identified two institutions one in Delhi and one in Indore-which are meant for people with certain disabilities. We believe that Geeta will find very good and welcoming home there.... The procedure to bring her back is almost complete,\" the Spokesperson said.\nHe also said that two members of Edhi Foundation which has been taking care of Geeta will accompany her to India.\nRead:\nSushma asks Akhilesh to send pics of 'Geeta's family'\nGeeta's Indian lawyer wants DNA test to determine parentage\nGeeta is believed to have inadvertently crossed over to Pakistani territory as a child. She was 7-8 years old when she was found by the Pakistan Rangers 15 years ago at Lahore railway station, according to reports from there.\nFour families from Punjab, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh have claimed Geeta is their daughter and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has asked Chief Ministers of these states to send photographs of those claiming to be her parents, which could be sent to her for identification.\n Bajrangi Bhaijaan Geeta deaf mute girl Pakistan Also Read Nine-month-old booked for attempt to murder in Pakistan Militants kill engineer in Pakistan airport attack, destroy radar Why Pakistan film industry wanted Bajrangi Bhaijaan release stalled Over 125 million mobile phone users in Pakistan may lose connections", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/geeta_1_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/geeta_1_1_0_1_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Geeta?src=hash", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151015/world-neighbours/article/indian-girl-stuck-pakistan-15-years-be-reunited-family-soon", "https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj/status/654563970175528960", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:06:47.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
