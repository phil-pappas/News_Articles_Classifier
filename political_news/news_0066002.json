So she repeated the question, prompting Biden to hold up his hands and laugh. \n\"Is there still an opening for you in the race, sir?\" another reporter asked. \n\"I'm here to greet President Park. I'll talk to you all about that later,\" he said. When the reporter asked whether Democrats deserve his decision, Biden laughed. Â© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.
