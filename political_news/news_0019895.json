Jeb Bush was back in Michigan Thursday for an evening fundraiser in Oakland County for his presidential campaign — his fourth visit to the state this year.\nCiting security reasons, a Bush campaign spokeswoman would not say where the fundraiser is being held and when.\n“I’m sure we’ll be back in November,” said Bush spokeswoman Emily Benavides, declining to elaborate on any future visits by the former two-term Florida governor.\nBush’s fundraiser came after his third-quarter campaign contributions in Michigan declined 65 percent to $115,675, compared with the $332,650 he raised from state donors during the second quarter from April 1 through June 30, a Detroit News analysis of campaign finance data shows.\nHundreds of Bush’s loyal Michigan donors have already made the maximum $2,700-per-person contribution permitted under the law for the 2016 GOP presidential primaries with about two and a half months to go before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.\nDespite having an early fund-raising advantage, Bush also has seen his standing in public polls drop over the summer.\nAt 7 percent, he now trails billionaire business tycoon Donald Trump, retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz among likely GOP voters, according to an average of recent surveys compiled by Real Clear Politics .\nBush is traveling to Michigan from Nevada. There on Wednesday he proposed moving the U.S. Interior Department from Washington, D.C., to a Western state where the vast majority of federally owned land is managed.\nBush campaigned in Texas on Sunday and California on Monday.\nBenavides said the Michigan fundraiser was Bush’s only stop in the state. He was then headed to Virginia for an event on Friday, followed by a presidential candidates forum in South Carolina on Saturday, she said.\nBush was last in Michigan Sept. 18-19 to speak at the state Republican Party’s biennial leadership conference at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island.\nIn May, Bush made a two-day swing through Michigan. He spoke at an Ingham County Republican dinner, toured an anthrax plant in Lansing and met with educators and school children at a charter school inside Dearborn’s Greenfield Village .\nIn February, Bush began testing his policy positions before becoming a presidential candidate during a speech to members of the Detroit Economic Club.\nclivengood@detroitnews.com \n(517) 371-3660 \nTwitter.com/ChadLivengood", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:50:42.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
