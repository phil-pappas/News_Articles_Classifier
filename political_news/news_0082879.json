Several countries are holding firm. But there are real fears New Zealand could cave. \nTrade Minister Groser is quoted in this morning’s Herald as saying every country will have to swallow multiple dead rats to finalise the deal in an ‘ugly compromise’. \n‘In New Zealand’s case, the dead rat seems to be a dairy for medicines deal’, said Professor Kelsey. ‘If this happens, we can expect the Minister to hail the \"net benefits\" of the TPPA to New Zealand, playing up supposed gains to dairy exports that remain to be seen, and playing down New Zealand’s agreement to longer monopoly protection for biologics.’ \n‘But the stark reality is that any such deal to close the TPPA would cost New Zealander’s lives.’ \nHealth economists calculate that every added year of protection for biologics would cost New Zealand many tens of millions of dollars in current spending, and much more in the future as more biologics come on stream. \n‘Future New Zealand governments would have to stump up hundreds of millions of dollars more to Pharmac. Yet this year the National government refused to fund even the modest budget increase Pharmac sought to meet rising costs.’ \n‘Cancer sufferers in Atlanta described the biologics provision as a \"death sentence clause\". Do Prime Minister Key and Minister Groser want that recorded as their legacy?’ \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:35:44.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
