The bill doesn't actually mention Planned Parenthood, but it stems directly from the release of undercover videos involving the group. \"Our investigation has raised many more questions than we've been able to find answers,\" said Marsha Blackburn, the expected panel chair. \"We need to have a national conversation.\" This is the second special committee created by Republicans since their takeover of the House in 2011, the other being Benghazi, notes the Washington Post . Democrats immediately drew a parallel. \"Here we go again—Planned Parenthood is the new Benghazi,\" said Lois Frankel. The panel is set up to have seven Republicans and six Democrats, though it's unclear whether any Democrats will participate. Its authority will go beyond just Planned Parenthood, involving all \"medical procedures and business practices used by entities involved in fetal tissue procurement\" and \"any other relevant matters with respect to fetal tissue procurement.\" The panel also will examine federal funding for abortion providers. \"It’s become very obvious that this is all part of a political agenda to make abortion illegal in this country,\" says an executive at Planned Parenthood.
