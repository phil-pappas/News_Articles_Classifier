Jo Holmes, a Spokesperson for the Auckland Ratepayers’ Alliance, says: \n\"While many ratepayers may be against the TPPA deal, or want more information from the Government, very few will appreciate Auckland Council sticking its beak in and wasting more of ratepayers' money debating matters they have no jurisdiction over.\" \n\"At the meeting members of the Council were calling this stunt a total waste of ratepayer money. Instead of wasting two hours, or around $40,000 on discussing the TPPA, Councillors could go do something useful instead - mow a few berms perhaps.\" \n\"Len Brown and his Council should leave international relations to Wellington. We don’t need to pay twice.\" \nAll articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users.
