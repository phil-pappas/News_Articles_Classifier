(Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press) Mulcair: \"This is about what the Liberals do\" 1:32 Related Stories British Columbia's 3-way race could decide election \nDan Gagnier's sudden resignation from the Liberal campaign hounded party leader Justin Trudeau again Friday, as he insisted that the former campaign co-chair's connection to the energy sector was known publicly for months and that he left the Liberal campaign less than 24 hours after an \"inappropriate\" email to pipeline company officials surfaced. \nGagnier resigned as co-chair earlier this week after an email he wrote to TransCanada Corp., a company involved in the controversial proposed Energy East pipeline, advising several high-level employees on how to effectively lobby a government to have the pipeline project approved. POLL TRACKER | Follow the latest numbers \nDuring a campaign stop in Mississauga, Ont., this morning, Trudeau was for the second day peppered with questions from reporters about whether Gagnier's involvement in his campaign was ethical, and if the incident calls into doubt Trudeau's own ethics. Dan Gagnier's work as a lobbying consultant for TransCanada Corp. was known publicly for months, Justin Trudeau said Friday. (liberal.ca) \nThe Liberal leader insisted that he took immediate action when the email surfaced and Gagnier resigned, despite the party's initial insistence that Gagnier had not broken any rules or laws. \nTrudeau said he had wanted Gagnier on his campaign team because he believes in surrounding himself with advisers and volunteers with a wide range of experiences and perspectives, adding that any prime minister should strive to have a diverse group of people surrounding him â€” something he said Conservative Leader Stephen Harper has resolutely failed to do because he wants to make all decisions himself. \nIt is not uncommon for lobbyists to hold high-level positions during election campaigns, and that each of the main federal parties currently battling to form government following the Oct. 19 election have lobbyists in various positions. \nIn his job as a lobbyist and consultant, Gagnier was providing advice to clients in his leadership position throughout the campaign. He had been a consultant for TransCanada Corp since the spring of this year. \nDespite the prevalence of the practice during election campaigns, the NDP has written to the Commissioner of Canada Elections, seeking an investigation into \"the possibility of a contravention of the Elections Act, by either or both of the Liberal Party of Canada, and/or TransCanada Corporation.\" The letter states that Gagnier may have contravened the Elections Act as well. \nTrudeau was in Mississauga to highlight his party's plan for seniors. He was introduced by longtime former Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallion, who also plays a role in the Liberals' most recent campaign advertisement aimed at seniors. \nHe told the audience that the Tories' constant efforts to mislead seniors on the Grits' campaign platform was a sign of desperation. \n\"They know they can't win a fair fight, so they go for the low blow,\" Trudeau said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:38:20.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
