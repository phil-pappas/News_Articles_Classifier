This local social media campaign is targeted towards all ages by encouraging participants to take part in bubble blowing activities.\nThe Pop for Hope Challenge, which is both simple and fun, will be championed by local businesses and celebrities including Houston Rockets star James Harden , and Houston media personalities: Tom Koch , Michael Berry , Dominique Sachse , Ken Hoffman , Cleverley Stone, Dayna Steele , Peter Remington , Katherine Whaley , and Michael Garfield – all of whom have created personal videos that will kick-off this viral fundraising effort. Pop for Hope encourages participants to either blow a bubble gum or soap bubble, challenge a friend, school, organization or business to do the same and donate to Casa de Esperanza. A minimum donation of $10 is suggested – making this an event that anyone can be part of and give voice to the issue of child abuse.\nPeople can spread the word of the challenge to friends and co-workers by tagging or naming them in videos posted on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and other social media sites. Those challenged can accept by uploading a bubble-blowing video and tagging or naming their friends or make a donation to Casa de Esperanza.\nPop for Hope donations will be used to help open a home in the Casa de Esperanza neighborhood so the organization can care for more children and provide funding for Hands of Hope Interns, who care for the children. The goal is to increase capacity and keep children safe. Funds will also be used to recruit, train and provide casework support to volunteer community foster families in Casa's community foster care program, so they can provide homes for more children. https://www.casahope.org/p-pop-for-hope .\nAbout Casa de Esperanza\nCasa de Esperanza strives to break the destructive cycle of child abuse by offering safe homes to children of families in crisis.
