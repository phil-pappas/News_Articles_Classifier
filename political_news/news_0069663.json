(disclosure: I worked for Leadnow for one week in July on this campaign)\nThe recommendations are being communicated in an effort to avoid vote-splitting between 'progressive' parties in swing ridings the Conservative could easily win.\nThe choices were based on input at the riding level from residents who pledged to vote strategically. Selection has relied heavily on local polling and door-to-door outreach, intensive new developments for a strategic voting effort.\nAmara Possian, Campaign Manager for Leadnow, says “these recommendations show that Canadians are prepared to unite to defeat the Conservatives.”\nThe Liberals, NDP and Greens, meanwhile, are encouraging Canadians to vote for their first choice and not to vote strategically.\nMore recommendations will be made and released on VoteTogether.ca just days before the election. Information about races in every riding is available on the site, but only some ridings – where local strategic voting campaigns have been very active - will have candidate recommendations.\nVote Together Recommended Candidates\nAlberta\nCalgary Centre: Kent Hehr (Liberal)\nCalgary Confederation: Matt Grant (Liberal)\nBritish Columbia\nCowichan-Malahat-Langford: Alistair MacGregor (NDP)\nKootenay-Columbia: Wayne Stetski (NDP)\nNanaimo-Ladysmith: Seila Malcolmson (NDP)\nNorth Island – Powell River: Rachel Blaney (NDP)\nPort Moody-Coquitlam: Fin Donnelly (NDP)\nManitoba\nElmwood-Transcona: Daniel Blaikie (NDP)\nWinnipeg South Centre: Jim Carr (Liberal)\nNew Brunswick\nFredericton: Matt Decourcey (Liberal)\nOntario\nEglinton-Lawrence: Marco Mendicino (Liberal)\nEtobicoke-Lakeshore: James Maloney (Liberal)\nLondon North Centre: Peter Fragiskatos (Liberal)\nWaterloo: Bardish Chagger (Liberal)\nWillowdale: Ali Ehsassi (Liberal)\nSaskatchewan\nSaskatoon-University: Claire Card (NDP)", "external_links": ["http://www.votetogether.ca/pages/recommendations/", "http://www.mediacoop.ca/sites/mediacoop.ca/files2/mc/imagecache/page450/harper_1.jpg", "http://www.votetogether.ca/"], "published": "2015-10-11T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:06:43.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
