With all the questions that have been raised, we feel there would be greater accountability and a cost savings if we took the service in-house,” said Mayor Stephanie Murray. “We also believe we can provide a more comprehensive service to our residents.”\nDeputy Mayor Steve Massell said that Middletown doing it’s assessments and inspections in house will save the Township’s taxpayers money, and ultimately create savings for residents of neighboring towns. “Once we have a year of doing this work ourselves under our belt, we’ll be able to offer the service to other communities as a share services agreement, ” Massell said.\n“Given the allegations against RDS and given our ability to do the job ourselves, it makes perfect sense for us to manage this program internally,” said Committeeman Tony Fiore.", "external_links": ["http://www.moremonmouthmusings.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/money-500x250.jpg", "http://php.app.com/taxpain/2015/10/12/windfall-for-tax-assessors/", "http://www.moremonmouthmusings.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/money-500x250-300x150.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:04:29.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
