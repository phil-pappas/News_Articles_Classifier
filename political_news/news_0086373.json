The changes proposed for council and community board electoral boundaries will affect their voting for years to come,\" she says. \n\"We know that our young citizens are interested in democracy - this is their chance to tell us if we've got it right. Does the proposal have too many councillors, wards and community boards or not enough? \nDeputy Mayor Buck says the city has changed a lot since the last representation review six years ago. \n\"Everyone needs to have their say about this. It's easy to do, with just a few simple questions to answer online.\" \nEvery six years the law requires local bodies to review their electoral arrangements. The Council's Initial Proposal suggests wide-spread changes to ward boundaries, an increase in councillor numbers from 13 to 16, and fewer community boards, down to seven from the current eight. \nThe proposal also suggests joining Banks Peninsula ward with areas of Sumner. \nComments can be made online, and the Representation Review 2015 consultation booklet with detailed maps is also online. Public consultation closes at 5pm on Friday 9 October. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:05:06.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
