Paul Ryan, R-Wis., should replace John Boehner as speaker of the House.\nRyan's name has garnered approval among a variety of party members, including members of the conservative Freedom Caucus, along with more establishment- oriented Republicans. All say they can back him.\nAnd some leading Republicans are also showing support.\n\"I did everything except carry his gym bag this morning trying to get him to do it,\" Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said.\n\"I think he'd be an amazing speaker,\" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the man who was the most likely replacement for Boehner before he suddenly withdrew.\nRep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the powerful House Government Oversight and Reform Committee, is also seeking the House speaker position. But even he says he could back Ryan if necessary.\n\"I'm a huge fan of Paul Ryan; I would support Paul Ryan and I would hope that he would do it,\" Chaffetz said.\nIn addition to Chaffetz, some other Republicans are also running for the position. Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., is eagerly seeking the post, with the support of the Freedom Caucus.\nMeanwhile, Ryan has repeatedly said he doesn't want the job, although he's said to be thinking about it.\nIt's still uncertain whether Ryan could get the necessary votes to be elected speaker.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:40:02.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
