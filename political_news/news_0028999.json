Steve Nass (R-Whitewater), chairman of the Senate labor committee, wants to leave the state's current practice in place. Republicans on Nass's committee passed on a party-line 3-2 vote an amended version of the bill later Wednesday without the prohibition .\nThe Assembly is likely to pass its version of the civil service bill next week before lawmakers finish their fall session.\nBut with both sides holding firm, the disagreement between GOP lawmakers means that the proposal is unlikely to get through the Senate until January, at least. That's one thing that both Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke (R-Kaukauna), one of the bill's co-sponsors, and Nass chief of staff Mike Mikalsen agree on.\nThe overall bill would overhaul a system begun in 1905 that is aimed at ensuring tax dollars go for competent state employees rather than political hacks.\nRepublican Gov. Scott Walker has strongly backed the proposal, which he took up as a major cause just days after he dropped out of the race for president last month.\nWalker's administration has said the civil service rules for 30,000 state workers need reworking to become more efficient and help keep up with the crush of retiring baby boomers. But it's drawn criticism from Democrats who fear it could lead to cronyism.\nIt has gotten a mixed reception of skepticism and praise from others who formerly worked within the state's system of merit hiring and firing.\nThe proposal would have originally increased the probationary period for state workers from six months to two years. Under a GOP amendment adopted by the Assembly committee Wednesday on another 8-5 party line vote, the probation period would instead increase to one year, with state managers having the option to seek an extension of another year.\nThe amendment would also allow the state's technical colleges to maintain their own human resources staffs, instead of having them consolidated with other units of state government, Steineke said.\nThe amended bill also requires Walker's administration to bring a plan implementing the changes to the Legislature's budget committee by March 2017.\nThe Senate committee approved similar changes to the bill Wednesday in addition to the provision dealing with applicants' criminal history. The Senate panel also required the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau to evaluate how the new system is working.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/335000561/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-23T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:27:46.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
