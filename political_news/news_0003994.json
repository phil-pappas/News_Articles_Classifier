Kennedy International Airport in New York. The Transportation Security Administration has a program called SPOT that lets behavior detection officers screen passengers' facial expressions for potential malicious intent.

Hugh Handeyside says there's no evidence that deception or \"mal-intent\" can reliably be detected through observation, especially in an unstructured setting like an airport screening area.

The SPOT program officers typically spend less than 30 seconds scanning an average passenger for over 90 behaviors that the TSA say are linked to stress, fear or deception.

TSA officers' perception of people's behaviors is inherently subjective, Handeyside says. The fact that many people find airport settings inherently stressful only compounds the problem.

Just about everyone outside the TSA who has reviewed the SPOT program has decided that it's unscientific and a waste of money, Handeyside says.

Despite the criticisms, SPOT remains in place and has cost taxpayers well over $1 billion since its inception in 2007. The SPOT program should be terminated, Handeyside says.

The agency, which has removed the word from its website, agreed to stop using the term after Shadow Petoscary, a transgender woman, complained online about her experience last month at an Orlando airport. The woman protested after airport security held her for 40 minutes because of an \"anomaly\" detected when she walked through the full body scanner. She tweeted the entire interaction: \"I am being held by the TSA in Orlando because of an \"anomaly\" (my penis)\" Petoscary tweeted last month. The TSA replied that it would investigate.

The TSA says in its procedures that it screens transgender people as \"he or she presents themselves at the security checkpoint.\" And now it also pledges to review its training policy so that officers are more sensitive to these passengers. The change was cheered by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. \"Transgender people deserve respect, safety, and equal treatment everywhere. Good move by @TSA,\" she tweeted .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:07:15.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
