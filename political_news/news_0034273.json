They were allegedly discussing Pakistan terrorist Ajmal Kasab and the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.\nThe city police force which was already on alert due to Prime Minister Modi’s day long visit to the financial capital on Sunday is now extra vigilant as the input provided by the auto driver “can't be ignored considering the nature of his claim,\" a senior IPS officer from the Mumbai Crime branch said.\nAccording to reports, the auto driver had picked up three men from Sion in Mumbai on Saturday evening at 7.30 pm and had dropped them at Airoli. While driving, the auto driver heard fragments of their conversation and heard the words “Kasab” and “boss” and started to pay attention to grasp what they were discussing.\nWhile two men spoke fluent Hindi, the third man had a hard time conversing in the language. One of the passengers allegedly said “Who will look after my family if I execute the plan well?” and the other man responded saying, “you don’t have to worry about anything as long as our boss is there, look at Kasab’s family, they are doing well”.\nAfter the passengers alighted at Airoli bridge, they crossed the toll plaza and took another auto which headed towards Navi Mumbai. The driver tried to note down the number of the other auto but failed to do so as it sped away.\nThe quick thinking driver then rushed to Navghar police station and informed the cops about what had transpired. According to his statement to the police, the three men were carrying three huge bags that they clutched closely and kept on their laps throughout the journey. The driver also said that the men kept asking him questions about various locations in Mumbai and it seemed like they were new to the city. He also provided the police with their physical description.\nThe Maharasthra anti-terrorism squad was called in following the auto-driver’s report and ATS officers have made sketches of the two suspects that have been distributed to all police station in the area including special crime branch units. ATS, teams from Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai crime branches are working on the case.\n Ajmal Kasab auto driver Maharasthra anti-terrorism squad nation Also Read Unfazed Mulayam Singh says 'wrong' anti-rape law should be amended All above 75 in BJP declared brain dead by PM, says BJP leader Yashwant Sinha India, China suffer heavily due to air pollution: study PM Narendra Modi launches scheme for Member of Parliaments to adopt villages", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/ATS-official_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/ATS-official_0_0_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/nation-current-affairs/article/auto-driver-overhears-trio-discussing-ajmal-kasab-maharashtra", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:10:10.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
