Bush bears some responsibility for the attacks on 9/11, Politico reports. During an interview with Bloomberg , the GOP presidential frontrunner was asked if he would be able to show compassion and reassure Americans during a natural disaster or terrorist attack. He responded by saying he's more \"competent\" and has a \"bigger heart\" than either of his predecessors. He also pointed out that 9/11 happened while Bush was in charge. When the interviewer expressed shock he could blame the former president, Trump seemingly stuck by it. \"He was president, OK?\" Trump said. \"The World Trade Center came down during his reign.\" The New York Times reports Trump's comments on 9/11 are just the most recent in a string of criticisms directed at George W. Bush as part of his attacks on primary opponent Jeb Bush. “Your brother’s administration gave us Barack Obama because it was such a disaster, those last three months, that Abraham Lincoln couldn’t have been elected,” Trump told Jeb Bush during a debate in September. While George W. Bush refused to address Trump's latest comments, Jeb Bush weighed in on Twitter: \"How pathetic for @realdonaldtrump to criticize the president for 9/11. We were attacked & my brother kept us safe.\" Donald Trump insinuated George W. Bush was at least partly to blame for the 9/11 attacks during an interview Friday.
