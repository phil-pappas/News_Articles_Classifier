The truth of the matter is that poor communities are more vulnerable.” \nWest Virginia leads the nation in drug overdose deaths, with 33.5 fatalities per every 100,000 people — more than twice the national average. Mr. Obama is proposing steps to help communities cope, such as expanded training for doctors who prescribe painkillers and more money for treatment centers. \nHe said West Virginia’s high rate of drug overdose cases “partly has to do with the economics that have been taking place in some of these communities.” \nBut West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said before Mr. Obama’s visit that the prevalence of local drug abuse and the state’s 7.3 percent unemployment rate are tied to punitive federal regulations on the coal-mining industry. \n“While President Obama finds it necessary to address our state about a war on drugs, it is inconceivable that he refuses to address in any meaningful way the plight of our miners and their families,” he said in a statement. “The president’s policies have consigned our state to poverty and have caused a loss of hope in our citizens.” \nRep. Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia Republican, held a rally with other local officials and miners at the state Capitol to protest the president’s mining policies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:49:52.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
