Against the backdrop of the US government's latest extension of its military commitment to Afghanistan, it is worth noting that the province is precariously situated along the same political faultlines that recently rattled Kunduz province.\nContinued instability in Faryab and its adjacent provinces risks undermining the country at a time when Afghanistan is haemorrhaging on all fronts.\nUndermining the government\nWhy is Obama changing his mind on Afghanistan?\nIt is no secret that Faryab has been a hotbed of insurgent activity since the civil war of the 1990s. Its lucrative natural resources and agriculturally viable land have been embroiled in a tug-of-war between two political parties, Jamaat-e-Islami and Junbish-i-Mill Islami.\nBut for several years, the area has also become a safe haven to fighters from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) and the Quetta Shura Taliban who have both sought to establish operational bases in a collaborative attempt to subvert the central government.\nIn fact, a Quetta Shura leader died in Faryab on October 5, during a battle with the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) following a Taliban assault on Maymana , the provincial capital, in which almost 10 percent of the population lives.\nAlso read: Afghanistan: The other refugee crisis\nThis came in the wake of several clashes last month in which the Taliban not only attacked Maymana, but also captured Qaisar and Almar districts from the ANSF, forcing school closures, under Islamic law, and preventing many households from farming - the main source of livelihood in the province.\nRoughly 30 percent of the province's populations live in Qaisar and Almar districts, which serve as strategic supply points for cross-border trade with Turkmenistan.\nThe current situation represents a drastic escalation of fighting from August of this year, when Afghanistan's vice president (a member of Junbish-i-Milli Islami ) and former Northern Alliance commander, General Ahmad Rashid Dostum, personally led clearance operations in the area with the Afghan military.\nBut with the ANSF forced to retreat due to insufficient equipment , Faryab remains vulnerable to further infiltration by IMU, Taliban, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), to whom the IMU has pledged support.\nIf Faryab collapses, it will unleash a terrifying domino effect in an area Afghanistan cannot afford to lose. The only way the NUG and the international community can get ahead is to pick up the pieces before they fall.\nIn response, the rise in militias proves even more corrosive as it loosens the already-tenuous grasp of the National Unity Government. President Ashraf Ghani's endorsement of Dostum assuming his role as a regional strongman and rallying his own militias against the Taliban insurrection in Faryab spells a clear message for the population: The central government has limited power to affect the change in an area.\nUndermining the economy\nThe political erosion in the north is also an ominous indicator of the decline of President Ghani's plan for stability and development.\nForeign direct investment fell by 30 percent in the first half of this year and economic growth slowed to two percent from an average of nine percent between 2003 and 2012.\nTucked in the hem of Turkmenistan, Faryab maintains a key geographic position for Afghanistan's economic interests. Its location and resources are indispensable to the Afghan government's strategy of regional trade along the historical Silk Road trade route and increasing foreign investment in Afghanistan's natural resources and extractive industry.\nA young Afghan displaced from her home in Faryab province as the Afghan army carries out a full-scale military operation against militants [EPA] Mostly an agricultural area containing marble and some oil reserves, Faryab is a transit point for the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline.\nWith an estimated revenue yield of $400m a year , the pipeline not only reinforces the regional economic links coveted by Ghani, its revenue would help substantially displace the donor aid that currently furnishes more than 90 percent of Afghanistan's budget.\nInstability in Faryab also threatens to exacerbate a different power struggle.
