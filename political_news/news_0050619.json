Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden, but falls to every GOP candidate tested against her in the recent survey.\nClinton leads the Democratic 2016 pack with 45 percent support, while Sanders and Biden pull in 25 percent and 19 percent, respectively, which is nearly unchanged for the previous Fox poll taken in late September. No other Democratic challenger garners more than a single percentage point in the poll.\nHowever, Clinton drops general election head-to-head matchups with the three outsiders in the GOP field, Ben Carson, Donald Trump and Carly Fiorina, as well as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. In the matchups, Carson beats Clinton 50-39, while Trump leads 45-40. In addition, Bush leads by four points (44-40), while Fiorina bests the former secretary of state 42-39.\n  U.S. military: Russia's 'reckless' strikes actually helping ISIS Russian airstrikes in Syria have opened the door for the Islamic State to expand its foothold.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/13/15 12:41 PM On the flip side, Biden continues to poll well in 2016 head-to-head matchups with the GOP, as he leads all of the GOP candidates tested. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio polls best against Biden and is osing by a single point, 44-43. Notably, Biden leads Trump by a 50-37 margin.\nThe poll came out hours before the first Democratic debate is set to take place Tuesday night in Las Vegas. Clinton and Sanders will be joined on stage by former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Sen. Jim Webb, and former Rhode Island Gov.
