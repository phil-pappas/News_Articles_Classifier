That's the highest share of disapproval since Gallup began tracking sentiment toward the court 15 years ago. Forty-five percent say the approve of the highest court in the land, while 5 percent have no opinion.\nThe difference remains partisan, even though it changed somewhat since the last poll conducted in July.

The telephone-based poll of roughly 1,000 American adults was conducted Sept. 9-13 with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n  'This just isn't good enough': GOP slams Obama on jobs \"Too many middle-class families are still struggling in this economy, and we can do a lot better,\" Boehner said.\nBy Joseph Lawler â€¢ 10/02/15 10:05 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:10:38.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
