They complain that increasing demands weigh on their profits and therefore their ability to lend; regulators and policymakers say the rules are necessary to reduce the likelihood of taxpayer bailouts. \nIn January, the biggest lenders must start to set aside ‎extra capital. \nThe minutes also reveal the extent of BoE contingency planning earlier this summer as it worried about whether Greece would crash out of the eurozone ‎. \nIt decided not to publish the details earlier in case markets took fright. \nNow it has been revealed that the UK central bank increased its monitoring of deposits and liquidity at Greek and Cypriot bank branches and subsidiaries in Britain, and asked about contingency planning at the UK’s big banks.
