Plenty of \"Stop the Zip Rail\" signs can be seen along Hwy. 52 on the way to Rochester. \nAn environmental review of the route is under way, but there's no federal funding on the horizon, the paper said. So MnDOT Chief of Staff Eric Davis said: \"We recognize that without a reliable source of funding for the planning and construction of a high-speed rail line, the project really just is in kind of limbo.\" \nWhile no official decision has been made, Davis said it might make sense to hold off for now: \"There is some concern about the timing of undertaking the next phase of work because arguably that would be a waste. We would rather have identified a funding source before we would do that work,\" he said. \nMeanwhile, the state is talking with the North American High Speed Rail Group, which proposes to build an 84-mile, elevated high-speed rail line from Rochester to the Twin Cities without public money. \nThe paper says the \"$4.2 billion project would be funded through a combination of Chinese and U.S. investors. As part of the project, the rail group would also develop real estate that ties into the rail line.\" \nState officials are considering the request.
