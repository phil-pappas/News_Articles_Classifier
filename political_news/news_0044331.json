It is being hosted by CNN and Facebook. \nShe said all of the Democratic candidates -- right now, Hillary Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee -- are more electable than the entire GOP field, which she said is \"trying to out-Trump Donald Trump.\" \n\"Any one of those candidates is in dramatic contrast to any one of the Republican circus candidates -- circus performers -- that are on the other side,\" Wasserman Schultz said. \n\"The Republicans are saying, let's kick more immigrants out of the country, let's take away health care for more Americans,\" she said. \nO'Malley and Sanders have pressed for more than the six debates currently scheduled and sanctioned by the DNC. But Wasserman Schultz offered no indications Sunday that more will be added to that calendar. \n\"We're excited about the first debate coming up on Tuesday,\" she said. \"We have six debates throughout our cycle, along with a number of candidate forums.\" \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
