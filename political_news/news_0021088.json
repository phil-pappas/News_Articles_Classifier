The Government can put a stop to this. \n\"The National Government seem to think it’s ok to pollute our water in the name of growth. It’s short term thinking that the last few months of dairy price fluctuations has proven to be flawed. \n\"Regional Councils implementing the NPS are taking a collaborative approach, which is all very well and good, but it means fresh water quality is threatened while councils wait for this to happen. It means Landcorp and others can continue to pollute the Waikato River with dairy effluent while downstream millions are spent cleaning the river up,\" Ms Delahunty said. \nThe Environment Aotearoa 2015 report raised water quality as well as climate change and biodiversity as environmental matters that have worsened since 2007. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:08:23.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
