Born and raised in Sydney's affluent eastern suburbs, she left Australia at age 24 and has lived and worked in the United States for almost 40 years. These days, at age 63, one of her clients is the Prince of Wales Foundation in Washington.\nAnother is our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. Pardon?\nIt was a misjudgment that got Shorten nothing except an almighty kick in the privates from the collective media commentary.\nYes, but before you drift into the wrong lane, Josephine Linden is the woman who manages Malcolm's millions, nothing else; Lucy's too. She has been the Turnbulls' financial adviser for years.\nIllustration: Glen Le Lievre.\nThe Prime Minister named Linden in Parliament last week: \"The hedge funds Lucy and I have been invested in were selected for us by … Josephine Linden, a very prominent Australian, actually, in New York City, and she has managed that portfolio … I have left that very much in her hands.\" But his words seemed to escape general notice.\nAdvertisement Thus Linden is the one who has some, at least, of the Turnbull investment millions working passively for them out of the Cayman Islands, an issue that had Bill Shorten's Labor Opposition in such a fever in Parliament 10 days ago.\nExcept that Mr Shortly and Co utterly ballsed it up in pursuing their quarry.\nJosphine Linden has been the Turnbulls' financial adviser for years Photo: Andrew Quilty\nInstead of sticking strictly to the issue of - what is Australia's wealthiest ever Prime Minister doing using a rampant tax haven on the far side of the world as a vehicle for making more millions for him and his family rather than investing here in his home country? - Labor got greedy and sought to create the taint if not the outright smear that the Turnbulls are into tax evasion.\nIt was a misjudgment that got Shorten nothing except an almighty kick in the privates from the collective media commentary last weekend. So much so, that when Parliament resumed sitting on Monday, not a word was heard all week about the Prime Ministers' tax affairs.\nTurnbull had taken Labor's raft of questions head-on in Parliament at the time, asserting, in summary, that: \"I want to make this very clear…\nA) \"When I became a minister [in 2013], all my investments were approved under the ministerial code of conduct by the Secretary of [the Department] of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and\nB) \"In order to avoid conflicts of interest [in Australia] almost all of my and my wife's investments – and they are all disclosed – are in overseas managed funds, which means that I and Lucy have no say in which individual companies those funds invest in … and\nC) \"The fact is that all of my or Lucy's income from these investments, including funds registered in the Cayman Islands, is taxed in full in Australia.\"\nNothing Turnbull said in his defence during the two days he was under Labor shot and shell tells us why it is not possible for any minister, state or federal, any premier, or any prime minister, to make personal or family investments in Australian projects, companies or developments of any kind, for fear of breaching conflict of interest issues.\nYet surely, you'd think, this would not be beyond the wit of lawyers and financial advisers, even parliaments, to overcome.\nPerhaps Malcolm could ask Josephine?\nI do not jest. She is, it would seem, an extremely formidable as well as competent player in the international financial world. Does that surprise? Of course not. The self-made Turnbull would hardly choose anyone less accomplished.\nEven in New York, the family name has clout. When Josephine Linden's daughter, Alexandra, a \"policy officer\" at the Australian consulate, married New York's Dr John Belletti in October 2010, the New York Times carried a brief news story of the ceremony.\nTwo years earlier, Alexandra's mother retired after a 25-year career with investment bank Goldman Sachs, her final years as one of the mega-firm's partners and managing directors. She then founded her own firm, Linden Global Strategies, and remains its chief executive in advising \"sophisticated US and international clients\" in the still-booming \"wealth management industry\".\nMalcolm and Lucy are in safe hands.\nPaul McGeough, the Herald' s chief overseas correspondent and a former editor, gets the last word.\nHe emailed me four weeks ago from Washington: \"What a fabulous piece on Keating/Turnbull. I read it on the porch at our small farm near the Shenandoah. It was vintage Ramsey and gave me a lift of the kind in reading journalism that you don't get too often these days.\n\"I still dine out on the story of Saturday mornings and keeping an eye on the clock to see how long it would take David Marr to storm thru the door yelling, 'What the f---' as a prelude to a post-mortem about the failings of that day's paper, and invariably, just before or just after David, you would call and launch your own tirade with the same \"What the f---.' Stay well. Paul.\"\nApologies, But I couldn't resist sharing it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:30:23.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
