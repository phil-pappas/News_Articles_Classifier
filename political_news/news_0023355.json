I repeat, I am sincerely sorry for this.\"\n– Helen Goodman MP Last updated Mon 12 Oct 2015 Read more 2 updates Bishop Auckland MP 'sorry' for tweet about Jeremy Hunt's wife Politics Helen Goodman County Durham", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:34:19.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
