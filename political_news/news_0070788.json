But under the measure, enhanced prison penalties could still be applied to offenders with prior convictions for serious violent offences and serious drug felonies, a Senate fact sheet said. \nThe legislation was introduced by nine senators from both political parties, including Republican Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Dick Durbin, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat. \nA separate bill in the House of Representatives would also reduce use of mandatory sentences. \nThe outlook for passage of either measure was uncertain. \nPresident Barack Obama, who also favors criminal justice reform, welcomed the legislation. \n\"The broad and impressive bipartisan coalition that created the bill makes me optimistic that members on both sides of the aisle, in both houses, will continue to work together on this critical issue in the coming weeks and months and put a meaningful criminal justice reform bill on my desk before the end of this year,\" Obama said in a statement. \nDurbin said that while mandatory minimum sentences were once seen as a strong deterrent, they have too often been unfair, and led to overcrowded prisons and tighter budgets. \nThe drumbeat for reform has grown as U.S. crime rates have drastically declined over the past two decades. Lengthy prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders are increasingly seen as racially imbalanced and disproportionate to the crimes. \nPresident Barack Obama, a Democrat, also favors criminal justice reform. During the summer he toured a federal prison and vowed to work to address prison overcrowding. \nMore than 1.5 million Americans were in state or federal prisons at the end of 2013, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. African-Americans were 15 percent of the U.S. population at that time but accounted for about a third of its prisoners. \n(Reporting by Susan Cornwell ; Additional reporting by Jeff Mason ; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh , Grant McCool and Ken Wills ) Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) (C) delivers remarks at a bi-partisan news conference on criminal justice reform, The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, on Capitol Hill in Washington October 1, 2015.
