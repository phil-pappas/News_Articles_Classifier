(AP) - The only scheduled debate among all the candidates for an unprecedented three open seats on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is just hours away.\nWednesday's forum at Widener University Law School in Harrisburg comes less than three weeks before the Nov. 3 election. Seven candidates are running - three Democrats, three Republicans and an independent.\nTwo of the open seats resulted from the resignations of disgraced justices - a Democrat implicated in a pornographic email scandal and a Republican convicted of corruption for using state-paid staff for political work. The other vacancy was created by the retirement of Chief Justice Ronald Castille last year.\nThe seven-seat court is under a microscope because of allegations that a second sitting justice is involved in the email scandal and criticism that the court has interfered in disciplinary cases that should have been handled by independent panels required by the state constitution.\nThe Democratic candidates are Kevin Dougherty, a Philadelphia judge, and David Wecht and Christine Donohue, both state Superior Court judges based in Pittsburgh. The Republicans are state Commonwealth Court Anne Covey of Bucks County, Adams County Judge Mike George and Superior Court Judge Judy Olson. Paul Panepinto, a Philadelphia judge and ex-Republican, is running as an independent.\nCounting six other candidates who were eliminated in the May primary, the crowded contest has already set a record for campaign contributions - more than $8 million as of mid-September, the most recent figures available. The next campaign finance reports are due next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:55:07.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
