Women are underrepresented in STEM fields, but current females in the industry are working to change that.\nBy Lauren Camera Oct. 21, 2015 | 6:10 p.m. EDT + More Sarah Richardson is a postdoctoral fellow in synthetic biology at the University of California-Berkeley. Her research focuses on harnessing bacteria to make molecules that could lead to the development of new biofuels and medicines.\nOr, as she explained it Wednesday: “I try to make bacteria friendly, and make us less scared of it.”\n[ READ: Look Beyond Academia to Find Jobs With a Science Ph.D. ]\nIn addition to being an accomplished young scientist, Richardson devotes a significant amount of time volunteering in schools with large numbers of minority and low-income students in the Oakland, California, area.\n“The first thing they always say to me is, ‘You don’t look like a scientist,'” relayed Richardson, a light-skinned African-American woman with a halo of curls cropped close to her face.\n“At first I thought it was funny,” she said. “But it stopped being funny when I realized my career was suffering because my colleagues also thought I didn’t look like a scientist.”\nRichardson is one of five women in the midst of their postdoctoral fellowships who convened at the White House to talk about the barriers they face as females in the science, engineering, math and technology, or STEM, fields .\nThe five women, specializing in areas ranging from astrophysics to marine microbiology, were recently named recipients of the 2015 For Women in Science Fellowship and given $60,000 grants from L'Oréal to advance their postdoctoral research. The program aims to encourage more young women to pursue STEM in a field where they remain underrepresented.\nThe 2015 For Women in Science Fellowship recipients (sitting, from left to right): Ming Yi, Julie Meyer, Sarah Ballard, Claire Robertson, Sarah Richardson. Megan Smith, U.S. chief technology officer, stands on the far right.\nRichardson said it wasn’t until she began adding male colleagues' names to her research papers and grant applications that she began being published more often and receiving more funding for future projects.\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, women make up 47 percent of the total U.S. workforce, but are much less represented in particular science and engineering occupations. They comprise 39 percent of chemists and material scientists, 28 percent of environmental scientists and geoscientists, 16 percent of chemical engineers and just 12 percent of civil engineers.\nFunneling more women into STEM fields is just one part of a much larger economic priority for the Obama administration: helping Americans nab higher-paying jobs. But it’s also one that Megan Smith, U.S. chief technology officer, takes most seriously.\nSmith was recently a vice president at Google and has held various STEM-related jobs, including one that involved designing, building and racing a solar car 2,000 miles across the Australian Outback. She says she sees her role in the administration as “an instigator,” continually pushing every sector to think about how they can better highlight the achievement of women in STEM fields.\n[ ALSO: Schools Unsure Which New Common Core Materials Work Best ]\n“Our job is to encourage young girls to see you and want to be you,” she said to the fellowship winners.\nThere are some promising signs. More female students are taking classes like pre-calculus and advanced biology during high school than male students, according to the National Girls Collaborative Project , ​ ​and women are earning a near-equal proportion of bachelor's degrees in STEM fields – though in some degree areas more than others. However, experts explain, many end their STEM track there, either not pursuing STEM jobs upon graduation or enrolling to earn a master’s degree or doctorate in a STEM field but not graduating.\nAs the fellowship winners​ ​sat around a table on the fourth floor of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, they rattled off some of the reasons it specifically can be difficult to complete a fellowship: Women may pause their program to have a baby and then lose health insurance because it’s tied to their fellowship; it's difficult to afford child care on annual fellowship stipends of $40,000 or so; and women battle what the recipients described as near-constant gender bias and sexual harassment.\nRELATED\nWhat John King Brings to the Education Department Richardson, who doesn’t have children of her own but has colleagues who do, talked about the repercussions of what she’s termed “the mommy track.”\n“We can manage our time better than anyone, but when we open our mouths and say ‘baby,’ everything changes,” she said.\nSmith explained the biggest problem with attracting and retaining women in STEM fields is that there’s not one major hurdle to overcome, but hundreds.\n“It’s the story of a thousand paper cuts,” she said.\nSo what can be done? Smith and the other women agreed that even something as small as getting directors to cast more women in STEM roles on television shows and movies would have a big impact. And pushing important STEM organizations, like NASA and others, to report on their internal demographics would make the issue more public.\n“We all come at this in a historical context,” Smith said to the group of female scientists. “It’s not your fault you don’t have a lot of lab space. We’re all working to form a more perfect union.”\nTAGS: STEM STEM jobs STEM education", "external_links": ["http://ngcproject.org/about-ngcp", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef23i%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Women%20Still%20Underrepresented%20in%20STEM%20Fields&summary=The%20White%20House%20on%20Wednesday%20acknowledged%20women%20who%20are%20succeeding%2C%20but%20said%20much%20more%20needs%20to%20be%20done.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef23i%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef23i%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef23i%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef23i%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Women%20Still%20Underrepresented%20in%20STEM%20Fields", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZef23i%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Women%20Still%20Underrepresented%20in%20STEM%20Fields"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:32:25.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
