The Labour leader said he would \"not press the nuclear button\" if he was prime minister and restated his opposition to renewing Britain's nuclear weapons system.\nHe said: \"Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction that take out millions of civilians. They didn't do the USA much good on 9/11.\"\nSeveral members of his shadow cabinet have broken ranks to openly criticise their leader's position.\nAnd the former chief of NATO has branded Mr Corbyn's comments as \"extremely dangerous\".\nPlay video \"Ex-NATO Chief Hits Out At Corbyn\" Video: Ex-NATO Chief Hits Out At Corbyn Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle said his remarks were \"unhelpful\".\nShe added: \"I think it undermines to some degree our attempts to get a policy process going.\n\"As far as I'm concerned we start from the policy we have… I don't think that, a potential leader answering a question like that, in the way which he did, is helpful.\"\nHer remarks prompted a tweet by shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott: \"Surprised that Maria Eagle criticises JC for making his position clear on Trident nuclear weapon system.\"\nPlay video \"Angela Eagle Contradicts Corbyn\" Video: Angela Eagle Contradicts Corbyn Meanwhile, Angela Eagle, the shadow business secretary, said that ruling out the use of a nuclear deterrent rendered it redundant.\nShe said: \"We have Labour Party policy on having a nuclear weapon. I don't think anyone in their right minds would want to get to a situation where it would be used.\n\"But I think if you do get to that situation... you have to be prepared to use it… Jeremy will have to justify his own decisions and his own comments and I think you'll have to talk to him about that.\"\nThe party is bitterly split over defence issues - and in particular on Trident.\n1 / 4 Gallery: Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet On Trident Position\nLabour's official policy remains to support the deterrent, despite the party leader's opposition.\nThere has also been division on whether Labour would support airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Syria - something that Mr Corbyn opposes but several members of his shadow cabinet have indicated they would back.\nIf these fractious issues are put to a parliamentary vote, it is likely that Mr Corbyn would have to allow MPs a free vote on the issue or face multiple resignations from his top team.\nShadow home secretary Andy Burnham said he would \"find it difficult\" to remain in position if Labour changed its policy to favour scrapping Trident.\nPlay video \"Quick Hits: Corbyn's Speech\" Video: Quick Hits: Corbyn's Speech He said: \"I believe we should renew our nuclear deterrent... as I look around the world... I see Russia flexing its muscles, China parading its nuclear weapons... personally.. I don't think now is the time to drop our defences.\"\nDefence Secretary Michael Fallon accused the Labour leader of \"effectively saying he would lower Britain's defences\".\nHe said: \"Having nuclear weapons and our enemies knowing that we're prepared to use them in the most extreme circumstances of self-defence is vital to keeping our country safe.\"\nAnd Former NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen told Sky News Tonight: \"Without interfering with British politics I would say such statements are extremely dangerous for the credibility of our deterrents policy.\nPlay video \"Corbyn Accepts 'Different Views'\" Video: Corbyn Accepts 'Different Views' \"The existence of a nuclear capability, including a British nuclear capability, is an integrated part of NATO's deterrents and the aim of deterrents is to prevent conflicts.\n\"Ultimately, while we all hope and think it will not be necessary to use a nuclear capability, if you put in doubt whether you are willing to use the military capabilities you do have then you also undermine the strength of your deterrent.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:00:28.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
