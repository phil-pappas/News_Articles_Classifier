The school spoke with Tolbert’s son the same day, a Tuesday, but didn’t inform his parents of the situation until Wednesday. By then, the boy had already penned an apology letter to his classmate. \nAccording to court papers, the female student reported that she \"felt fearful.” \n“The same girl that accused my son of this act of perception of intimidation, aggressively poured milk on someone else’s lunch. When she did that there was no penalties for that. She received nothing for that,” said Candice Tolbert, mother of the accused. \nEagnews.com reported that the boy in the case is black, and the girl is white. The Tolberts have not cited race as a reason for the stringent punishment in this case, but they do feel the school has consistently treated their son differently than other student. \nIn a day when disgruntled students find ways to shoot their classmates and where the police are daily fighting for their lives because of racial crimes, this case seems like an over zealous offense against bullying. Who defines what bullying is? Why is it ok for a 12-year-old white girl to pour milk on another student with no punishment, but a 12-year-old black boy in the same school is punished for basically looking at someone in the wrong way? \nThe zero tolerance approach to bullying has gone too far once again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:45:24.173+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
