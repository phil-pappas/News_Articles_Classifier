Is there a single soul who is surprised that an Engineer came up with this. 10,535 pages reduced to 4 sentences. READ SLOWLY! Great summary by a Notre Dame University engineer. Here are the ​10,535 pages of Obama Care condensed to 4 simple sentences. As ​humorous as it sounds...every last word is absolutely TRUE! 1. In order to insure the uninsured, we first have to un-insure the insured. 2. Next, we require the newly uninsured to be re-insured. 3. To re-insure the newly ​​uninsured, they are required to pay extra charges to be re-insured. 4. The ​extra charges are required so that the original insured, who became un-insured and then became ​re-insured, can pay enough extra so that the original un-insured can be insured, so it will ​be free-of-charge to them. This, ladies and gentlemen, is called redistribution of wealth\" or, by its more common name,​SOCIALISM, or PROGRESSIVE, the politically correct names for COMMUNISM! Wow!What a brilliant way to raise money to fund a free service. Arent we lucky to ​have such a brilliant man leading us!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:55:59.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
