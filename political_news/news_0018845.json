I couldn't be more grateful for this moment and all of the birthday wishes from everyone. THANK YOU #Blessed #OlderWiser\nPosted by Usher on Saturday, October 17, 2015 This isn't the first time the President has broken out in song recently. In August, Obama was in New Orleans for the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and started singing after a woman he met told him her name was Weezy, which reminded him of the show \"The Jeffersons.\"\nRead More Perhaps most memorably, Obama sang \"Amazing Grace\" while eulogizing Clementa C. Pinckney, a pastor who was killed in the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting in June.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/usher", "https://vine.co/v/ej97uElxWP2/embed/simple", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js", "https://www.facebook.com/usher/videos/10153705496797498/", "http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2015-10-13", "https://vine.co/v/eJahjd1bDFr/embed/simple", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:03:54.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
