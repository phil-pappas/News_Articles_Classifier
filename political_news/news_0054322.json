(Jamal Nasrallah/European Pressphoto Agency) By Dennis Ross October 9 at 12:16 PM Dennis Ross, a counselor and fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, was a special assistant to President Obama from 2009 to 2011. His book “ Doomed to Succeed: The U.S.- Israeli Relationship from Truman to Obama ” will be published Oct. 13.\nPresident Obama has been consistent on Syria. Even when I was in the administration, the president made clear that he did not want to get dragged into the conflict there. The legacy of Iraq weighed heavily on him. He was elected to get us out of Middle East wars, not into them. He was not going to get involved in “ someone else’s civil war .”\nBut what if that civil war produced a humanitarian catastrophe? What if it created a massive refugee crisis? What if it threatened to destabilize neighboring states? What if it gave rise to a group like the Islamic State? These questions were not considered because the fear of being dragged into a quagmire was so great. The costs of action always determined the administration’s approach, not the costs of inaction.\nIt is nothing new for Obama to challenge those who think the Iranians or Russians are gaining in Syria as they act and we do the minimum.", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B015X54HSC", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/09/10/remarks-president-address-nation-syria"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:59:51.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
