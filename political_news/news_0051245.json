The agency didn't ask questions, even though the child-welfare division was well aware of the nonprofit's difficulties making payroll and paying taxes. \nChild Welfare Director Lois Day said her department is trying to match up Rosas' testimony with complaints the agency received and to find out what investigative action was taken. But she acknowledged to The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board that her division did not take any steps beyond its normal monitoring and checking of children to ensure that the financial problems weren't affecting child safety. She noted that caseworkers, lawyers, court-appointed advocates and others come in contact with the children, and they expected they would have heard of substandard conditions through those channels. \n\"We did not receive information that child safety was at risk,\" she said. \nIt makes you wonder what kind of information would actually sound an alarm. A story by Willamette Week earlier this month documented a long list of safety concerns identified by Portland Fire & Rescue, several former employees and even a Multnomah County tax assessor employee. DHS' own licensing inspections uncovered problems with the foster-care agency's practices, according to the story. \nEven if the financial issues were the only problems the agency knew about, DHS flunked the common-sense test. How could a foster-care organization that receives $1.6 million a year from the state, according to Willamette Week , get so far behind on its taxes that the IRS would file liens? How could the agency overlook that it was the lone provider that had its state funding garnished for payment of a judgment over unpaid wages? Why would it not alert its caseworkers or its investigators to take an extra close look at the facility and make sure the kids were well cared for? \nThankfully, the DOJ's Charitable Activities section took action that DHS should have pursued. Assistant Attorneys General Michelle Smith and Heather Weigler led a team of investigators that persevered in demanding documentation, interviews and answers despite months of delay, accusations of racist behavior and other roadblocks from Holden. DOJ negotiated a Sept. 18 settlement that calls for Give Us This Day to shut down, its insurance provider to pay the state $500,000 and for Holden, also known as Mary Ayala, to not serve in a fiduciary position for any charitable organization in Oregon for seven years. \nCredit too the legislators who are not letting this go. Sen. Sara Gelser, D-Corvallis, who chairs the Senate Committee on Human Services and Early Childhood, and vice-chair Sen. Alan Olsen, R-Canby, made clear their frustration that the many red flags set off nobody's alarm bells at DHS, as The Oregonian/OregonLive's Denis Theriault reported . The agency is now reviewing its licensing and investigative procedures as well as going through its record of complaints at the foster home, Day said. Her agency is also looking at whether it needs to bring more financial expertise in evaluating licensees. \nWhile that's worth considering, it also misses the point â€“ it should not take a sophisticated business background for DHS to exercise some common sense. Consider for example one of the earliest exchanges between DOJ's Smith and Holden's attorney. While Holden addressed one failure right away, Smith didn't stop there, noting that \"such issues can be symptomatic of larger management issues within an organization.\" DHS should take that sentiment to heart, both in monitoring other foster-care providers and in evaluating its own handling of this case. \n- The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:33:04.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
