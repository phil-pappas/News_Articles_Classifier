Her total take between July and September exceeds that of at least two competitors, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\nUnlike that many of the presidential candidates, Fiorina's fundraising improved in recent months. She had raised just $1.7 million between her campaign kickoff in early May and the end of June and has been relying heavily on outside money.\nFiorina deputy campaign manager Sarah Isgur Flores says the campaign ended September with $5.5 million cash on hand.\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is leading the Republican field in recent fundraising, having netted $20 million.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:41:49.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
