Grant announced the death of Franklin Pierce, the nation’s 14th president, who had succumbed the day before to cirrhosis of the liver at age 64 at his home in Concord, New Hampshire. In keeping with tradition, Grant ordered flags to be flown at half-staff on all federal buildings. Pierce’s presidency is remembered for having set a course that led the Southern states to secede from the Union over the slavery issue, precipitating a bloody struggle during which Pierce backed the Confederate cause.\nHis support for the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 allowed the two new territories to decide for themselves whether they would permit or outlaw slavery. Foreshadowing the Civil War, the territories erupted in sectarian violence. Pierce’s failure to stem the fighting as well as his secret plan to start a war with Spain as a pretext to annex Cuba further damaged his already shaky political standing.\nPierce remains the sole president from New Hampshire and the first one to be born in the 19th century. He is also the only elected president whose party failed to nominate him for a second term—other than vice presidents who had succeeded to the office.\nBy the end of his single term in the Executive Mansion, a reporter described Pierce as “a wreck of his former self … his face wears a hue so ghastly and cadaverous that one could almost fancy he was gazing on a corpse.”\nThe Democrats had abandoned Pierce in 1856, replacing him with James Buchanan. After losing the Democratic nomination, Pierce continued his lifelong struggle with alcoholism as his marriage to Jane Means Appleton Pierce fell apart. When he left office in 1857, Pierce was asked what he would do next. “There’s nothing left [to do] but get drunk,” he said.\nSOURCE: WWW.HISTORY.COM\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:42:39.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
