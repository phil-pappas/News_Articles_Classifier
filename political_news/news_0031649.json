These were areas that we have serious challenges on but today the situation is different as the people are able to work to bring both body and soul together. \n“I made sure that I am fair to everybody here. If your community had light and one doesn’t, I try to give them road. At least on a fair ground, all 278 communalities in the district has fair share of the development cake from me,’’ he said. \nAlhaji Mumuni said his track record would ensure his victory in the November 7 parliamentary primary. \n‘‘I know if only job or work for the people and not ethnicity is the yardstick for winning the primaries, I have no doubt in my mind about my winning. \n“The position of Member of Parliament is not for a particular ethnic group, it is about performance, it is about who can represent your views well at the national legislature for them to be worked on. In that regard I think I am better qualified to do the job,’’ he added. \nHe said in the unlikely event that he loses the primary, the victor needs to count on his record as a District Chief Executive to win next year’s election. \nHe touted the fact that under his administration, the Sawla clinic has been upgraded to district hospital status whilst the Sawla Day Senior High School now has boarding. \nHe however conceded that despite the success chalked they still have challenges. Majority of the 278 communities in the constituency lack portable water, teachers for basic schools and most communities are yet to be hooked to the national electricity grid. \nAlhaji Dramani said given the opportunity to represent the people in parliament, he will work assiduously to change the trend. \nAlhaji Dramani is contesting two aspirants including the incumbent, Donald Dari Soditey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:18:33.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
