HYMLY -0.01 % reported another quarterly earnings decline Thursday, hit by slowing demand in China and emerging markets, and by fierce competition in the U.S. that pushed up marketing costs.\nHyundai, the world’s fifth-biggest auto maker by sales when combined with affiliate Kia Motors Corp. 000270 1.30 % , said sales in China slumped by nearly a fifth in the three months ended in September from a year earlier.\nIn the U.S., the Korean company shipped a record volume of autos in the third quarter, but the cost of incentives rose more than 30% from a year earlier as Hyundai spent more to lure customers. The U.S. is the company’s second-biggest market, after China.\nHyundai said July-September net profit was 1.21 trillion won ($1.1 billion), down 25% from 1.62 trillion won a year earlier. The result was worse than market expectations for 1.52 trillion won.\nThe seventh straight quarterly profit decline comes as sedans like the midsize Sonata—which the company has aggressively marketed for years—fall out of favor with consumers who prefer larger sport-utility vehicles and trucks that have become cheaper to drive as fuel prices fall.\nOn Wednesday, General Motors Co. GM 5.79 % posted a record third-quarter operating profit in its core North American unit, fueled by the strongest U.S. demand in a decade for profitable trucks and SUVs.\nHyundai has made some progress recently in catching up with consumer tastes. Sluggish sales in China began to improve with last month’s launch of the revamped Tucson, Hyundai’s flagship midsize SUV. The Tucson and its larger cousin, the Santa Fe, underpinned better sales in the U.S. as well.\nThe company’s China sales will continue to improve in the fourth quarter, helped by a tax cut on auto purchases, said Hyundai finance chief Lee Won-hee during a conference call.\nHyundai’s third-quarter operating profit fell 8.8% to 1.5 trillion won from 1.65 trillion won. Revenue rose 10% to 23.43 trillion won from 21.28 trillion won.\nMr. Lee said the company’s weak quarterly performance was also due to one-off charges related to last month’s recall in the U.S. of nearly half a million Sonata sedans for faulty engine parts.\nHyundai didn’t provide a specific amount, but analysts said the recall could cost the company at least 100 billion won in the third quarter.\nHyundai said sales in the first nine months of 2015 fell 2.4% year-over-year to 3.53 million vehicles, adding to market concerns that it may miss its full-year target of 5.05 million cars.\nCiting worsening business conditions and tougher competition, Hyundai Chairman Chung Mong-koo earlier this year predicted the group’s 2015 sales would increase by 2.5%, its weakest rise in 12 years.\nHyundai executives acknowledged that its sales goal is tough, but said favorable foreign-exchange rates and the launch of new models globally should help the company meet the target.\nThe auto maker is widely expected to benefit from a weaker South Korean won, which boosts its price competitiveness in overseas markets. The won was about 14% weaker in the third quarter compared with the same period a year ago, and is currently at its lowest level in five years.\nWrite to In-Soo Nam at In-Soo.Nam@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:36:03.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
