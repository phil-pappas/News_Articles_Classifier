Salman Khan, who began this year with a bang, is not done just yet. The star released the trailer of his upcoming romantic film ‘Prem Ratan Dhan Payo’ on Thursday, and it has already lived up to all our expectations. Salman has teamed up with director Sooraj Barjatya after 16-years, to show fans just what they’ve been missing. The director-actor duo, have always managed to strike up a perfect blend of royality, romance and drama with films like 'Maine Pyar Kiya', 'Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!' and 'Hum Saath-Saath Hain' . Although most of us whished the trailer was a tiny bit longer the two-minute video did not fail to impress. Sooraj and Salman tag along an all-star cast of Sonam Kapoor, Neil Nitin Mukesh, Anupam Kher and Swara Bhaskar in this larger than life film. In the 128-second clip Sooraj brings back the old world charm with majestic Rajasthani sets, old school romance, sword fights, sibling rivalry, family drama and of course his trade mark chandeliers. Taking a close look at Sooraj’s past works and all his other ‘Prems’, there are a few things that stand out. First thing’s first, the magnum opus of the films, the grandeur and larger than life scenes that make us feel like we are watching something more than just Salman Khan. The old school charm and romance that is almost absent in the films we see today, takes centre screen. Honestly, ask yourself when was the last time you saw two grown ups tease each other in a scene that did not lead into the bedroom. Like all his alter ego ‘Prem’, Salman will now play on the heartstrings of his leading lady, Sonam Kapoor. Keeping up with tradition, fans can expect to see choreographed dance routines taken to the next level. While we have seen ‘dance crews’ grooving to techno beats in recent Bollywood flick, ‘PRDP’ will take you back in time with a visual delight of extravagant dance and song sequences woven with love, emotions and togetherness. Can we also mention the catchy ‘Prem Ratan Dhan Payo’ soundtrack that we picked up almost immediately? entertainment Bollywood Prem Ratan Dhan Payo Salman Khan Sonam Kapoor Sooraj Barjatya Also Read 'Ironman' Milind Soman goes pink, supports breast cancer awareness initiative I wasn't called to Hyderabad by any agent for commercial sex: Shweta Basu Tara Reid launches her perfume range Psy's 'Gangnam Style' gallops to YouTube record", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/PRDP-sets-3.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/salman-khan_25.jpg", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salamn-dance.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/PRDP-sets-4.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-chandeliers-2.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151001/entertainment-bollywood/article/look-salman-khan’s-iconic-character-‘prem’-1989-2015", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-khan_25.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/PRDP-sets-2.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-actress-3.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salamn-dance-2.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-actress-2.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salamn-dance-3.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/PRDP-sets.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-actress.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-chandeliers.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/salman-chandeliers-3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:45:23.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
