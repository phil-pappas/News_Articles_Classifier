More Gangmasters agency to gain extra powers \n“This bill is a good bill but it could be a better bill,” Michael Russell, a former SNP cabinet member, told the conference. \nThe vote by delegates to the conference in Aberdeen in effect requires party leaders to rethink the motion, which welcomed the introduction of the land reform bill. Speakers complained that the legislation did not do enough to challenge Scotland’s highly concentrated patterns of rural land ownership. \nDelegate Bill Middleton said he had voted for the motion to be remitted in the hope that it would push the government towards more radical controls on absentee landlords and wider opportunities for ownership of land by those who live on and work it. \n“I believe it’s Scotland’s land,” Mr Middleton said. \nSome members have been disappointed by the government’s decision not to seek a cap on the size of land holdings and its softening of requirements for public disclosure of all ownership. \nHowever, people involved in developing the legislation have warned that it must be carefully judged to reduce the risk of potential challenge by landowners under European human rights legislation. \nMr Russell, MSP for Argyll and Bute and a former education secretary, said that such concerns were being given too much weight and that international rights laws and conventions could also be used to strengthen the rights of tenants and other groups. It’s encouraging that the grassroots are taking ownership of this issue \n- Andy Wightman, activist \nAndy Wightman, a prominent activist in land reform, said the vote offered a “clear mandate” for the SNP to strengthen the bill and make new reform commitments in its manifesto for next May’s Scottish parliamentary election. \n“It’s encouraging that the grassroots are taking ownership of this issue,” said Mr Wightman, who is a standing in May as a candidate for the Scottish Green party. \nSNP conferences have over the past decade been highly disciplined affairs, with motions crafted to maximise support rather than challenge the leadership. \nParty leaders sought to head off another potential revolt over the issue of unconventional gas extraction by announcing a government moratorium on underground coal gasification and widening a review into fracking. \nHowever, some delegates sought to remit back what they said was a weakly worded motion on the issue after a debate in which speakers were uniformly hostile to fracking and many said the ban on the technology should be made permanent. \nHowever, supporters of the motion said the moratoriums were steps in the right direction and an effort to remit the motion back for revision was defeated by 554 votes to 427.
