While Perry is popular with millennials, her lyrics may have some echoes of the former president's salacious past.\n\"So let me get you in your birthday suit\" — \"Birthday\" \nAs Bill Clinton was eyeing a big win in the New Hampshire primary in 1992, news broke of an extra-marital affair with an Arkansas state employee and cabaret singer named Gennifer Flowers. The story was first reported by The Star tabloid magazine but soon grew national attention as Flowers released taped conversations alleging a 12-year affair with the then-Arkansas governor. Soon, reputable news outlets carried the story forcing Bill and Hillary to do damage control by appearing together on CBS' \"60 Minutes.\" In their first joint appearance, Hillary famously told Steve Kroft, \"I'm not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette, I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him.\" Six years later, Bill Clinton admitted to the affair. In a deposition in a sexual harassment case, Clinton revealed he did have sexual relations with Flowers, saying it occurred only one time in 1977.\n\"Oh no, did I get too close?\" — \"Unconditional\" \n  Obama takes a stand against 'overtesting' \"Overtesting,\" as the phenomenon is called by critics, has taken flak from both the Right and Left.\nBy Curt Mills • 10/24/15 2:55 PM Former White House volunteer aide Kathleen Willey claims Bill Clinton got a little too close for comfort during his first term in office. The incident in question allegedly took place in the Oval Office in November of 1993. \"This hug lasted a little longer than I thought necessary, but at the same time — I mean, I was not concerned about it. And then he kissed me on — on my mouth, and — and pulled me closer to him. And, I remember thinking, I just remember thinking, 'What in the world is he doing?' I — it — I just thought, 'What is he doing?' And, I — I pushed back away from him, and he had his arms — they were tight around me, and he — he — he touched me,\" Willey told CBS News in 1998. Willey has been critical of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, recently telling radio host Aaron Klein, \"She might throw a tantrum, but she enabled it to happen again, and again, and again and again. And then she chooses to go after the women that he hooks up with, to ruin them again, and again, and again and again. And that's how it works.\"\n\"Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed\" — \" Roar \" \nIn 1994, former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones filed suit against Bill Clinton, alleging sexual harassment. According to Jones' suit, Clinton exposed himself and propositioned her while she was staying at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock, three years earlier. The suit was filed two days prior to the three-year statute of limitations,seeking $750,000 in damages. While Clinton's attorneys maintained Jones' claims were without merit, the case was settled out of court for $850,000. It was Jones' case that set the stage for the more publicly damaging probe involving Monica Lewinsky.\n\"Boy, you should know What you're falling for\" — \"Dark Horse\" \nPerhaps the most notable of Bill Clinton's indiscretion was with 24-year-old intern, Monica Lewinsky. Initially, the president denied the nine sexual encounters Lewinsky said the pair had, some in the Oval Office — one of which produced the now infamous stained blue dress. For her part, Hillary Clinton called the scandal a \"vast right-wing conspiracy.\" When Lewinsky's testimony to independent counsel Kenneth Starr contradicted Clinton's, the House of Representatives impeached Clinton. He was later acquitted by the Senate.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump: I tried to tell Carson about his Iowa lead 'but he was sleeping'   while Trump lagged behind.\n  1:10 PM Top Story Trump: I tried to tell Carson about his Iowa lead 'but he was sleeping'   while Trump lagged behind.\n  1:10 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:57:52.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
