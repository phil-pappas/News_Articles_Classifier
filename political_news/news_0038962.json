This flows down through his Ministers, advisers and the attitudes of top public servants. \n\"How can middle ranking public servants respond objectively to OIA requests if their political masters expect them to delay, redact or block it? \n\"Given John Key’s lack of transparency and regard for the law was called into question last October - when he admitted the Government sometimes delays releasing official information right up to the deadline for political purposes - this inquiry must place emphasis on his words and attitude. \n\"The Ombudsman has a very important role to keep our Government honest and ensure the public has access to information. There is no other body in New Zealand which can do that. \n\"Labour supports the proactive release of Cabinet and other papers being made publicly available on a dedicated website,\" Clare Curran says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:32:36.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
