The Tennessee Department of Correction paid nearly $8,000 for the review, requested after The Tennessean and other media published reports of safety and staffing issues that prompted two legislative hearings. \nThe review recommended changing the oft-criticized 28-day work schedule to a 14-day schedule. The report also recommended changing correctional officer's eight-hour shifts to a 12-hour shift, and changing the definitions used to classify attacks on staff by inmates. \n\"Ultimately, these changes are anticipated to positively affect outcomes relative to facility stability and safety as well as addressing staffing concerns relative to pay, overtime and scheduling issues,\" the report states. \nRichard Stalder, formerly the head of the Louisiana prison system, participated in the review and presented the findings to lawmakers. Overall, he said the ACA's brief visits to several prisons provided enough information to show the state's prison system is safe. \nDuring the hearing, Stalder acknowledged the ACA officials didn't set up specifics interviews with employees or inmates or take notes from their interactions in the prisons. Stalder said they tried to speak with as many officers and inmates as possible during their visits, visits that prison officials knew were coming. \nACA officials based their decision to call the prison system safe at least in part on the fact that, according to department officials, there has only been one escape since 2009. A review of department reports however shows there have been 38 escapes since 2009. \nAfter lawmakers noted that an inmate escaped from a work detail in Tiptonville this summer, the ACA acknowledged they meant to say escapes from \"secure custody\" as opposed to someone escaping from a minimum security work assignment that took them outside of a prison. Sen. Paul Bailey, R- Sparta, argued most people would still consider that an escape. \n\"If this was an escape issue, we'd be sitting here talking about how do we cut back on escapes?'\" Stalder said after the hearing. \"What we're saying is, that public safety is the primary concern and that the department has an enviable record, a sustained positive record relative to the fundamental core element of public safety.\" \nDepartment of Correction Commissioner Derrick Schofield and others in the administration have denied any issues with safety or staffing. They have said the schedule caused some issues initially, but argued most officers support the change. Schofield and others have also consistently downplayed reports of increased violence within the Tennessee prison system. \nIt's up to the department to decide whether any of the recommendations will actually be implemented. Schofield and the department are scheduled to formally respond to the ACA report during a legislative hearing next week. After Wednesday's hearing, Schofield said the recommendations \"make sense.\" But he denied assaults have been improperly classified or that the 28-day \"time-keeping schedule\" is causing problems. \n\"I think their recommendations (are) subject to interpretation. Good recommendations, but we have to look and see what’s best for Tennessee in terms of how we implement those,\" Schofield said. \nDave Smith, spokesman for Gov. Bill Haslam, said in a statement the governor appreciates the work of the ACA. \nClassifying assaults \nHow TDOC officers are required to record violent incidents has been repeatedly criticized. Officers argue they are required to report incidents that used to be considered assaults — like an inmate throwing bodily fluids at them — as “staff/inmate provocations.” \nAlthough Assistant Commissioner Tony Parker said an inmate throwing feces at an officer’s face is an assault, multiple incident reports obtained by The Tennessean have shown such attacks listed as “staff/inmate provocations.” Data provided by the department also shows the number of \"staff/inmate provocations\" spiking as the number of assaults decrease from 2008 to 2015. Critics: Puncture wound case illustrates prison reporting issues \nParker has said classifying more incidents as assaults can lead to more inmates staying in prison longer, at a higher cost to Tennessee taxpayers. \nThe ACA recommended changing the inmate disciplinary policy to remove the definitions for both assaults and \"staff/inmate provocations.\" They would be replaced by definitions including \"staff assault with weapon\" and \"staff assault without weapon.\" \n\"The team felt that there was a gap in the application of those two (current) rules as written that could be closed by shutting the door on them, deleting them and adding new rules,\" Stalder said. \n\"We determined that we believed a gap existed through a combination of tours, interviews with staff, review of documentation, review of outcome measures presented by the department that all of y'all have seen. And we looked at the same types of materials.\" Buy Photo \nAuditor Richard Stalder, former head of Louisiana prison system reveals the results of the prison review at a Legislative hearing Wednesday Oct. 7, 2015, in Nashville, Tenn. (Photo: Larry McCormack / THE TENNESSEAN) \nChanges to officer work scheduling system \nOfficers have also complained about a relatively new, 28-day schedule. The schedule replaced the traditional 40-hour work week, requiring officers to work 6 days on, three days off. Officers argued the new format unfairly delays overtime payments, significantly decreasing the amount of take-home pay for an already difficult job. \nThey argue that’s leading to more vacancies, with the remaining officers forced to work doubles and more overtime in general. That overtime is only paid after officers work 171.1 hours in a month; officers say at times, they’ll be forced to work many hours in a row, and then taken off the schedule if they approach enough hours to warrant overtime. \nFewer officers working lengthy schedules is leading to safety problems, officers and inmates argue. Tennessee requests independent review of prison system \nThe report calls on a 14-day schedule, where officers work 12-hour shifts. The officers would work 86 hours a pay period, with double shifts being eliminated. \n\"We felt like (Schofield's) goal could be accomplished by transitioning to the 14-day work period instead of the 28-day work period, that would ensure that every correctional officer who works shift work would have every other Friday, Saturday and Sunday off,\" Stalder said. \nHe also said the change would increase the frequency that officers would receive their payment for overtime. \nReception to the ACA review \nLawmakers at the hearing both welcomed the recommendations and criticized the auditors. Some criticism came for a lack of depth or the amount of recommendations; Sen. Ken Yager, R-Kingston, criticized the ACA for only visiting five of the state's 13 prison systems. Several said they were displeased that they had only received the report hours before the hearing Wednesday, an unusually quick turnaround for a legislative review. \nStalder said he spoke with staff members, he acknowledged ACA reviewers were with wardens or other members of the administration during their visits. Although Stalder said he didn't think administrators were within earshot during his conversations with staff, Sen. Mike Bell, R-Riceville, questioned whether any correctional officers would feel comfortable speaking the truth when their bosses were standing nearby. \nAs soon as the audit was announced, lawmakers, officers and others criticized the ACA. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart, D-Nashville argued because the state of Tennessee has paid more than $40,000 to prepare for previous ACA audits and that Schofield is a member of the ACA standards committee that the review would be a \"rubber stamp for business as usual.\" \nAfter the hearing, Stewart, House Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh, D-Ripley, and Tennessee State Employee Association President Bryan Merritt said the review was a good start. But all said it should be the launching point for a more in-depth investigation. \n\"As we anticipated, while there are some good recommendations in this report, we knew that this would not be the comprehensive, independent probe that we were hoping for, but instead another rubber stamp of approval just like the ACA has given in the past,\" Stewart said in a statement. \nFitzhugh noted that he had sent concerns to the department about the 28-day schedule months ago, as had many other state lawmakers and correctional officers. He said it was both affirming and disappointing to see the ACA note those same issues in it's report; he thinks they could have been addressed sooner had the department listened to state lawmakers. \nIt remains to be seen what recommendations Schofield will chose to implement. \n\"I think he has a credibility problem, to say the least,\" Fitzhugh said, noting he had always gotten along with the commissioner in the past. \n\"I hope he listens to this report that he commissioned. I sure do. Surely he will.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:18:57.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
