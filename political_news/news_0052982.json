With former Mayor Karl Dean's successor now known, the Scene thought it would be instructive to sit down with his predecessor: Bill Purcell, Nashville's much-respected mayor from 1999 to 2007. Admittedly, we did so in part to research our theory that Nashville mayoral terms run in cycles. We elect a big-spending big-picture mayor for a couple of terms — a Bredesen, a Dean — then go for a mayor who refocuses on the little things that matter: infrastructure, neighborhoods. Having followed Phil Bredesen, the man who brought major league sports (and stadiums) to Nashville, Purcell is perhaps best-known for his attention to the fine details of running a city. That said, his eight years in office also planted the seeds for much of Nashville's recent booming growth, which gives him an unique vantage point on the transition from what has come before to whatever might come next. Read the full transcript of our conversation, including talk of the election and — perhaps more importantly — Hot Chicken, after the jump: The day Karl Dean was inaugurated, what was that like for you? So this was the last day that you were mayor. Was that like graduation? What was that day like? You know, it was celebratory in every way. Perhaps the happiest person that I knew was my wife. But I was equally happy. To know that a transfer of responsibility is occurring easily and collaboratively and, in my case, to someone who you know and trust and have worked together with for most all of the previous eight years is truly a moment of celebration. It’s a city celebration, but for me it was also very personal. I felt a high level of not just comfort and satisfaction but real optimism about where the city was going and where we would end up, so the celebration in that regard was complete. What was the day after like? In my case, it was a little unique I suppose, at least in my life. Karl was sworn in, I went and had a hot chicken lunch, and I flew immediately to Boston to take up a new job. So for me, I went directly onto the next thing and for me that I was ideal because I was able to be in a new and different environment right away with lots of things to learn and lots of people to meet and lots of things ultimately that I wanted to do. And I got to do them. So that for me was an ideal way to complete that celebration. Did that keep you from checking up every week on what was going on here? I imagine it might take a while before you weren’t obsessive about things that were happening that you used to have such a role in. That’s a really interesting question. My recollection is that I was, everyday, challenged and rewarded by what I was doing and that I didn’t find myself guessing or second guessing about what my successor had done. It’s especially true for me because I knew the new mayor well. I knew his team very well. I knew the folks that I left behind in charge of those departments and I knew that they were ready for anything that came and obviously the proof over the last eight years is that they were. I can imagine any mayor leaving office would feel like they were in the middle of some things. Whether it’s things you started that you didn’t get to finish or whatever that is. Are there things that come to mind for you? They do and that’s another part of, frankly, my satisfaction about the last eight years as well. I had been involved in trying to provide a new baseball stadium. It wasn’t a priority of my original campaign, but it was, I felt, a need of the city and I tried very hard to get that done. We had a deal done which, then, the owner was unable and unwilling to fulfill. So that was a piece of unfinished business when I walked out the door and Mayor Dean took care of it. We had suggested, when the baseball stadium did not get built on the thermal site, we had thought that would be a good place for an amphitheater. That proposal came late in my term and, as mayor’s learn, new and unexpected proposals in the last months of a term are not easy and not always successful. So the amphitheater was not approved, but at the end of the day there’s an outstanding amphitheater on that site and that work is done. We had done the planning for and outlined our hopes and dreams as an administration for the river in particular, with the east and west bank, and the nice thing for me, in fact a really great thing for me, has been to be able to watch the way those hopes and dreams were not just fulfilled but exceeded. So, in my case, there is a huge amount of satisfaction and a lot of rejoicing in the fact that the things that I hoped would continue and improve did so. The things that I had hoped could be addressed were. I think it was, in the end, an ideal eight years from my perspective and very reassuring for the long term. I imagine you might resist this — and I’ll add a caveat that I don’t think we can really sum up Karl Dean’s legacy today, I think a lot of these things you have to be years down the road to see how things work out — but with that said, how do you think he did? What are strengths of the last eight years, what are weaknesses? I think he was an extraordinary mayor at an extraordinary time. And I think he met the challenges that were presented to him and he was successful in his approach to individual issues and collectively. In terms of the legacy, you’re right, you can’t know what history will say or do. But I do think it’s a matter of fact that it was during this period of time that Nashville moved back to the front of the American mind. Moved back into a place of recognition as a major successful American city. And that’s a pretty big achievement. It’s the culmination of lots of work by lots of people and Karl Dean would be the first to say that, going back a generation. But it happened on his watch. And that’s, I think, going to be extraordinary for him as well. One of the questions at least that I’ve found interesting throughout this boom time, and it seems like it’s facing Mayor-elect Barry, is how do you have those boom times without leaving a section of your community behind? It’s always a challenge, in fact the greatest challenge of being mayor, is communicating with everybody at the same time and having them understand. It’s really hard. Particularly when there is a lot going on and a lot needs to be done, you can find yourself either in front of people or, and this hopefully doesn’t happen, but behind people in terms of their desires and wishes. This administration, unique in the history of the city, had both the extraordinary flood and the Great Recession, and coming out of that obviously there have been huge gains, in part because of investments made now and in part because of investments that we made previously. But going forward, I think this mayor, Megan Barry, comes from a neighborhood background, comes from a larger city perspective than I think has been credited to her, and I am confident that she will make sure that she personally and her programs generally are felt across 533 square miles. Karl Dean’s interest in jobs, his interest in economic development, his interest in schools, his interest in safety, all those things touch the whole big city. But I think at this moment, as the natural attention of the city turns to the far reaches of our boundaries, that the new mayor will be positioned to meet that need going forward. There’s this, I guess sort of conventional wisdom — I don’t know, I’ve talked to people about it at least — this idea that it’s a cyclical thing. You have a mayor that builds big buildings and the next mayor focuses on sidewalks and neighborhoods and things like this. There are some flaws to that, I’m sure. But you were the guy who campaigned with the desk in the neighborhood, the neighborhood mayor, and Phil Bredesen built a lot of big stuff. Is there something to that? Ideally, you aim to do both. What I mean by both is you aim not only to protect and promote the downtown and the business center, but you also are physically and visibly engaged with the most distant reaches of the county. It’s easy though, to say that, it’s not as simple to do, especially when you’re confronting the kinds of challenges that we have confronted. My thinking is that it’s a balance that has to be struck by each mayor as they move through their terms, and I have no reason to think, in fact I believe that Megan Barry will strike the balance that’s important for this time. I don’t see it as a pendulum, but I do think for each mayor and each administration, there is a resetting of the relationship with the public and you can continuously make mid-course corrections as you move along. What do you think the toughest decision for a new mayor coming in is? The hardest challenge initially is understanding the continuous nature of so much that goes on in the government. Making sure that you want to maintain all that’s good and all that’s necessary, while simultaneously attempting to raise expectations in the areas that are most important to people now. That is not all that different from new management and new leadership in any corporation or any other place. The difference is you have 630,000 shareholders, if you will, 630,000 people or more that have not just an interest, but a real stake in what you’re doing. So you are, from the start, reassuring the management and all the players within the government that you want them to keep doing the things that are essential for the operation of the city while simultaneously trying to not only move things to the next higher level and also in some cases change course because it’s time to do that. You were mentioning earlier how you inherit a great many of those people too that you’ll have working for you. Maybe more than people realize. Basically, there’s more than 10,000 people there when you come in and most of them are going to be there when you leave. Do you think that’s a good thing? Yeah, it’s a… Because people think about those sorts of government jobs and say ‘oh those people just hang around.’ Look, whether you’re talking about the phone company or most major organizations in the world, you want a workforce that is both motivated and experienced. So, yeah, you want to make sure there’s a whole lot of people who work for the city that know exactly when the garbage trucks are supposed to start and exactly where they’re supposed to go and what they’re supposed to do at the end of the day. And you would not ever want to return to a strictly spoils based system where, for the first few months everyone had to figure out how to get the lights on at the courthouse. But there is a clear challenge in establishing the relationship between, especially, long term employees who have perhaps been accustomed to a particular style and a direction and who are now confronted by a change in leadership. Having said that, these are also people who have had a lot of experience with that. Because mayors do leave and many of these folks have been through more than two changes in administration and because they’re good, they know it’s their job to respond to a new leader, provide the best advice they can give, explain why we’ve always done it this way, but be prepared for the leader to say ‘that’s not good enough, that’s not the answer I was looking for as to why we are doing this. What I was looking for is is there a better way, is this the best way? Is there a cheaper way?’ And if you are successful, they meet those new expectations from a new leader. I think I saw your name on a financial disclosure or two, but it didn’t seem like you were very involved in this election, publicly at least. What did you make of it? It got kind of nasty toward the end, what did you make of how that went? The good news is at the end of the day I think we have a very good mayor and a very good Metro Council and I am very optimistic about what they can do together. Having said that, I was very disappointed in the negativity in the campaign and equally disappointed that it became partisan. Period. Is that inevitable? No. In fact, this is the first time this has happened. It’s not occurred before in this way. I recall an effort by one party to become involved in the elections in 1999 and the other party did not engage and it worked, frankly, to the disadvantage of the candidate. It backfired. In this case, both parties engaged and so you began a partisan election. That has never happened before. And I really believe that one of the secrets of the success of this government over the course of now more than 50 years has been that from the start, we didn’t want that. We said it wouldn’t be a part of it. And it’s not like this isn’t a city that knew partisanship. I mean, Andrew Jackson invented the Democratic party sitting right here in Nashville and there have been all kinds of partisan activities here, for both parties. Some of the largest fundraisers ever held in the history of the Republican party were conducted here. Chairman of the Republican finance council and committee nationally, probably more such chairs, come out of Nashville than any other city to my knowledge. There are lots and lots of partisan people. It’s not a city that decries politics. But we have since the start thought that, as to this mayorship, as to this position, we should not engage in that kind of partisan politicking, that the parties themselves were not going to engage or be engaged and we were consistent about that. This, to my knowledge, is the first time this has occurred and I believe it was a mistake and my hope is it won’t be repeated. There’s plenty of things for those parties to do. They’ve got presidents to elect and governors to focus on, they’ve got a legislature that they’ve got all kinds of opportunity to be involved with. There’s a reason why this mayoral election is very deliberately held at a time when none of those other national campaigns are being conducted. There’s pressure periodically to move it to another cycle, and the people who argue for that typically argue that it would save money. But I would say to you, from the beginning, we knew there were cheaper ways to do it but there was no better way to do it. And those who are promoting moving it to national electoral cycles typically are partisan political people who see the opportunity to bring all those partisan political national, mostly, but even state political issues to bear in an election where none of those issues belong. They just don’t. My sense is that the city didn’t enjoy it, that the candidates ultimately realized they didn’t benefit from it, either one, and the next election and the election after that folks will again avoid that kind of engagement. Getting more to the substance that came up in the campaign, I don’t guess you’ve been combing through the finance books of Metro recently, but you keep up with this stuff and you were intimately familiar with it. One disagreement that seemed to come up between David Fox and Megan Barry was about the state of Metro’s finances. David Fox saying the sky’s not falling but we have to be careful, I think it’s fair to say he wanted to be more cautious. Megan Barry was saying we keep investing. I’m trying to fairly sum up their arguments. They sort of disagreed about where things stand now with debt levels and things like that. What do you make of that? It’s interesting. I watched closely what all the candidates said on that subject and I thought there was a major disagreement earlier in the campaign, but by the end of the campaign I was convinced that they were both saying essentially the same thing about our current fiscal state. Just trying to say it in a different way to talk to different people? Well, perhaps. It’s not unusual for campaigns and candidate’s positions to evolve, but my clear sense of what they were saying by the end was at the moment the finances of the city are, not just balanced, but in good order and we’re safe. The question was what about the future? That’s the only place where I heard the language differing and we’ll have to see how much true difference there was in their positions because I’m satisfied that the new mayor is going to be careful, the new mayor is going to be thoughtful, the new mayor is not going to invest money that the city doesn’t have or can’t afford. And like most times in our history, people will be watching pretty closely where the money goes. Again, Karl Dean was confronted with two extraordinary realities. One the flood and secondly the Great Recession. And in those two challenges he’s been unapologetic and clear that he felt the need for historic investment that was, for some, counterintuitive but that he believed was essential to maintaining not just where we were but the momentum that we had. The convention center. Yeah, the convention center and the balance. We had gone through a very successful period of time in the first decade, before the recession hit. There was another time with significant cranes from the Pinnacle outside the window, to Rolling Mill Hill, to the railroad gulch, all of which began on my watch. The Viridian and the Etch and the Encore, and the balance of the housing investments downtown. And he knew that in that unique time in our history something more had to be done and so he did it. This is a different time now. Back to my experience, if we were going to have housing in the downtown we had to incentivize it. So we did incentivize the Viridian, we incentivized the Encore, we incentivized the Bennie Dillon, we incentivized the construction of housing downtown in order to show the market what could be done. As a result of those investments, we incentivized and supported the construction of the Symphony Hall. We arranged for the removal of the thermal plant. That allowed the Pinnacle to come in without public investment, basic private investment that followed the earlier public investment. So in that regard, there are certainly areas and you see another of these cranes here now where there is no public incentive but there is private investment based upon an understanding about where we’re headed. I think Megan Barry will understand the presence of that private investment. It’s clear, it’s happening, from Charlotte to Buchanan Street to Old Hickory. So if there’s a change, I think it will be mostly based upon the place we are in our history, the place where we are economically and the things the city needs to do. In terms of challenges, it’s always going to be education. It’s the largest part of the budget. The number of customers are increasing. Despite what some people say there are more customers of our public schools every year than there were the year before, and I think that’s going to continue. So there’s going to be increasing needs and demands for support for those schools and, as you’ve seen from the litigation and the conversation around the state, there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the current state funding formula. The comptroller has issued a rather scathing analysis of that which you can look up. It’s a very strong statement about the lack of transparency about the system and the way in which it’s currently structured. That’s not to predict how the lawsuits will come out, it just means that there is going to be this continuing challenge between the needs especially of urban systems and the ability of the state to do its part and then the obligation of the city to continue to support more kids in a larger number of schools because that’s where it’s headed. So that challenge is real and I think it’s one that the mayor comes in with her eyes wide open about and will tend to focus those resources where they are needed which is going to be first and foremost schools. You mentioned public schools, obviously the charter school debate is ever-raging. Mayor Dean is an outspoken cheerleader of those charter schools and has recruited and during his time in office there’s been a serious expansion of those. Do you think that’s a good thing? The first charters began on my watch. Those were the first experiments in that regard. I believed then and I believe now that people do want to have a certain amount of choice for their kids. They’d like to have the first choice be a good neighborhood school, but if their child needs something more or different they’d like to have other options available to them. So we began the process of making this a piece of what we offered. I think where the city is at the moment is where most of our attention needs to be. Whether charters by themselves will cause the whole big system to improve or change or whether or not they are simply a piece of the solution with lots of other things being brought to bear. My sense is that the new mayor is on the high middle ground. That’s my sense of it. We’ll see how it plays out in terms of her budgets, but I think that she believes that it’s a piece of who we are now and it’s likely to remain a piece of who we are now but it is not in and of itself going to be what moves our entire public system to excellence. It’s going to require a lot more attention at lots of levels within the public system and that balance will be clearer. Of course [Dean] is moving into a period of education reform of his own and that’ll be actually fun to see how the current mayor and the former mayor and the former former mayor all may or may not see that issue. At this moment, my sense is that we’ve got all the tools we need and it’s likely if a good new idea is presented in the form of a charter that it will be embraced, but no one I think believes based on current evidence that that is the single silver bullet for a public education system that needs much more. Have you talked to Megan Barry at all yet? Not since this election, no. But I’m looking forward to it. What will you say when you do? The good news is Megan is someone that I know well and have had lots of opportunities to talk to throughout the course of the campaign. As any former mayor I think would do, I was happy to answer questions of any candidate and talk to any candidate during the course of the campaign about the city or anything they wanted to talk about. I would say that I had more conversations with her during the course of the campaign than with any other candidate and I was glad to help. I think she is prepared for everything that’s ahead. I think that Karl Dean was probably the best-prepared mayor we’d ever had. What makes you say that? For most of his career he’d been on the streets, in the jail — and I know something about that preparation because it’s where I started too — but then for the previous eight years he’d been right inside the courthouse and he knew every legal issue, he knew every policy issue that had a legal implication, he’d sat through every Metro Council meeting, he’d been involved really with all of the important decisions of my previous eight years. They touched him in some way and he touched them in some way. And I think that combination made him the best prepared mayor we’d ever had. What I think Megan Barry brings is an experience inside the Metro Council that gives her an opportunity to start out, uniquely, aligned with the new council just elected. That’s not essential. There have been plenty of examples over the course of the whole more than half-a-century of Metropolitan government where mayors and city councils fell out. But I think it is hugely advantageous that she starts with that knowledge and that background. No mayor has ever had that before. So I think she starts out in a very good place given where we are a a city. My major advice is consistent across mayors, right? And it’s that there really are three key lines of business and if I have a legacy that I feel particularly satisfied about it is that for almost a decade I said there were three key lines of business in every city. This city in particular. And they were education, public safety, and quality of life. When I watched the campaigns to succeed me take place, I watched all the candidates for mayor say basically that. Education. Public safety. And the quality of life piece, to some degree, was transformed depending on the candidate. Karl Dean came in as mayor and consistently for the next eight years said education, public safety, and economic development were the three pitches we had to hit. But I think that those basic concepts of things the city has to continuously do, can’t ever take its eyes away from, that’s now in our DNA. So my advice for Megan Barry would be the basic advice that I continue to give the city and have been giving for some time. It always was true even when we didn’t know it and it always will be true. And the last piece which during a recession can become economic development, I think will evolve back into quality of life. So that’s what I was going to ask you. I know Karl Dean is not opposed to quality of life, nor are you opposed to economic development, but are there times when those things can be at odds? Or when a focus on one can mean a lack of focus on the other? Because it does seem like there’s a certain anxiety in Nashville, in some areas, that will the growth mean we don’t recognize the city we live in anymore. Look, the Wall Street Journal said in 1999 there’s one thing all three candidates for mayor agree about. We don’t want to be Atanta. Sound familiar? That was 1999. There is more similarity about the anxieties of a city than folks remember, thankfully. Most people forget their urban anxieties at least after a couple of years. In this case, it’s a real concern and it’s been a real concern for a long time. But the mayors that we’ve had, really in modern history have supported and encouraged moderate growth that we’ve been able to handle and when we’ve had particular challenges whether it was a tornado or a flood or incredible traffic jams in the center of downtown, we’ve worked through them. We had never had an NFL football game until I became mayor. Or Monday Night Football. We had never confronted a Monday Night Football game with a bomb threat before with the whole world watching. But you know what? We learned how to deal with it, we got through it and now that’s not an issue. We will solve the problems of downtown traffic in Nashville. Some of them are short term solutions, some of them are long terms solutions. We will solve them. And we will deal with traffic, we will deal with transit. But the key is, in dealing with those things, not to lose sight of the critical underlying obligations of the city. Not get distracted by the events of the day and miss the big and critical pieces. Quality of life includes jobs. Quality of life includes employment. And when it's broadened out to quality of life, you do in the end capture the issues of not just your downtown and your homeless population but also your distant reaches of small and medium-sized town centers. So speaking of how growth can have good and bad effects possibly, do you worry that the same thing can happen with hot chicken. I know you’re a fan of hot chicken. We have a lot more hot chicken places in town now. I like a lot of them But you’re a bigger fan of hot chicken, I think, than I am . I hope so. So what do you think? Are we in danger. Can you end up with a lot of mediocre hot chicken instead of a few really great places. That’s a very good question and one that I haven’t had to address before. I think Nashville knows its hot chicken. Nashville is not going to support bad hot chicken. Nashville is good enough and strong enough and big enough now to make sure that all our hot chicken is good. I’m counting on that. Is it possible that in some distant places, you know in Ann Arbor on Tuesday it’s Nashville Hot Chicken Day, for example. At a place called Zingermans. There are lots of other people out there trying it. Have you had it anywhere else that you thought it was even close? No. No. No. People have tried. And I go to Buffalo periodically and they think they have something that’s competitive, but it’s a different product altogether and it doesn’t compete with what we have. It just doesn’t compete. It’s just a different thing. It might as well be deep-fried cauliflower. It’s just something else entirely different from what we have and I don’t worry about it in any way changing the immigration patterns or the movement of jobs into the city. We’re good there. It was invented here, we’ve been protecting it, we nurture it through the Hot Chicken Festival and other processes. All the new places, I think, do their best to honor the founding principle. And people now know it’s good for you too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:40:24.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
