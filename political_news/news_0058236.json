A deal is 91 days overdue. Tuesday Governor Wolf vetoed the republican short-term spending bill, calling on GOP leaders to get serious about negotiating a long-term deal. Republicans fired back, accusing him of holding social services and schools hostage. \nAuditor General Eugene DePasquale said the last things he wants to see affected by the state budget impasse are children. He said that can be avoided if the state budget passes soon. Until then, no state budget means no state funding coming into schools. Because of that, he said at least 17 districts have borrowed a total of $346 million. That's estimated to result in more than $11 million in interest and fees the districts will owe. \n\"So then there’ll be more cuts. So then they’ll be more grades or subjects taken out of the schools. And then it’s like the kids are growing up with a less education,\" Steelton parent Ranada Peffer said. \nDePasquale warns it's about to get worse. \n\"The cost is going to go up each and every month,\" Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said. \nHe expects another 28 districts to start borrowing money next month, including Steelton-Highspire, where Peffer's son goes to school. \n\"If they’re going to have to take out loans to fund the schools, by the time they pass the budget, who knows how far in debt they’ll be?\" she said. \nHer other son is in a pre-K program she said was delayed this year because of the budget stalemate. \n\"It was two weeks of 'Why can’t I go to school? Why can’t I go to school? Why can’t I go to school?'\" Peffer said. \nThe Steelton-Highspire District expects to borrow $8 million, which is money parents would rather see come from the state. \n\"What could we do about it? That is the very frustrating part about it is that we can’t do nothing about it,\" Kevin Williams, a grandparent from Steelton said. \nThe auditor general said whether or not the schools are reimbursed by the state later on, it's still a lose-lose. If the schools aren't reimbursed, there may be cuts in programs. But if they are reimbursed, that would likely result in a more expensive state budget.
