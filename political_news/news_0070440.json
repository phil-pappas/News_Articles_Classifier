Paul Ryan formally declared his candidacy for speaker of the House Thursday and he appears to have a lock on the job when elections are held next week.\nThe 45-year-old Wisconsin Republican has support from three major caucuses within the GOP, including the Freedom Caucus , which was once known as the Tea Party.\n\"We have an opportunity to turn the page, to start with a clean slate, and to rebuild what has been lost,\" Ryan told Republicans in a letter announcing his candidacy.\n\"We can make the House a more open and inclusive body -- one where every member can contribute to the legislative process,\" he said.\nRyan didn't initially want the job , but he agreed to run if he earned unified Republican support. He told colleagues he was excited for the opportunity at hand.\n\"I know you're willing to work hard and get it done, and I think this moment is ripe for real reform,\" he wrote. \"I believe we are ready to move forward as a one, united team. And I am ready and eager to be our speaker.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:02:34.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
