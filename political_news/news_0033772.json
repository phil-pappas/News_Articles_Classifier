As a result, the six-month growth rate of the LEI has moved further into negative territory. Meanwhile, the CEI for Australia continues to increase moderately, although the six-month growth rate has eased. Taken together, the downward trend in the LEI and the moderating growth rate of the CEI suggests downside risks to Australia's growth will persist in the near term.\nAbout The Conference Board Leading Economic Index ® (LEI) for Australia\nThe composite economic indexes are the key elements in an analytic system designed to signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle. The leading and coincident economic indexes are essentially composite averages of several individual leading or coincident indicators. They are constructed to summarize and reveal common turning point patterns in economic data in a clearer and more convincing manner than any individual component – primarily because they smooth out some of the volatility of individual components.\nThe seven components of The Conference Board Leading Economic Index ® for Australia include:\nYield Spread, 10 year minus Policy Rate\nShare Prices, All Ordinaries\nMoney Supply, M3\nRural Goods Exports\nSales to Inventory Ratio\nGross Operating Surplus, Private Non-Financial Corporations\nBuilding Approvals\nFor more information including full press release and technical notes:\nhttp://www.conference-board.org/data/bcicountry.cfm?cid=7\nFor more information about The Conference Board global business cycle indicators: http://www.conference-board.org/data/bci.cfm\nAbout The Conference Board\nThe Conference Board is an independent business membership and research association working in the public interest.
