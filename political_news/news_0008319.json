The Democratic front-runner has taken four days off from campaigning in order to prepare for the meeting, which could be a major political event.\nDuring the video , various politicians and diplomats who worked with Clinton while she was serving as secretary of state give their highest praise, describing her as an empathetic and \"dogged\" leader with an \"iron will\" and \"vision for the future.\" Top U.S. officials such as former Secretary of State Madeline Albright and President Barack Obama vouch for the candidate in the video, although neither have given an official endorsement yet.\nThe ad praises Clinton for restoring ties with her political rival Obama following her 2008 loss, advancing the rights of women and girls worldwide throughout her career, standing up to Iran and negotiating a ceasefire between Gaza and Israel. Clinton also portrayed herself as a champion of LGBT rights worldwide, even though she didn't publicly support gay marriage until after she was gone from the State Department.\n  U.S. jet in Afghanistan hit by small-arms fire The F-16 was able to land safely after the incident on Oct. 13, said Capt.
