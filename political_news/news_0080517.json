The company was hired to study how the agency might better influence reporters.\nThe Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, was trying to \"refine their agency messaging,\" according to a Washington Post story . But Enzi said he's worried about how much money is being spent on these activities across the government given the $18 trillion national debt.\n\"[U]nnecessary media relations spending is a cost that the nation simply cannot afford,\" he wrote. \"With the administration again asking Congress to raise the federal debt limit, it is essential that the Executive Branch avoid spending on unessential and inappropriate activities, and that Congress be made aware to the extent that such spending continues to occur.\"\n  McCarthy drops out of speaker's race Republicans were set to hold an internal election Thursday afternoon, but that election was postponed.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/08/15 12:30 PM Enzi said agency spending on PR is \"largely a black box,\" and said the Congressional Research Service has trouble pinpointing exactly how much is being spent. He also noted that this spending continues despite several laws that prevent the government from spending money on \"publicity or propaganda purposes,\" or to influence legislative outcomes.\nEnzi asked OMB to explain exactly how much SAMHSA has spent on its PR contact with Edelman, and how much more it plans on spending.\nBut he also asked for a government-wide estimate of all spending on advertising, PR and media relations efforts in fiscal year 2015, which just ended.\n\"Describe the manner in which the administration categorizes such spending, and a breakdown of how much was spent within each category,\" he wrote. \"Describe how 'messaging' activities such as that described by the Post are categorized, and provide government-wide and agency by agency totals for spending on messaging activities.\"\nHe also asked for a summary of all current laws aimed at preventing the government from spending on propaganda and publicity efforts.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Paris train hero in critical condition after stabbing Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone was stabbed \"repeatedly,\" according to a CBS news report.\nBy Jacqueline Klimas • 10/08/15 12:32 PM Read his letter here:\nTop Story McCarthy out of speaker's race GOP was set to hold an internal election Thursday afternoon, but that election was postponed.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/08/15 12:30 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:52:32.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
