With this, she will be juggling four projects simultaneously, including Bharat Ka Veer Putra — Maharana Pratap, Baal Veer and host of a finance show Get Rich With Aashka. She will be seen travelling across 30-odd destinations in India in this show. She says, “I am excited to tour around the country and show the viewers a different side of India. In our first schedule, I have done everything — from climbing an elephant to ziplining. Rather than being just in front of the camera, I enjoyed each place as if I was holidaying there. Life is a book and those who don’t travel, read only a page and I believe in reading and enjoying the entire book!” Documentary on A. R. Rahman to premiere on October 26: ' Jai Ho', a 90-minute documentary tracing the journey of music maestro A. R. Rahman, is all set to premiere on October 26 on Discovery channel. The Oscar-winning composer said initially, he did not find it \"necessary\" to have a documentary based on him, but later director Umesh Aggarwal convinced him. \"There were lot of offers before to do a documentary on me, but I felt it was not necessary. And after the Oscars and the brouhaha happened, I felt that people could get some kind of inspiration with my life through the journey of my life, through the way I'm making music,\" Rahman said. \"And then Umesh, an award-winning filmmaker, contacted me and he said that initially it was only for the consulates all over. It was the kind of exposure which was good, but I didn't know that all this would happen,\" he added. However, the composer added that he \"cannot watch myself\". \"People living abroad and having the Indian flag, they deserve to know about the people of India. I didn't know it'll come out charmingly like how it's made. I cannot watch myself and hate to watch myself,\" he said. Aggarwal said that it's the first \"definite feature\" on Rahman. \"I am confident that this film will convey his astonishing success and global phenomenon,\" he said. Shot across the world, the film includes interviews of Aamir Khan, Danny Boyle, Mani Ratnam, Gulzar, Ashutosh Gowarikar, Shekhar Kapoor, Subhash Ghai and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber among others. The film traces Rahman's journey from achieving superstar status in India with numerous hits in a very short time to working with big names in the west. Some of his personal experiences are also going to be showcased in the film. \"Jai Ho\" has been created for the Public Service Broadcasting Trust. Mahesh Bhatt gives insights into his new TV show: Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt, who has been associated with the Hindi film industry for over four decades, will soon be narrating and exploring tales of some of Bollywood’s most iconic personalities in the TV show 'Khwaabon ka Safar with Mahesh Bhatt', which will go on air October 19. At the launch of the show here, Bhatt said that when he was approached by the makers, he immediately agreed to take it forward as he felt humbled to get such an opportunity. “When I heard the whole idea and the kind of narratives that have been fashioned, I was humbled by the idea that I had to come face to face with my own ignorance. I did not know all these people whom I claimed to know, I did not know that the great Indian filmmaker V. Shantaram made a living by giving out lamps at theatres while the artists performed and it was there where Shantaram ji first learnt what drama was all about,” he said at a media interaction here. “It is a unique show where I am learning about my own ancestors, and there was a time which existed prior to even my birth,” he added. At the press conference, a video clipping giving a sneak peak into the journey of the show, which will be aired on The EPIC Channel, was also showcased. Talking about the show, Mahesh Samat, managing director, The EPIC Channel, shared that the show wil bring forth the journey of young, ambitious people who stood for what they believed in and made their dream come true against all odds.
