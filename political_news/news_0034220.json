In bond trading, for example, there are generally not exchanges where investors can check the most recent prices. Investors have to rely on their broker or bank to give them a fair price without having an easy way to determine what a fair price looks like. Not surprisingly, in this setup, the brokers and banks charge a lot for their services — often around 3 percent of the transaction price for municipal bonds, as compared with the few tenths of a percentage point that investors pay for a stock trade. When the banks had to start giving some information about the recent trades they had done in the corporate bond market a number of years ago, the prices for investors swiftly went down . None of this means that there aren’t potential problems in need of fixing in the stock market. Even some high-frequency traders worry that the fragmented, automated nature of stock trading has made the markets more fragile and liable to disruptions like the so-called Flash Crash of 2010, when stock prices cratered in a matter of minutes for reasons having little to do with the value of the underlying stocks. After that crash, though, prices recovered quickly, and the same has happened after more recent market mishaps. There is also evidence that the presence of high-speed traders has made it more expensive for big investors trying to buy or sell multimillion dollar blocks of shares. David Lauer, a co-founder of the Healthy Markets Association — an advocacy group that has been critical of high-frequency traders — said that while the automation and race for speed in the stock market had generally been a good thing for ordinary investors, it had turned into an arms race with little societal benefit. But if the pendulum has swung too far in the stock market, Mr. Lauer said, “the pendulum hasn’t even begun swinging in other markets.” Even regulators have taken to complaining about how much time they are spending on the stock or equity market rather than on other topics that are costing investors more. “We spend a lot of time on equities, when there is a greater amount of efficiency,” Stephen Luparello, the Securities and Exchange Commission’s director of trading and markets, said at a New York event in February. As to what might happen if the trading tax that Mrs. Clinton proposed is enacted, perhaps the best indication comes from Canada, where a fee aimed at high-speed traders was put in place in 2012. Researchers at the University of Toronto found that the fee did push out the high-frequency traders, but had only a modest impact on the cost of trading. The effect was to push up, just slightly, the cost of trading for investors both big and small. \nThe Upshot provides news, analysis and graphics about politics, policy and everyday life.
