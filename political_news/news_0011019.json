Shelters also must have moisture-proof flooring that is raised at least 2 inches above the ground.\nThe changes make the rules more enforceable for humane officers, Tener said.\nSome cities have passed additional rules covering pets kept outside, but many continue to follow the guidelines of the Ohio Revised Code, said Teresa Landon, executive director of the Ohio Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n“Any time that a city or a municipality makes a move to strengthen, to go above the Ohio Revised Code, it’s a good step,” she said.\nThe state rules leave a lot of gray area, said Corey Schoonover, Fairfield Area Humane Society executive director who helped develop the Lancaster ordinance. The new rules enhance the humane officers’ ability to ensure people take better care of their outdoor pets, he said.\nBut the ordinance could create a burden for citizens, said Councilman Mike Fracassa, the only “ no” vote in Monday night’s decision. The ordinance doesn’t differentiate clearly between outdoor and indoor pets, he said.\n“It’s too restrictive; it’s not clear as to what pets we’re talking about,” he said. “I definitely favor enforcement against animal abuse, but this is just taking things too far.”\njsmola@dispatch.com \n@jennsmola", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:03:50.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
