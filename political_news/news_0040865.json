Longtime FIFA finance committee chairman implicated in approving a $10 million payment through FIFA to Jack Warner in 2008. A U.S. Department of Justice indictment published in May alleges it was a bribe from 2010 World Cup host South Africa. \nISSA HAYATOU (Cameroon, 1990-present ) \nInterim FIFA President in Blatter’s absence denied claims made at a British Parliamentary hearing in 2011 that he got a seven-figure bribe to vote for Qatar. Reprimanded by the IOC in 2011 for taking cash from FIFA’s then-marketing agency partner in the 1990s. \nCHUNG MONG-JOON (South Korea, 1994-2011 ) \nWould-be FIFA presidential candidate banned for six years by FIFA ethics committee this month. Case arose from Garcia report allegation of undue financial pledges to FIFA members if South Korea won 2022 hosting vote.
