We are urging the DPR Humanitarian Committee to reconsider the decision without delay in order that we can resume providing much-needed healthcare.”\nSince the beginning of the conflict in May 2014, MSF has donated medication and material to 170 medical facilities to treat war-wounded and patients with chronic diseases.\nMSF has also conducted more than 85,000 consultations together with the local healthcare authorities through 40 mobile clinics since March 2015, providing healthcare to people living in places from where doctors and nurses have fled or where pharmacies are empty.\n“We are almost the only organisation providing treatment for tuberculosis in prisons , insulin for diabetic patients and haemodialysis products to treat kidney failure,” continued Janssens.\n“With the termination of our activities from one day to the next, thousands of patients suffering from chronic potentially fatal diseases will be now left with little or no assistance.”\nManu BraboMSF staff treat patients with TB in a prison in Donetsk, Ukraine , January 2015.\nFew back-up options\nMSF is currently providing 77 percent of the insulin needed for patients aged over 18 with diabetes in the area under DPR control.\nTeams also supply 90 percent of the products necessary to conduct haemodialysis treatment, vital for patients suffering from kidney failure.\n“Without the steady supply of these life-saving treatments, severe health complications can occur.\n“There are very few back-up options for these people now that MSF has stopped its activities. We are deeply saddened that so many patients will be left behind,” says Janssens.\nJon Levy/Foto8MSF doctor Svetlana Niekurasa checks 91-year-old Varvara Tutunik in her home in Debaltseve in April 2015.\nCrucial healthcare must be provided\nSome 150 patients in the penitentiary system who live with drug-resistant tuberculosis will now no longer have access to the treatment that MSF has been providing since 2011.\n“There is a huge risk that the health of these patients will deteriorate soon. Any interruption of treatment of patients with drug resistant TB is known to reduce dramatically the prospects of cure, even if they restart treatment later,” adds Janssens.\n“Prisons in Ukraine are known to have very high numbers of drug resistant TB, and if these treatments are interrupted, this will lead to a major risk to public health.”\nToday, MSF urgently requests the Humanitarian Committee to reconsider the withdrawal of the organisation’s accreditation in order that it can resume life-saving medical activities.\n“As a medical organisation we ethically cannot accept being forced to abandon our patients.\n“The decision must be reviewed so crucial healthcare can be once more provided to those in need,” concludes Janssens.\nMSF in Ukraine\nMSF has been working in eastern Ukraine since 2011 and has been providing medical-humanitarian aid through mobile clinics and donations to health care facilities on both sides of the conflict since May 2014.\nMSF relies only on private donations for its work in Ukraine and does not accept funding from any government.\nFind out more about MSF's work in Ukraine", "external_links": ["http://www.msf.org.uk/node/16076", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/176/688_720x480_219811292_555x370.jpg", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/176/687_720x480_638873969_555x370.jpg", "http://www.msf.org.uk/node/166", "http://www.msf.org.uk/node/17156"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:17:28.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
