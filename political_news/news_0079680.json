Mattiello says he is not yet ready to talk about ways to make the Senate passed-version of the governor's truck-tolling bill better. But Raimondo has said she's open to compromise. And some of the likely questions — and talking-points — are obvious: Is the powerful House speaker willing to support the $600-million revenue bond she has proposed to produce a surge of construction activity at a potential cost of $1.1 billion over 30 years? Or will he insist the cost be reined in? What happens if so many tractor-trailer trucks, from out of state, take detours, the revenue is insufficient to pay the bonds? Does Mattiello have any qualms about giving the Rhode Island Department of Transportation unbridled authority \"to fix, revise, charge and collect tolls for the privilege of traveling on Rhode Island bridges?\" Are the $13.5 million in new tax credits, rebates and other sweeteners Raimondo offered enough to satisfy the Rhode Island truckers and shipping companies that would have to pay the tolls? And before asking rank-and-file lawmakers to vote on the proposed new truck tolls, will legislative leaders insist that the Raimondo administration disclose where they intend to place the overhead tolling gantries, and how much they intend to charge? Asked where Mattiello stands on these questions, his spokesman Larry Berman said Friday: \"He said these are all good questions and all are issues that he [has] asked the [House] fiscal staff to look at, but he is awaiting more information and hasn’t reached any conclusions yet.'' On Friday, Raimondo spokeswoman Marie Aberger affirmed the governor's willingness to negotiate a plan to fix Rhode Island's worst-in-the-nation bridges. \"As the governor has said for months, she is open to compromise on the specifics, but any solution must follow some key guiding principles .... No broad-based tax increases that would burden all Rhode Islanders; a sustainable, predictable source of revenue that’s enough to actually tackle the problem; a fair solution that can happen quickly; and nothing that would make us more of an outlier as we work to make our state more competitive.'' Making their pitch Raimondo and her team, including RIDOT Director Peter Alviti, have been out and about, meeting with chambers of commerce and individual business owners in the months since the General Assembly shut down in June, with her toll bill in limbo. \"I think there are still a lot of questions,\" said Erin Donovan-Boyle, executive director of the Newport Chamber of Commerce. \"The business community wonders how this is going to impact their businesses directly and indirectly. It seems the governor's office senses that there are a lot of questions and has tried to reach out directly through chambers and associations to answer what questions they can,'' she said last week. Page 2 of 3 - Laurie White, president of the Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce, said: \"We invited Director Alviti to present to various groups within the Chamber over the past few months. He visited with us on three separate occasions. We [also] invited the governor to share her direct perspective and she did,'' a week ago Friday. \"Her message emphasized the potential loss of the federal match and the benefits of the surge strategy,'' White said. \"We also met with the Speaker to express our view that dilapidated infrastructure is a priority issue for the business community. He indicated that he and the governor are working closely on the [bridge] funding formula, which we applauded,'' White said. Asked whether those visits won over any opponents within her sphere, White said: \"We have not taken a position just yet. \"Having said that, the [chamber] feels strongly that the condition of our infrastructure is a major detriment to our business climate. Fifty out of 50 [states] is unacceptable. We intend to visit with Speaker Mattiello to share our sense of urgency and to get his point of view ... . We also will be getting the Senate president's view.'' White also shared the results of a spring survey of her chamber's members that drew about 80 responses. Among the highlights: — 96.55 percent agree \"an efficient and reliable transportation infrastructure is critical to RI's economic growth.\" — A majority (51.85 percent) believe the initial RhodeWorks proposal announced in May 2015 \"would be an effective and appropriate way to finance repairs and improvements to the state’s bridges and transportation system.'' — A majority (57.8 percent) said the proposal would have ‘Minimal’ to ‘No impact’ on their business. — About half (50.91 percent) were not convinced that an amended RhodeWorks proposal (heard before the Senate) would adequately protect RI businesses that would be impacted. Some 11% were not sure. — 63.64 percent agreed \"that state leaders needed to take more time then was available in the prior legislative session ... to deliberate the elements of the proposed plan.'' White said her chamber has been aggressive, since spring, in gathering and providing the governor with \"input from the membership on impact.'' She believes this information resulted in the reworked version that came out in June, with rebates and other sweeteners \"to blunt any disproportionate impact on RI business with significant trucking operations.'' Newport County Chamber's Donovan-Boyle included in her latest newsletter contact information for Gabe Abo, the Raimondo aide sitting down with individual business owners to explain how the proposal would affect them. Conveying Abo's request, she wrote: \"Before the meeting, please compile the following information which will assist the Administration in the analysis: number of Federal Highway Administration Class 8 trucks and above (tractor-trailers); the location of the trucks and the major routes they drive; the frequency of the routes they drive per year.\" Page 3 of 3 - Other opinions Critics insist there are better options than tolls for financing — and producing — the urgently needed bridge repairs. Instead of tolls, a Republican Policy Group, led by state Rep. Patricia Morgan, R-West Warwick, says the state should pay for bridge repairs from existing revenue. \"The money that is needed is less than 1% of the total budget. We can surely do it ... without cutting any social programs or critical public services.'' The Center for Freedom & Prosperity has suggested Rhode Island contract with a \"private sector general contractor'' to finance, design and manage the construction, as Pennsylvania has done. The Center's CEO Mike Stenhouse says this approach would bypass RIDOT, reduce the overall cost and protect taxpayers against cost over-runs. To further reduce costs, the center suggests the General Assembly provide a “case-specific exemption from project labor agreements (PLAs), minimum apprenticeship requirements, and ‘prevailing wage’ laws.” Mattiello says he remains open to hearing every idea, but every one he has heard so far has shortcomings. With a potential $150 million deficit next year, Mattiello said the state can't count on the Republicans' \"pay-as-you-go\" proposal. As for \"privatization'' proposal from Stenhouse's group, he said it looks to him like an attempt to ship tax dollars and construction jobs to non-union out-of-state companies. Should lawmakers go with some version of Raimondo's revenue-bond proposal, voters will not have any say. Aberger's explanation: \"The key feature of a revenue bond is that its guarantee of repayment is solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating initiative, in this case, the user fees on large commercial trucks. By utilizing this revenue bond structure, under no scenario would the State of Rhode Island be ‘on the hook’ for repaying the bonds.\" This was Raimondo's answer when asked on WPRI's \"Newsmakers\" what would happen if the toll revenue fell short: “If that were to happen, you’d have to increase the toll ... . Taxpayers will never be on the hook for this bond.” --kgregg@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:45:45.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
