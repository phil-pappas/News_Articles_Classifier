The Prime Minister and government should walk the talk,\" he said.\n\nOn the state of the economy, the former Commerce and Industry Minister said, \"Besides, he said that Indian industrialists are investing abroad and external commercial borrowings have gone up so also debt to GDP ratio. Capacity utilization has been low in industries. Credit off-take are at the lowest levels in the 20 years. Exports have been on the decline for the last nine months.\"\n\nSenior Party leader Ahmed Patel took to twitter to target the government on rising prices of pulses.\n\n\"Govt was sleeping while Dal price rose. In March, crop estimate report had shown huge decline in Dal production, but they waited till Jun to act. While price continued to rise, govt wasted a crucial month as it insisted on a particular tendering technique unavailable with Agriculture Ministry,\" he said in tweets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:29:20.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
