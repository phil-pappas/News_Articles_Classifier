It is Republicans' second try to defund Planned Parenthood, after an initial attempt to strip funding in a bill funding the government through the fall.\nThirty-five groups, including the Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life and the Family Research Council, are supporting the reconciliation effort, writing to Congress that \"Planned Parenthood and other abortion businesses do not need or deserve taxpayer funding.\"\n  Report: Obama to meet families of Oregon victims Last week after the shooting took place, the president repeated his call for gun control.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 10/05/15 10:01 PM \"Instead, these tax dollars would be put to better use at local community health centers, which provide all the same health services Planned Parenthood does (and usually more), but do not abort the lives of unborn children and callously harvest their body parts for profit,\" the groups wrote.\nThe reconciliation bill does not target other abortion providers.\nThe effort came about after a series of undercover videos in which abortion foe David Daleiden captured top Planned Parenthood officials discussing how some clinics provide aborted fetal tissue for medical research. The footage has prompted an outcry among Republicans against Planned Parenthood and has started several GOP-led investigations into the group.\nThe reconciliation bill defunding Planned Parenthood would likely get further than any other legislation vehicle, as it could pass the Senate. But President Obama is sure to veto it, and Republicans don't have enough votes in the Senate to override a veto.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Reid: Republicans 'puppets' of the NRA The minority leader urged his colleagues Monday to pass legislation to require mandatory background checks.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 10/05/15 9:14 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:53:58.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
