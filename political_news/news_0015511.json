I dunno why, I guess I couldn't be arsed drawing this iso at work. How many times does she mention feminist or feminism? I know all the words in the article but I just cant understand why she cant talk properly. All I see is the female version of the spoon salesman from Fawlty Towers. Does writing in such a manner make it exciting and fresh because it just seems like an awful lot of words to say fk all. Her relationship never failed because a guy wouldn't accept a bj, we all know this voluntary refusal is pointless in the long run, as these are soon restricted to birthdays, apocalypses and redecorating and entire room off your own back after the honeymoon period. Her relationships fail as she's probably so far up her own fking ahole, that no wants her. She is effectively the Cadbury Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut bar of the chocolate aisle. Some want to try it but they conclude its st, not worth the hassle and go for plain, or people try it and think, that's more fruity and nutty than I want from a chocolate bar, never again. The fact that a person from PH found this article, posted it, then subjected us to a discussion really leads me to ask, is your internet broke.There are millions of videos of car racing, things blowing up, people falling down, cats looking cute. Articles on carb refurbs, suspension setup and someone has even bothered to review the new MG 6, yet you read st like this instead of going, Ha feminism, pah, bet she takes it up the oxo tower and doesn't shave, NEXT.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:00:42.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
