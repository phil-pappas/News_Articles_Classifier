Benton was acquitted of the final charge he faced on Thursday. Earlier in the month, a judge tossed all four of the other charges he faced. Both Benton and Tate are former longtime aides to former Rep. Ron Paul and Sen. Rand Paul. Benton had been serving as a general consultant to the super PAC, America's Liberty, and Tate had served as president and founder.\nWhen the two Republican operatives were charged, they took a leave of absence from America's Liberty and John McCardell, the vice president of finance, took over in the interim.\nMcCardell said both Tate and Benton have \"resumed their original roles.\"\n\"They are both back to helping America's Liberty PAC and Rand Paul full-time now,\" McCardell told POLITICO in an email.\nMcCardell also said he is back to his previous role as vice president of finance.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:33:51.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
