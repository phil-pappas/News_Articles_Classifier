Locally, about 27 employees or a 9 percent reduction will occur at the D.C. headquarters. Related The Resurrection of LivingSocial \nThe workforce reduction was motivated by a new directive, which accelerated earlier this year, towards rebuilding and revolutionizing the brand. LivingSocial CEO Gautam Thakar previously described this vision by saying that the company will become an “experiences marketplace.” Inline with this mission, Thakar and co. recently launched two major pilot programs; Restaurants Plus and FastBook. \"This action is difficult, yet it allows us to operate more efficiently\" \nEach pilot has a common goal, which is to lessen the friction of a sale, Thakar previously told DC Inno. Restaurants Plus uses card linking technology to help LivingSocial customers save money with every swipe of a preregistered card and FastBook is the company’s first-ever booking tool, focused on the health and beauty market. \n“This action is difficult, yet it allows us to operate more efficiently, while focusing our investments into accelerating progress toward our mission of becoming a leading experiences marketplace … at the start of the year we announced our new direction and I am encouraged by the early customer feedback from our new pilot programs and today’s action allows us to move forward in a more streamlined manner,” said LivingSocial’s President and CEO in a statement . LivingSocial will make it a priority to build out its product and technology teams, with an eye on mobile and data analytics areas \nThe cuts, a LivingSocial spokeswoman told DC Inno, will be evenly spread across different divisions while the company’s Tucson customer services facility will bear-the-brunt—a 29 percent reduction. Employees will be offered severance packages and outplacement support. In addition, the sales forces will shift to become a more in-house team rather than an “on-the-ground” division. With that being said, LivingSocial remains hiring and its career page shows various developer positions open. \nThakar joined LivingSocial in August 2014 after a successful career as an executive advertising guru for Ebay. Since taking the reigns, he has hired a new CFO, a new head of product, a new VP of marketing and a new VP of analytics. \n“In the future, LivingSocial will make it a priority to build out its product and technology teams, with an eye on mobile and data analytics areas, he said. “In the past, we’ve probably under-invested in it, honestly,” Thakar told DC Inno in late September .
