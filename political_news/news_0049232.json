It failed, so the bonus was never paid. \n\n“The law is clear — public dollars may not be used to promote school levies,” Yost said in a written statement. “All of Ohio’s school districts must be careful not to cross the line from educational to promotional — and not knowing about an illegal expenditure doesn’t make it legal.” \n\nIn early 2014, the Buckeye Valley school board sought out architecture firms to determine the costs for upgrades to three elementary schools and to determine the size of a bond. The board approved Orchard Hiltz & McCliment, and entered into an agreement on March 18. \n\nThe agreement stated that OHM would provide basic services related to the possible renovation of three older elementary schools and included a provision for Aimpoint Research, a subcontractor of OHM, to provide up to $30,000 in “community engagement” services related to the bond issue. \n\nOn September 3, 2014, a complaint was filed with the auditor’s office, alleging that public money was being paid to Aimpoint to promote an upcoming bond levy, a potential violation of state law. \n\nMinutes from a school facilities meeting show that Aimpoint’s CEO spoke about campaign strategy and how to pass the proposed bond issue. Aimpoint later billed OHM $2,500 for the meeting. The next day, August 19, 2014, a board member was recorded saying the district hired OHM and Aimpoint “to aid us in passing the bond issue.” \n\nAn interview with Aimpoint’s CEO revealed a separate contract between OHM and Aimpoint in which OHM would pay Aimpoint an extra $15,000 should the bond levy pass. The CEO stated, and subsequent interviews with board members confirmed, the board was unaware of the $15,000 “win bonus.” \n\nThe report concludes that Aimpoint received public money to promote the levy campaign and that board members knew, or should have known, this fact. \n\nAudit reports are not typically released so close to an election. But delays by the district in formulating a response to the inquiry prevented earlier release. \n\n“What could we possibly say to the voters after the election if they discovered we withheld information from them prior to their decision at the ballot box?” Yost said. “The Auditor of State has no interest in any local election or its outcome. It has every interest, and duty, to report its findings regarding the conduct of local governments and their compliance with applicable law.” \n\nBuckeye Valley has another bond levy on the Nov. 3 ballot. \n\nAuditors doing the district's regular audit will determine if a finding for recovery of the misspent money will be necessary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:56:07.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
