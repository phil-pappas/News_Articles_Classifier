I also like to follow information on my (many) ailments. I get daily Google Alerts for most of them so I can be one of the first to know about the latest treatment options.\nI can tell its Pinktober. All my breast cancer news includes the words 'awareness', 'pink', the s-word, or other related terms. Yesterday's alert included these items:\n“Harford observes breast cancer awareness month”\n“Breast cancer survivor finds comfort in delivering flowers to other patients at Texas hospital”\n“WATCH: 29 year old beats breast cancer, gets featured on Pink Ribbon Connection”\n“Breast cancer awareness chili cookoff Saturday”\n“Breast cancer survivors event”\nThis drives me crazy. Please stop spending money on pink and spend the money on more important things like research.\nCaroline’s Breast Cancer Blog", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:39:15.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
