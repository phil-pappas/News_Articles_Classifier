Oregon memories go back to Thurston High School in Springfield, to Reynolds High School in Troutdale, and now to Umpqua Community College in Roseburg. They're part of a swelling list of school shootings, consuming first-graders trying to learn their ABCs and grownups trying to learn a new job skill. \nAs President Obama said Thursday, \"Somehow this has become routine.\" This week he'll be coming to Roseburg to comfort families, also becoming agonizingly routine. \nWhat's common to these horrors, it seems, is a seriously mentally ill figure armed like an armored regiment. We have a lot of trouble talking about the armament level, although we can piously say we should do better with mental illness.We certainly should, although very few mentally ill people are violent. We should somehow focus more on those who, like the Roseburg shooter, have access to 14 guns including an assault rifle – a collection that stunned the shooter's father. \nThere are long odds against any new gun limits, even something like extending Oregon's closing the gun show purchase loophole to the federal level. Nobody knows the effect of limits – you can't count the violence that doesn't happen – but the Brady Bill did prevent more than a million gun purchases, mostly to convicted felons. We're content with the end of the ban on sales of assault rifles, although their function is to assault people. \nThere are things we can and should do about our gun laws. But we also have some issues about our gun attitudes. \nRonald Reagan famously said that government wasn't the solution; government was the problem. With guns, after each of these massacres, we conclude just the opposite: Guns aren't the problem, guns are the solution. \nFor one loud chorus in the response, the answer is always to have more guns present. \nAs Frank Bruni pointed out in The New York Times Sunday, Texas has now changed its laws to allow guns on college campuses, to the considerable unease of professors who encourage argument in their classes. Actually, the law pretty much allows open carry anywhere. Georgia has recently redone its laws to allow guns in bars, along with churches and government offices. \nLast year's Republican nominee for governor of Oregon, state Rep. Dennis Richardson, responded to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting by saying that if he'd been there, he could have just picked off the shooter with his gun. After every school shooting, there's a call to arm teachers and repel threats with shoot-outs, although relatively few of these calls come from teachers. \nWayne LaPierre, CEO of the National Rifle Association, has famously declared that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun. In Roseburg, the good guys with a gun indeed stopped the bad guy with a gun – or at least got him to turn the gun on himself – but only after nine other people were dead, making it not exactly the ideal approach. \nBut we still cling to the idea that guns are themselves a solution, that they make not only situations but people better. The mother of the Roseburg shooter, one of her patients told The New York Daily News, eagerly collected guns: \"She said she had multiple guns and believed wholeheartedly in the Second Amendment and wanted to get all the guns she could before someone outlawed them,\" helping her son get access to 14 guns. \nThe mother of the shooter at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were killed, was also a gun enthusiast, who acquired a large arsenal and thought shooting sessions were a good bonding opportunity with her problem son. \nThe Douglas County sheriff, who declared after Sandy Hook that the shooting had nothing to do with any gun issues, announced that his policy response to the Roseburg shooting would be to refuse to say the name of the shooter – although it wasn't exactly something that could be kept a secret. \nEvery time, we hear so many voices firmly insisting that guns are a solution, that they should be legally present in more places and carried by more people, and that any limitations are entirely the wrong direction. \nYou can see how someone living in the debris of his own mind and his own life, looking only to make other people feel the kind of pain he does, might conclude that guns are also his solution. \nDavid Sarasohn's column appears on Mondays and Wednesdays.
