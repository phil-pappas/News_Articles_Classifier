In the reddest of red states  say, Idaho  you can find the kind of socialism, through publicly owned utilities or the federal dam that farmers rely on for their water, that would be right at home among aquavit-sipping Danes . . . . Free of the label, a hybrid economy where health care, education and pensions for the elderly are provided, side-by-side-by-side with creative capitalism, works pretty well in the Nordic countries, Britain and Canada. And most of the tenets of what is considered democratic socialism have majority support in the United States. . . . So we dont like them. But we do like many of their ideas. We can thank Senator Bernie Sanders, self-proclaimed democratic socialist, for this healthy debate. This week, Donald Trump called him a communist. If so, you can find broad public support for most of the things advocated by the commie from Brooklyn. The right wing falls under the spell of the rich so easily. They would rather have people die in the streets for lack of health care than to tax the rich. They would rather we work our children 18 hour days in factories with chains on the door, as we did in the late 1800's, than tax the rich. The right wing is so inundated with an occult that worships the rich, they can't see how they are destroying this nation; one tax cut for the rich and removal of social programs for the middle class and poor at a time.
