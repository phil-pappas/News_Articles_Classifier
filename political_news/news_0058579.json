In fact, the first cat was cloned in 2001 by a team of scientists in Texas at Texas A&M University, College Station. The team was able to perform this historic achievement by transplanting DNA into an egg cell whose nucleus had been previously removed then transplanting this embryo into a healthy, female, surrogate cat. And it is certainly an impressive scientific feat, no matter the team responsible, but now the idea could also mean big business, according to ViaGen CEO Blake Russell. \nIn an interview with the Washington Business Journal , ViaGen's parent company, publicly traded Germantown, Md.-based synthetic biotech firm Intrexon ( XON ), said that it will be venturing into the business of cloning household cats and dogs for high income customers. \nViaGen is a Texas-based company that specializes in animal cloning technology, gene banking and what it calls \"pet preservation.\" This translates into a customer being able to store their favorite dog or cat's genetic makeup as a way to recreate a copy/twin in the future. And it isn't offbeat science fiction anymore, Russell told WBJ.

In addition, Intrexon charges $150 a year after the first year to store your pet's genetic material and there's an initial $1,600 fee. This obviously does not account for what could be other consulting and visitation fees. \nWhether it's ethical to clone a cat or dog is obviously another question entirely, but according to ViaGen the technology has reached a point where they've already been able to clone \"healthy and normal\" livestock and a first litter of kittens. \nWhen the service will be available to the general public is unclear at the moment. With that being said, Russell said he believes that the cost will continue to decrease as they scale and this \"product\" will be become more popular in time. \"I think the market is quite large,\" Russell told WBJ.
