(AP) â€” The city is suing the owner of the West Richland Municipal Golf Course in federal bankruptcy court, saying she owes between $1.27 million and $1.36 million.\nThe Tri-City Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/1jJPXNG ) that according to court documents, Michelle Marcum has liabilities totaling nearly $1.9 million, the bulk of which is owed to West Richland.\nMarcum has managed the course since 1989 and agreed to purchase it from the city in 2006, when West Richland was looking to privatize the course. She has received seven extensions to her $1.4 million promissory note since 2010.\nMarcum's attorney says she was told the city would renegotiate financing with her.\nShe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June.\n___\nInformation from: Tri-City Herald, http://www.tri-cityherald.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1jJPXNG", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:18:38.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
