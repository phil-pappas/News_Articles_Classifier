Until recently, many doctors assumed exercise would be too draining on cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.\nBy Steve Sternberg Oct. 20, 2015 | 12:01 a.m. EDT + More More on Cancer and Heart Health:\n• Cancer Treatments Can Cause Cardiac Issues\n• Minimizing Heart Damage After Treatment\n• A Wonder Drug's Frightening Side Effect\n• A New Rx for Cancer Patients: Exercise\nThe next blockbuster prescription for cancer patients may be exercise, scientists say.\nNew research is chipping away at the doctrine that says cancer patients should take it easy. Until recently, many doctors —and patients—assumed that exercise was too draining and might be unsafe, particularly during the rigors of chemotherapy , with its challenging side effects and overwhelming fatigue.\nBut emerging evidence suggests that exercise is safe and may help blunt the devastating impact of chemotherapy on fitness —and, ultimately, speed recovery. Increasingly, scientists are also beginning to look even deeper, to examine the impact of exercise on cancer progression. Lee Jones, an exercise physiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , poses the question this way: “What is exercise doing to tumor biology, the ability of these cells to grow and prosper?”\nJones says he long nurtured an interest in biology and sports . As he dived deeper into his discipline, his focus veered from sports medicine to the clinical applications of exercise in health care: What are the normal physiologic responses to exercise ? What are they for people with heart disease and cancer ?\nThese interests converged, he says, as cancer survivors began living longer with hearts that had been exposed to prolonged bouts of damaging chemotherapy. And not just their hearts but also their lungs, muscles and blood. “This would have a fundamental effect on fitness,” Jones says.\nFifteen years ago, he began designing studies to test whether a structured exercise program could stave off the “global deconditioning”—or physiological decline—that results during cancer therapy. “At the time, people thought we were crazy,” he says. “You’re going to exercise patients who have cancer?”\nBut the findings were striking. In women with breast cancer who didn’t exercise, chemotherapy took a major toll on aerobic fitness, aging them prematurely. “Ten weeks of chemotherapy is equivalent to 10 years of normal aging, Jones says. “It turns a 50-year-old into a 60-year-old; a 60-year-old into a 70-year-old.”\nWhen cancer patients who exercised were compared with those who didn’t , Jones says, the difference was striking. “Exercise completely prevented the decline that we saw in the control group.”\nThe findings were impressive, says Donald McDonnell, a professor of pharmacology and cancer biology at Duke University School of Medicine, who worked with Jones at Duke. “Usually, you need a green laser to point out [subtle] differences in the two groups. Not this time. His results were dramatic.”\nThere are other intriguing hints that cancer patients who exercise may be better off, Jones says. Some studies of disease patterns in cancer patients, for instance, have shown that people with cancer—breast, prostate and colorectal--who report higher levels of exercise have a fewer recurrences and lower death rates.\nConfronted with this evidence, Jones began to wonder whether exercise could have an impact on tumors themselves. Some tumors, for instance, thrive in low-oxygen environments. Exercise pumps oxygen into tissues, which could discourage their growth. Other studies suggest that exercise may bolster the effectiveness of chemotherapy.\n“I think about exercise as if it’s a drug,” he says. “How much do I need to give? Does it work? Are there some patients who respond better than others?”\nThe latest data indicates that how well a tumor responds to exercise, and whether it recurs, depends on the characteristics of the tumor. “Right away that tells you it’s not a uniform impact,” Jones says. “With a different tumor, there may be a different exercise prescription.”\nWhat sets Jones’ work apart, says McDonnell, is that before he came along, “a lot of this stuff was not great science. Jones was one of the first to do prospective clinical trials.”\nJones says he’s ramping up to do even more at Memorial Sloan Kettering—14 studies, over the next three to five years, involving 400 to 500 patients.\n“It’s early days,” he says. “If we think of this from the standpoint of the evidence, there are 120 studies looking at the impact of exercise on cancer. There are 3,500 in heart disease.”\nTAGS: cancer exercise and fitness", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8lh8%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8lh8%3Fsrc=usn_su", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8lh8%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=A%20New%20Prescription%20for%20Cancer%20Patients%3A%20Exercise", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8lh8%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8lh8%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=A%20New%20Prescription%20for%20Cancer%20Patients%3A%20Exercise", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe8lh8%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=A%20New%20Prescription%20for%20Cancer%20Patients%3A%20Exercise&summary=New%20research%20shows%20working%20out%20may%20ease%20the%20effects%20of%20chemotherapy%20for%20some%20patients.&source=U.%20S.%20News"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:37:57.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
