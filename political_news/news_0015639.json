She also alleged that they had tried to touch her inappropriately when she was waiting her turn at the counter, said a police official.\nBy the time the shop manager intervened and other customers gathered around, the accused duo had fled the scene. The police were thereafter informed and a case registered at Rajendra Nagar police station by the woman.\nIt is yet to be verified as to what weapon or object the woman had produced from her bag at the store, police said, adding that they have obtained CCTV grabs from the outlet and identified the duo.\nHowever, no arrests have been made in the case as yet, said the official. The complainant has been asked to join the probe and her response is awaited, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:24:17.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
