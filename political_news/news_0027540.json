Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said Friday that he could \"potentially\" be a candidate for speaker of the House but also gave the name of Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as someone who he would support for the position. “The fact is that yes, I think that I can be potentially a candidate, but at the same time, I agree with the vast majority of members, I think. That we need a Paul Ryan or we need somebody who is a. experienced, b. has been a committee chairman or something other than just up through the leadership ranks,\" he said in an interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"We very definitely need to pick our fights carefully, but we need somebody who’s willing to do those fights when the time comes because the motion of our party has been to the right\" he added.\nNew members since the 2010 wave election are \"more conservative\" and \"more interested in real fiscal reform,\" and they've been denied by K Street influence, he remarked.\nRyan has repeatedly said that he would not seek the speakership despite significant support from the GOP base, writing in a statement Thursday that he \"will not be a candidate,\" adding that \"I continue to believe I can best serve the country and this conference as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,\" he said.\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial board endorsed the Wisconsin Republican on Thursday night as maybe \"the only man who can stop GOP self-destruction.\"\nIssa also addressed the potential of going up against Rep. Jason Chaffetz for the speakership, remarking that the Utah Republican, who succeeded him as the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has not fulfilled his duties.\n\"Jason's a good man, an honorable man, but he got his job by going to [Speaker John] Boehner and saying he would shut down that rancor that was going on, he would go along, get along, and he's done that. He put shining pictures of Utah on the wall, and he basically stopped doing it. There hasn't been a single committee report or staff report published since he's been chairman. The fact is, he's a good guy. But whatever he was as a freshman when he was a fighter on our committee, when he was trying to hold government accountable, he took a break from that. And I think that's gonna hurt him, not whether I get in the race or not--it already hurt him. He didn't have 30 votes going into the race, I don't think he's going to get the 240,\" he said.\nIssa then remarked that he \"would not have the hubris to determine whether I'm the 240 candidate or Paul Ryan.\"\n\"This is something where the conference has to dig deep, they have to ask the question of 'who can we unite behind?' This is a job you can't run for. You can make yourself available for it, but the conference really has to look hard not for who's got the most whips calling but who really can make a difference beyond 218, because the day after you're speaker, you have to make hard decisions,\" he said. \"And like Joe said earlier, you have to be able to go to people and say, 'I promise you I will bring up your issue, but I need you to do this for me, and you've got to keep those promises. And that was one of the areas that Boehner ran out of places to say yes to.\"\nLater in the program, House Freedom Caucus founding member Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) touted Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) as someone \"who's boring\" and \"not very exciting\" but as someone who would defend the institution.\nRyan, Mulvaney added, has good relationships with conservatives and the \"credibility that a lot of other folks might not have,\" but also remarked that \"he still has to answer some tough questions.\"\n<div", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-republican-crack-up-1444347391"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:59:22.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
