The mayor's office announced the appointment Thursday afternoon in a news release. \n“I worked with Lonnell for eight years on the Metro Council and found him to be smart, engaging and committed to public service,” said Mayor Megan Barry, in a prepared statement. “I know that he is the right person to help strengthen the office of neighborhoods while also engaging more parts of the community in the governing process.” \nThe appointment comes with the addition of \"Community Engagement\" to the position's title. The news release says the new title reflects Barry's desire to ensure that traditionally underserved populations in Nashville have a more prominent role in the administration. Matthews starts Nov. 12. Megan Barry names Talia Lomax-O'dneal as finance director \nMatthews, who ran for a seat in this year's at-large council race and lost, was the youngest African-American ever elected to the Metro Council, and served District 1 from 2007 to 2015. While on the Metro Council, Matthews led as President Pro Tempore, Minority Caucus President and served as the chair of the Budget and Finance Committee, Parks Committee and Education Committee. \nMatthews also served as District Executive Director of the YMCA Community Action Project and Urban Services Youth Development Center for the YMCA of Middle Tennessee. \n“After two terms on the Metro Council, I am honored that Mayor Barry has asked me to continue my public service to the citizens of Nashville and Davidson County,” said Matthews, in the prepared statement. “I look forward to working with the Mayor to ensure that our fellow Nashvillians have a prominent role in decisions about how we will grow and change while preserving our quality of life.” \nThe mayor also announced other appointments: \nRon Thompson will serve as a community engagement assistant with the Office of Neighborhoods and Community Engagement to improve the public’s access to the Mayor’s Office. He worked on the Charles Robert Bone mayoral campaign prior to joining the Barry's campaign as her personal aide. He started Oct. 7. \nErin Williams will continue to serve in the new Office of Neighborhoods and Community Engagement as neighborhood liaison. \nPatrick Hamilton will serve as scheduler for the mayor. He recently served as Chief Development Officer for Nashville CARES. He starts Oct. 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:34:42.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
