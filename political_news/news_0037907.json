Comment Follow @kathyprojo Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 4:02 pm Updated at 4:39 PM PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- This was House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello's message: \"We have to get over the 38 STUDIOS HANGOVER.'' \"A company from outside Rhode Island is not going to locate here if they pick up the newspaper every day and see stories about how bad we are.'' He may not have stuck word-for-word to the prepared text of the speech he intended to deliver at Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council's 72nd annual meeting on Monday night. But that was the message he intended to leave with the crowd of business, political and education leaders gathered for the dinner at the Rhode Island Convention Center. \"Why don't I want a special prosecutor?\" Mattiello asked the crowd. Because, Mattiello said, he didn't want to see 38 Studios \"above the fold 1 1/2 years more.\" \"So my challenge to you folks is to go out there, when they talk about a special prosecutor, rather than be a negative ... What are we going to get from it and what's the cost? We have to be positive. You carry the burden for that. We can't. ... It's up to you folks to spread a good message. It's the state you do business in.\" Mattiello highlighted recent tax-cutting moves by state lawmakers. He hailed, for example, the move to increase the estate tax exemption from $921,655 to $1.5 million dollars, and said in the prepared text of his speech: \"I am going to look closely in the coming session to raise the exemption even further or look at doing away with the tax.'' But he also bemoaned the toll that the state's failed $75 million investment in ex-Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling's high-risk video-game venture in 2010 is still having on the state. The company's descent into bankruptcy in 2012 left taxpayers on the hook for the state-backed loan. Mattiello confirmed his earlier support for the resumption of House Oversight Committee hearings into the debacle, following the recent release of thousands of pages depositions taken in connection with the state's court fight to recover its losses , which alleges fraud, negligence and legal malpractice by the chief architects of the disastrous loan-deal. But Mattiello went into the dinner with a few words of caution he intended to convey. A sampling from his prepared remarks: \"We can not let one bad deal paralyze us. We can not stay focused on the year 2010 forever! It was five years ago already.\" \"Look, mistakes were made and bad judgment was exercised. The releasing of the depositions a few weeks ago gave us a pretty clear picture of what went wrong and who was responsible. Those people are no longer in positions of authority. \"Our House Oversight Committee is going to be reviewing the material and will begin holding hearings within a few weeks. We need to learn from the mistakes and make recommendations to improve the way we conduct business. \"I know it was a terrible debacle. But at some point, it is time to move on or we are going to wallow in self-misery forever while our neighboring states attract businesses and new jobs? We can’t let 38 Studios define ourselves as a state. \"It’s time to change the way we act and think about our state. We have to show the rest of the country that we are a better, smarter state that learned from its mistakes. \"If we are not going to sell our state to others, how are we ever going to get our economy moving at a more rapid pace?'' Along those lines, he said: \"I was proud to support Governor Raimondo’s request to add $5 million dollars into this year’s budget to embark on an aggressive marketing campaign. We can turn things around by selling ourselves to others.'' Mattiello has left the door open to subpoenas as a way to try to compel reluctant witnesses to testify before the House Oversight Committee, but he has not voiced any interest in hiring a \"special prosecutor,\" as some have suggested, while state police are still engaged in an \"active investigation\" of 38 Studios and the people and issues around it. Mattiello reiterated his stance on an independent prosecutor: No need for one at this point. The State Police are conducting an independent investigation. -- with reports from Kate Bramson, Journal staff writer -kgregg@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:39:27.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
