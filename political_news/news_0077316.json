And the official number of returnees affected by the same situation is 16,141.\nDuring the first three days of panic for mass deportations, and touring the shelters I found stories of patients and deads, as well as grandparents away from their families.\nArriving at shelter “Bella Vista” (Villa del Rosario, in Cucuta), an over 80-year old man came in because he needed to explain his situation to me. We sat down and he began telling that had 40 years living in Venezuela, has 7 children, 5 grandchildren, and is in Colombia by himself now. All he asks is to be let back to his family; he feels lonely and misses his grandchildren. He complained that the Guard deceived him by saying \"let’s go grandpa\", and got him in a truck. Then, he realized he was far from home and all he remembers is his daughters crying when he was caught.\nMr. Silverio Flores Cuevas, cried while commenting that he has all the papers of their Venezuelan children, grandchildren, Colombian passport, identity card and residence card. He also participated in the Robinson Mission, the Venezuelan government social program that teaches reading and writing to the illiterate; his card is supported by the Government, and also has a record of \"arbitrary departure\" of the Colombian Ombudsman's Office.\n\"I have not hurt anybody, if they say I can go back, I would go running right now. I just think of my grandchildren, we used to go for a walk holding hands”.\nInnocent people suffering cruelty\nOne of the first makeshift shelters by the Mayor of Cucuta is the Municipal Coliseum. I went there to get to know it, took pictures and was impressed by the big amount of children running around. Innocent of the situation they were going through.\nInside a tent there was a young woman with her daughter and told me that she was taken out of Venezuela for not having a legal document, even though at San Antonio del Tachira and Cucuta’s border they never asked for that, and she could enter and exit without any problem, She only had a residence card; another card given to her by the Community Action of the neighborhood; a card that allows people to buy gas which is supported by the Government, and her Colombian international passport.\n\"At no time we were told that we were going to be taken out of there or that we could not live in Venezuela,\" said the girl. She was alone with her cousin and daughter, their Venezuelan husbands were not expelled.\nThe mass exodus of Colombians from Venezuela has been full of abuses. The ones who lived in the neighborhoods La Invasion, My pequeña Barinas and Ezequiel Zamora, dawned on August 22, surrounded by military troops, who forced them to leave their homes, and unfulfilling legal regulations, deported them just for being Colombians.\nThe price of not being Venezuelans\nLida Martínez, displaced from the civil war in Valledupar, (capital of the Cesar’s Department, Colombia) and now deported from Venezuela, said she woke up in the early morning scared, because there were several men outside her home, knocking the door. Then, her husband went running with his brother, and she stayed alone with her three children and sister in law.\n\"The next day came the Bolivarian Guard and forcibly entered my house, they turned everything upside down and left a mess. Then they asked me if I'm Colombian or Venezuelan, I said I’m a Colombian displaced by armed groups and my 3 year-old daughter is Venezuelan”.\nGuards answered that my condition was not their business and has no validity, \"so go, grab a suitcase and your daughter because you have to leave\", they said.\n“My house was made of bricks and they wrote the letter ‘D’ on the wall meaning ‘Demolition’ and said they were going to knock it down, ‘this house is going to be knocked down for you not being Venezuelan’, they said. I showed them my daughter’s documents but they didn’t care, the only thing they said was that I could leave her with them if I wanted. Not even for a minute. They would have to kill me first, but I’m taking my daughter with me”, Lidia said.\nThey took Lidia and her daughter to an open field under the sun, and she watched the Guard pulled their belongings from the house, took the ones of greater value, and when her daughter cried from hunger, they did not care , just said they had to wait for deportation and that when they get to their land they might be given food.\n\"I have the papers of the house, a permit for the purchase of gas, but the Guard said that was a President’s order and we had to evacuate the area, because that land does not belong to anyone \", she added.\nAnother who felt cheated by being expelled from Venezuela, was Andrea, because when the governor of Tachira went to the neighborhood with the promise of giving IDs to a group of Colombians, instead of giving them an appointment to get the document, were taken for the police command blackmailing them with the fact that they had 20 days to get the certificate, otherwise, they should assume the consequences.\nThe responsibility of the Venezuelan state with Colombian families who have taken refuge in their country is not being properly enforced, because the international protection of refugees begins by ensuring admission to a safe country, giving recognition of asylum and respect for their fundamental rights, including the right of not being forcibly returned to a country where their safety or survival are threatened.\nIn the case of Luz Chacón, housed in temporary accommodation Bella Vista, she said was deported and mistreated.\n“They caught me around 8 am on August 23, and took me to an open field; there was my sister, who had a newborn of 15 days baby, and the Guard did not mind, they got us in a patrol, arrived at the Customs, where we talked to Inmigration officers. I asked for water and there was not. My 4-year old daughter started to ask for food at 11 am, and they did not let me buy her anything. I had to give money to a policeman for him to get me something and he gave me a soda with salty snacks, he did not give me any change. I said to other officers that my daughter needed to eat better and I was sent to drink no drinking water. From there, we went out at about 5 pm”, she said.\nLuz also said that at the time of her arrest, many people ran and beat her daughter leaving her with a black eye. For that reason, the Office responsible for protecting the Child and Adolescent (Lopna), wanted the child to stay, and also because she was born in Venezuela.\n\"I started to argue with two guards who wanted to abuse me and threatened me to get me a bag of drugs and two guns. All because I didn’t let them beating me and asked for food for my daughter”, she expressed.\nLuz complained that they were treated like cattle, she had residence papers in the neighborhood, but that did not help; her brothers ran when they started to be taken out of their homes and went up to the roof while she was taken away. When I told them I wanted to pee, they said they could do nothing, they were only following orders and that I could pee on my clothes if couldn’t hold it. They treated me very bad, my daughter shit on her and had nowhere to change. Women had to get off the pants, urinate in front of them, and dirty as we were, left at the border \" .\nShe said she has no family or place where arriving in Colombia. If not for the shelters wouln’t know where she would be, since the only savings they had were taken away by the troops who came to the neighborhood.\n\"My husband was not deported but came two days later by the river, and had to pay to get some things out of our house and bring them. Thanks God the first days Colombian police went into the water and helped us move things. There were women who fell into the river carrying beds, all with fear to be caught, others dropped TV sets into the water. I don’t know what is worse, if crossing the river or passing over the bridge and spend all day enduring hunger and sun \", she said.\nStories like these were repeating over and over in other shelters, as Villa Antigua, PTP, the Union Hotel, Home of Nazareth. The lines were endless at Colombian Inmigration, at Simon Bolivar Bridge and other places I visited .\nAbuse of power, the disrespect for families’ properties and human rights, the physical and psychological abuse, is what these Colombians are suffering when taken out of Venezuela.\nAt Villa Antigua there is a family consisting of father, mother and three children, the oldest of them is Michael Owall Martinez, 6 year old and who likes to sing hip hop, has a sister ages 4, and a brother who is 2 year old, both suffering epilepsy. They need urgent medical assistance, and are served by a general practitioner, but are not in treatment and daily decline in their illness.\nParents want to return to Venezuela because they were assisted by Cuban doctors in Barrio Adentro Mission, they were doing the correspondant tests and now they are afraid that the disease progresses in their two young children.\nIn the same shelter, I met one of the Civil Defense workers who took care of Mr. Julian Alberto Vélez, Colombian living in Venezuela, affected by Guillain-Barré syndrome, who at the age of 49, died after waiting one hour to legalize his passing from San Antonio del Tachira (Venezuela) to Cucuta (Colombia).\nSolidarity before the crisis\nAndrea, acknowledged the humanitarian work being met spontaneously by officials of the Colombian police, army and other agencies working to give them peace of mind, as well as ordinary people on the Colombian side. \"The day I went to my house for a few things, I found it destroyed, but on reaching the Tachira river, police helped us move stuff to the other side.\"\nLuz, also thanked Colombian Inmigration in the Simon Bolivar international bridge, who received her, her mother and daughter, gave them food, diapers, and all they needed before transferring them to a shelter.\nThe deportation of Colombians started in February this year; one of the reasons was the expiring of the documentation that was granted by the former President Hugo Chavez, in 2004 and lasted only 10 years. Now it is added the practice of home demolitions since August 19, when a state of emergency was decreed. In the border state of Tachira, followed Zulia and Apure.\nBy now, 20 border municipalities are closed, divided into seven zones, each under the command of a senior military officer. People who are not trained to deal with immigrants, those who already were displaced by the armed conflict, and who went from being welcome in Venezuela, to be \"criminals\".\nBy: Yeidy Sanmartín (@amnistia)\nTranslated by: Marcela Albahari (@amnistia)", "external_links": ["https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/124/081_1023x769_476567371_900x677.png", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/124/094_1023x770_578922495_900x677.png", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/124/064_1024x769_002883679_900x676.png", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/124/093_1022x769_759400921_900x677.png", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/124/088_1022x768_047547225_900x676.png", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/124/070_1026x770_482540466_900x675.png", "https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/124/089_1024x767_207917149_900x674.png"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:35:16.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
