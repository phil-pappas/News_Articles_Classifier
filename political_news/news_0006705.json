In the meantime even sexual attacks have become commonplace daily events. The most recent struggles preoccupy the police forces in Braunschweig and Hamburg. The reasons seemingly harmless however the consequences are all the more dramatic, says Policeman Steffen Schwarzkopf.\n[News Headline: New Mass Riot in Refugee Camp]\nThe violent outbreak has been documented by cell phone video at the initial refugee receiving camp Wilhelmsburg in Hamburg. Dozens of refugees from Albania and Afghanistan took to beating each other severely and many had weapons. There were injuries and a number of arrests.\nNote – not “Syria war refugees.:\n“They were fighting with one another then, and some had knives and one even said he had a gun. Others started throwing the iron bed posts at each other.”\nMassive fights in religious and ethnic conflicts are occurring ever more . Example in Brandenburg…nearly 100 cases within exactly three months. The politicians make light of the problem, says the police trade union.\nRainer Wendt, German Police Trade Union “In politics it is frequently portrayed as being a squabble over the left over food portions or the [unfair] amount of clothing being handed out, but it is not so. We must enter time and again with a strong show of force. A person cannot simply make light of what exactly is happening here but naturally the interior ministers are unable to read the actual on-site situation of the police.”\nThere are also sexual attacks on the rise. Baden-Wuertemberg recently reported 6 rapes and a women’s rights organization reported that refugee women are even occasionally being sold/rented out for 10 Euros. Violence in many different forms.\nWolfgang Bautz, Integration Researcher “One of the accelerants is considered to be alcohol and a daily routine that is numbing.” Criminal acts by refugees are being prosecuted by the police but the crimes have no influence on the asylum process even when the criminals are sentenced.", "external_links": ["http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-10.50.45-PM-800x435.png", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-10.50.56-PM-800x430.png", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KBhb2IBXRc8", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-10.50.49-PM-800x454.png", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-1.28.16-PM-800x443.png", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-10.51.27-PM-800x465.png", "http://pamelagellercom.c.presscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2015-10-13-at-10.51.08-PM-800x434.png"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:33:09.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
