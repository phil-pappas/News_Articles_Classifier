It was the first match and in other tournaments there were teams that lost 6-1 and qualified, so what we have to do is take the positive aspects and move forward to the next match.”\nAustralia will be looking to pick up their first win on Wednesday when they face back-to-back FIFA U-17 World Cup finalists Mexico before rounding off their Group C matches three days later against Argentina.\nPhoto: FIFA/Getty Images", "external_links": ["https://d3oilk4eevknv6.cloudfront.net/newsweb/mediatools/image/image/000/001/159/398_700x480_628309282_555x380.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:50:58.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
