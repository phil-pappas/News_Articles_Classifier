Thus, given the invocation of Donald J. Trump in connection with your activities, we ask that you refund all funds received by you in connection with any fundraising undertaken to specifically support and/or done in the name of Donald J. Trump,\" the letters reportedly stated.\nTrump's decision to disavow all outside support groups supporting his candidacy comes less than 24 hours after news broke that Make America Great Again PAC , a super PAC that had been soliciting donations since July in support of Trump's White House bid, would cease its fundraising activity.\n\"Mr. Trump has said he doesn't have a super PAC. To erase any doubt, I am closing my super PAC and will wait for the primary to reach Colorado to have an impact on the race,\" Mike Ciletti, head of the Make America Great Again PAC, told Politico Thursday.\nThe letter to Ciletti's PAC, among others, also follows a Washington Post report that Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, has close ties to Ciletti and has paid two of his companies to produce various materials for Trump's campaign.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Romney admits: 'Without Romneycare, I don't think we would have Obamacare' Romney explained that his signature achievement helped pave the way for the Affordable Care Act's passage\nBy Al Weaver • 10/23/15 2:01 PM According to the Post, Lewandowski allegedly threatened to take legal action against the authors of the report if they suggested that Trump had given a green light to Ciletti's PAC.\nHowever, a veteran campaign strategist, who pitched himself as a potential vendor and consultant to Ciletti's PAC earlier this summer, claims the conversations he had with Ciletti seemed to indicate his PAC \"was completely sanctioned by the Trump people.\"\n\"As I understood it, they were getting money from [Ivanka Trump's] in-laws and I was told they would be doing some fundraising functions for Trump,\" the strategist told the Washington Examiner, speaking on the condition of anonymity.\nCiletti did not return the Examiner 's request for comment.\nIt is unlikely that other candidates will follow Trump's lead in disavowing the outside groups that support them. While Trump is using his personal fortune to self-fund his campaign, several of his opponents rely heavily on the activities, fundraisers and digital components their PACs are able to afford.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner McCarthy fired up, wants cuts in debt ceiling deal McCarthy said a \"clean\" debt ceiling increase makes no sense as it would just allow the debt to soar higher.\n  1:32 PM Top Story House Republicans vote to repeal key pieces of Obama's health law House GOP   Obamacare.\n  11:59 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:42:06.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
