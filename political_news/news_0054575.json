Huckleberry & Persimmon gives kids space to burn off excess energy Expand Huckleberry & Persimmon, 5956 Odana Rd., is a new play and activity center offering options for families with children ages 1-5. The grand opening on Sept. 19 featured games and face-painting, a photo booth and information about forthcoming classes in subjects such as art, movement, Spanish and science. Director Lee Alliet took some time to tell us what parents can expect from activities here. \nWhat made you decide to start your own kid-centered business? \nWith our first child, we enjoyed parent-baby groups at Happy Bambino in Monona. We’re a west-side family, so it was a lot of time in the car, but we managed it because of how much we liked going there. When our second child was born, though, I knew I couldn’t be in the car that much. And trying to find west-side activities that were both available and affordable was a struggle. × \nPlaytime with all kinds of great equipment. And not in your house! \nHuckleberry & Persimmon features “play-based” classes. What does that look like? \nSome resemble a traditional educational setting with an instructor up front, kids quietly listening, everyone doing the same thing. But asking a young child to sit still that long doesn’t always work. So while our classes still have an instructor and lesson plans guiding what we’re doing, there are always different options kids can choose from. \nWhat can parents expect from the “Mayhem Open Play” sessions? \nThat 5:30-7 p.m., after-work, before-bedtime period is not always the most fun. So here, there are riding toys, trampolines, hula hoops, balls and mats for kids to burn off energy during that pre-bedtime hour. × Firelily Photography \nYou have workshops geared toward parents, too. What topics do you plan to cover? \nWe’re working with a local sex therapist to put on a workshop about maintaining intimacy between parents — not just sexual intimacy, but also about how your marriage survives having young kids. And one I’m really excited about is on helping kids deal with transitions, both big and small. All of the parent workshops are targeted toward participation and involvement. You learn from the person presenting, but also from each other. We want to help families build a community through being involved in the kids’ classes and parent workshops together. \nHow does the name “Huckleberry & Persimmon” reflect your philosophy of childhood learning? \nThe name comes from the old saying, “a huckleberry over my persimmon” — meaning something just out of reach. To me, the huckleberry signifies a young child’s ability to grow and learn. And it means being respectful of what young kids are able to do, and what they’re not, what’s just a huckleberry away, and what’s too far beyond that. \nHuckleberry & Persimmon, 5956 Odana Rd., 608-572-7532, huckleberrypersimmon.com Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:22:40.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
