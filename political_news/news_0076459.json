Wall was indicted Wednesday on federal charges after the 29-year-old Layton man allegedly claimed he needed passes to catch a fugitive at the event where many attendees wear elaborate costumes.\nAuthorities say a security official got suspicious of Wall, who was posing as a special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations. The official contacted the Air Force, whose agents confirmed Wall didn't work for them.\nWall faces charges of impersonating a federal officer and making a false statement.\nThe September comic book convention attracted about 120,000 people and featured \"Captain America\" actor Chris Evans.\nNo lawyer or phone number was publicly listed for Wall on Thursday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
