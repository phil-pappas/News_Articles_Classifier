CNN first reported the letter on Sunday.\n\"Accordingly, because Lessig, like Clinton, is a bona fide and legally qualified candidate for President...we request that he be provided with a comparably scheduled 3:12 (three minutes and twelve seconds) opportunity to reach your viewers as well,\" the letter continued. \nClinton played a bartender in that recent SNL skit , which lasted for 3 minutes and 12 seconds. \nAn NBC official responded to Bonin, asking for proof that both Lessig and Clinton are both \"legally qualified candidates.\" NBC said if Lessig fails to provide such proof, its affiliate stations are not required to provide equal coverage time.\nThe Federal Communications Commission says that candidates can request equal time when broadcast stations have a competitor on the air. \nBonin said he is not asking for Lessig to appear on SNL, but wants \"the opportunity he is guaranteed under federal law to use your publicly licensed airwaves to make his case to your viewers, comparable to what Secretary Clinton was afforded for free.\"\nBonin said he's preparing a response to send to NBC early this week. \nLessig, who's running for president to \"fix our broken democracy,\" is a constitutional law and ethics professor at Harvard Law School.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:43:33.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
