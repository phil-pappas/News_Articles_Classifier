During Halloween Season and Special Events, Six Flags deploys Walk Through Metal Detectors to increase guest safety.\nMINOOKA, Ill. , Oct. 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- After 9/11, Six Flags like Disney World and many other theme parks decided to implement Walk Through Metal Detectors to help insure guest safety.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278669\nIn 2013 at Disney World Theme park, a senior citizen and her grandson visiting Orlando climbed aboard the Dinosaur dark ride at Disney World's Animal Kingdom last Sunday, they were on the hunt for a thrill or two.\nWhat they weren't expecting to find: a loaded gun on the seat beside them.\nThe Cobra .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol was soon claimed by its owner, a Florida man who told park security that the weapon had fallen out of his pocket during the ride. Angelo Lista , 44, of Royal Palm Beach, who had a legal concealed weapons permit, was immediately removed from of the park.\nFirearms, after all, aren't allowed on Walt Disney World property for park visitors. They aren't allowed on property at many major theme parks in Orlando and elsewhere. Universal Studios? No. Sea World? No.\nFirearms or weapons aren't the only reason why Walk through Metal Detectors are in place at major theme parks. Another big reason, is modern technology, phones, camera's selfie sticks. There are numerous stories of riders attempting to video, or shoot selfie's while in the middle of the ride. This also endangers other riders and guests on the ground if the device slips out of someones hand or pocket.\nIn general it seems we will need to become more and more comfortable in encountering Walk Through Metal Detectors in every day life. Not only to protect us from the bad guys, but also to protect us from dumb things we do.\nTo learn more, please visit http://www.metaldefender.com\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/metal-defender-walk-through-metal-detectors-deployed-at-six-flags-300163105.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.metaldefender.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY33326&Transmission_Id=201510201412PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY33326&DateId=20151020", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.metaldefender.com/defender-md-6-6-zone-walk-through-metal-detector.html", "http://www.metaldefender.com/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151020/278669", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/metal-defender-walk-through-metal-detectors-deployed-at-six-flags-300163105.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:17:07.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
