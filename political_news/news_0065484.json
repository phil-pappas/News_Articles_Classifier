Join York University faculty, staff and students as they climb 1,776 steps to the top of the CN Tower in support of the United Way Toronto. Registration is open now for the student and public climb on Nov. 7, from 6 to 10am and it is filling up quickly. A team has been created for 'York University Faculty and Staff'. Be sure to indicate that you're climbing as part of this team when you register if you are faculty or staff. Register now and set up a personalized fundraising page later as once the event has reached capacity, no exceptions are made for new registrants. There is a minimum of $75 per climber that will need to be raised. The goal is to raise $5,000 at the CN Tower Climb for the United Way. York University's 2015 campaign goal is $220,000. It's not a race and climbers can go at their own pace; some like to challenge themselves, others take a more leisurely approach. For those looking for a bit of friendly competition, they can set up sub-teams after registering. For more information, visit the CN Tower Climb for the United Way website.
