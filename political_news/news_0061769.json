Bernie Sanders received 29 percent support. Vice President Joe Biden, who is still weighing a presidential bid , received 18 percent support. One percent of Democratic voters picked former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Harvard professor Larry Lessig each received less than 1 percent support. \nSanders was the only candidate to see a significant change in his support, which is up five points since mid-September. Clinton didn't see a significant change despite the fact that more than six in 10 Democrats who watched the debate said she did the best job (just 35 percent said the same of Sanders). \n\nPlay Video Saturday Democratic debates: Rumors of a Joe Biden run resurface Hillary Clintonâ€™s solid performance in the Democratic debate appears to have given her a boost in New Hampshire, a key primary state. New polls s... \nThat might be the case because Democrats who watched the debate were more likely to view Sanders and Biden favorably. While Sanders is viewed favorably by 62 percent of Democrats, among Democrats who watched the debate, that number jumped to 84 percent. Biden is popular among 76 percent of all Democrats but scored 89 percent in favorability among debate watchers. Clinton's support is roughly the same in both groups. \nSixty-one percent of those who watched the debate say Biden should stay out of the 2016 presidential race. Eighty-four percent of Democrats who watched the debate say they are satisfied with the options they have for their nominee. Among Democrats who didn't watch the debate, 64 percent are satisfied with their options.\nSupport for a Biden presidential bid is dropping among Democrats. In August, more than half of registered Democrats (53 percent) wanted him to jump in; now that number stands at 47 percent. If he decides not to run, more of his support goes to Clinton, who would have a 23-point lead over Sanders.\nClinton continues to be the candidate Democrats say is best prepared to handle the economy, health care, foreign policy, race relations, climate change, gun policy and even income inequality, though her lead is small (43 percent say Clinton is best able to handle it, and 38 percent say Sanders).\nThe next Democratic debate will be hosted by CBS News, on Nov. 14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:22:14.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
