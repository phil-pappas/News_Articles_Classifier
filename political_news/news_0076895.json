What's going on?\nAnger over tax credits The House of Commons has already given its backing to tax credit cuts, despite bitter opposition from Labour, the SNP and some Conservative MPs.\nDavid Cameron says the cuts are part of a grander plan to boost wages and take the low paid out of tax, but the IFS says millions of families will be left out of pocket.\nMr Cameron won the day in the Commons, where he has a slender majority.\nImage caption The government does not have a majority in the House of Lords But he is far short of a majority in the House of Lords - the Upper House has plenty of Liberal Democrat peers who feel strongly that the cuts are unfair and would, no doubt, enjoy giving their former coalition partners a bloody nose.\nThey can band together with Labour peers and members of other parties, and the non-party cross bench peers to inflict a damaging defeat on the government, derailing one of Chancellor George Osborne's flagship polices.\nConstitution wars Mr Cameron is the first Conservative prime minister to have faced such a challenge. All his predecessors have had majorities in both Houses.\nIt should not really be much of a problem - the House of Lords is not traditionally supposed to block financial legislation that has the backing of MPs.\nThis principle was established in 1911 during the constitutional gridlock that followed a decision by peers to block the Liberal Party's \"people's budget\".\nBut nothing is ever cut and dried in Britain's fluid, unwritten constitution. And both sides are angrily trading precedents and claiming that their opponents are overstepping the mark. If they could only agree where the mark is.\nImage copyright PA Image caption The Lords does not traditionally block financial legislation approved by the Commons \"The House of Lords is trying to grab a new power from the House of Commons over financial matters. This is an unprecedented challenge to the authority of the House of Commons,\" a Conservative source told the BBC's James Landale.\nLabour has accused Conservative peers of passing an amendment in 2008 that would make their current attempts to pass a financial measure - the tax credit cut - through secondary legislation a non-starter.\nThe amendment meant Labour could only raise the National Insurance upper threshold through primary legislation, the party says.\nFlooding the Lords with Tory peers David Cameron has apparently threatened to appoint dozens of new Conservative peers to ensure he gets his way in future.\nHis official spokesman has refused to rule out such a move, although the fact that he would need to recruit 150 or more suggests it is not too plausible.\nTory backbencher and keen constitutional student Jacob Rees-Mogg says he would back a plan to flood the House with Tory peers, arguing that it would bring the Lords into \"disrepute\" with the public, triggering reforms.\nImage caption Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg says MPs should have the final say on financial matters He insists the convention that elected politicians have the final say over financial matters dates back to the 15th Century.\nLib Dem chief whip Lord Newby, whose party is attempting to block the tax credit cuts with a so-called \"fatal motion\" has accused Mr Cameron of behaving like a \"school bully\" and riding roughshod over the appointed House of Lords.\nBut he is also keen on the idea of a constitutional crisis. He told the BBC's Daily Politics that if the PM followed through on his threats it \"would produce the kind of reform for which we have been arguing for decades\".\nBack from the brink The prime minister has repeatedly stressed he has no appetite for Lords reform, but has warned: \"This house (Commons) has voted twice in favour of tax credits... the Lords should listen to that carefully\".\nThe House of Lords is already the world's largest legislative body - there are not enough seats in the chamber for the 826 peers entitled to sit there.\nAll the signs are that peers will back a motion by Labour peer Baroness Hollis to delay the tax credit cuts until ministers set out how they would mitigate their impact over the next three years.\nIf they opt instead to go for the nuclear option and back a Lib Dem \"fatal motion\" that would kill off the tax credit cuts, we could be looking at a constitutional crisis, says the BBC's Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy in his blog.\nBut even if peers pull back from the brink on tax credits, the war may not be over.\nFurther Lords v Commons battles On Tuesday, Mr Cameron faces two more attempts to strike down regulations proposed by the government - and both may well succeed.\nLib Dem Lord Tyler is targeting a change in electoral registration rules and his party colleague, Lady Hamwee, takes on ministers over benefits for asylum seekers.\nLabour are fired up about the electoral registration issues, and have just had a weekend of action aimed at signing up new voters.\nThey fear the change will remove 1.9 million people from the electoral register in time for next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Mayor of London.\nLord Tyler says there can be no constitutional quibble about the motion he has tabled on Tuesday, and that Conservatives have \"prayed to annul\" similar Statutory Instruments, as such rule changes are known, in past Parliaments. And then watch out for amendments to the EU Referendum Bill which could allow 16 and 17-year-olds a referendum vote in England and Wales.\nThis constitutional battle is set to run and run.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33463864", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4508/production/_86327671_gettyimages-495527485-1.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F926/production/_86328736_026376421-1.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34614462", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16C1C/production/_86321239_86317792.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34599183", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14746/production/_86328738_026389350-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:05:18.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
