Boehner, the speaker of the House, at the Capitol on Friday. He reassured Republicans he would remain speaker until a new one is found. Credit Zach Gibson/The New York Times With House Republicans in turmoil and party leaders fearing that the disarray could spill into the 2016 presidential and congressional campaigns, the push for Mr. Ryan to run for speaker was taking on more urgency. But despite the many entreaties, the House adjourned for a weeklong recess on Friday, and Mr. Ryan left his suitors wanting, returning to his family and advisers in Janesville, Wis., to discuss his future, and, he said, to watch the Packers game on Sunday. The biggest influence on his decision is expected to come from his wife, Janna, who worked as a lawyer and lobbyist in Washington before moving to her husband’s hometown to raise their children, who are in school there. Party elders, conservative leaders and Republican colleagues have been pressuring Mr. Ryan, 45, who was Mr. Romney’s vice-presidential running mate in 2012, saying he should run for the good of the country, to rescue the institution of Congress and to protect the political interests of Republicans over all. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “There’s really only one choice: Paul Ryan is the guy to bring us together,” said Mr. Upton, of Michigan, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and a friend of Mr. Ryan’s, who said he had corralled him on the House floor. Mr. Romney, in a statement, appealed to Mr. Ryan’s sense of duty. “I wouldn’t presume to tell Paul what to do, but I do know that he is a man of ideas who is driven to see them applied for the public good,” Mr. Romney said. “Every politician tries to convince people that they are that kind of leader; almost none are — Paul is.” But even as Mr. Ryan was said to be reconsidering, his close associates cautioned that he had no intention of fighting for the job and would most likely accept it only by acclimation — including the support of the hard-line conservatives who pressed to oust Mr. Boehner and helped drive the majority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, out of the speaker’s race on Thursday. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:37:59.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
