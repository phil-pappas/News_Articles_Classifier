Rather, it should be viewed as an integrated approach, from moving vulnerable power systems from basement or sub-basement areas to creating backup power systems that can continue to maintain critical technologies.\n\"Trying to create a response from a clean sheet of paper on the eve of a storm is not an effective strategy,\" offered Mr. Occhipinti. \"It should be part of long-term comprehensive planning. For example, generators need to be maintained and tested on a regular basis. The entire building in question should be periodically taken off the utility's grid and reviewed for how the backup system responds to that challenge.\"\nHe also reminds that new municipal codes are requiring building owners to make unprecedented investments. \"For example, in the wake of Sandy, building owners are now required to install electrical service a minimum four feet above the highest tide recorded for that area.\"\nStanding up to Sandy\nIn the aftermath of that savage 2012 storm Adco was subcontracted by Consolidated Edison to disconnect damaged residential and commercial buildings from the power grid so electricity could be restored to unaffected areas of Staten Island and Brooklyn.\nGiven the urgency of the task, Adco placed 150 union electricians at various sites to help restore power to those two battered boroughs. The firm essentially went on emergency footing to support the far larger issues facing millions of New Yorkers.\nAdco employees worked round-the-clock to repair electrical outages in Manhattan , Brooklyn , Queens and Staten Island . In many cases, Adco provided generators for critical business operations to ensure essential operations in New York City could continue. Specifically, Adco loaned generators to a number of Staten Island businesses including a donated generator to power up the Staten Island Command Post, which was managed by the Staten Island Borough President.\nAdco also made its own office space available to Tishman employees for the purpose of enhancing the recovery effort.\nAfter nearly forty years of company growth in the most challenging market in the United States , Adco now employs some 700 people working on behalf of Fortune 500 clients and sectors that range from the financial and legal communities to hospitals and universities.\nAdco is certified as a woman owned business enterprise by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , City of New York, New York School Construction Authority and WBENC.\nAdco Electrical Corp.\n201 Edward Curry Ave\nStaten Island, NY 10314\n(718) 494-4400\nwww.adcoonline.com\n releases/a-wandering-hurricane-joaquin-prompts-adco-electrical-to-pre-position-response-teams-to-address-vulnerable-manhattan-business-infrastructure-300153374.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY18475&Transmission_Id=201510021042PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY18475&DateId=20151002", "http://www.adcoonline.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/a-wandering-hurricane-joaquin-prompts-adco-electrical-to-pre-position-response-teams-to-address-vulnerable-manhattan-business-infrastructure-300153374.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:16:59.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
