Single page Share This Article As Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams and the County Council head into 2016 budget talks, their cultural facilities advisory committee is suggesting they invest $5.4 million into 10 capital projects. Another $225,000 was recommended for consultant studies. There's no guarantee the proposals will get the money as they compete against other projects in the county's $1 billion-plus budget. But at least they have a shot. \"We work very hard not to raise expectations too high related to this funding,\" said county Community Services Director Erin Litvack. Three projects received the bulk of the funding recommended by the advisory committee, said member Lee Dever, a retired 3rd District judge.

But before the county invests more money in the project, the committee said the Cultural Celebration Center has to raise matching funds. About $250,000 was cut from the Cultural Celebration Center's request because it involved funding for maintenance and security. The panel did not believe that request fit into its mandate to boost arts and culture, said committee member Max Chang. Another amphitheater-improvement project, Murray City's request to upgrade its facility in Murray Park, was recommended for almost $1.3 million. \"It's well used, especially during the summer and a great asset to the public,\" Chang said. The third significant expenditure would involve the Centro Civico Mexicano center in Salt Lake City. The committee recommended the county put $855,000 into a project to design, build and develop the arts and cultural components of the facility's new mixed-use center. Centro Civico had requested almost $1.3 million. Also suggested for funding were: • Kingsbury Hall, $218,000, to install a digital video and sound system, and another $12,700 to help the facility comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act; • Utah Museum of Natural History, $133,000, to install shade-providing features on the building's outdoor terraces and improve acoustics; • Discovery Gateway, $86,500, to renovate its waterplay exhibit; • Utah Museum of Fine Arts, $42,500, to upgrade projection, sound, lighting and recording equipment in Dumke auditorium; • Cottonwood Heights Arts Council, $30,000, to improve the sound system in the Butler Middle School auditorium; and • Salt Lake Acting Co., $24,000, to renovate the concessions area and the \"green room\" where actors wait while not on stage. The committee rejected funding requests from The Leonardo, Red Butte Garden, The Madeleine Choir School and Loveland Living Planet Aquarium because they did not meet cultural-enhancement criteria, Chang said. The recommended consulting studies would look at improvements to an outdoor stage in Midvale, a building purchased by Salt Lake Choral Artists and the West Jordan Cultural Arts Facility, plus a feasibility study of creating an arts hub in South Salt Lake.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:58:04.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
