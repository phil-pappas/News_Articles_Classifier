Andrew Meares Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The federal government will move swiftly to hold a pre-Christmas byelection in the seat of North Sydney following the expected resignation this week of former treasurer Joe Hockey.\nMr Hockey, who was elected in 1996, lost his job when Tony Abbott was ousted a month ago and will give his valedictory speech to Parliament on Wednesday.\nUpon his resignation, he will be appointed as Australia's ambassador to the United States, replacing former Labor leader Kim Beazley. Trade Department official Jan Adams, who did much of the heavy lifting on the China-Australia free trade agreement, is expected to be sent to Beijing. Australia's ambassador to China, Frances Adamson, is coming home early to join the office of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull as foreign policy adviser.\nMr Hockey's seat of North Sydney is a safe Liberal seats that stretches from Hunters Hill to Willoughby. The seat was held by independent Ted Mack between 1990 and 1996. At the the 2013 election, Mr Hockey won it by 66 per cent to 34 per cent on a two-party preferred basis.\nWhile the Liberals expect to hold the seat, it has a high proportion of Greens voters and the byelection will be the first real test of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership.\nEnormous distraction A byelection in the new year would be an enormous distraction for the government which is busily trying to prepare a policy agenda on tax reforms and other areas to take to an election in 2016.\nManager of Government Business Christopher Pyne indicated on Monday the government was keen to get the byelection out of the way before the new year, saying the voters in North Sydney should \"be without a member for as short a time as possible\".\n \"A byelection requires 33 days' notice from the Electoral Commission ... so there is technically time to have a byelection before Christmas,\" he told Sky News.\nAs The Australian Financial Review reported last month, Labor is unsure if it will run a candidate in North Sydney. If it does run, it will not spend much money, given a federal election is approaching and resources are needed elsewhere.\nMr Pyne confirmed that Mr Hockey had been offered a chance to stay in the ministry but he declined.Mr Hockey had initially sought the Defence portfolio but decided he'd had enough and wanted out.\nMr Beazley is due home from Washington by Christmas.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:02:29.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
