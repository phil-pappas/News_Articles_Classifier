Presidents have signed the bipartisan bill into law annually for more than 50 years.\nThe move will force Congress to revise the bill or try to settle a larger budget dispute that led Obama to veto it.\nThe bill would increase defense spending by adding $38 billion to a separate war-fighting account.
