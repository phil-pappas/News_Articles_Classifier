King received a $385,490 grant to construct a new manure storage facility and other improvements on a dairy operation where there is uncontrolled manure runoff from the existing concrete cattle lot. Also, there is currently no manure storage capacity, which results in manure spreading during winter and other times of the year when the soil is relatively impervious. All of these conditions currently cause manure and the nutrients it contains to run off into Octoraro Creek and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-governor-wolf-announces-517-million-investment-in-water-infrastructure-projects-in-8-counties-300164090.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC35041&Transmission_Id=201510211520PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC35041&DateId=20151021", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pennsylvania-governor-wolf-announces-517-million-investment-in-water-infrastructure-projects-in-8-counties-300164090.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.pennvest.state.pa.us/pennvest/site/default.asp"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:39:28.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
