The gathering is an important stop for presidential candidates seeking support in the early caucus state. \nThe former president will be joined by pop star Katy Perry , who endorsed Clinton earlier this year. \nAfter largely staying off his wife's campaign, Clinton has taken a more active role recently. He's begun raising money for her bid at events across the country. With the highest favorability of any living president, Bill Clinton is considered one of his party's most effective messengers.
