More Tribunal throws out MPs’ spies complaint \nHis comments at a parliamentary debate on Tuesday, made in a personal capacity rather than on behalf of the bank, will be viewed as a boost to the “out” campaign as arguments on both sides of the referendum debate gather momentum. \nStuart Rose, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer, is spearheading the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign launched earlier this week, backed by business heavyweights including Virgin boss Richard Branson. \nBut Lord Blackwell, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher and John Major, said: “I don’t agree that remaining in the European Union without a significant change in the current arrangements is ultimately sustainable from a political and constitutional perspective.” \nHe said the continued drive towards political and economic union among eurozone members, while necessary for the euro to survive, means the current position of the UK “may become increasingly unsustainable”. \n“We are not and never will be part of the eurozone, so the reality is that we cannot be at the heart of a European Union that becomes increasingly focused on the governance and political decision-making of an integrated eurozone core,” he added. \nLord Blackwell conceded that it would be “simplest” to stay in the single market if the City of London’s global competitiveness can be protected from “unwelcome regulation”. \n“However, whatever the nature of our relationship that emerges, it is clearly in the interests of both UK and European business to maintain a trade arrangement,” he said. \n“There are voices on both sides of that argument, but in the end our global competitiveness in the fast-growing markets outside the European Union must be a primary concern.” \nLord Lawson of Blaby, the former Conservative chancellor, said in the hearing that “the time has come to rediscover out national self-confidence”. \n“The regulatory burden imposed by membership of the European Union in the case of the United Kingdom has been calculated to cost something like £25 billion a year,” he said. \nHe urged Britain to “abandon a political project that we do not share,” and instead “embrace a global future”.
