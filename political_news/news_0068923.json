(‘Sustainable Development Goals’, United Nations, 2015, https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/topics ). \nNeoliberalism, which began in the late 1970s, permitted exploitation eventually resulting in large inequalities in the West which could not compete with States such as China and India able to exploit a vast workforce. \nCompetitive advantage between States was determined by the capacity to exploit rather than creativity with the West the major loser. \nThe adoption of neoliberal absolutism (presently hidden from the public) on 10 December 2008 (see Anthony Ravlich Google+) aims to create liberal totalitarian societies (see below) demanding top-down compliance with virtually no room for freedom and creativity. \nNeoliberal absolutism also permitted exploitation but this time under international law which portends a global slave economy. \nCorporations and investors realizing that exploitation would not be prohibited meant Corporations could relocate to States with the cheapest labour while investors saw greater opportunities in countries other than the West. \nIt is not surprising that the global financial crisis occurred in the same year neoliberal absolutism was adopted. The epicenter of the crisis was the European Union. \nMy forthcoming book (I have had a major set back but I am confident it can be overcome) will show that both neoliberalism and neoliberal absolutism are permitted by the existence of a UN ‘hidden’ collectivist agenda (also see Anthony Ravlich Google+) i.e. although in the Universal Declaration international law omits the right to individual self-determination, property (including intellectual property) rights, duties to the community as well as the core minimum obligations with respect to economic, social and cultural rights (the latter means no protection for the welfare State and no socio-economic ‘bottom-line’ thereby allowing exploitation and the creation of underclasses). \nThis collectivist ideological agenda is a major violation of the Universal Declaration which the UN claims as its authority. In my view, the UN is responsible for a global crime against humanity. The real purpose of the collectivist agenda, in my view, is to create liberal totalitarian societies in preparation for a one world government. \nThe UN’s ‘hidden’ collectivist agenda is, in my view, largely responsible for the creation of liberal collectivists who drive the agenda and who hope to preside over a one world government. The liberal collectivists, consisting of many academics and bureaucrats, are dominant in many States although largely in the shadows of the Corporations who also follow the collectivist agenda. Their political representatives are often called left neoliberals. \nI consider the liberal collectivists e.g. Helen Clark from New Zealand who is seen by many as a future UN Secretary-General, also dominate the UN, and the EU bureaucracy as well as the East Asia community, which includes Australia and New Zealand, which is forming. \nI regard the liberal collectivists, who often find common cause with repressive States, as the major enemy of human rights in the world as well as those States in the UN General Assembly who allowed the omissions in the first place most likely to protect their dominance without threats from seekers of truth and dissenters. \nThe liberal collectivists promote a liberal totalitarianism which kills by omitting human rights subjecting enormous numbers to gross neglect and many with lives, their potential crushed, barely worth living. I consider it is no less an effective form of control than authoritarian States which kill using direct violence. \nIn my view, such a major redistribution of the wealth is not only likely to impoverish many in the West but also aims to culturally cleanse society of individual self-determination e.g. seeking of truth, hopes and dreams, which will make it virtually impossible to improve oneself or regain what has been taken. \nIn my view, because the West has been the major champions of individual freedoms this means a severe global decline in individual freedoms while also, with little creativity permitted, bringing the development of human knowledge to a standstill seriously jeopardizing the survival of humankind. \nThere is little doubt in my mind that Western culture will be decimated unless the West unites and fights back but war need not be a consequence if the ethical approach is adopted (see below). \nFurthermore, in my view, the collectivist agenda perversely aims to eliminate the universal truth upon which the declaration is based (and, in my personal opinion, it seeks to eliminate God’s Universal Truth and spirituality which I regard as a creative force i.e. personally, I consider the collectivist agenda and liberal totalitarianism as ‘evil’). \nIn my view, the ethical approach to human rights, development and globalization (see Anthony Ravlich Google+) should replace both neoliberalism and neoliberal absolutism. The ethical approach is firmly based on the Universal Declaration and would eliminate the UN’s ‘hidden’ collectivist agenda. \nIn my view, much of what has happened at the UN has been pursued with low cunning and gross deceit – it has been hidden from people behind a global iron curtain, with the global establishment complicit, and people in the West have not been given any choice in the matter e.g. many might consider that you can only help the poor when you can afford it - not when it results in your own country being divided between rich and poor. \nStates under the UN Charter have a duty to uphold the Universal Declaration but their failure to do so means the West would, in my view, be quite justified in boycotting the UN especially given that repressive States now appear to be in control of the human rights agenda (see Anthony Ravlich Google+). \nAlso people should be informed of the ethical approach, which has had some top support such as the Open Democracy Initiative of the White House, the US State Department and even the United Nations itself but only on the internet. \nIn my view, people need to be informed of the ethical approach in the mainstream media where it can reach the democratic majority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:47:01.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
