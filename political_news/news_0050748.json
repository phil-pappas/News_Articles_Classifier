Photo: Josh Robenstone\nShe said \"radicalisation\" can be more effectively countered if viewed as stemming from social disaffection, rather than in its worst manifestation as a national security threat.\nAdvertisement The Italian-Australian Senator Fierravanti-Wells, who has had a life-time of first-hand bi-cultural experience, said far more work needed to be done understanding the root causes of youth alienation, which can be acute among cultural minorities. This would allow policies to be targeted at its causes rather than its results.\nHer frank comments are derived from numerous closed-door consultations with some 160 Muslim leaders and smaller community groups across the country, in which it became apparent that the government's approach had backfired.\nSenator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells being sworn in as Parliamentary Secretary for Social Services in September 2013.

I wish more Muslim leaders would say that more often and mean it,\" he said during a multi-flagged media event at the Canberra headquarters of the Australian Federal Police.\n\"Everybody, including Muslim community leaders, needs to speak up clearly, because no matter what the grievance, violence against innocents must surely be a blasphemy against all religion.\"\nPrivately, security officials complained that such rhetoric has not helped in building trust and maintaining maximum intelligence flow from community leaders to police and other authorities.\nSenator Fierravanti-Wells said young people go \"off the rails\" for all kinds of reasons but when they do, it is the first person who speaks to them that can tempt them in a new direction, whether that involves drugs, gambling, or in some cases, membership of an organisation offering respect and potentially even the glamour of war.\nFollow us on Twitter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PoliticsFairfax"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:10:14.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
