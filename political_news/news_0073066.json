The conference is set for Oct. 27 to 29 at the Ritz-Carlton Pentagon City in Arlington, Virginia , with each day dedicated to a specific unmanned systems domain, maritime, air and ground.\nRecently, the Office of the Secretary of Defense released updated guidance for participation at conferences by military personnel. According to Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work , military-focused conferences and events are \"critical to our ability to share information and break down barriers that block innovation.\n\"Restrictions on conference participation and attendance by DOD personnel have become counterproductive, undermining the professional development for communities such as our science and technology, medical, and educational personnel, and making it more difficult for them to come together with others to promote the free exchange of ideas that drive creativity and innovation,\" Work said.\n\"Unmanned systems help protect warfighters by keeping them out of dangerous scenarios and providing mission-critical intelligence,\" Brian Wynne , president and CEO of AUVSI, said. \"Unmanned Systems Defense is an ideal opportunity for military personnel to learn about these rapidly proliferating technologies at a venue that is just minutes from the Pentagon.\"\nUnmanned Systems Defense will bring together industry, government program managers, decision makers and technology experts for information sharing and interaction, including panel discussions, in-depth presentations and extensive networking opportunities.\nThese are the keynote addresses scheduled for each day at Unmanned Systems Defense:\nMaritime Day, Tuesday, Oct. 27\nU.S. Rep.
