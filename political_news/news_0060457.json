Reeves Gains Support From Mississippi Pharmacists JACKSON – Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves today earned the endorsement from the Mississippi Pharmacists Association for his work to ease regulatory burdens. MPhA promotes relationships between pharmacists and other health care professionals. With more than 1,300 members statewide, the Mississippi Pharmacists Association supports all areas of pharmacy, including health-system, academia, chain, independent, technicians and students. “Tate Reeves recognizes the ability to provide responsive health care in rural Mississippi often begins with the pharmacist,” said Dr. Phil Ayers, President of MPhA. “Our pharmacists are working together to maximize improvements in post-discharge patient outcomes by ensuring the smooth and safe transition of patients from the hospital to the home. Tate recognizes this important role and is a strong advocate for rural health care in our state. We are proud to support his re-election.” Lt. Gov. Reeves has worked to ensure pharmacists have a fair regulatory environment and supported efforts to encourage health care professionals to practice in rural Mississippi. “The key to quality health care is quality providers in all areas of our state, and I support the good work pharmacists do to help treat Mississippians,” Lt. Gov. Reeves said. “I appreciate the support of pharmacists around Mississippi.” 10/15/15 Posted October 15, 2015 - 10:56 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
