(NCH) resigns from the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce. It should come as no surprise that a company whose primary purpose is to bring new business to Nevada and keep existing businesses alive, has decided to resign from the Chamber, who during the most recent legislative session, chose to actively endorse the largest new tax on businesses.\nIn the past 20 years, NCH has grown to be a powerhouse for business start-up solutions, offering resident agent services, mail forwarding, virtual offices, legal consulting, estate planning, tax and accounting preparation,and business and credit coaching. NCH has remained an active member of the Nevada Registered Agent Association, providing a voice for all resident agents in Nevada and actively pursuing initiatives to keep business costs down for new and existing companies in Nevada .\nCort Christie , founder of NCH, has worked toward increasing business ownership and building strong political alliances that will protect Nevada's business industry and help develop a prosperous market for everyone.\nLast year, the defeat of Question 3 set a precedence that Nevada is focused on growth; and additional business taxes were not welcome. Voters rejected the proposal four to one, showing strong support for the local economy. However, when a similar proposal was introduced this year, the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce chose not to support Nevada businesses. The Chamber worked in favor of the proposal which now requires businesses to pay higher corporate filing fees (which were already the 3rd highest in the nation), keep a separate set of books with a June 30th fiscal year end, adhere to a new commerce tax (gross receipts tax), and handle increased MBT taxes. Additionally, even if companies don't owe the new commerce tax, they now have to file a tax return to prove it.\nIn a letter written to the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, Cort Christie expressed the following, \"We believe in building long-term business relationships and we see the value in having a united association to do this. We have continued to maintain our participation and membership with the Chamber thus far; however, after the Chamber's stance during the most recent legislative session, we have now decided to resign. \"\nNCH markets and brands Nevada as \"America's Choice for Incorporation\" because it holds to their belief that Nevada is a great state for incorporation and business start-up. The Chamber's strong opposition of this message, has resulted in the resignation of a 21 year member, reminding us all that Nevada's economy requires unwavering support to make a full recovery from a devastating recession.\n releases/nevada-corporate-headquarters-inc-resigns-from-las-vegas-chamber-of-commerce-300154197.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY20035&Transmission_Id=201510051605PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY20035&DateId=20151005", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nevada-corporate-headquarters-inc-resigns-from-las-vegas-chamber-of-commerce-300154197.html", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:54:16.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
