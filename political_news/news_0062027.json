Bush on Ted Cruz: 'I just don't like the guy.' 1 / 26 Back to Gallery \nAt a private Denver fundraiser for presidential candidate Jeb Bush, brother George W. was reportedly mellow while talking about other Republicans in the race ... until he got to Ted Cruz. \n\"I just don't like the guy,\"Bush reportedly said of Cruz. \nAccording to Politico , former President Bush told the hundred donors at the Sunday evening gathering that Cruz could be his brother's most serious rival for the nomination. \nGeorge Bush also spoke out against Cruz's apparent alliance with Donald Trump, who stood with the senator at a Capitol Hill rally last month opposing the proposed nuclear agreement with Iran. \nOne donor at the Denver fundraiser, paraphrasing Bush, told Politico that Bush found it \"opportunistic that Cruz was sucking up to Trump and just expecting all of his support to come to him in the end.\" \nA spokesman for George Bush, however, said it's not true that he views Cruz as Jeb's biggest rival. \n\"The first words out of President Bush's mouth last night were that Jeb is going to earn the nomination, win the election and be a great president,\" spokesman Freddy Ford told Politico. \nIn a statement to Politico, the Cruz campaign said: \"It's no surprise that President Bush is supporting his brother and attacking the candidates he believes pose a threat to his campaign. I have no intention of reciprocating. I met my wife Heidi working on his campaign, and so I will always be grateful to him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:24:01.615+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
