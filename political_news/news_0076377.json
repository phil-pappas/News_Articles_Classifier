Former U.S. Senator Jim Webb of Virginia on Tuesday dropped his bid and said he would explore an independent run for the White House.\nOn Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden announced he would not seek the top job after months of indecision about whether to run. His announcement removed a potential hurdle for Democratic front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nA recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Chafee with support from less than 1 percent of respondents.\n(Reporting by Emily Stephenson ; Editing by Mohammad Zargham )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:51:21.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
