The cuts we have already made have been achieved by internal reshaping and the reduction of the workforce from 10,000in 2012 to 7,000 now through voluntary redundancy and reduction in the number of managers. It is anticipated that this will further reduce to 5,200 by 2018.\nIn 2017/18 and2018/19 we will need to save another £37 million. We can only make these savings by changing the way we deliver services and by reduce non-statutory services.\n– Cllr PatriciaBell, Cumbria County Council’s Deputy Leader Last updated Thu 22 Oct 2015 Read more 3 updates Cumbria County Council faces £17.5m funding cuts Politics Cumbria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:43:33.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
