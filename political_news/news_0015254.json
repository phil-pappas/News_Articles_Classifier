(Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool, File)\nAssociated Press Oct. 20, 2015 | 11:05 a.m. EDT + More BOSTON (AP) â€” A judge has ruled that a mother and boyfriend charged in the death of a 2-year-old girl whose body washed up on a Boston Harbor beach can have their own autopsy conducted on her remains.\nRachelle Bond and Michael McCarthy were charged last month. Bond's daughter, Bella, was known as \"Baby Doe\" for three months as authorities launched a massive investigation to find out who she was and how she died.\nMcCarthy is charged with murder, while Bond is charged with being an accessory after the fact. Both have pleaded not guilty. A judge approved the request for a separate autopsy during a court hearing Tuesday.\nThe girl's body was found in a trash bag on Deer Island. Bond claims McCarthy killed Bella, but McCarthy has denied it.\nA probable cause hearing is scheduled Nov. 19.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
