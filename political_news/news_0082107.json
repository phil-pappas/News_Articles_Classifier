The team aims to support and promote the sustainable pathways for marine energy research, development, and implementation in Indonesia through a series of capacity building programmes and has established a strategic partnership with Orkney-based company Aquatera Ltd to deliver the aims. The Centre for Understanding Sustainable Practice (CUSP) at RGU, led by Dr Alan Owen, and Aquatera, led by Dr Gareth Davies, last week welcomed representatives from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) of the Republic of Indonesia, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya (ITS), the Indonesian Counterpart for Energy and Environmental Solutions (ICEES) and the Indonesian Ocean Energy Association (INOCEAN), as well as various experts from across Scotland who provided their insight into the Scottish energy situation. Starting in Edinburgh, the Indonesian delegation gave an overview of the current status of marine energy in the country and highlighted their priorities in developing the sector, while discussions were facilitated with stakeholders and representatives from a range of Scottish bodies that have been responsible for developing marine energy policies as well a number of companies who have already developed marine energy technologies. The delegation then travelled to Orkney, home of the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), a marine energy centre of excellence, where they were given a thorough understanding of how the islands had established their expertise in the field. They visited the harbour facilities at Hatston Pier and discussed the socio-economic effects that marine energy has brought to the islands with the International Centre for Island Technology (ICIT). Dr Owen said: “CUSP has been working closely with a number of agencies in Indonesia to help develop a pathway to creating a viable marine energy in the country so we were delighted to welcome this delegation in Scotland. “I know that they have taken a lot away from hearing of the various experiences of developing a marine renewable energy industry in Scotland and that it will help to inform the growth of renewable energy in Indonesia.” Ms Maritje, of ESDM said “Indonesia as an archipelago has good potential for marine energy sources. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of Republic of Indonesia is eager to tap this potential and the visit to Scotland is part of our efforts to realize the implementation of marine energy projects in Indonesia. During the visit we received a lot of information and opportunities to see marine energy technology and supporting facilities. We are looking very carefully at running a pilot project on tidal current in Indonesia.” Dr Davies, said “It is clear that there is a lot of common interest in marine energy between Indonesia and the UK and furthermore it is clear that the experience of developing marine energy projects in small island communities such as Orkney can provide other island based projects with a fast track pathway to success.' CUSP was recently awarded £183,000 from two UK Government funds to be used to help build up the Indonesia’s science and innovation capacity, as well as accelerating the implementation of marine energy in more remote areas, such as Aceh and Lombok.
