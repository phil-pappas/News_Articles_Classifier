Opponents successfully circulated a referral petition to suspend it from taking effect until voters can decide its fate in the 2016 general election. The referendum put on hold the timetable changes that were meant to provide more time for challenges of candidates’ petitions. It also stalled various other changes that some thought good and some thought bad, such as repeal of the registered-mail allowance for submitting petitions and imposing stiffer requirements for candidates to withdraw in time to be replaced on the ballot. The referral also affected at least one provision in SB 67 , another package of election-law changes passed in the 2015 session but without controversy. Now that provision in SB 67 will need to be changed in the 2016 session and will need to be done under an emergency provision that requires two-thirds majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives so it can take effect immediately upon the governor signing it into law. The state Board of Elections gave its support earlier this week to the change that Secretary of State Shantel Krebs will seek come January when the Legislature convenes. \nHere’s what that’s all about. SB 69 sought in part to change the petition period for political party candidates seeking nomination for state and county offices in a primary election; the timetable sets when candidates can gather signatures on their candidacy petitions and submit them. The schedule has been Jan. 1 through the last Tuesday of March in the year of the primary election. That remains in effect for 2016 because of the referral of SB 69. The legislation would change that period to Dec. 1 of the year preceding the primary election through the first Tuesday of March. SB 67 meanwhile set a deadline of the third Tuesday in March to challenge a primary candidate’s petition in circuit court. \nSB 67 also added these requirements regarding a challenge: This action takes precedence over other cases in circuit court. Any party appealing the circuit court order to the Supreme Court shall file a notice of appeal within ten days of the date of the notice of the entry of the circuit court order. Secretary of State Krebs and the Board of Elections decided they would seek repeal of the challenge deadline, because it would fall before the petition deadline of the last Tuesday in March that remains in effect while the referendum runs its court. The board however endorsed keeping the rest of the language upon suggestion from board member Drew Duncan of Sioux Falls, a Republican. \nAll of this goes back to the challenge of signatures filed by Annette Bosworth, a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, that was attempted in spring 2014 by blogger Cory Heidelberger, a Democrat now living at Aberdeen, and then-legislator Steve Hickey, a Republican from Sioux Falls who has since resigned from his seat in the state House of Representatives. Time ran too short for the Heidelberger-Hickey challenge to be completed by Circuit Judge Mark Barnett before the deadline for county auditors to prepare their primary ballots. The goal of Krebs’ changes to the petition timetable in SB 69 was to provide a longer opportunity for such challenges. Instead, the referral of SB 69 — which Heidelberger led because he and other Democrats opposed other changes in SB 69 — means the tight window for challenges will remain in place for the 2016 primary elections. \nAltogether Krebs and the Board of Elections put their stamp on a package of 18 sets of proposed changes to be considered in the 2016 legislative session. This marks the second consecutive year that Krebs, a Republican, has worked cooperatively with the state board since she won the 2014 election. Her predecessor, Republican Jason Gant, didn’t treat the board with the same respect and tended to unilaterally proceed with his own elections legislation. Krebs seems intent on rebuilding the relationship that existed between the board and secretaries of state prior to 2011.
