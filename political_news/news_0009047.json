But I think that's unlikely. Not impossible but unlikely.\"\nMurphy bristled at national polls that he argued pointlessly dictates media coverage of the presidential race.\n\"I often joke that if I ever had the horrible, malicious job of being Head of the PRC's Intelligence Service and they said, \"All right, here's $20 billion, screw around with the U.S,\" one of the first things I'd go do is bribe media pollsters,\" he said. \"Because you totally control the thinking of the D.C. press corps based on polls.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-10-20/mike-murphy-of-right-to-rise-explains-his-theory-that-jeb-bush-is-still-the-candidate-to-beat", "https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:39:58.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
