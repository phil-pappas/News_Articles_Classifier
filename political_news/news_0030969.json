Portland City Council approves housing emergency \nWheeler says increasing tax-increment financing to 50 percent would help get more affordable units built. And he also says it’s time to rehab some of the city’s older, vacant buildings. He says homelessness is a complex issue, that includes a crisis in mental health care and addiction treatment. \nHe added that there are fewer shelter beds today in Portland than there were in 2008. Close to 1,800 people sleep unsheltered on Portland streets every night. \nWheeler also says he believes that a local gas tax should pay for street maintenance and safety improvements, instead of trying to revamp the failed street-fee proposal put forth by City Hall last year,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:47:24.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
