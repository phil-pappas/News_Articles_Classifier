However it is no longer proportionate to commit officers to a permanent presence.\" \nThe force said it had discussed its decision with Britain's Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. \n\"Like all public services, MPS resources are finite. With so many different criminal, and other, threats to the city it protects, the current deployment of officers is no longer believed proportionate.\" \nSome charges dropped \nIn August, prosecutors announced they were dropping allegations involving sexual molestation and coercion as statutes of limitations in the investigation were running out. Assange can still be investigated on suspicion of rape until 2020, they said. \nIn May, the Swedish Supreme Court denied Assange's latest appeal to dismiss an arrest warrant over the allegations. \nProsecutors have agreed to look into conducting interviews in London to move the investigation forward, but the court sees \"no reason\" to lift the arrest warrant, the Supreme Court said then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:18:02.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
