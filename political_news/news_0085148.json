Duncan issued a statement Thursday expressing support for Umpqua Community College and the city of Roseburg. (Andrew Harnik /Associated Press) \nU.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, whose office threatened on Wednesday it might cut off federal financial aid to Umpqua Community College , called out his support for the college and the city of Roseburg Thursday. \nDouglas County officials have confirmed their were multiple deaths and more injuries after a 20-year-old man went on a shooting rampage at the quiet rural campus Thursday morning. \nDuncan's statement reads: Tonight, my thoughts are with the students and families at Umpqua Community College. We have lost bright students and dedicated educators to gun violence in more than 30 school shootings this year alone -- an unconscionable reality of American life. We must do more to keep our students and communities safe, and I pledge the full support of my Department to the Roseburg community during this heartbreaking time.\" \nThe U.S. Department of Education looks out for students by checking to see if there are colleges whose students default on their loans at high rates. That could suggest the school is charging students too much and offering them weak educational offerings that don't lead to good-paying jobs. Umpqua is among a list of colleges whose high student loan default rates put them on a warning list the department issued Wednesday. \n-- Betsy Hammond", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:31:57.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
