The rates will adjust based on conjestion and are aimed at keeping traffic flowing smoothly.\n\"The approved toll rates are priced to ensure reliable travel times and manage congestion in the Express Lanes,\" HPTE board chair Tim Gagen said.\nDrivers who use a state-approved electronic\nAdvertisement ExpressToll pass get a break on prices, officials said.\nFor instance, the price range a driver using a toll pass on I-70 will vary from $3 to $30. A driver without a toll pass could see a bill as high as $40, because of processing fees. The lane, which will not give credit for high-occupancy vehicles , will open by the end of the year.\n\"The message here is that you should get an ExpressToll,\" said Megan Castle, spokeswoman for the enterprise.\nExpressToll accounts cost $35 to open, then a $15 fee for the pass is deducted, leaving $20 in pre-paid tolls.\nThe board also approved the toll rates for the second phase of the U.S. 36 Express Lanes project — from Louisville/Superior to Table Mesa — which opens in early 2016.\nA separate set of toll rates were set for special events that generate significant traffic along U.S 36. When implemented, drivers with an ExpressToll pass could be charged up to 60 cents more on CU home football games at the westbound McCaslin toll point. Drivers could see a toll charge of up to 50 cents for Saturday events at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield at the westbound Sheridan toll point and the westbound Church Ranch toll point. Drivers without a toll pass would be charged $1.50.\nThe special event rates will not affect high-occupancy vehicle drivers using a switchable transponder.\nDuring the morning peak period — 7:15 a.m. - 8:15 a.m. — from Table Mesa to downtown Denver, motorists with a pass will be charged $8.75. Without a pass, a surcharge is applied, and the cost increases to $16.33.\nMonte Whaley: 720-929-0907, mwhaley@denverpost.com or @montewhaley", "external_links": ["https://www.expresstoll.com/Pages/Express-Lanes-and-HOV.aspx", "https://www.codot.gov/programs/expresslanes/proposed-toll-rates/us-36-express-lanes/us-36-tolling-fact-sheet", "https://www.codot.gov/programs/high-performance-transportation-enterprise-hpte/agenda-item-documents/186-cover-letter-toll-schedules.pdf", "https://www.codot.gov/projects/I70mtnppsl", "https://www.codot.gov/programs/high-performance-transportation-enterprise-hpte", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1014/20151014__I70chart~p1_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:10:07.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
