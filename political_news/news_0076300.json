Sources at the university have confirmed that the board will pick interim UW President Ana Mari Cauce.\nCauce has been with the university since 1986 and was selected as interim president in March after Michael Young left the post. Young was president for four-years before moving on to Texas A&M University.\nDan Evans, former Washington governor and UW regent with a long history of supporting the university, said he doesn't know if the regents plan to announce Cauce as president but he's all for it if they do.\n\"I have a great admiration for Ana Mari. I wince when I hear her introduced as interim president. She doesn't act like it's an interim position. She, from the very first day she took office, has acted as president and really moved the university forward showing great leadership, and I think she is very well respected by the faculty and the legislature,\" Evans said.\nEvans brought up the fact that the UW has seen a pretty fast turnover of presidents and that's not great for a university.\n\"It takes time to exert leadership and unfortunately we've had a succession of presidents who haven't stayed very long,\" he said. \"They just get acquainted, and then they are gone. ... I don't think that will be the case with Ana. She has the opportunity to provide leadership for many years.\"\nEvans emphasized the importance of the university's relationship with the state's Legislature and that he believes Cauce's standing with the leadership in Olympia is solid.\n\"I think we have an opportunity for a president who comes with good, important external connections,\" he said.\nUniversity officials would not confirm the purpose of the regent meeting nor the selection of president.\nFrom the UW's bio of Cauce :\nDuring the course of her career at UW, Cauce has been appointed to various leadership positions including director of the UW Honors Program, chair of American Ethnic Studies, chair of Psychology, executive vice provost, and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 2011, Cauce was named provost and executive vice president, responsible for overseeing the education, research, and service missions of the university's schools, colleges and other academic units.\nFor her teaching, scholarship and advocacy, Cauce has received numerous awards, including the Dalmas Taylor Distinguished Contribution Award, the Luis Fernando Esteban Public Service Award, the James M. Jones Lifetime Achievement Award of the American Psychological Association, the Grace Hopper Exemplary Leadership Award, and the Distinguished Contribution Award from the Society for Community Research and Action. In 1999, she was awarded the Distinguished Teaching Award, the highest honor the University of Washington gives to faculty members for their work with students in and outside the classroom.\nCauce is a professor of Psychology and American Ethnic Studies, with secondary appointments in the Department of Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies and the College of Education. She maintains an active research program, focusing on adolescent development, with a special emphasis on at-risk youth. She is also a strong advocate for women and underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Cauce remains active in the classroom and continues to teach and mentor undergraduate and graduate students.\nThis is a breaking news story.", "external_links": ["http://www.washington.edu/president/biography/", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Evans"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:04:48.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
