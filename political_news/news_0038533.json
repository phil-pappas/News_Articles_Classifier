In 2006, Thaksin filed a libel suit against Sondhi and Khunthong Lorseriwanit, publisher and editor of the Manager daily, for accusing him of hiring Cambodian shamans to carry out voodoo rites at Government House and at Bangkok's Erawan Shrine. The Criminal Court sentenced Sondhi to three years in jail over the libel charges, and gave Khunthong a two-year suspended sentence and Bt40,000 fine. Khunthong was also ordered to publicise the ruling in his newspaper for five consecutive days. Both defendants appealed, and in 2011 the Appeals Court sentenced Sondhi to a two-year suspended sentence, a Bt20,000 fine and an order to publicise the ruling for five days. Khunthong was acquitted. Sondhi and Thaksin then took the case to the Supreme Court, where the judge said yesterday that though Thaksin's beliefs were a personal matter, his actions as prime minister still affected the public's faith and the country's honour and dignity. The judge also pointed out that every citizen is a stakeholder and has the right to criticise the country's leader. The judge added that Thaksin had failed to testify in person against Sondhi's claims. Sondhi had alleged that Thaksin ordered Cambodian men to build a shrine at Government House. He also questioned Thaksin's presence at the initiation ceremony for the reconstructed Erawan Shrine after a man had vandalised it. Sondhi said that, as prime minister, Thaksin should have had nothing to do with the ceremony. He also asked why Thaksin had blocked others from attending this ceremony, and why he had carried out rites at the Emerald Buddha Temple and Phanom Rung Stone Castle - both of which are reserved for the Royal Family. The court acquitted Sondhi on grounds that his testimony was credible and that his intentions were honest. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Sondhi said he supported Privy Councillor Thanin Kraivichien's proposal that politicians who abuse their power be banned for life. Separately, the Supreme Court sentenced academic Pramote Nakhonthap to a two-year suspended sentence for defaming Thaksin by implicating him in the \"Finland Plot\". Thaksin and the now-defunct Thai Rak Thai Party sued Pramote, former Manager executive Saowalak Theeranuchanyong, editor Khunthong, Manager webmaster Panchapat Angsuwan and the Manager Media Group, for publishing a series of articles written by Pramote from May 17-25, 2006, under the title \"Finland Strategy: The Plan to change Thailand's Ruling System?\" In March 2009 the Criminal Court said the five-article series accused the plaintiffs of using policies to destroy the Thai bureaucratic system to establish a one-party system and to overthrow \"a high institution\". Pramote failed to present witnesses or show up in court to defend himself. The court ruled that the articles were not an honest expression of academic opinion and also charged Khunthong with failing in his duty as an editor. Pramote and Khunthong were sentenced to a year in prison and a Bt100,000 fine, but the court suspended the sentence for two years on grounds that Pramote is an academic and pro-democracy activist, while Khunthong is a journalist who has contributed greatly to the country. The court also said their action was aimed at protecting the revered institution. The court has ordered them to publish the verdict in five newspapers. The court also acquitted the other defendants. The two appealed, but the Appeals Court upheld the ruling on Pramote but acquitted Khunthong on April 5, 2013. Pramote then took the case to the highest court, where he also questioned the Thai Rak Thai representative's right to sue him as he was not the actual damaged party. The Supreme Court rejected his appeal and upheld the previous ruling. 862 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:11:22.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
