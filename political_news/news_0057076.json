We’ve got you covered. \nWhile earlier reports Tuesday made it seem like Ohio Republican and House Speaker John Boehner might have to keep his job until the end of the year, it looks like there could be a replacement after all. But that’s only if the major caucuses in the U.S. House unite behind Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc. \n“We as a conference should unify now,” Ryan told reporters late Tuesday. “What I told members is if you can agree to these requests and if I can truly be a unifying figure, then I will gladly serve, and if I am not unifying, that is fine as well — I will be happy to stay where I am.\" \nRyan said the caucuses have until Friday to support him. \n*** \nWorried about his family : Ryan, the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate, said of his family Tuesday night “I genuinely worry about the consequences that my agreeing to serve will have on them. Will they experience the viciousness and incivility that we all face here on a daily basis? But my greatest worry, my greatest worry is the consequence of not stepping up, of someday having my own kids ask me, `When the stakes were so high, why didn’t you do all you could do, why didn’t you stand and fight for my future?'\" \n*** \nOhio connection : Sure Paul isn’t from Ohio but he did attend Miami University in Oxford, which is in Boehner’s 8th Congressional district. He graduated in 1992 - a year after Boehner joined Congress -  majoring in economics and political science. \n*** \nWhat Jim Jordan said : Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Urbana, is chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of 40-something conservative hardliners. They met with Ryan on Tuesday but have not said if they will endorse him yet. “Jordan indicated afterward that his group still planned to vote for (Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida), but might be willing to accept Ryan,\" NPR reports. \n*** \nHappening today : Ohio Democrats U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Rep. Tim Ryan will will outline bicameral legislations aimed at increasing accountability and transparency in Ohio’s charter schools. Watch for updates at Dispatch.co m . \n*** \nSpeaking of charter schools : “The Ohio Board of Education refused on Tuesday to turn over internal communications requested by state Auditor Dave Yost about the Department of Education’s rigging of charter-school evaluations,” Dispatch reporter Catherine Candisky writes. “The board voted 10-3 against a resolution to immediately release the documents to Yost and directing state Superintendent Richard A. Ross and other staff members to cooperate with the auditor’s probe. Four board members abstained from voting.\" \n*** \nRight to Rise calls out John Kasich : The super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential bid is calling out Ohio Gov. John Kasich's campaign.  \n\" We're far more conservative than the Kasich people; they're doing stuff our lawyers would never allow, so but it's open to interpretation,\" Mike Murphy, head of Right to Rise, told Bloomberg's Sasha Issenberg. \" I don't want to get in too much details but the advertising that they're running is extremely overt for super-PAC advertising as far as Kasich participating and talking to a camera. That is a very aggressive interpretation.\" \nHe later went on to say about keeping the wall up between the super PAC and the campaign when it to social medai, \" No, you know, the Kasich lawyers down at Mulligan’s Bar might allow that, but we don’t. And I’m joking about the Kasich lawyers and alcohol — they’re litigious.\"\n***\nWhat they are talking about : Kasich filmed footage for TV ads running in New Hampshire before he officially declared his candidacy. That footage is now being used by his super PAC New Day for America but some have questioned it.\nRob Nichols, spokesman for Kasich’s official campaign, told Dispatch Public Affairs Editor Darrel Rowland recently, “As is always our practice, we’re careful to follow not just the letter of the law but the spirit of it also, and we work closely with our legal counsel to make sure we do. And, if anything is ever uncertain, we make sure to always err on the side of caution.”& amp; amp; lt; /p>\n*** \nA week from today : The GOP presidential candidates will face off for the third time in a debate hosted by CNBC in Boulder. Kasich is expected to participate. \n*** \nAnd on the Democratic side : Lots of chatter about a possible announcement today from Vice President Joe Biden about whether he will enter the 2016 presidential race. Of course, that chatter has been happening for a few weeks now so do with that information what you will. \n*** \nMary Taylor part 2 : In case the formation of nonprofit political organization called “Onward Ohio” wasn’t indication enough, Dispatch reporter Randy Ludlow writes Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor said Tuesday “I am seriously considering running for governor in 2018.\" \n*** \nIn Columbus politics : Columbus City Council President Andrew Ginther and Franklin County Sheriff Zach Scott faced off in the last major Columbus mayoral debate Tuesday night. \n“Columbus City Council President Andrew J. Ginther painted himself as the candidate with a plan to build a more prosperous city,” Dispatch reporter Rick Rouan. “Franklin County Sheriff Zach Scott assailed Ginther’s time on council, saying many of the city’s problems have come during his time as an elected official, and that Scott is the person to clean up City Hall.” \nIf you missed it, you can watch it on 10tv.com . \n*** \nBuckeye Lake update : “Boating could resume at Buckeye Lake in June under an expedited construction schedule that would allow for raising the water level to about five feet, Fairfield County Commissioner Dave Levacy said Tuesday,” Dispatch reporter Mary Beth Lane writes. “Officials from Gannett Fleming, the engineering firm chosen by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources to design the new dam, shared the plans with Levacy, who owns Buckeye Lake Marina, and other members of the Buckeye Lake Advisory Council at a meeting on Monday.” \nThe project to fix the Buckeye Lake dam is expected to cost the state $110 million. \n*** \nDayton Peace Accords : Those organizing events around the 20th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords hope that former President Bill Clinton will make a stop, Dayton Daily News reporter Thomas Gnau reports. \n“Those behind the local celebrations expect to hear definitively from Clinton’s representatives this week and perhaps in the next two days, said John McCance, one of the lead organizers,” Gnau writes. \nClinton will be in Columbus for a talk at Ohio State Nov. 19 and events are planned in Dayton from Nov. 18-21. \n*** \nOn this day: According to The Dispatch library, on this day in 2010, “Campaign finance reports show that the 2010 race for governor between Democrat Ted Strickland and Republican John Kasich will be the most expensive in state history. The two candidates so far have raised $34.5 million combined and spent $25.9 million, meaning they should easily shatter the $33 million that was spent by all candidates for governor four years ago. ” \n*** \nVoters Guide : Early voting has started in Ohio and you can see what will be on your ballot with The Dispatch's Voters Guide. \n*** \nGet the news in your inbox : Did you hear we have a Dispatch Politics email?
