Scott Walker Published On: Oct 05 2015 09:26:50 AM CDT Tweet WASHINGTON - \nThe Supreme Court won't hear an appeal from a former aide to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker who was convicted of campaigning on taxpayers' time. Related Content Legislators propose raising conviction cap to $1 million \nThe justices on Monday let stand a lower court ruling that said prosecutors did not violate Kelly Rindfleisch's constitutional rights when they searched her emails. \nRindfleisch pleaded guilty in 2012 to doing campaign work at her Milwaukee County government job. She was one of six people convicted following an investigation into Walker's former aides and associates when he served as Milwaukee County executive. Walker, who recently folded his Republican presidential campaign, wasn't charged. \nRindfleisch argued that the warrants for her emails were too broad and violated her constitutional right to be free of unreasonable searches. \nA state appeals court ruled 2-1 that the warrants were constitutional. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
