(AP Photo/John Locher)\nAssociated Press Oct. 25, 2015 | 5:05 p.m. EDT + More By JIM VERTUNO, AP Sports Writer\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” Lewis Hamilton seized on a late mistake by Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg to win the United States Grand Prix and secure his third Formula One season championship.\nHamilton overtook Rosberg with eight laps to go Sunday when Rosberg locked his tires and helplessly watched his teammate zoom past.\nHamilton had to beat Rosberg and outscore Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel by nine points to wrap up his second consecutive championship with Mercedes. He also won with McLaren in 2008.\nThe win also gives Hamilton his 21st victory over two seasons and 10th this year. He is the first Formula One driver to win 10 or more races in consecutive seasons.\nVettel, who could have pushed the title chase to next week in Mexico City, finished third after starting 13th.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
