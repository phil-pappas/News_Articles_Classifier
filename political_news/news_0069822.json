To remain in office beyond 2015, he must defeat two-term Councilwoman Ora Kornbluth, who seeks to become the town's first woman to hold the mayor's office.

In interviews this week, Schmelz and Kornbluth generally agreed on a number of topics, ranging from taxes and infrastructure maintenance to the fate of the Bergenfield Swim Club, which declared bankruptcy this year. Buy this photo \nThe greatest differences came in their approaches to the job. \nSchmelz, 52, an employee at Arrow Fasteners in Saddle Brook who prides himself on being one of the most publicly visible and accessible mayors ever to serve in Bergenfield, did not hold public office before he was elected in 2013 to fill the unexpired term of the late mayor Timothy Driscoll. \nKornbluth, 48, the business director at a yeshiva day school on Washington Avenue who said she tends to work \"under the radar\" and lead by example, served on the zoning and planning boards before she was elected to the Borough Council in 2010. She has a financial background and works most Sundays during football season as a game statistician for broadcasts of the National Football League. \nSchmelz said that his primary role as mayor has been to bring residents' concerns before the council and, as the sole Republican, to act as \"the eye of the people.\" Even though the mayor in Bergenfield's political system can vote only in the case of a tie among council members, \"at least there's another pair of eyes watching what's going on,\" he said. \nAt the same time, he said, he has helped \"put pride back into Bergenfield\" by becoming a fixture at youth sporting events, business openings and other community events, where he seems to savor spending time with residents. \n\"If I go to a senior citizen event, I sit down and eat with the senior citizens. If I go to a school event, I stay there from the beginning to the end. If I go to a spaghetti dinner, I have no problem staying there and picking up the tables at the end,\" he said of his governing style. \"I'm not fake, we'll put it that way.\" \nKornbluth said that not only would she do her best to unite residents, but she is also in a better position than Schmelz to unite a Democratic council whose members often disagree with one another. \n\"If none of us can get into agreement on an issue, then there are many things that just don't get passed and don't get pushed through,\" she said. \"As a mayor and as a friend of theirs, there are many times when I could sit down with them and say, 'Listen, we all need to compromise.' And the compromise will come a lot better from me than from a Republican mayor.\" \nKornbluth also pointed to her performance as a member of the finance committee as evidence of her ability to lead the borough. Since she joined the council in 2010, borough debt has dropped from $17.8 million to $11 million. Late last year, Moody's upgraded Bergenfield's bond rating, citing its \"healthy financial profile\" and \"manageable debt and pension burden.\" \nThe new rating, she said, \"will allow us to bond money much more responsibly\" and help control taxes. \nAs far as policy is concerned, Schmelz and Kornbluth said they would do their best to keep tax increases to a minimum; both said they were committed to investing in the borough's road and sewer systems; and both said they were open to having the municipality operate the now-defunct Bergenfield Swim Club if it could do so at an acceptable cost. \nBoth candidates also said that the borough's downtown is in need of rejuvenation, but they proposed differing ways of achieving that end. Kornbluth said she wants to abolish the borough's special improvement district and set up a chamber of commerce to attract businesses, while Schmelz said he supported mixed-use zoning of the property along Washington Avenue to attract developers. \nTwo council seats are also being contested in the Nov. 3 election. Three-term Democratic incumbent Thomas Lodato, 58, an attorney, is running alongside one-term incumbent Hernando Rivera, 45, an adjunct professor and student counselor at Fairleigh Dickinson University. \nTheir Republican challengers are Ricky Sanchez, 61, a longtime cameraman and editor for CBS-TV, and Cindy Naylis, 29, an owner of two small businesses and mother of a 2-week-old boy. \nKornbluth's council term expires at the end of 2016. If she loses the race for mayor, she can still maintain her council seat. \nEmail: pugliese@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:54:59.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
