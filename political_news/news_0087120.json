The staff and zone committees of Environment Canterbury have made more progress on freshwater over the past five years than in any other part of the country by getting all of the parties with an interest in water engaged in the rules and initiatives needed to better manage Canterbury’s water,\" Dr Smith says. \n\"The staff of Environment Canterbury share not only their successes in this report, but they also acknowledge their struggles and challenges to demonstrate that while it’s not always easy, it’s worth it. The report shows that collaborative processes are not just about coming to an agreement - they also provide an opportunity to strengthen the wider community and define the future of their region through the sustainable, long-term decisions that are made. \n\"Freshwater management is not the only area that stands to gain from using a collaborative approach. I have previously suggested a collaborative approach to developing a National Policy Statement on biodiversity. This is another contentious environmental issue which to date has been unable to be progressed and I see a role for a tight collaborative process involving farmers and conservationists. The Canterbury Water Management Strategy experience will have much to offer by way of guidance.\" \nThe Canterbury Water Management Strategy report is available from the Environment Canterbury website: www.ecan.govt.nz/pages/home.aspx. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:14:32.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
