Unfortunately, the government squandered that under pressure from a few irresponsible employers. \n“But this isn’t the way it has to be, and we are proud to see political leaders stand up for a better way of doing things.” \nE tū represents working people in industries like mining, aviation, aged care and manufacturing, which all have unique health and safety needs. We fight for strong health and safety laws for all working people. \nENDS E tu \nE tū: the new union for New Zealanders \nE tū has been created by the merger of the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union and Service and Food Workers' Union. E tū represents more than 50,000 working New Zealanders in industries as diverse as aviation, construction, journalism, food manufacturing, mining and cleaning. By standing together in a union workers get higher wages and better conditions. As the country's largest private sector union E tū can provide members with workplace representation, legal advice, a freephone support centre, work rights education and broad representation through E tū's campaigning and research work. We campaign hard for workers' rights, health and safety, a living wage for all Kiwis, and recognising high-value skilled work.
