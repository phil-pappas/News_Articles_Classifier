By Mortimer B. Zuckerman Oct. 2, 2015 | 3:12 p.m. EDT\nBy Mortimer B. Zuckerman Mortimer Zuckerman is the chairman and editor-in-chief of U.S. News & World Report and the publisher of the New York Daily News.\n+ More Twenty-two years ago Israel's Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands, as President Bill Clinton watched and smiled. It was the beginning of the Oslo peace process and the quest for a two-state solution. Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas is in the 11th sterile year of his supposed four-year term. He marks the Oslo anniversary by symbolically tearing up that agreement. He gratifies himself by raising the Palestinian Authority flag at the U.N., tolerates violence in Jerusalem and descends into the gutter to declare of the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, \"The Al-Aqsa is ours ... and [the Israelis] have no right to defile it with their filthy feet.\" This is both offensive and untrue. In the peace agreement after the Six-Day War, Israel gave Jordan responsibility for the prayer spots holy to the Muslims on the Temple, though the Mount is sacred to Jews too. The understanding was that Jews had the right to visit but not pray and can enter only through one of the 11 gates. Only a few thousand Jews visit, Israel has so honored its promises that 3-4 million Muslims annually use the right of access.\n[ READ: Abbas Says Palestinians No Longer Bound By Accord With Israel ]\nAccess for prayer. Not access for violence. What happened in Jerusalem on the occasion of the Jewish New Year is disgraceful: three days of violence, fires and stone-throwing on the Temple Mount and in the Old City. Dozens of Arab young people, many of them masked, holed up in the Al-Aqsa mosque. They set up barriers at the mosque's doors. When the security forces entered, the masked men began hurling firecrackers, stones and other items. Fortunately the Israeli police managed to close the mosque doors with the rioters inside.\nViolence continued on the Temple Mount and in the area of the Old City. The violence in the Al-Aqsa mosque was clearly planned in detail. Palestinians tried to stir up the public as well as escalating the clashes and called for a \"day of rage\" on Friday. And tensions were heightened with the death of Alexander Levlovich who crashed his car in a stone-throwing terror attack. The Israeli president described this as terrorism by any interpretation and called for strong action as befits the fight against terrorism. The problem is that the terrorists believe they have legitimacy to spread terror beyond the Old City, to some of the key roads especially route 443, one of the two roads that lead to Jerusalem. It has become a hub for stabbings and stone-throwing as well.\nIt's fortunate that Israeli police forces were able to prevent a mass escalation. But the danger remains – for both sides – and it behooves the grown-ups to control the hot heads. Abbas himself wants it both ways – clashes for propaganda but at a level that does not adversely provoke the global media. The Waqf leaders or Islamic Trust, who administer the site, do not want riots either, nor does Jordan. Alas none seem to have enough sway with the young attackers. It's a challenging situation, too, for the Israeli security forces, which exercise prudent intervention, decisive enough to protect lives and property without giving an excuse for a minor incident to escalate.\nMost critically, the Israelis focus on creating an environment that doesn't threaten their strategic ally, King Abdullah of Jordan. Abdullah has already expressed concern. The Israelis do not wish to have a crisis with Jordan. I just attended a dinner party with the king in Washington, D.C. He is seasoned with vast knowledge of the challenges that the moderate leaders in the Arab world face. He underscored that there has been a mini-intifada in Jerusalem for the last 16 months, focused on the Temple Mount through stone-throwing, vehicular attacks, knifings and setting fire to various parts of the city. Fortunately the incidents have not spun out of control nor have they spread to the West Bank. The question is how long the P.A. and the Israeli government will be able to control the flames.\n[ MORE: Israeli Public Opinion Nuanced When It Comes to Iran Deal ]\nEverybody knows that there is danger in escalation from stone-throwing to firebombing. At times like this, anyone who takes a drive on the Mount of Olives to enjoy the sunny view risks having stones thrown at their car. Those who visit relatives in the cemetery there, where philosophers, prime ministers and rabbis are buried, find desecrated headstones. No wonder the impassioned dialogue between the Palestinians and the Israelis has become increasingly heated in recent days, diminishing the chances of resumption of negotiations.\nNetanyahu met this week with Ban Ki-moon, the U.N. secretary general, and with Secretary of State John Kerry. This is when the nuclear agreement with Iran has greatly diminished any flexibility that the Israelis had hoped would help them advance their relationship with the Palestinians. For what the Israelis see are radical Islamic organizations capturing more and more territory, while Abbas is merely choosing symbolic political gestures. Now even as the Israelis voice warnings, Iran is gaining nuclear weapons courtesy of the United States. They have little desire to do anything constructive. There is nothing the Israelis can do now to ameliorate the agreement with Iran that will continue to pose an existential threat to Israel, no matter how much applause followed Netanyahu's speech. They know that just a few days ago the commander of the Iranian army left no doubt he intended to destroy Israel. This follows on a week in which rockets were fired at Israel, fortunately intercepted by the Iron Dome.\nNothing seems to end the violence. Today the threats and the consequences are emanating yet again from Gaza, the next hot zone. Generally speaking, after every war something new begins. But it is only in Israel, where after a long and major war has ended, where soldiers and citizens displayed magnificent courage, that everything goes back to square one, to the inevitable escalation of tensions that will turn into the next war.\nBy contrast, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi is a remarkable restraining influence. He said in an interview with the Associated Press that Egypt's 40-year peace with Israel should be expanded to include more Arab countries while resolving the Palestinian issue. Netanyahu rightly welcomed el-Sissi's call to expand the peace with Israel and to include additional Arab countries.\nThe problem on the ground is that meanwhile nothing changes. The police can only do so much. Punishment is not deterring. The Palestinians tolerate the violence in their name, though it diminishes any hope that the occupation can be brought to an end and their lives improved immeasurably.\nThe Report Thank you, your email has been submitted.\nSubscribe to our\nNewsletter Stay informed with exclusive content sent\ndirectly to your inbox.\nTAGS: Israel Middle East Palestine Abbas, Mahmoud Netanyahu, Benjamin", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdttdq%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=The%20Unchanging%20Palestinian%20Violence%20in%20the%20Middle%20East&summary=The%20Palestinian%20violence%20in%20Jerusalem%20goes%20on%20as%20it%20always%20has.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdttdq%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=The%20Unchanging%20Palestinian%20Violence%20in%20the%20Middle%20East", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdttdq%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdttdq%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdttdq%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=The%20Unchanging%20Palestinian%20Violence%20in%20the%20Middle%20East", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdttdq%3Fsrc=usn_gp"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:27:31.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
