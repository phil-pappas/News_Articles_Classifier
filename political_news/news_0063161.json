By Chay Liberté Filed Under Politics News , 2016 Election , Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , Donald Trump \nWith the recent tension in Syria mounting, many are wondering, is Obama available for that third term? \nThe POTUS discussed the audacity of such a move in a sit down with 60 Minutes this week, where he answered questions about the Middle East, before diving into the 2016 election. PHOTOS: OBAMA'S VISIT TO EL RENO PRISON \nJournalist Steve Kroft began with the president's opinion on one of the most visible –– and vocal –– candidates, Donald Trump . He's apparently, one of the TV-ish characters Obama was talking about, when he offered advice to Kanye West . \n\"I think that he is a great publicity-seeker,\" Obama said, \"and at a time when the Republican party hasn't really figured out what it's for, as opposed to what it's against.\" \nThe latter part, he expounded, was a nod to the anti-immigration sentiment that set the tone early for the former Celebrity Apprentice host's campaign. \n\"... He is, you know, the classic reality TV character.\" \nAnd while Obama's adiministration is all about transparency, he doesn't think Trump will be elected, nor does he think that Hillary Clinton's email gaffe was much of a gaffe at all. \nIt certainly wasn't detrimental to national security, he said. \n\"I think that it was a mistake that she has acknowledged ... When we're in these offices, we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information, how we handle our own personal data,\" he mentioned, however, \"... I can tell you that this is not a situation in which America's national security was endangered. \nAs for his ballot buddy, Joe Biden , Obama is firm about supporting him, if he chooses to run. \"I think Joe will go down as one of the finest vice presidents in history, and one of the more consequential. I think he has done great work,\" he said. \nMostly, however, it was what Obama said by the end of the interview that sealed the great pre-22nd amendment hope. \n\"Do you think if you ran again, could run again, and did run again, you would be elected?\" Kroft asked. \n\"Yes,\" Obama said without equivication or explanation. \n\"You do?\" Kroft prodded. \n\"I do.\" \nWatch: Celebrities: Are the Kardashians Your First Family? and a segment of Obama's 60 Minutes interview, in the videos below. \nBET Politics - Your source for the latest news, photos and videos illuminating key issues and personalities in African-American political life, plus commentary from some of our liveliest voices.
