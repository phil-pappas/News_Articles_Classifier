In addition to excessive force, Hahn is suing for battery, negligence and federal and state civil rights violations.\nThe video shows Hahn pinned on the ground with an officer on top of her. Another officer joins in and strikes her in the head then tells her to stop resisting. Hanh screams for help and repeatedly shouts that she didn't do anything.\nThe Carlsbad Police Department says it will provide its account of the incident in court.\nThe lawsuit says Hahn had been pulled over for an alleged seat belt violation, but was never ticketed.\n___\nInformation from: The San Diego Union-Tribune, http://www.utsandiego.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1MW2qHL", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:33:30.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
