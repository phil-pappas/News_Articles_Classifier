He said his wife and three young children will still come first.\n\"I genuinely worry about the consequences that my agreeing to serve will have on them. Will they experience the viciousness and incivility that we all face here on a daily basis?\" Ryan said. \"But my greatest worry, my greatest worry is the consequence of not stepping up, of someday having my own kids ask me, 'When the stakes were so high, why didn't you do all you could do, why didn't you stand and fight for my future?'\"\nHe made his terms clear and gave fellow Republicans until Friday to express their support.\nUtah Representative Jason Chaffetz tweeted he's dropping out of the race and will support Ryan.\n\"He's the right person at the right time,\" Chaffetz said.\nHowever, Ryan's biggest challenge may be getting the approval of the Freedom Caucus.\nIt is one of the most conservative groups within House republicans considered responsible for former Speaker John Boehner's resignation. They also are considered the reason Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's decided not to run to replace Boehner.\nWill Ryan get their approval?\n\"I think he has to campaign for it. We've heard one speech,\" said Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa. \"We're willing to listen but it's the beginning of the conversation as far as I'm concerned.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:54:04.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
