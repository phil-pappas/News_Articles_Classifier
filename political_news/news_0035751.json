The key here is that we don't infringe on the rights of legal gun owners who are of sound mind, and never offer the possibility of the government to do so in the future. This seems to be the part that has most been caught up on with Gun Control advocates as they just prefer to naively think that the government could never turn against you or, the government will always exist in the form it does today. Which, since there hasn't been a nation in the history of the planet that has lasted forever, it's not unreasonable to think at some point down the road, the US could change. More to the point, you will not find a Gun Rights activist that believes there shouldn't be a mechanism to ensure legal guns get into the hands of people shouldn't own them. Thus, I have a compromise. I suggest that what the US should implement is a query only database that contains only the names of former convicts and those who have been in a mental health institution for 5 years. That is to say, that should you ever be convicted (preferably of a violent crime as I don't see why non-violent criminal offenders should have their rights as severely restricted but I'm amenable to either way really) that your name would be put into the database. As well, any mental health facility that cares for an emergency case, must report to the database a person who had come into their care as the only reason one goes into said facility is that they are deemed a threat to themselves or others. After a period of time (5 years is what I suggest but it could go as high as 10 if people wanted to be extra cautious) the names would automatically delete themselves off of the system, much like how your web browser can be set to automatically delete entries older than a set amount of time. This database would be accessible only to gun store owners (and perhaps those who sell guns in gun shows as well) but even if someone were to get access to the program it wouldn't do them much good. That is where the \"query only\" function of it comes into play. You see, you would go about the normal process of applying for a gun and while you are filling out your application, they will check your name against the database from another terminal. If you are flagged, then they will simply deny your purchase. Any audits will be carried out at the state level of course, thus to ensure the federal government never has contact with those papers stored by most gun store owners. The only part the Federal government will play, as I said, is just maintaining the database. In closing, to my Gun Rights activist, I would only stress that this system wouldn't affect you whatsoever as long as you follow the laws and don't become a risk to yourself or others as deemed by a licensed psychiatrist. And, the broad strokes of this system is already being implemented or has been put in place in several states around the nation. This is only seeking to strengthen the database that gun store owners use, while maintaining actual enforcement at the state and local levels. So what do you guys think? Love to hear your thoughts, especially any criticism as I've tried to make this as fair to both sides as possible. Re: A Background Check We Can All Get Behind Such a database would be just as misused as the child molester list. so i wouldn't support such a thing.

Love to hear your thoughts, especially any criticism as I've tried to make this as fair to both sides as possible. Are you suggesting this in addition to the NICS check and are you also suggesting it just checks names? If it's in addition to NICS then it's a redundant check as that's the whole purpose of NICS and if you're talking about a name only database that just isn't going to work.
