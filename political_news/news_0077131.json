Clinton finds herself in a tighter than expected race with independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and her move to consolidate Latino support is a sign the candidate is trying to solidify her base.\nClinton has long performed well with Latino voters, too. During the 2008 Democratic primary, Hispanics picked Clinton over then-Sen. Barack Obama by a nearly two-to-one margin.\nRepublicans used the news as an opportunity to hit both the endorser and the recipient.\n\"Hillary Clinton and Julian Castro have one thing in common: no one has any idea what they've accomplished,\" RNC Spokeswoman Ruth Guerra said in a statement. \"This endorsement will do nothing to save Hillary's flailing campaign in the midst of plummeting poll numbers and an FBI investigation into the mishandling of classified information on her secret email server.\"\nCastro is not the first member of his family to endorse Clinton, either. His brother, Rep. Joaquin Castro, has endorsed Clinton and is slated to campaign for her in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, ahead of next week's first Democratic debate.\nJulian Castro has been a staunch defender of Clinton over the last few months. Asked by CNN in August about her growing email controversy, Castro said, \"Folks need to understand that she did not handle classified information that was classified at that the time. It may have become classified later, but it was not classified that way at the time.\"\nHe has also batted down any speculation about possibly becoming vice president.\n\"It's flattering,\" he said of the speculation at an event in Kansas City in July, \"but there really is not anything to make of it. I'm focused on my work at HUD. This is not like something you run for. Nobody signs up for that. So I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing.\"\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/sources-julian-castro-is-endorsing-hillary-clinton-for-presi", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-clintons-break-bread-and-build-ties-with-julian-castro-stoking-talk-of-a-2016-ticket/2014/08/14/ad57c662-23c3-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:27:59.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
