We look forward to receiving the details of this proposal in due course.\" \nBut Liberal Democrats have voiced fears that the government is \"blackmailing\" town halls into accepting devolution by the threat of further grant cuts. Promoted stories \nCllr Lucille Thompson, Lib Dem group leader, said: \"It's good news so far as the city council's concerned because it's always great when councils can take control of their own finances. \n\"I think where the danger lies is with the devolution package that the council is going for.\" \nShe said it's unclear whether the money will go to Winchester or bosses at a Hampshire combined authority, which could redistribute money raised in the city to poorer areas. \n\"The government's blackmailing councils to sign up to the deal,\" Cllr Thompson said. \"They're saying 'the carrot is that you will get all your business rates, and if you don't sign up to the devolution deal we're going to cut your rate support grant.'\" Share article \nIt is unclear how much freedom the Guildhall will have in spending the money, but it is expected the rules will be looser than current grants, often given for specific services. \nCouncil finance chief Alexis Garlick said the deal is currently expected to be \"fiscally neutral\".
