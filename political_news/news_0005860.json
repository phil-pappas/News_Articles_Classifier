Like Us on Facebook \n\"We cannot let hate and discrimination determine the outcome of this election. We owe it to the hardworking Latinos that came before us, to ourselves and to our children, to show the people who unfairly label us as criminals and speak down to us that our community is strong, meaningful and incredibly powerful,\" Hayek said. \nSalma said that the Latino community, which is the \"largest, youngest and fastest-growing\" community in the United States, deserves someone who acknowledges the contributions they have made in the country. \nHayek said that she is \"proud\" to be of help for the \"Latinos for Hillary\" campaign. The actress even cited that it comes as an advantage that the leading candidate of the Republican Party is using \"hate\" to win votes. \n\"(It's incredible) that the leading candidate of the Republican Party has been irresponsibly campaigning, using unfounded and insulting accusations against the Latino community to win votes,\" Salma said. \nSince he announced his candidacy in June, Donald Trump has been under fire from the Latino community.
