With this meeting, we intend to do just that,\" Councilwoman Susan Guidry, the committee's chairwoman, said in a statement. \"The people of New Orleans need to know that their elected officials and police department are taking this threat seriously and that we are working tirelessly to ensure the safety of our citizens.\"\nThe NOPD reported five armed robberies on Wednesday, including two teachers who were held up inside Success Preparatory Academy . Police have released a video of the suspect.\nThe latest string of robberies fraying the nerves of Uptown residents began on the night of Aug. 20 when three gunmen held up workers and diners at Patois on Laurel Street. On Sept 24, two armed suspects made their way into Atchafalaya on Louisiana Avenue and robbed customers and staff.\nAnd Monday night, three suspects went into the Monkey Hill Bar and took wallets from about a dozen patrons as well as taking money from the register and an upstairs office.\nThe latest NOPD statistics show that, through Sept. 26, there were 676 armed robberies reported this year, an average of 2.51 per day.
