It's his 50th birthday, and he's hogging the microphone as the perspiration drips down his heavy frame. You can count the politicians on the dance floor on one hand, and have a few fingers spare.\nIn fact, the biggest crowd, on this August 2015 night, is drawn from the 1974 year 3 class at St Aloysius' College at Milsons Point in Sydney. That's real loyalty – friends who will stick with you for 40 years. Joe knows he's low in the polls. A social drinker, tonight he's high on friendship.\nFormer Treasurer Joe Hockey delivers his valedictory speech.

Malcolm Turnbull took over the leadership of the Liberal Party, and the music stopped for Joseph Benedict Hockey.\nHockey, who had told everyone in that year 3 class at St Aloysius that one day he wanted to become the nation's prime minister, was ushered out the exit door; the casualty of a changing political paradigm, an inability to sell the government's plan to a wary electorate, and a close-knit political partnership which meant the prime minister and his treasurer would rise – or fall – together.\nFormer treasurer Joe Hockey leaves the House after his valedictory speech with son Iggy and daughter Adelaide at Parliament House in Canberra on Wednesday. Photo: Andrew Meares\nJoe Hockey and Tony Abbott's bond has always been political, not personal. They have some things in common, like an early Jesuit education, a Sydney University degree and a love of the Liberal Party, but not a close friendship.\nThat's, in part, because there are as many differences, as there are similarities, between them. Hockey – the son of Armenian-Palestinian father Richard, and Australian-born mother Beverley – is a moderate. Abbott is conservative. Abbott's children have all grown up. Hockey has three primary school-aged children. Abbott is a monarchist; Hockey a republican. Abbott draws his income from politics; Hockey, who is married to a former merchant banker, Melissa Babbage, is independently wealthy.\nBut early on in their political careers, and over dinner at Portia's Place in Canberra, they formed a bond of sorts. Along with Ross Cameron and Christopher Pyne, they'd meet up regularly , where the only common view across the table was a love of the Shantung lamb and support for Catholicism.\nThat built a foundation for later, and despite going up against each other in the leadership stakes in 2009, they've always shared a healthy respect. It faltered only once, in 2010, when Abbott announced his controversial paid paternity leave program without his treasurer knowing many of the details.\nThat led to a behind-doors stoush, and a deal that they would never – publicly, at least – have more than \"a cigarette paper\" of difference between them. Theirs would be a relationship, they agreed, unlike that of John Howard and his treasurer, Peter Costello, which failed in the end, as did that of Bob Hawke and his treasurer, Paul Keating. In Alan Jones' words, they would pick. And stick.\nAbbott led the 2014 budget negotiations, but Joe Hockey, as treasurer, was in it up to his eyeballs. Indeed, in some areas and with an eye on the polls, Abbott pulled Hockey, who wanted to go a step or two further, back.\nAt a private party, hours after the controversial budget was handed down, Abbott jumped up onto a table and asked people to listen. \"I cannot imagine a stronger and warmer partnership than the one we have enjoyed over the past few months,\" he told everyone. The warm afterglow of the Abbott government's first budget hadn't yet reached its audience.\nSome of the backlash was expected, but Joe Hockey believed the electorate's fear of the growing debt would trump their concerns about whether the budget was too tough. And he believed the salesmanship he'd shown previously – on issues as tricky as HIH Insurance and WorkChoices – would mean he could win the non-believers over. He was wrong. And so was his boss.\nAbbott, who excelled in the scrappy fighter mode in opposition, could not translate that into a prime ministerial authority in the same way John Howard, his mentor, was able to be disliked and respected in equal parts.\n\"To have a really successful economic policy you need the combination of a determined reformist treasurer and a very supportive prime minister,\" John Howard told me in December 2013. \"You need both. [Peter] Costello could have never delivered the 1996 budget that he did without my total support.\"\nHockey had Abbott's support, but neither had Howard's canny ability to sell a tough budget and Hockey, the bloke who filled the Sunrise screen and made us like politicians, quickly lost his way. His confidence followed, and the support he had, both inside the party and outside, collapsed as quickly as the political life cycle shortened.\nJohn Howard, the leader Joe Hockey has always most wanted to impress, knew the Treasury portfolio would turn the electorate against Hockey. Up until that point, Hockey's poll standing glistened. When Senator James McGrath – a key numbers man for Malcolm Turnbull's leadership bid – wanted help in launching a campaign offensive on Kevin Rudd in 2010, he conducted private polling of Liberal candidates before picking up the phone and asking Joe Hockey to come to Queensland.\nHoward, too, believed Hockey had the magic salesmanship touch; that's why he put him in charge of his unsalvageable WorkChoices. But being treasurer would be different, Howard told me in December 2013, as I was penning Joe Hockey's biography. \"Treasurers are never very popular. I was never popular. [Paul] Keating wasn't popular. The Canberra gallery loved him but a lot of ordinary people didn't. They didn't like me either.\" Scott Morrison, take note.\nHockey had had three decades in politics preparing for the Treasury gig, and believed he could be different. He believed he had capital in the bank with voters, and with his own backbench. Indeed,he believed he would be the next conservative prime minister. So did Tony Abbott. And so did many of those now sitting in Malcolm Turnbull's cabinet.\nThe 2014 budget stopped that, for a couple of reasons. First, Hockey struggled to translate the easy style that had been such a campaign asset into selling a budget he believed the voters should accept. That unsettled him, and as the public rancour followed him (and other ministers ) into shopping centre car parks and the McDonald's drive-throughs, he retreated into his office.\nHockey's strength has always been his ability to connect with others. But now, on the defensive, a series of poorly worded comments focused the attention of the national electorate on the treasurer who was calling for the end of the age of entitlement. Poor people don't drive cars. Mothers who claimed paid parental leave from employers and from the government were double-dipping. Australians wanting to buy their first home should \"get a good job that pays good money\". He couldn't turn a trick.\nBy themselves, none of those statements was fatal to his position. Julie Bishop, as opposition treasury spokeswoman, had forgotten the RBA cash interest rate and faced accusations of plagiarism. Malcolm Turnbull was sent packing as leader by many of those who are now sharing his limelight. But together, they painted a picture of a long-term politician, who had lost both his way and his ability to connect with those he served. His mojo was gone. And he didn't have a leader who could help restore it.\nJoe Hockey will miss Parliament; his decision to leave following long conversations with his best friend Melbourne businessman Andrew Burnes, and his wife, Melissa. Melissa is the hardhead at home. \"It is what it is,\" she told him after losing government in 2007. She said the same, when he bungled a leadership bid in 2009. And she's said it again in the past few weeks, as the door finally closes on her husband's political aspirations.\nHe's onside though. \"It is what it is,\" he said in his first appearance after leaving the Treasury office. The same words.\nI knew Joe Hockey but had no brief for him when I started to write his biography, other than a journalistic commitment to tell a good story of an interesting Australian life. Eventually, Joe was a willing and co-operative subject and we've since become friends. Some parts of what I wrote embarrassed him but he never backed away because he saw the value in the truth even if it was uncomfortable.\nHe believes that at 50, he's got a long second career ahead of him. And, having now turned the corner, he will work to ensure his next role builds on the legacy of the public life his father, Richard, an Armenian-born Palestinian who came to Australia as a refugee in 1948, instilled in him as a child.\nMost likely, that role is as Australian ambassador to Washington where the Americans will enjoy his affability and not be hung up on the domestic issues that have ended a political career which faltered on trying but failing to convince voters of an uncomfortable truth that many just did not want to hear.\nMadonna King is the author of Hockey: Not Your Average Joe (Penguin Australia).", "external_links": ["http://media.smh.com.au/video-news/video-national-news/congested-level-crossings-not-on-labors-removal-list-6958636.html"], "published": "2015-10-24T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:56:53.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
