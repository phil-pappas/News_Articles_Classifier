A two-bit “Ishtar” that might play better on a phone, the film is set mainly in contemporary Afghanistan—hard to think of a funnier place—and was directed coarsely by Barry Levinson from a slovenly script by Mitch Glazer. Bill Murray is Richie Lanz, a down-on-his-luck rock tour manager who takes his last remaining client, Ronnie ( Zooey Deschanel), on a USO tour to Kabul. She dumps him, but not to worry, because Richie happens on a dazzling Afghan girl with a golden voice and gets her a triumphant gig as the first female singer on “Afghan Star,” that nation’s version of “American Idol.”\nMore Reviews ‘Suffragette’ ‘Nasty Baby’ At least that’s the plot line the film appears to be following. The awful truth is that Richie’s discovery has the voice of a timid teeny-bopper, and zero dazzle. This raises the question of whether he’s delusional or we are, and neither alternative fits. No one doesn’t love Bill Murray, but his melancholy torpor can wear thin in the best of circumstances, and these circumstances are pretty close to the worst. The cast includes Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Danny McBride and Scott Caan. No one escapes unscathed.\nRewind ENLARGE DVD // Streaming // Download ‘Lost in Translation’ (2003) Let’s forget about Bill Murray’s mishap in “Rock the Kasbah” and recall his exquisite performance in Sofia Coppola’s smart, sweet comedy set in Tokyo. He plays Bob Harris, a melancholic movie star who is jet-lagged out of his skull. Scarlett Johansson is Charlotte; she’s young enough to be his daughter. What they first have in common is insomnia. Their body clocks are out of sync with the surroundings, though in fatefully close sync with each other.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AL104_Rewind_JV_20151022140427.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/AR-AL104_Rewind_DV_20151022140427.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:53:23.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
