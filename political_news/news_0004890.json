Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are both running for the GOP presidential nomination.\nIn his latest book , Unlikable: The Problem with Hillary , Klein claims Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, once named Rubio as the greatest threat to his wife's candidacy.\n\"He's young, Hispanic and a good speaker,\" Klein quotes Bill as saying over dinner last spring, by way of an anonyous source who was supposedly there. \"He'd pose a generational challenge and a challenge for the Hispanic vote, which we need to win ... We've got to destroy him before he gets off the ground.\"\n  Donald Trump, No Labels hero On  \nBy Byron York • 10/12/15 9:49 PM Klein describes himself as politically independent, but he makes clear in his book and in an interview that he has an intense dislike of Clinton.\n\"I find her untrustworthy, I find her a liar and I don't think she should be, for those reasons as well as her lack of accomplishments, in the White House,\" he said.\nSince even before launching her second campaign in June, Clinton has struggled to shake questions about her use of a non-government email server during her tenure as secretary of State. She has denied any wrongdoing, but critics say it was irresponsible and suspicious for her to conduct government business on a private server.\nKlein said, however, that Republicans and voters at large shouldn't focus solely on the controversy, which he said it she will probably overcome.\n\"Is [President] Obama really going to approve the indictment of the Democratic frontrunner?\" Klein said. \"Good luck with that if you're a Republican. So, all of us who do not want to see Hillary Clinton as president, we ought to examine her behind the email scandal and take her seriously and realize that this is a very formidable figure and poses a real danger to the country.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Gov. O'Malley in fourth place in his home state Previous polls show the O'Malley's best numbers came back in February of 2013, when he reached 8 percent.\nBy Daniel Chaitin • 10/12/15 9:10 PM Top Story Trump, the No Labels frontrunner On  \nBy Byron York • 10/12/15 9:49 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:12:35.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
