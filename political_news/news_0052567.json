Rama Rao Hyderabad : The Opposition, especially the Congress, has stepped up the attack on panchayat raj and IT minister K.T. Rama Rao over the multi-crore TS Water Grid scheme. Over the past few days, the Congress, Telugu Desam, BJP and Left parties have intensified their attack, saying that though the government plans to mobilise Rs 35,000-odd crore for the project, it’s keeping many issues under wraps. However, TRS leaders put the project cost at around Rs 22,000 crore. Mr Rama Rao, who is crisscrossing the state and launching the Water Grid works in Mahbubnagar, Nalgonda and other districts, has hit back with a vengeance, saying that the Opposition fears a wash out after the Water Grid project is completed. Leader of Opposition in Legislative Council Mohammed Ali Shabbir said that there was absolutely no transparency in the scheme and the entire project was shrouded in secrecy. “I wrote to principal secretary J. Raymond Peter seeking a detailed note on the Water Grid scheme on August 17 this year, but till date, there has been no reply. The TRS government has accused previous governments of doing nothing. This is not true. I sought details on what they are doing, but they are keeping things under wraps,” he said. Mr Shabbir Ali sought details of budgetary provisions, GOs issued, process of awarding contracts, present status, and time of completion of the scheme and other details but the government was yet to furnish details. He said that there were several issues involved in the implementation of the scheme, but the TS government has ignored the Opposition in the implementation of the scheme. “This is not healthy in a democracy,” he said. BJP spokesman Sridhar Reddy alleged that a person who played a key role during YSR rule is now involved in the Water Grid scheme. “Why is the TRS government, which has blamed previous governments of awarding contracts to only Andhra contractors, now following the same pattern? Why not encourage TS contractors in the scheme?” he asked. CPM leader Julakanti Ranga Reddy said he suspects a lot of corruption in the scheme, but was yet to get his hands on any evidence. “It will take some time to gather evidence. But the scheme certainly raises a lot of issues, including mopping up resources, funding, budget allocation etc.” he said.
