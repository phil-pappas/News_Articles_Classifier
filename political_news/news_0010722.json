He is a politician and he is an economist too. If a nation’s finances and economy end up in a ditch, he goes there and he turns things around. I know of Zimbabwe, where they used to buy common items with wheel barrows of money; he went there and that is no more the case. So he’s not just anybody; he is God’s gift to us”. \nImam Haroun proceeded to urge the gathering to continuously support and help protect Alhaji Bawumia and prayed for Allah to help Alhaji Bawumia and to grant him his wishes. \n“Let us protect him and take good care of him because he is God’s gift to this nation. If we don’t protect him and take proper care of him and reject this gift from God, God will not bless us. So may God continue to help Mahamudu Bawumia and may he grant him his desires. May God bless Ghana and may God bless Kumasi”, he said. \nAlhaji Bawumia thanked Allah for bringing him and other members of the Ghanaian delegation back home safely. He also thanked the Regional Chief Imam and the Muslim Community in Kumasi for inviting him and for their hospitality. \n“I thank Allah for bringing us safely from Hajj and for those who were not able to return alive, may Allah grant them Jannatul Firdaus. I wish to take this opportunity to thank my father, the Regional Chief Imam, Abdul Mumin Haroun and the Muslim community in Kumasi for inviting me and for your hospitality. May Allah reward all for this hospitality and may Allah continue to bless Ghana”, he prayed. \nAlhaji Bawumia was accompanied to Kumasi by Sheikh T.B. Damba, former 2 nd Vice-Chairman of the NPP, Sheikh I.C. Quaye, former Greater Accra Regional Minister and Kamal-Deen Abdulai, NPP National Nasara Coordinator.
