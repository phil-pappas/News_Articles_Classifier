It was passed by 320 to 258, a majority of 62. \nExplaining his decision in the House, Mr McDonnell said: “When the circumstances and judgments change it is best to admit to it and change as well.” \nMr McDonnell also questioned the true purpose of the fiscal charter. \n“It is increasingly clear that the charter and the fiscal mandate are not economic instruments, they are political weapons,” he said. \nThe debate is not about economics but about the “politics of dismantling the welfare state, the closing down of the role of the state and the redistribution of wealth from the majority to the minority”. \n“Austerity is not an economic necessity it is a political choice,” he said. \nLabour’s deficit reduction programme would not be wrought “on the backs of middle and lower earners”, would be fairer than Mr Osborne’s approach, and would be on a looser timescale, Mr McDonnell said. \nThe shadow chancellor also announced a review of the remit of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which is in charge of setting interest rates and meeting the inflation target, will be led by former MPC member Professor David Blanchflower as part of Labour’s “radical project”. \nThe 21 Labour MPs who defied the whips were Rushanara Ali (Bethnal Green & Bow), Ian Austin (Dudley North), Adrian Bailey (West Bromwich West), Ben Bradshaw (Exeter), Ann Coffey (Stockport), Simon Danczuk (Rochdale), Chris Evans (Islwyn), Frank Field (Birkenhead), Mike Gapes (Ilford South), Dame Margaret Hodge (Barking), Tristram Hunt (Stoke-on-Trent Central), Graham Jones (Hyndburn), Helen Jones (Warrington North), Liz Kendall (Leicester West), Chris Leslie (Nottingham East), Fiona Mactaggart (Slough), Shabana Mahmood (Birmingham Ladywood), Jamie Reed (Copeland), Angela Smith (Penistone & Stocksbridge), Graham Stringer (Blackley & Broughton) and Gisela Stuart (Birmingham Edgbaston).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:24:44.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
