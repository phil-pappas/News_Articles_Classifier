After 2021, the minimum wage would be adjusted for inflation under current Ohio law.\nThe amendment would require employers to pay tipped employees $6 per hour in 2017 and increase wages by $1 per hour each year until it equals the full minimum wage.\nOhio voters approved annual increases tied to inflation through a 2006 amendment to the state Constitution . In 2015, the state minimum wage increased 15 cents to $8.10 an hour and the minimum wage for tipped workers increased 7 cents to $4.05 an hour.\nStand Up for Ohio, a coalition of community, labor, civil rights, and environmental groups, is backing the amendment. The group was founded by Communications Workers of America members in 2011 and helped organize opposition to Senate Bill 5 that year.\nOhio Senate Democrats proposed raising the minimum wage to $10.10 in 2016 , but the bill likely won't pass the Republican-controlled Statehouse.", "external_links": ["http://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/getattachment/7c4348dc-888e-458f-8ded-031493de3a63/The-Ohio-Fair-Wage-Amendment.aspx", "http://www.legislature.state.oh.us/constitution.cfm?Part=2&Section=34a"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:43:27.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
