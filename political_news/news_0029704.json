Scott Walker is expected to lay bare the financial challenges that ended his White House bid last month. \nThe report will represent the first look at what Walker's presidential campaign actually raised and spent during the 71 days the Republican governor was an official candidate for the nation's highest office. Walker dropped out of the race on Sept. 21, unable to sustain financially a candidacy that had soared early, raised and spent money aggressively and then faced plummeting polling and donations. \nOne key question will be how much debt to consultants and vendors, if any, Walker's campaign has left on the books. \nFor his part, Walker told conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes Wednesday that he wouldn't focus on the mistakes, whether his own or those of his campaign staff. \n\"There were a lot of different factors, obviously different candidates, different situations, different staff. All of those things come. Instead of doing what a lot of candidates do and whine about this, that or whatever, for me I accept it for what it is,\" Walker told Sykes. \nEarlier this week, Walker said his campaign will report relatively strong fundraising . \n\"The reports will be out. The bottom line is as in the past we've raised a lot of resources (though) not as much as some of the other candidates,\" Walker said.
