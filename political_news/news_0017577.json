Wednesday, Sept. 23, 2015. (Jessica Christian/Jackson Citizen Patriot via AP) LOCAL STATIONS OUT; LOCAL INTERNET OUT; MANDATORY CREDIT ADVERTISEMENT Posted: Thursday, September 24, 2015 5:15 pm \nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, among the leaders in GOP presidential polls nationally, will bring his campaign to Northern Virginia on Sunday evening. \nCarson plans a 90-minute rally at Park View High School in Sterling, beginning at 7 p.m. \nLoudoun is a large swing county in this key swing state. In 2012, President Barack Obama, a Democrat, carried the county with 51.6 percent of the vote to 47.1 percent for Republican Mitt Romney. \nIn recent days, Carson has worked to clarify his remarks after a Sunday interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in which he said: “I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation.” \nCarson has subsequently said he does not care about an individual’s religious beliefs as long as the person embraces the U.S. Constitution and is willing to place it above the person’s religion. \nCarson was in Richmond last October as the keynote speaker of the Family Foundation of Virginia’s annual gala at the Greater Richmond Convention Center. \nacain@timesdispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-25T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:30:55.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
