We don't know if it's legal,\" he said. \"We also strongly believe that it will hurt our ability to retain and create jobs here in the city and the county.\"\nAlso EDGE has 26 active PILOTS still in \"ramp up,\" or the early stages, of hiring and 47 that are past \"ramp up,\" Dulberger said, not the 458 that had been reported by some outlets during the recent city election.\nThere were also questions about a proposed plan for EDGE to take over operation of the Community Redevelopment Agency, a city/county organization that reviews Tax Incremental Financing projects, and has seen two projects in 15 years.\nWith no staff, CRA approached the EDGE board about assistance, Bright said.\nRegardless, Basar said, there should be no arrangements made between EDGE and the CRA without the approval of the commission and the city council.\nOverall, the meeting was helpful, Dulberger said.\n\"What they asked is doable,\" he said. \"The question is, what are the consequences.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:47:14.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
