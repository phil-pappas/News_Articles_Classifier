Other residents will pay less tax because of decreases in local levies, he said.\nUnion employees in the town -- who make up about 90 percent of the town's workforce -- will receive 3 percent pay raises in 2016, but the total amount the town spends on salaries will go up only a fraction of a percent. Darienzo said that's because 45 vacant positions will not be filled in 2016. There will be no layoffs, he said.\nThe town is increasing its debt-service spending in 2016 from $71,738,224 to $80,745,046 to more aggressively pay off its debt, Darienzo said. The town's debt rose from about $600 million in 2010 to about $770 million in 2015, but is expected to decline in 2016, he said.\nFor the past few years, Oyster Bay has borrowed $30 million in short-term notes each May to address potential cash-flow problems in June and July, before the town receives tax payments in August, Darienzo said.\nTweets by @Newsday The same approach will be used again, because some vendors are slow in paying the town, which wants to pay its own bills on time, he said. The notes are paid off in 10 months, he said.\nWith Ted Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Newsday"], "published": "2015-10-05T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:00:45.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
