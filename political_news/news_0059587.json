Comments (0) \nChancellor George Osborne's own father-in-law has slammed the deal he signed with the Chinese to fund the building of a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, saying we would all be paying 'eye-watering' energy prices because it is such a bad deal. \nLord Howell of Guildford, himself a former Conservative energy minister, said he suspected the deal would not be repeated because of the high price the Government paid – which will be passed onto the nation through higher energy bills. \nMr Osborne and the Tory Government gave 'risk-free guarantees' to two Chinese state-owned energy companies to invest 33.5 per cent of the cost of Hinkley C, with the French state-owned energy firm EDF funding the rest of the cost and building the plant. \nThe deal signed this week to build Hinkley C has long been criticised by environmental campaigners, more recently by former defence chiefs and security analysts worried about the threat to national security of involving China in building and running nuclear power stations in Britain, and now the finances of the deal itself have been criticised from experts within Mr Osborne's own family.
