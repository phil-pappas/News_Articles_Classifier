People in Juan Lacaze, a coastal city of fishermen and paper factory workers in southwestern Uruguay, wanted to do their part to help a country where more than 200,000 have been killed in the fighting.\nBut after months of the Syrians' complaints about their living conditions and demands to be sent to another country, many Uruguayans in this town and elsewhere have come to see the refugees more as rude, ungrateful guests. This month the 51-year-old Alshebli shocked locals by dousing himself in gasoline in protest, furthering Uruguayans' indignation and sense that this South American nation's humanitarian gesture has gone off the rails.\n\"I'm outraged,\" said Monica Benitez, who works at a shoe store in Juan Lacaze's tiny downtown. \"What they are doing is offensive.\"\nThe Syrians' discontent is playing out as hundreds of thousands of their compatriots are risking their lives to migrate to Europe and world leaders from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Pope Francis have urged nations to open their doors to the flood. The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged to take in 10,000 Syrians over the next year.\nUruguay's attempt to help by sheltering 42 refugees — a largely symbolic gesture given that over 4 million Syrians have fled since civil war broke out in 2011 — appears to be backfiring, just as earlier this year the ups and downs of six former Guantanamo Bay detainees taken in by the country hogged headlines.\nLike the ex-detainees, the refugee families complain that life in Uruguay is expensive and authorities aren't doing enough to support them. But unlike the former prisoners, who refused jobs offered to them, the adult Syrians have worked.\nThe Syrians' biggest beef is that they can't make ends meet even though the government provides housing and gives each family a monthly stipend. Both government officials and the families have declined to say how much that is.\n\"I like Uruguay. I like Uruguayan families. My young children all go to school here,\" Alshebli said in halting Spanish, standing in the living room of his sparsely furnished, multi-room home on the outskirts of Juan Lacaze. \"But food is very expensive. How can I feed 15 children?\"\nHe showed The Associated Press a two-month winter electricity bill totaling $475 and said everyone in the family who is able works. For example his 19-year-old daughter Nada sells Arab food downtown and recently worked in an assisted living facility, but earned just $68 in a little under a month there.\nAlshebli also complained that the government won't let him farm beyond the modest vegetable garden the family has planted.\n\"No sheep. No cows. No land,\" said Alshebli, recounting what he said officials told him.\nPolitical analyst Daniel Chasquetti said the government underestimated cultural differences between Uruguay and the refugees' homeland and failed to take into account their limited job skills.\n\"And it's not like Uruguay is a country bursting with opportunities,\" Chasquetti said.\nThe economy of this nation of 3.3 million people is largely based on agricultural and textile exports, and about 40 percent of workers earn around $500 a month, according to a leading union.\nIn August one of the Syrian families tried to travel to Serbia, only to be detained 23 days at the airport in Istanbul because they didn't have the right documents. Ultimately they returned to Uruguay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:36:23.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
