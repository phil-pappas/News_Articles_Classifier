Carson's campaign raised $20 million, almost entirely from small donations. Poll leader Donald Trump is self-financing.\nBush's campaign said he has $10.3 million in cash on hand.\nRecommended: How much do you know about Jeb Bush? Take our quiz. His fundraising for the entire third quarter is only moderately more than Bush raised in the 16 days after he launched his campaign in July, when he pulled in $11.4 million.\nTest your knowledge How much do you know about Jeb Bush? Take our quiz. In addition, Bush released the names of hundreds of people who have bundled together donations totaling $17,600 or more for his campaign.\nWhile the Bush camp called it a landmark showing of transparency, campaign watchdog groups complained that releasing names at the $17,600 level made it hard to divine who were the mega-donors responsible for raising $100,000 or more.\nAlso on Thursday, Bush issued details of his health status, with his doctor reporting that at age 62, he is in excellent physical condition, takes a cholesterol medicine and has used exercise and careful eating habits to bring down his blood pressure and weight.\nOther fund-raising totals reported by Republican candidates on Thursday - the deadline for campaigns to report donation totals to the Federal Election Commission - included $4.2 million brought in by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, $4.4 million by Ohio Governor John Kasich and about $580,000 by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.\nThe dip in the pace of donations for Bush reflected his decline in polls of Republican voters who so far are favoring \"outsider\" candidates like Trump and Carson.\nBush campaign manager Danny Diaz said in a memo to Bush donors, some of whom have been rattled by Bush's decline in support, that the former Florida governor remains in a good position to challenge for the nomination.\n\"We knew from the start this was going to be a hard-fought and close race, but few could have anticipated just how volatile this field would be,\" Diaz said.\nThe $13.4 million raised by Bush in the third quarter compared with $14.2 million raised in the same period in 2011 by the eventual 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, the Bush campaign said.\nSenator Marco Rubio, a Bush rival for establishment Republican support and also from Florida, raised $6 million in the same period while reporting having $11 million cash on hand.\nThe Super PAC that is supporting Bush, Right to Rise, reported in July that it had raised more than $100 million. Unlike the candidates themselves, the Super PACs did not face the Thursday deadline for reporting donation totals to the Federal Election Commission. Sources have reported slowing donations to Right to Rise.\nThe Bush campaign has been working hard to build get-out-the-vote organizations in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina and elsewhere.\n\"The overall effort supporting Jeb will be better funded than any other in the entire field,\" Diaz said.\n(Reporting by Steve Holland and Lisa Lambert; Editing by Diane Craft, Christian Plumb and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:10:22.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
