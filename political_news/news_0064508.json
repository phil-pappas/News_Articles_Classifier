Walter’s bid for Erie County executive is reworking the current sales tax distribution formula among the city and the suburbs. (John Hickey/Buffalo News) By Robert J. McCarthy | News Political Reporter | @bobmccarthybn on October 24, 2015 - 1:47 PM , updated October 24, 2015 at 2:45 PM Tweet ADVERTISEMENT \nIf Republican Raymond W. Walter wins his election and gets his way as the new Erie County executive, town and city governments will receive an average $166 per resident from the 8.75 percent sales tax – compared to the current $139. \nNot a bad deal, right? Especially if reworking the current sales tax distribution formula, which highlights his campaign, means suburban and rural towns could decrease their property tax bills. \nThere’s a flip side, however, for the approximately one-third of Erie County taxpayers residing in the cities of Buffalo, Lackawanna and Tonawanda. Those cities also would receive $166 per resident, but that’s a drastic decrease from the current $308 under the distribution formula negotiated in 1977. \nFor those three cities, Walter’s plan is anything but a good deal in the distribution of the 3 cents on every dollar that Erie County collects on sales taxes. \nAs Walter claws for attention trying to unseat Democrat Mark C. Poloncarz, the Williamsville assemblyman contends it’s time to retool the tax formula to recognize that two-thirds of the electorate reside outside the city. \nAnd suddenly, a new city-suburban division is born. \n“I’m surprised someone trying to represent the entire community is not aware of the negative impact this would have on the City of Buffalo,” said Democratic Mayor Byron W. Brown, pointing to what would be an annual loss of $42 million to Buffalo’s treasury. “We would have to raise taxes to the limit, raise every single fee in the City of Buffalo, look at potential cuts in essential city services, and it would have a chilling effect on investment in the city.” \nIn addition, Brown appears none too appreciative of the idea at a time when many suburban residents are flocking to the city for work, recreation and to live. The city still needs help because of its widespread poverty and other problems, opponents of Walter’s plan say. \nAs it stands now, Buffalo receives a smaller percentage of sales tax from Erie County than does Rochester from Monroe County and Syracuse from Onondaga County. \n“When we talk about ‘One Buffalo’ and building a city of opportunity, we’re talking about the city and its suburbs,” the mayor said. “Those old days of pitting the city against the suburbs were gone, but sadly, it seems that’s very much a part of Assemblyman Walter’s campaign for county executive.” \nYou might expect that reaction from someone whose budget faces such drastic reductions. \nYou might also expect just the opposite from Amherst Supervisor Barry A. Weinstein. His budget, after all, would receive a $3.3 million boost under Walter’s plan, money that could lower town taxes and buttress the town’s rainy day fund. \nWalter’s proposal is “long overdue,” Weinstein said. \n“He proposes sales tax distribution on the basis of population, which is the equivalent of one man, one vote,” Weinstein said. “It’s certainly appealing.” \nCity schools would get more \nWalter also emphasized his idea would distribute $100 million to Erie County schools over the next four years, and said that is getting lost in the debate. \nHis plan would pour an additional $7.5 million annually into Buffalo’s struggling schools. \n“What’s the city’s biggest problem? Schools,” Walter said. “Maybe the mayor doesn’t need a few of those deputy mayors. You might make it a little tougher for the mayor to operate, but you wouldn’t take money from the school district. \n“We would still help the people who are hurting the most,” he added. \nUnder his plan, Frontier also would receive an additional $1 million, Kenmore-Tonawanda $1.5 million, and $2.1 million for Williamsville. \nUntouched formula \nMost observers consider Walter the underdog in heavily Democratic Erie County, and some Democrats say he is trolling for votes where most voters live – in the suburbs. Walter is gaining the most attention of his campaign by pushing the tax redistribution, which he prominently features in his campaign commercials. \nWalter argues it is no longer fair for city residents to benefit at the expense of suburban taxpayers. The formula has not been touched in almost 40 years, he said, and much has changed. \n“The reality is that over all these years, we’ve been operating under a system that’s unfair,” Walter said. “The majority of sales tax is now paid by the population outside the city. \n“We’re just trying to make it more fair on a per capita basis,” he added. \nBut the “city against the suburbs” element is emerging as a major byproduct of the Walter proposal, although his website claims just the opposite because the plan “spreads prosperity to every corner of the county.” \nCity share ‘should be increased’ \nBuffalo Common Council President Darius G. Pridgen said Walter is widening a divide that never before existed. \n“I have no problem having the discussion, but for us it should be increased,” Pridgen said of the sales tax proceeds. “If this has been such a pressing issue, I’m really surprised to be hearing about it just now at election time.” \nWalter’s proposal opens a new wound between suburbs and the county’s three cities, he added. \nFormer Common Council President George K. Arthur agreed with Pridgen. He helped negotiate the original 1964 agreement as a member of the county Board of Supervisors and the 1977 update on the Common Council. \n“It would hurt all the cities because the cities have all lost population,” he said. \nLegal obstacles \nWhile suburban supervisors warm over the prospect of significant new revenue, city officials and Poloncarz warn of legal and political obstacles, such as getting it passed in the county Legislature. \nIf Walter is elected county executive on Nov. 3, he said he will make his sales tax plan his top priority. With one year’s notice, any of the agreement’s entities can opt out to end the 1977 pact, so he said he will immediately start the process. \nShould the county Legislature (currently in Republican hands but members are up for election Nov. 3) back his proposal, cities could then exercise their power to levy their own sales tax. \nThe GOP candidate says the cities would fare better under his plan because they could only levy half of the county’s current 3 percent level. \n‘Modernize formula’ \nNo community should carry on forever under an outdated agreement, Walter said, especially if demographics so radically change. \n“The City of Buffalo is in the best economic shape than in the last 50 years,” he said. “We either modernize this now or we never will.” \nWeinstein scoffs at the legal impediments that opponents of Walter’s plan say will derail the idea, suggesting negotiations can overcome anything. \nHe said the idea is not new, but was hashed out while he served in the county Legislature. It went nowhere, Weinstein said, only because the lack of GOP clout at the time prevented any traction. \n“It’s fair, and we’ve long complained the City of Buffalo and the other two got two bites of the apple,” he said. “We just didn’t have enough votes to make it a big deal.” \nBut it’s also a sure bet that political realities present huge obstacles for Walter, aside from the challenge of getting elected. \n“I have not seen any enthusiasm for this whatsoever,” Brown said. “People in the suburbs and in the city feel good about each other and very good that the second largest city in the State of New York is in a good place.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:46:40.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
