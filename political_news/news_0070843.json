Five open-government groups are calling for Governor Raimondo to order state agencies \"to promote transparency\" in responding to requests for public records. The groups cited a \"series of troubling responses\" to records requests, saying, \"They warrant decisive action on your part in order to address the lackadaisical interest in a strong APRA.\" Raimondo’s spokeswoman said, \"Our administration takes transparency seriously\" and it plans to meet with the groups. Providence College political science Prof. Joseph P. Cammarano said controlling the message is essential to a winning campaign, but governing requires a greater degree of openness. Also, he cited John Milton’s thoughts on \"liberty vs. license,\" saying, \"There is a duty to serve the public in a manner consistent not just with the letter of the law but the spirit and intent of the law — particularly in Rhode Island, with its long history of opacity. If this were Minnesota, I wouldn’t be as worried.\" YouGottaBeKiddingMe The state Department of Children, Youth and Families received $24,000 in grants to support \"wellness initiatives,\" but a new state audit makes you wonder whose wellness was being supported. The audit found DCYF transmitted that money to the Center for Southeast Asians, and the nonprofit hired then-DCYF Executive Director Janice DeFrances as a consultant, paying her $9,851. The audit says DeFrances \"may have violated the state Code of Ethics by serving as a paid consultant to an agency vendor for whom she has the ability to award work.\" It says she circumvented state purchasing rules. It says she received $1,018 of that money after she retired. (Governor Raimondo wisely did not reappoint her.) And it says she received $681 for \"miscellaneous expenses such as: restaurants, supplies and an alcohol purchase.\" Well, cheers! But it’s hard to see how any of that contributes to the wellness of the children DCYF is supposed to care for and protect.
