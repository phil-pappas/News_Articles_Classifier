Goldberg wrote that it was “out of an abundance of caution.”\nThe Brookline Democrat did, however, seek guidance from the state Ethics Commission before filing the disclosure, in which she vowed to abstain from handling any deals with J.P. Morgan Securities, where her husband works as a financial adviser.\n“The fact that the Treasurer filed this general disclosure on Sept. 25 ... should not be misconstrued to mean that she participated in a substantive manner on matters involving J.P. Morgan Securities LLC prior,” Chandra Allard, a Goldberg spokeswoman, said in an email. “To be clear, she has not.”\nThe Sept. 25 filing came on the same day Goldberg disclosed that her office awarded $300 million in notes to J.P. Morgan as part of a $1.2 billion sale.\nIt follows a May disclosure in which she revealed that J.P. Morgan had also won the right to sell $100 million in bonds.\nIn both cases, Goldberg’s office said the sale was competitive, meaning the treasurer’s office automatically awards the contract to the lowest bidder and all bids are sealed.\nGoldberg also wrote that, to the best of her knowledge, her husband, Michael Winter, wasn’t part of J.P. Morgan’s pursuit of the contract.\nThe decision doesn’t erase all questions, according to one watchdog.\n“While it’s a commendable step, her measure falls short, because she still has say over firms that compete with her husband’s firm,” said Mary Z. Connaughton, director of government transparency at the Pioneer Institute. “It will be a lingering issue. There’s no easy way to resolve it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:17:46.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
