The individual submissions were overwhelmingly from men (82%); more than one-third of them came from people who were retired.\nSubmissions came from organisations of various sizes, most of which were not-for-profit organisations, peak bodies and companies including professional services firms, unions, social welfare groups and religious organisations. The main industries making submissions were financial and insurance services, professional, scientific and technical services.\nThe next main step is the release of a green paper this year ahead of next year’s white paper.\nTax Superannuation Tax white paper You might also like Greens leader Richard Di Natale made a deal with the government to allow changes to the pension.
