'Ghanaians are demanding a new register'', ''Say no to a bloated register'', 'Say no to ECOWAS register'' and among others. \nMr David Asante, National Coordinator of the pressure group, Let My Vote Count Alliance said the group was genuinely calling for a new voter's register for the country to have a peaceful and credible election in 2016. \nHe indicated that all the consultations done by the electoral Commission on the voters register shows that majority of Ghanaians were calling for a new voters register, adding that, there is no choice for the Electoral Commission other than to hear the voice of the people. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:05:53.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
