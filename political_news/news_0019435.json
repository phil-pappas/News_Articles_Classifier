Now, Democrats seeking to reclaim the majority are hoping to unseat Arnold and a string of other Republicans. At the very least, they hope to fend off a Republican supermajority of 74 seats in the 122-member House. A supermajority would erase a key Democratic check on taxing and spending bills, which require 60 percent of votes to pass.
