Every politician tries to convince people that they are that kind of leader; almost none are - Paul is,\" Romney said in an emailed comment.\nRyan's spokesman Brendan Buck noted, however, that Ryan had repeatedly said he is not seeking the speaker's job. \"Chairman Ryan appreciates the support he's getting from his colleagues but is still not running for speaker,\" Buck said.\nFinding a replacement for Boehner has consumed Republicans as Congress faces a series of pressing decisions, from raising the government's borrowing authority to funding federal agencies through September. Boehner announced September 25 that he would leave the post on October 30.\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, who wants Ryan to run, said after speaking to Ryan as Ryan was preparing to catch a plane home: \"He needs to talk with his family first. But I'm optimistic.\"\nIn Ryan's hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, some of his constituents said they believed he would be better off staying on as head of the Ways and Means Committee and keeping a lifestyle that would still allow him to spend time with his family.\n\"Right now he has young kids and that has to be his top priority,\" said Rick Mueller, 53, who owns a printing company in the town of about 65,000 northwest of Chicago. The speaker's job comes with a $49,500 raise and an office with one of the best views in Washington, not to mention unequalled Capitol Hill power: Whoever holds the spot is second in line, after the vice president, for the U.S. presidency.\nNeighbors say Ryan, 45, is an avid hunter and regularly attends his childrens' cross-country meets in Janesville.\nMegan Caulfield, 51, who grew up in Ryan's neighborhood, said: \"Paul doesn't strike me as a type of person to succumb to pressure but I think he would do it out of a sense of responsibility to the party and if he feels he can make progress.\"\nPLEA FOR PARTY UNITY\nBoehner made a plea for unity at a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, urging members to \"truly listen to each other and have an open mind about how we can come together,\" according to a source in the room.\n\"It's not helpful for one group of members to say they will only vote for this candidate on the floor,\" Boehner said, in apparent reference to the conservative Freedom Caucus. It has about 40 members and is aligned with the small-government Tea Party movement.\nEarlier this week, the Freedom Caucus endorsed Representative Daniel Webster of Florida for speaker, raising doubts Californian McCarthy could get enough votes to win on the House floor. Admitting he was shocked by McCarthy's sudden pullout, Boehner told Republicans he intended the election to happen before the end of October.\nAmong items immediately facing Congress is something Republicans generally are reluctant to do: raise the debt ceiling. The Treasury Department says the government will need to increase its borrowing limit by November 5.\n\"The most recent development in the speaker's race plus the compressed time frame to come to a resolution increases the chances of a policy mistake around the debt ceiling,\" said Libby Cantrill, an analyst for Pacific Investment Management Co.\nMcCarthy's departure left Webster and Oversight committee chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah in the race. But Chaffetz said on Friday that he, too, backed Ryan and would drop out if Ryan changed his mind.\nHours before McCarthy withdrew from the race Thursday, some Republicans received emails accusing McCarthy of an affair with Republican Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, two lawmakers told Reuters. McCarthy has denied that any personal misdeeds were behind his decision to quit the race. Ellmers condemned \"false accusations\" in a statement released Friday.\n\"As someone who has been targeted by completely false accusations and innuendo, I have been moved by the outpouring of support and prayers from my colleagues, constituents and friends. Now I will be praying for those who find it acceptable to bear false witness,\" Ellmers' statement said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:19:33.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
