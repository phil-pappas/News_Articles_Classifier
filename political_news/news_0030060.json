Sometimes, they have riots,\" he said.\nIn Britain, too, the police are finding it hard to do their policing duties in London, with minority communities there believing that the police are \"not on their side\".\nMr Lee said similar issues also exist in South-east Asia.\nPraising the police here for having bucked the trend, he said, to applause from the audience: \"That is very, very remarkable.\"\nTham Yuen-C\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times on October 05, 2015, with the headline ''Very remarkable' that S'pore police seen as fair by different races: PM'.
