Committee chairman Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) disparaged the previous committees for failing “to interview so many witnesses and access so many documents,” though he also admitted that the all-day questioning of Clinton failed to reveal anything new. \nIn all, Clinton has spent almost 14 hours being publicly questioned about Benghazi. After a horrific terrorist attack occurred on September 11, 2001, during George W. Bush’s presidency, he spent one hour testifying to the 9/11 commission. That hour of testimony took place in private, and without even the full committee in attendance. \nBush spent a comparatively tiny amount of time answering questions about the prevention and handling of the much larger attack. And that’s in spite of a great deal of evidence that Bush did not take threats of a terrorist attack by Osama bin Laden inside the U.S. seriously enough , and did not take appropriate steps to make such an attack less likely.
