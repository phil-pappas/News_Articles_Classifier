(DontChaKnow = 24 points!) None of those? Good. Because I have a better offer. \nGrayson is offering the luck-donor airfare, park tickets, hotel stay and concludes… \nIf the Congressman from Disney World tells you it’s fun, then it’s fun. \nI want to give one lucky supporter a chance to have that fun, together with one even luckier guest. Who would you bring with you? \nBy the way, if you would rather not have dinner with me, that’s OK. We’ll have lunch instead. Or even breakfast, if you insist. I’m giving you plenty of leeway here. \nWARNING: If you don’t participate, you’ll miss out on a chance to create a lifelong memory, break Mickey-bread with me, and help our campaign return progressive values to Our Nation’s Capital \nGrayson is currently in a contentious Democratic primary with his fellow Congressman Patrick Murphy and has trailed in the fundraising department. While the polling has been trending his way, it’s likely Grayson will have to continue to tap his own personal fortune to stay competitive. He trails only Barack Obama and Senator Elizabeth Warren in the number of nationally active small donors, it’s likely his offer will have many takers.
