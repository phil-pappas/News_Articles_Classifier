I have seen everything throughout the years and I am very proud to be a member here. I am honored to be able to serve as the anniversary chairperson and give something back to the church and community I love.”\nAnniversary Event Co-Chair Elisha Thompson, said, “This was an amazing event and the turnout shows just how important the church is to this community.”\nThe church is located at 12-16 W. 108th St., between Central Park West and Manhattan Ave., with a membership of about 350 parishioners. (It is not to be confused with the Southern Baptist Convention, a national association of churches).\nIn 2012, Southern Baptist Church made history when the Rev. Eva Duzant was ordained as the first female minister in its then 90-year history.\nDuzant, now assistant to Pastor Roberson, said, “Southern Baptist Church is a special place with a long and distinguished history of fellowship and serving the greater Harlem community.\n“I am honored to serve and worship here,” Duzant said. “We have all been blessed by Southern for 93 years and God is still working through His people here.”\n-30-\nFor more information about Southern Baptist Church, Contact: Eva Duzant | (212) 663-6549.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:19:22.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
