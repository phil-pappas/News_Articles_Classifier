We said we will sincerely try. After that, saying that you have to 'announce today, announce now'...we can only say what we can do,\" Rao said.\nAs the Opposition MLAs entered the Well of the House and raised slogans, the Speaker asked Legislative Affairs Minister T Harish Rao to move the motion for suspension of the members.\nMembers of MIM and a few from Congress and TDP were not among those suspended.\nThe Opposition members have been demanding that the TRS government waive the farmers' loan, an election promise of the ruling party, in one go, instead of doing so in a phased manner.\nThe waiver of loans would help in putting an end to the ongoing suicide by farmers due to distress, they said.\nHitting out at the TRS government, Opposition leader (Congress) K Jana Reddy alleged that the government did not rise to the occasion when the farmers have been in distress.\nThe government tried to muzzle the voice of Opposition with the suspension, BJP floor leader K Laxman charged.\nStates: Telangana MLAs suspended Telangana assembly Monsoon Session Also Read Telangana House session not to be extended Opposition alleges attack by TRS ‘Adulterated’ Heritage Milk Rocks Telangana Assembly TRS goes to the house stronger, after opposition MLAs and MLCs join the party", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151005/nation-politics/article/30-opposition-mlas-suspended-telangana-assembly", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Assembly-session_1_0_2_0_0_3_0.jpg", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Assembly-session_1_0_2_0_0_3_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-06T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:20:12.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
