All times local:\n1:05 p.m.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel says it is important to try to quickly integrate a flood of newcomers into society, stressing the importance of jobs, education and learning the German language.\nMerkel said in her weekly podcast Saturday that Germany had learned its lessons from the 1960s when a wave of migrants arrived as \"guest workers.\" It was thought they would eventually return home but instead many have remained for generations.\nShe says less-educated refugees should be given training to help get them jobs, and that children should be quickly put into schools.\nMerkel is proposing a 600-hour integration course to help refugees learn the language and culture, which could begin even before asylum is officially granted.\nGermany's also implementing new rules to quickly send home migrants who don't qualify for asylum.\n___\n12:45 p.m.\nAn official in Cyprus says a \"small number\" from the 114 migrants whose two boats landed at a British air base earlier this week have claimed asylum.\nBase spokeswoman Connie Pierce says RAF Akrotiri \"is not a route through which people will be able to get to the U.K.\"\nPierce said Saturday that base authorities are working with the Cyprus government to process the mostly Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian nationals and handle all asylum claims.\nShe said a temporary facility is being set up on base territory to house the people if it's deemed necessary to move them.\nBritain fears that its two sovereign bases on Cyprus could be seen by traffickers as an easy back door to Britain.\n___\n12:40 p.m.\nAuthorities say thousands more migrants arrived overnight in the locality of Berkasovo in western Serbia on the border with Croatia.\nThey're part of the flood now trying to make to Western Europe via Croatia and Slovenia instead of Hungary, which has erected high, razor-wire fences along its borders with Serbia and Croatia.\nNiklas Stoerup Agerup, a field protection officer with the U.N. refugee agency, said Saturday some 3,000 migrants arrived at the border with Croatia overnight.\nBut he says people are moving along on buses through the night. He says there's been a \"continuous outflow of people as well as an inflow.\"\nMahmoad Al Haj was among those waiting.\n\"I have a degree in economy,\" says the 30-year-old Syrian. \"I want to make a job in Denmark.\"\n___\n12:30 p.m.\nThousands of migrants are shouting 'I need go' as they wait in an overcrowded migrant center in Slovenia to move on toward Western Europe.\nTensions were building again Saturday at the Brezice camp near the border with Croatia where a fire broke out burning down several tents earlier this week.\nMigrants at Brezice are waiting for transport further west to Austria. Thousands are packed behind metal barriers guarded by riot police and armored vehicles.\nThe migrant flow has slowed down in tiny Slovenia which has complained it lacks manpower and equipment to handle the influx of tens of thousands of people crossing through the country.\nThe so-called Balkan migrant route switched to Slovenia a week ago when Hungary closed its border with Croatia forcing the tide to move.\n___\n11:00 a.m.\nAmnesty International is warning of a humanitarian disaster unless countries on the Balkans migrant route come up with a plan at a summit this weekend on how to tackle the crisis.\nThe group's branch in Slovenia said in a statement Saturday that migrants are still often forced to sleep outside on their way to Western Europe, and that conditions will become more severe as winter set in.\nThe group says Sunday's summit in Brussels of several EU and Balkan nations must result in a solution.\nLeaders \"must not walk away from another meeting without a feasible plan on how to protect the needs and rights of the refugees,\" the group insists.\n___\n10:45 a.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:18:07.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
