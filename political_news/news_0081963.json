The Conservatives made a net gain of one, thanks to three wins in Lib Dem seats. \nStuart Wilks-Heeg, head of politics at Liverpool University, said: “The Tories really made no headway in the north in 2015.” \nTheir vote share declined slightly while Labour’s rose 4.6 per cent. In 2010 they gained 23 seats. Conservative public service cuts have hit poorer northern areas hardest. \nThe party has just 100 members in Liverpool, a city of 466,000. \nYet still Mr Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor, continue to promote the north and cut devolution deals with Labour council leaders, risking the ire of southern Tory-supporting shires. \nSo is there any chance of an electoral gain in an area where many still blame the party for the brutal deindustrialisation of the 1980s when millions lost their jobs? \nMr Cameron’s speech recounted the dramatic night of election victory ; he did not say that his last engagement was a visit to Chester, his third during the campaign. He could not prevent the walled cathedral city falling to Labour. \nChris Matheson, who won by just 93 votes, said there were some local factors. The Conservatives also lost Cheshire West and Chester council. \n“There was a feeling the local council was arrogant and out of touch. We will work for the whole of Chester, not just a few bits of it.” There is a north-south divide. Always has been, always will be. David Cameron went to Eton. What has he got to say to me? I don’t trust him \n- Ryan Crewdson, fishmonger \nBut he added that many in the city were in the “squeezed middle”. “People know the current system is not working for them.” House prices are rising far faster than wages and some big employers in financial services have been cutting staff. \nMr Matheson’s decision to oppose fracking was also crucial. The Greens opted not to run and most probably lent their votes to Labour. They were also absent in Wirral West, where shadow minister Esther McVey was the Tory’s highest profile casualty. \nThe former Unite union official said his local background also helped him fend off a challenge from the UK Independence party. The eurosceptics targeted Chester’s council estates, bastions of Labour support, and more than doubled their share of the vote to 8.1 per cent. \nMr Matheson said local Labour party membership had doubled to 1,000 since the election, driven by enthusiasm for new leader Jeremy Corbyn . More video \nMike Jones, leader of the Conservatives on the council, said local issues were to blame. “We ran a boring campaign.” But he said the absence of the Greens helped Labour and they also won more Lib Dem deserters. \nThe Northern Powerhouse , which involves linking the big northern cities together to create a rival economy to London, would not win votes in the short term. “But maybe in 10-20 years’ time. It will be when people actually feel the impact of the new railway lines, the new investment.” \nJames Wharton, the Stockton South MP who is Northern Powerhouse minister, told a fringe meeting that backing the north was the “right thing to do” but that it might “potentially” bring electoral reward. \nSome Tory voters in Chester agree. Graham Skilton, 66, a retired dental surgeon popping out for a sandwich, said: “If they improve the North-west and make us a satellite of big cities in Liverpool and Manchester they will win votes. It is all about jobs.” \nBut Ryan Crewdson, a fishmonger serving customers in Hoole high street, said: “There is a north-south divide. Always has been, always will be. David Cameron went to Eton. What has he got to say to me? I don’t trust him.” \nMr Crewdson, 38, said he voted for Ukip but could be persuaded to back Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. “So what if he didn’t sing the national anthem? Nor does Wayne Rooney.” \nMr Wilks-Heeg said the party was deluded if it thought it could get a metro mayor elected across a wider area such as Greater Manchester — not least because it lacked activists. “There is simply no chance of a Conservative revival in the big northern cities unless something absolutely seismic happens.” Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:37:15.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
