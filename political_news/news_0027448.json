Award guidelines are online at www.i-sba.org/pac .\nAbout Spina Bifida\nSpina Bifida is a birth defect that affects the spine and is usually apparent at birth. Spina Bifida occurs when a portion of the backbone that protects the spinal cord, as well as the spinal cord underneath, do not form correctly during the pregnancy. This often results in damage to the spinal cord and nerves. Spina Bifida can cause physical and learning disabilities that range from mild to severe. Most children born with Spina Bifida live well into adulthood as a result of today's sophisticated medical techniques.\nMedia Contact:\nMatt Larsen\n773-444-0305\n releases/spina-bifida-research-award-announced-to-begin-awareness-month-300152436.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.i-sba.org/pac", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150930/272675", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150930/272676", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spina-bifida-research-award-announced-to-begin-awareness-month-300152436.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH16745&Transmission_Id=201510010840PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH16745&DateId=20151001"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:34:37.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
