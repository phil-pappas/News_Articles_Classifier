That new focus flipped a broad-based probe of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012, into what Podliska described as \"a partisan investigation.\" \nPodliska, who was fired after nearly 10 months as an investigator for the Republican majority, is now preparing to file a lawsuit against the select committee next month, alleging that he lost his job in part because he resisted pressure to focus his investigative efforts solely on the State Department and Clinton's role surrounding the Benghazi attack. He also alleges he was fired because he took leave from the committee to fulfill his military service obligations, which would be an unlawful firing. \n\"I knew that we needed to get to the truth to the victims' families. And the victims' families, they deserve the truth -- whether or not Hillary Clinton was involved, whether or not other individuals were involved,\" he told CNN in an exclusive TV interview that will air Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" \"The victims' families are not going to get the truth and that's the most unfortunate thing about this.\" \nPodliska told CNN that the committee, which has spent $4.6 million so far and is chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina, pulled resources away from probes of other individuals and agencies to focus almost exclusively on Clinton and the State Department she helmed for four years. Clinton will testify before the committee for the first time October 22 and the committee is set to release the findings of its investigation next year, in the heat of the presidential race. \nPodliska alleges that the committee's staff director told him he was fired for three reasons: using work email to send a social invitation to colleagues, assigning an \"unauthorized project\" to an intern and allegedly putting classified information on an unclassified system. Podliska, an intelligence officer who was hired for his expertise with the intelligence community, strongly denies the latter. He also disputes the legitimacy of the other two reasons cited to him by the committee, in particular assigning any \"unauthorized projects\" to interns. \nA commitee spokesperson \"vigorously\" denied Podliska's allegations about why he was fired and the objectivity of the committee's investigation. \n\"We are confident that the facts and evidence give no support to the wild imagination fueling these and any future allegations, and the Committee will vigorously defend itself against such allegations. The Committee will not be blackmailed into a monetary settlement for a false allegation made by a properly terminated former employee,\" the committee spokesperson, who declined to be named, told CNN in a statement. \nThe committee statement also fired back at Podliska, accusing the former investigator of his own bias in his work on the committee, a claim Podliska's lawyer firmly denied. \nThe statement added that Podliska had never previously accused the committee of conducting a biased investigation targeting Clinton, though Podliska said he repeatedly made the case to his superiors that the committee's work should be more all-encompassing. \nPodliska said he decided to come forward because the committee's skewed focus is detracting from the objective of uncovering the truth surrounding the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens: \"What happened was wrong,\" Podliska said. \n\"I'm scared. I'm nervous. I know that this is, you know, I'm going up against powerful people in Washington. But at the end of the day I need to live with myself,\" he said. \"I told my wife, I will view myself as a coward if I don't do the right thing here.\" \nHe insisted that his claim is not politically motivated, explaining that he has long been a conservative Republican -- \"more on the libertarian side\" -- and plans to vote for the GOP nominee in 2016. \n\"I am going to vote for the Republican nominee in 2016. I do not support Hillary Clinton for president,\" he said. \nThe accusation comes on the heels of House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's controversial comments linking the Benghazi committee's efforts to a downward slide in Clinton's poll numbers -- an admission that McCarthy later walked back but still helped sink his bid to become House speaker. \n\"Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right?\" McCarthy said less than two weeks ago. \"But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she's untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened had we not fought.\" \nDemocrats have seized on that gaffe as vindication that the committee was always a partisan witch-hunt aimed at sinking Clinton's presidential prospects. \nBut Podliska, who served nearly 10 months on the committee before he was fired in late June, said the committee's probe started out as a veritable fact-finding mission before it became an exercise in partisan politics. And unlike Democrats, he hopes that the committee won't be dismantled, but steered back toward its original mission. \nIt was only in the weeks following the March 2 revelation about Clinton's email server in The New York Times that the committee's inquiry \"changed to focus on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the State Department, and deemphasize the other agencies that were involved in the Benghazi attacks and the aftermath of the attacks,\" according to a draft of the lawsuit Podliska's lawyers provided to CNN. \nWhen Podliska returned from nearly two weeks of Air Force service at the end of March, he said fellow committee staffers told him the committee's inquiry had become an \"agency-centric investigation.\" \nDays after the Times story, the committee subpoenaed all of Clinton's emails related to Libya and soon called on her to turn over her email server for forensic examination. Since March, 24 of the 31 press releases the committee issued have focused on Clinton. \n\"Hillary Clinton has a lot of explaining to do. We however did not need to shift resources to hyper focus on Hillary Clinton. We didn't need to deemphasize and in some cases drop the investigation on different agencies, different organizations and different individuals,\" Podliska said. \"There's wrongdoing here and I think it needs to stop.\" \nWhen pressed for details, Podliska said he was \"not permitted to get into any more details.\" He is still bound by a nondisclosure agreement that prevents him from sharing details of the investigation's findings. \nThe new focus will in fact prevent real wrongdoing from being uncovered, he believes, including the actions of other agencies and individuals whom he believes are \"culpable and should be held accountable for what they were doing\" -- including other Obama administration officials. \nThe committee spokesman who provided CNN with official comment denied the accusations of bias and said Podliska was guilty of his own bias after allegedly crafting a PowerPoint presentation that the spokesman said amounted to a \"'hit piece' on members of the Obama administration -- including Secretary Clinton.\" â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:27:43.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
