(AP) â€” Colorado Rockies manager Walt Weiss will return to the dugout next season after meeting with General Manager Jeff Bridich on Tuesday.\nThe Rockies are 208-278 under Weiss, and went 68-94 and finished last in the NL West this season. He has one year left on his contract.\nWeiss' players campaigned for his return in the waning days of the season, with third baseman Nolan Arenado saying, \"we haven't been able to win. That's not a reflection on him. He's doing a fine job.\"\nBridich told The Associated Press that he and Walt \"met for several hours today about the season and how we can get better with him back in 2016. It's going well and we will continue to meet.\"\nColorado traded All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto this season and the pitching staff had a league-worst 5.04 ERA. There were some positives, too, such as Arenado and Carlos Gonzalez combining to hit 82 homers and drive in 227 runs. Prized pitching prospect Jon Gray also showed some hints of his talent.\n\"I'm encouraged by some of pieces we have in place,\" Weiss recently said. \"I feel good about where we are headed. We have some ground to cover, but I feel good about it.\"\nThe 1988 AL Rookie of the Year with Oakland, Weiss played shortstop for the Rockies from 1994-97 and was a special assistant to the GM for several seasons.\nWeiss took over for Jim Tracy following the 2012 season and made the rare jump from high school coach to the big leagues.\n\"That's all I ever do is thinking about winning,\" Weiss said. \"I was fortunate to win a lot as a player. I played some of the greatest teams of our era. That's what I was used to.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
