He said:\nThe order of cuts that we're being asked to make, as a result of these proposals, are so massive that I cannot in honesty describe what the model of policing would be like in this county. What I can say is it would be unrecognisable to the model of policing that the public of Cumbria have at the moment, and that has very serious implications.\n£1m equals 30 police officers... we've got to make £26m more of cuts. I spent £3m on PCSO's, £5m on Police staff, who's job is it to support Police Officers, even if I was to get rid of all those tomorrow, it wouldn't even come close to the size of the cuts.\n– Chief Constable Jerry Graham Last updated Tue 13 Oct 2015 Read more 5 updates Cumbria Police funding cut by £26m Politics Cumbria", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:08:07.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
