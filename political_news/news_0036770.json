This is the fourth year in a row that Americans from across the political spectrum have expressed overwhelming support for efairness legislation to close the online sales tax loophole.\n\"The shopping center industry is a premier driver of economic activity and one way our centers accomplish this is through the collection and remittance of sales taxes, which provide communities the revenue they need to fund critical municipal services,\" said Tom McGee , president and CEO of ICSC. \"It's time to level the playing field so that online-only sellers compete under the same rules.\"\nThe national poll also found that eight out of 10 Americans think collecting sales tax from online-only vendors at the time of purchase is easier than the current system of self-reporting. This is the only national poll that has tracked attitudes among voters on these two issues for four consecutive years.\nThe national poll identified a number of key findings, including:\nSeven out of 10 Americans support federal legislation that would require online-only vendors to collect sales tax at the time of purchase. Eight out of 10 Americans think it would be easier to collect sales tax from online-only vendors at the time of purchase. Over half of Americans think that the current uneven playing field is inherently unfair and gives online-only vendors a clear, competitive advantage. Nine out of 10 Americans say local retailers are important to their community's economic health and prosperity. \"Year after year voters continue to voice overwhelmingly strong support for federal legislation that closes the online sales tax loophole and makes sure that all retailers are free to compete for customers and sales without the federal government picking winners and losers in the marketplace,\" said Betsy Laird , senior vice president of Global Public Policy for ICSC. \"Americans have spoken; it's time to pass efairness legislation.\"\nICSC has promoted efairness for more than a decade, advocating that a \"sale is a sale\" regardless of whether the purchase takes place on Main Street, at shopping centers, or over the Internet.
