George Osborne has described the current system as “unsustainable” and says changes to income tax and the introduction of a national living wage will compensate those affected. \nHowever, according to the latest statistics from the House of Common’s library, at least 214,000 families in the South West can expect to see their income decline as a result of the reform, with households set to lose an average of £1,300 a year. \nThe Labour party has conducted a constituency by constituency analysis of the findings, identifying a total of 71 Conservative seats across the UK where the candidate’s majority in May was slimmer than the number of affected claimants. It says these MPs risk losing their seats if the Government is allowed to continue with its programme of reforms. \nAmong those flagged up in the Labour report are Plymouth Moor View MP Johnny Mercer and Sutton and Devonport MP Oliver Colvile. According to the study, Mr Mercer’s constiuency majority of 1,026 is outweighed five to one by affected claimants, who total 5,400. While Mr Colvile’s majority of 523 is overshadowed by 4,300 affected families. \nHis opponent in May, Luke Pollard, said the Plymouth MPs “ought to think long and hard about the promise they and their party made to people not to cut tax credits”. “Labour will be opposing this cruel tax credit cut and I invite Plymouth’s Tory MPs to join us and in so doing prove they can be trusted to keep their election promises,” he said. \nOther seats highlighted include Yeovil in Somerset, St Ives in Cornwall and Torbay, South Devon. In Torbay, Mr Foster’s majority of 3,286 only makes up for around half the estimated 6,400 families set to see their income squeezed. \nFormer Lib Dem MP for the area, Adrian Sanders, said the reforms will hit a low wage area like the Westcountry “hard”. “It only required half a dozen Tory MPs to stand up for our region and threaten to rebel and the Government’s 12 vote majority would have crumbled,” he said. \nMr Foster responded that the “simplistic” Labour analysis reflects the party’s lack of “convincing answers” to the issues being raised by voters across Torbay. He added: “When the election comes in 2020 Torbay voters are unlikely to be convinced that Jeremy Corbyn is the man to lead our nation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:23:46.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
