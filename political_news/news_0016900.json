Chandrasekhar Rao fails to control farmer suicides by Dasara, he would launch a “KCR ko hatao, kisan ko bachao” campaign across the state.\nDr Reddy met Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan on Thursday to enlighten him about the severe drought conditions, farmer suicides, the conduct of the Assembly session and suspension of the entire Opposition from the House.\nElsewhere, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Mohd Ali Shabbir said that the just-concluded Assembly session exposed Mr Rao’s weakness.\n“He simply fulfilled a Constitutional obligation, enacted a drama for a few days and then ran away from debating public issues,” he alleged.\nMr Shabbir Ali said Mr Rao convened the session from September 23 to prevent his Cabinet from being dissolved. As per Article 85 of the Constitution, it is mandatory to convene Assembly session once every six months, he said.\nStates: Telangana South Telangana K Chandrasekhar Rao Also Read Telangana: Baby dies as mother allegedly not allowed to nurse him First session of Telangana Assembly begins today Telangana to evaluate teachers, give them incentives Nepal earthquake: Hyderabad techie missing from Everest base camp", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/kcr_12_1_1_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151009/nation-current-affairs/article/opposition-steps-attack-k-chandrasekhar-rao", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/kcr_12_1_1_1_0_0_0_0_1_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-09T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:50:25.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
