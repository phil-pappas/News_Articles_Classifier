But you can't make the Chinese the scapegoat.\"\nSir Vince added: \"There are real problems in the UK. I had endless problems with steel when I was in the government, before this China problem erupted, because our energy costs were too high.\n\"We got permission from the European Commission to compensate. The Treasury is sitting on the money, as I understand.\"\nThe commission last year cleared a UK plan to compensate certain energy-intensive industries - including steel - for higher costs resulting from its carbon price floor under state aid rules.\nSir Vince said Chinese investment was welcome - so long as it helped British suppliers.\n\"I would welcome Chinese investment in the nuclear power industry - you have got to have safeguards. But you'd insist that the Chinese develop a supply chain here of British producers,\" he said.\nShare article \"If they want to invest in these new railways, well great, providing they give an undertaking they'll get a lot of their stuff from the rail factories in Derby and Durham.\n\"That's why you have the industrial strategy we had under the coalition. I don't know what's happened to it since.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u="], "published": "2015-10-21T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:31:36.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
