Clinton later released a statement reiterating her opposition:\n\"I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was Secretary of State. I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don't believe this agreement has met it.\"\ni Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced Wednesday she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that the White House strongly supports. Jim Cole/AP hide caption\ni toggle caption Jim Cole/AP Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton announced Wednesday she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that the White House strongly supports.\nJim Cole/AP In her post-administration book Hard Choices, she called the agreement an important tool for engaging with Vietnam and for protecting higher standards for American businesses and workers.\nShe did, however, say she was reserving judgment and questioned an enforcement process called the investor-state dispute settlement. It lets companies doing international business go before an international panel of arbitrators, bypassing a country's own justice system.\nClinton's TPP opposition puts her in line with labor groups and progressives — such as her chief rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — who have come out against the deal. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, pushed through the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.\nThis is the second major policy shift for Clinton in recent weeks. Late last month, she announced her opposition to the Keystone XL Pipeline, which the Obama administration is still contemplating. In both instances, Clinton took much longer to reach decisions than her Democratic rivals.\nTPP still faces hurdles in Congress, though, the president now has fast-track authority on the deal — only a simple majority in the Senate is needed for its approval. But with many progressive Democrats opposing it, and even some conservatives lawmakers skeptical of it, it is far from a done deal.\nThe TPP is the largest regional trade agreement in history. The U.S., Japan and 10 other nations finished crafting a deal Monday that cuts trade barriers, sets labor and environmental standards and protects multinational corporations' intellectual property.\nBut the accord still faces a battle in Congress , which has 90 days to review the agreement before voting on it. The deal faces a lower legislative hurdle than most proposals in Congress.\ntrans pacific partnership trade agreement Congress President Obama Clinton", "external_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/whats-next-trans-pacific-partnership-trade-deal-selling/", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/Jeh-14A8Rbc?rel=0&start=0"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T00:25:48.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
