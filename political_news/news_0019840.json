The Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing Enforcement Act of 2015 (H.R. 774), which was cosponsored by Congressman David Jolly (FL-13), passed the House this summer. \n“The successful passage of the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Enforcement Act in the Senate is a major victory for the thousands of Americans living along the Gulf coast whose livelihood depends on healthy, sustainable fisheries.” said Jolly “This bill will strengthen enforcement mechanisms against those who illegally fish in our waters, and will provide important tools to those who protect this important resource for our recreational, commercial, and charter boat fishermen,” Jolly said following the Senate action.” \nThe bill now heads to the President for his signature. \nThe Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing Enforcement Act stiffens penalties for those caught illegally fishing in U.S. waters by potentially stripping poachers of their boats and equipment and laying the groundwork for criminal charges based on the laws of their home countries. \nAccording to the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Gulf of Mexico’s commercial and recreational fishing industries contributed more than $30 billion annually to the region’s economy in 2012. \nGlobally, illegal and unreported fishing accounts for up to $23.5 billion worth of seafood, or about one in every five fish taken from our oceans.
