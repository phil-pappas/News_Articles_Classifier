Regardless, it's expected to cause torrential downpours along the East Coast and bring flooding to many areas.\nHigh winds, rainfall and flooding will likely affect energy infrastructure along the eastern seaboard, the Energy Information Administration reports. Governors in Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, South Carolina and North Carolina have already declared states of emergency ahead of the storm.\n  Obama repeats call for gun control, says thoughts and prayers 'not enough' \"Somehow this has become routine,\" Obama said. \"We've become numb to this.\"\nBy Nicole Duran • 10/01/15 6:43 PM The agency says Joaquin will affect power transmission and distribution lines, petroleum refineries, natural gas processing plants and distribution terminals along the East Coast.\nIn predicting the storm, the agency is looking back at Hurricane Sandy, which hit the East Coast in 2012.\nSandy downed power lines and flooded electric substations, with 8 million people losing power. The storm also damaged fuel distribution networks and terminals for crude oil and petroleum. Many gas stations were without power, making them unable to pump gasoline.\nTo keep track of potential energy disruptions, use the EIA's interactive map located here. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Clinton: Trump stokes prejudice, paranoia \"He has been stoking prejudice and paranoia.
