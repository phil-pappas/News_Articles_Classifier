Bush — praising his call for immigration reform but saying the rest of his party never followed suit.\n“Think how much better our economy would be if the rest of his party got the message,” he said.\nThe crowd shouted so much praise for Obama that he had to tell them to stop so he could continue his speech.\n“I love you too, but I gotta tell this story,” the president said before beginning a story about former Rep. Ed Roybal — who helped start the CHC — on the night he proposed to his wife but was subsequently unfairly questioned by police.\n“We can imagine his fear and his humiliation, what had been a beautiful day had suddenly come an example of occurrences that were happening far too often,” Obama said.\nHe said the rhetoric today is “the same cruel impulse that Ed Roybal spent a lifetime fighting against.”\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:12:25.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
