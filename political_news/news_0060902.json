(AP Photo/Steve Helber)\nAssociated Press Oct. 24, 2015 | 3:21 a.m. EDT + More By JULIE PACE, AP White House Correspondent\nWASHINGTON (AP) — For months, Jeb Bush's campaign insisted it was too early.\nToo early to worry about the Republican presidential candidate's sluggish poll numbers. Too early to fret over the rise of unorthodox candidates like Donald Trump and Ben Carson. Too early to question if the one-time front-runner is merely a pedestrian candidate.\nBut now there are just over three months until primary voting gets underway. With Bush still mired in the middle of the crowded GOP field, some supporters fear it could soon be too late.\nOn Friday, Bush signaled to supporters that he understood the need to make a change.\nFaced with slower fundraising, the campaign announced sweeping spending cuts that will deplete staff at its Miami headquarters.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
