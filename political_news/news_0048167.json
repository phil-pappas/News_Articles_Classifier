As the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported, lifting the ban could increase the value of U.S. crude and incentivize domestic production, which puts downward pressure on global oil prices and the prices that consumers pay for fuel.\n\"Lawmakers are ready to harness those benefits, and today's vote shows that bipartisan momentum is stronger than ever. We are eager to see this bill taken up in the Senate, where members of two committees have already endorsed efforts to lift the 1970s-era ban on crude exports. The time to act is now.\"\nAPI is the only national trade association representing all facets of the oil and natural gas industry, which supports 9.8 million U.S. jobs and 8 percent of the U.S. economy. API's more than 625 members include large integrated companies, as well as exploration and production, refining, marketing, pipeline, and marine businesses, and service and supply firms. They provide most of the nation's energy and are backed by a growing grassroots movement of more than 25 million Americans.\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/api-cheers-house-vote-for-crude-exports-300157361.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.api.org/news-and-media/news/newsitems/2015/september-2015/api-eia-report-confirms-need-for-bipartisan-action-on-crude-exports", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/api-cheers-house-vote-for-crude-exports-300157361.html", "http://www.oilandexports.com/", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC24833&Transmission_Id=201510091353PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC24833&DateId=20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:24:14.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
