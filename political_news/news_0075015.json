Lindsey Graham, a 2016 contender himself, says voters should be wary of electing another \"novice.\"\nDuring an interview with the Washington Examiner, the Southern senator expressed concern that GOP voters are losing sight of what, he says, is the most redeeming quality in a potential president.\n\"I think the experience when it comes to being commander-in-chief does matter, and will matter more over time,\" Graham told the Examiner. \"We've elected one novice, let's not pick another.\"\nAsked specifically about Trump, Carson and Fiorina, the South Carolina senator described them as \"fine people.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/12/15 8:20 PM Rezaian, a dual U.S.-Iranian citizen, was accused by the court of reporting details of Tehran's nuclear program back to the United States government. But details of the verdict handed down to the Post correspondent, who has languished in prison for more than 14 months, are sketchy at best. The Post and the reporter's family point to the mystery surrounding his \"belated and opaque\" guilty verdict as proof of a sham trial.\n\"Rezaian faced four charges — the most serious of which was espionage — and it was not immediately clear whether he was convicted of all charges,\" the report noted. \"Rezaian and The Post have strongly denied the accusations, and his case has drawn wide-ranging denunciations including statements from the White House and media freedom groups.\"\nWorse still, it is unclear what sentence has been handed to Rezaian. All that is known at this time is that the judge who heard the case is known for imposing particularly harsh sentences, and that the reporter could face between 10 to 20 years in prison.\nThe guilty verdict is \"an outrageous injustice\" and \"contemptible,\" said post executive editor Martin Baron.\n\"Iran has behaved unconscionably throughout this case, but never more so than with this indefensible decision by a Revolutionary Court to convict an innocent journalist of serious crimes after a proceeding that unfolded in secret, with no evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing,\" he said in a statement.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Washington Post outlines what the president 'can do on gun laws' Following a mass shooting earlier this month in Obama said he is exploring ways to address gun violence.\nBy Becket Adams • 10/12/15 8:08 PM Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has suggested the idea of freeing Rezaian in exchange for Iranians who have been imprisoned by the United States for violating economic sanctions against Tehran. The United States government has so ignored this suggestion.\nEarlier, on Friday, authorities in Turkey arrested the editor-in-chief of an Istanbul-based English-language newspaper for posting tweets critical of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Associated Press reported.\nAs police hauled Today's Zaman editor-in-chief Bulent Kenes from his office by police, supporters reportedly chanted: \"Free media cannot be silenced!\"\n\"A court issued a warrant for his arrest for tweets that a Turkish prosecutor says insult Erdogan,\" the AP reported. \"Kenes, who received a suspended sentence earlier this year for insulting the president, denies the accusation, insisting he is exercising his right to free speech.\"\n\"Dozens of people have been prosecuted under a previously seldom-used law that bars insults to the president. Free speech advocates say the law is being used aggressively to muffle dissent,\" the report added.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Donald Trump, No Labels hero On  \nBy Byron York • 10/12/15 9:49 PM \nTop Story Trump, the No Labels frontrunner On  \nBy Byron York • 10/12/15 9:49 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:10:53.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
