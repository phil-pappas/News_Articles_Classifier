One easy life-saving act is to donate old phones to the HopeLine ® from Verizon program to support victims and local domestic violence organizations in Alabama .\nHopeLine from Verizon puts the nation's most reliable wireless network to work in the community by turning no-longer-used wireless phones into support for victims of domestic violence. Victims of domestic violence need help and the simple donation of a no-longer-used phone can be that lifeline. Proceeds from the HopeLine program are used to provide wireless phones and airtime to victims of domestic violence and cash grants to local shelters and non-profit organizations that focus on domestic violence prevention, awareness and advocacy. Consumers can donate their phones at Verizon Wireless Communications Stores or by mail using the postage-paid mailing label available at www.verizonwireless.com/hopeline .\n\"Verizon has a longstanding commitment to raising awareness of domestic violence, working with many organizations to help domestic violence victims across the state,\" said Jonathan LeCompte , president – Georgia /Alabama Region, Verizon Wireless. \"During DVAM this year, we encourage all Alabamians to join us in helping our neighbors live free from violence. Call your local domestic violence shelter or organization and ask how you can help. At the very least, Alabamians can dig through drawers, find no-longer-used phones and donate them to HopeLine.\"\nSince the launch of the HopeLine phone recycling program in 2001, HopeLine from Verizon has given out more than $29 million in cash grants and distributed more than 190,000 phones for use by domestic violence survivors.\nFor more information about HopeLine from Verizon and to learn how to organize a HopeLine drive during DVAM, go to www.verizonwireless.com/hopeline .\nVerizon Communications Inc.
