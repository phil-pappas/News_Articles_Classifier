Some 400 voting stations didn't open at all, it said.\nMain opposition candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo and other candidates will hold a press conference on the vote Monday, Diallo's party said.\nPresident Alpha Conde faced seven other candidates. He is favored to win, though many say it is likely he will face off against Diallo in a second round. The two were pitted against each other after the first round of 2010 voting, and clashes broke out along ethnic lines. Similar violence last week killed at least three people and injured about 50.\nSome 6 million Guineans were expected to vote at more than 14,800 polling stations watched by anti-riot police, gendarmerie and international observers.\nGuineans were angered in some areas in and around the capital, where voting materials arrived late or ran out. Some stations remained open late. Others said their votes ran smoothly.\nThe opposition last week called for a delay, but the electoral commission said everything was in order.\nIt is this West African country's second democratic presidential election in more than 50 years.\nGuinea endured decades of corrupt dictatorship after its independence from France in 1958. In 2008, after the longtime strongman died, a military coup led to tumultuous rule until the junta's leader agreed to go into exile. President Conde later won the country's first-ever democratic election in 2010.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Carley Petesch in Dakar, Senegal contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
