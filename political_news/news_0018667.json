We have, at the moment, got a two per cent (council tax) increase in the budget but that is because we don’t know what is going to happen in the Chancellor’s Autumn Statement. \n“It might be that we don’t have to do it but if we haven’t consulted on it, we can’t do it. We don’t find out our settlement (grant from the Government) until Christmas so we can’t be any more specific with what we are doing with council tax at this stage until then.” Promoted stories \nCllr Sanders added: “It doesn’t stop us continuing to drive efficiency. We have driven out a hell of a lot of costs since 2006. It has been £12million of costs which is approximately 25 per cent of our operating costs and yet we haven’t cut a single service.” \nThe local authority has created the new council plan two years ahead of schedule as it says it has been able to deliver most of the objectives in the Council Plan 2013 to 2017, including bringing John Lewis, Waitrose and Network Rail to the town. \nBut opposition councillors have hit out at the Council Plan. \nLeader of the borough’s Labour group, Cllr Paul Harvey , told The Gazette that the real issue was the services that had been cut or changed because of “many years of bad management of the budget”. \nHe added: “From our point of view we think the council needs a radical overhaul of how it runs itself for people because the big missing piece of the council plan is that it is focused on things and not focused on people. \n“The Conservatives will steal money from Popley and Brookvale and their New Homes Bonus which they got from having to cope with high levels of development. The fact they are trying to take that away is totally disgraceful and we are utterly opposed to that.” \nCllr Gavin James , leader of the local Liberal Democrats group, added: “Effectively the public is going to pay the price for Conservative inactivity on investments.\" \n“The Liberal Democrats proposed a number of years ago investing in green energy and the returns are far greater than any of the investments we have got at the moment. \n“These seven or eight per cent returns would be supporting the revenue budget of the council which would mean that we could carry on funding services. Share article \n“The Tories didn’t do it, they have left it too late and now of course central Government are winding down the investment in green energy which means it is not possibly as financially beneficial as it was when we proposed it. So it is a Tory failure and the public have to pay.” \nIf the consultation is agreed at the meeting, the public will have their say on the proposals between October 30 and December 14.
