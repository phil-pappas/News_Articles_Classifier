Our team has done well to lift the deal from where it stood at the Ministerial meeting in Maui. While I am very disappointed that the deal falls far short of TPP’s original ambition to eliminate all tariffs, there will be some useful gains for New Zealand dairy exporters in key TPP markets such as the US, Canada and Japan. Greater benefits will be seen in future years as tariffs on some product lines are eliminated.” \nMr Wilson said that the entrenched protectionism demonstrated by the US dairy industry in particular had ensured that the deal on dairy failed to reach its potential. \n- ENDS -", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:55:30.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
