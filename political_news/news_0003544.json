Charles Krauthammer told Bret Baier that Hillary did a very good job and the committee wasted too much time on Sidney Blumenthal: \nI think A.B. [Stoddard] right. The judge [Andrew Napolitano] said there are three audiences, the main audience that matters, unless she's indicted, is the people. American people watching this. They don't care about [Sidney] Blumenthal. \nShe had her way, when she lowered her voice, and talked about the sleepless nights , it was a gripping performance, which is the way I would put it so I can remain neutral on this. But showing that she really cared, et cetera or at least giving that impression. And that's what's going to be shown. \nHere's a roundup of a few other conservative voices that were not happy about Gowdy's committee: \nByron York: Benghazi bust \nSo a hearing billed as an epic, High Noon-style confrontation — granted, the hype came from the media, not Republican committee members themselves — instead turned out to be a somewhat interesting look at a few limited aspects of the Benghazi affair. In other words, no big deal. And that is very, very good news for Hillary Clinton. \nErick Erickson: The Benghazi Hearing Should Not Be, But Is, A Waste of Time \nIt was all a political spectacle. God bless Trey Gowdy for trying to learn the facts and understand what happened. But the rest of it was just a carnival road show of back bench congresscritters playing to the cameras and Hillary Clinton working hard to play persecuted victim. \nJohn Podhoretz: Hillary wins — theatrically — in Benghazi hearing \nThe GOP, damaged by Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s jaw-dropping gaffe about how the committee had done its work by making Hillary’s poll numbers fall, didn’t have much running room. And two of them, Reps. Mike Pompeo and Peter Roskam, squandered what little they had by veering off on weird tangents. ↓ Story continues below ↓ \nShe looked big. They looked small. She spoke like a person engaged with highly serious matters, and they mostly sounded as though they were niggling, fussing and poking ineffectually at her. \nStephen Hayes was much different on Fox News' Special Report than he was on Twitter. On Fox News he was praising the committee and hoping Hillary was going to jail. but on the twit, he was much more even handed: Roby just overreached. No need to accuse HRC of not caring about the #Benghazi survivors. That's supposition. Stick to facts. \n— Stephen Hayes (@stephenfhayes) October 22, 2015 Pompeo's second round of questioning was snarky in tone and ineffective in substance. A net negative. \n— Stephen Hayes (@stephenfhayes) October 22, 2015 \nThe Daily's Caller's Matt Lewis said this: Unless something happens, it's starting to look like Hillary Clinton won't merely survive this hearing -- she will have come out on top. \n— Matt Lewis (@mattklewis) October 22, 2015 \nAnd of course you can always count on hacks like Hugh Hewitt to try and turn lemons into wine - or is it lemonade? . @LindseyGrahamSC \"What she is trying to do is marginalize the hearing through body language...she's trying to undercut the impact\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:15:32.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
