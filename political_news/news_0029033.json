State regulators and the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced on Friday that they are winding down the co-op operations of the insurer, called Health Republic. Given Health Republic's financial situation, commencing an orderly wind down process before the upcoming open enrollment period is the best course of action to protect consumers, Anthony Albanese, New Yorks acting superintendent of financial services, said in a statement. Twenty-one of 23 co-ops nationwide were losing money as of Dec. 31, the inspector general report found. Furthermore, enrollment was falling below projections for 13 of the 23 plans Another ObamaCare nonprofit bites the dust | TheHill Everyone in the industry at the outset of the first open enrollment could have told them this was coming. That first year the Co-Ops were priced significantly lower then almost all other companies....there was simply no way they could recoup their payouts especially given the clientele that this was designed to help. The Gov never took in enough to cover those losses and therefore the catastrophe that the risk corridors were designed to mitigate never happened. The payouts that DID happen were not nearly enough. It's not enough to say we are bringing more \"competition to the market place and then then set them up so that they would fail.
