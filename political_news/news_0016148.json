(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated Press) Comments \nCalifornia will become the second state after Oregon to automatically register voters using drivers license data. \nCalifornia Gov. Jerry Brown on Saturday signed legislation that could eventually lead to the registration of as many as 6.6 million people in the nation's largest state who meet the eligibility for voting but are not now on the voting rolls. \nThe Oregon Legislature approved the registration measure -- known as the New Motor Voter Law earlier this year, delivering Gov. Kate Brown one of her first victories as governor. She had first pushed for the measure as secretary of state. \nVoters around the country have long had the ability -- under a federal motor voter law -- to register to vote at DMV offices. But under the Oregon and California laws, the DMV data will be automatically used by elections officials to register voters if they are citizens and meet other voting criteria. Prospective voters will then be sent a notice giving them the chance to opt out of being registered. \nBrown signed the automatic voter registration bill and 12 other election-related measures that he said in a statement would \"help improve elections and expand voter rights and access in California.\" \nCalifornia Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in a statement that the legislation would \"remove a key barrier to voting.\" \nPadilla added: \"Citizens should not be required to opt-in to their fundamental right to vote. We do not have to opt-in to other rights, such as free speech or due process. The right to vote should be no different.\" \nIn Oregon, automatic registration was supported in the Legislature by all but one Democrat and opposed by every Republican. Supporters said it would provide greater access, particularly those who move frequently or are less engaged with the political system. \nCritics raised privacy concerns about transferring DMV information to voter rolls and said people should take affirmative steps to register if they want to participate in the political process. \n--Jeff Mapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:27:35.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
