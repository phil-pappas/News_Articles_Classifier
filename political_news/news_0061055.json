He was sentenced to 18 months of probation, fined $1,500 and required to do 80 hours of community service. \n\"You clearly made a mistake. It's forgivable. Move on,\" said Circuit Judge Douglas Van Dyk, who noted that Pottle had no criminal record and a history of volunteer work in Molalla. \nPottle did not make a statement during his sentencing and declined comment outside the courtroom. \nIt is unclear whether he has any college degree. \nPottle was elected to the Molalla City Council in 2010 and was re-elected in 2014. \n\"I believe integrity, honesty, education and listening to community needs are vital keys to building a firm foundation for Molalla to keep growing and moving forward,\" Pottle said in his 2014 Voters' Pamphlet statement. \nCriminal charges for misleading statements in the guide are uncommon, Flanagan said. \nFormer West Linn Mayor Patti Galle pleaded guilty in 2010 in Clackamas County Circuit Court to knowingly making a false statement on an official election document. She admitted to lying about her education credentials when running for mayor in 2008. \nGalle received three years on probation, was fined $5,000 and ordered to perform 120 hours of community service. \n-- Steve Mayes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:56:03.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
