Officials said the Arab gunman shot and killed the Israeli soldier and wounded the others before being shot and killed himself by security forces. \nOther amateur video shows what was initially thought to be a second attacker, but turned out to be an Eritrean migrant mistakenly shot by Israeli security forces. The man is seen being pinned to the ground with a metal stool as bystanders kick him. The man later died in hospital. \nIn the last three days alone there have been six separate attacks against Israelis, and a wave of protests. But the increased security measures have done little to curb the escalating violence. \nOn Sunday police tried to diffuse the mounting tension by blocking off Arab neighborhoods in East Jerusalem. But there is concern the move could serve only to incite more anger. \nThe month of violence first began amid rumors that Israeli politicians wanted to completely block Palestinian access to the revered Al-Aqsa Mosque, which sits on the same compound known to Israelis as the Temple Mount. \nThe Israeli government has insisted repeatedly that it has no intention to change the status quo for visitation rights at the site holy to both religions, and Secretary Kerry on Monday insisted there was no need for an international monitoring force at the site, as proposed by the French at the United Nations. \n\"We don't contemplate any change, but nor does Israel,\" Kerry said Monday during a visit to Madrid. \n\"Israel understands the importance of that status quo. What is important is to make sure everybody understands what that means. We are not seeking some new change. We are not seeking outsiders or others to come in,\" he said in reference to the French proposal. \nWhat Kerry did call for was \"clarity\" from Israel on its stance regarding Al-Aqsa, and an urgent effort by both sides to calm the violence. \nKerry is to meet this week with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian leaders to try and \"find a way of making certain that everybody is clear with what is happening with respect to the Temple Mount.\" \nStabbings have been the hallmark of the attacks in Israel but as more guns are being used, Israeli civilians are taking matters into their own hands. \nThe Krav Gun Shop and Shooting Range in Jerusalem was packed Sunday as Israelis clamored to buy guns. \nJerusalem resident Aryeh Freidman was among those applying for permits and shooting tutorials. \n\"I think it's important in these cases to have a means of self defense,\" he told Vigliotti. \nAn employee at the gun shop told CBS News they've had hundreds of requests for guns in the last week alone. He said even if they were open 24 hours a day, they couldn't keep up with the current level of demand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:53:30.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
