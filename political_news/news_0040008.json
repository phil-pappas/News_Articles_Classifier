Students present a prototype that they created for their Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition entry in New York.\nBy Ann Woo Oct. 8, 2015 | 11:48 a.m. EDT + More Thirty years ago, students used textbooks and spiral-bound notebooks. Today, they type up notes on laptops, do research on tablets and stay connected with friends through their mobile devices. The learning experience has evolved as we have moved to a more connected and tech-savvy society – so much so that the global education technology and smart classroom market is forecasted to grow by more than $50 billion over the next five years, according to a recent study by Research and Markets.\nSome have asked: \"Do we need more technology in our schools?\" To that, educators have answered with a resounding: \"yes.\" Not only do they believe that technology enables a more hands-on experience that allows students to better understand concepts and test theories, but 90 percent of U.S. teachers say modern technology in the classroom is important for students' success, according to a recent Samsung-sponsored GFK survey.\nTo address this, we have supplied schools across the country with technology through our Solve for Tomorrow Contest and surveyed more than 1,000 education professionals in the U.S. to better understand the resources available to them and how we can help provide them with professional development resources that highlight how to integrate technology into their lessons in a valuable way. Our hope is to see that students everywhere reap the benefits of technology in the classroom.\n[ READ: From Alfalfa to 'Old Smokey,' Students Use STEM to Solve Real-World Issues ]\nA recent survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that when used in moderation, students with access to technology do better, on average, than those with less interaction. Through the use of technology, in a meaningful way in their classrooms, teachers are able to cater to specific learning styles, engage students both in and out of the classroom, and encourage an increased level of student involvement and collaboration. The classrooms of today are equipped with devices such as interactive whiteboards and displays, dashboards, tablets, smartphones and other tools that have shifted the focus of traditional education and empowered students to use digital tools to solve problems.\nWe've seen this firsthand when students who were not previously interested in science learn to master the fundamentals of electrical engineering through fashion design-related activities or when fourth-graders in Los Angeles learn coding through fun, interactive activities.\nWe've seen that when some institutions lack a sufficient amount of equipment – such as individual science lab stations – to accommodate every student, they often turn to technology to bridge the gap, creating things like virtual biology laboratories. Through technology, educators are able to identify innovative ways to provide relevant information and new concepts to apply to the problem-solving process.\n[ READ: Teacher Reflects on the 'Perfect Storm' for Learning ]\nSource: Samsung-sponsored GFK survey\nThere are countless success stories that demonstrate how technology in the classroom can break down barriers and ultimately create a more inclusive learning environment. Take, for instance, the group of 85 students at Galena High School in Reno, Nevada, that entered Samsung's Solve for Tomorrow Contest. The team's objective was to design several pieces of adaptive equipment that would make day-to-day tasks – opening doors, drinking from water fountains, etc. – easier for students with disabilities at school.\nUsing everything they learned in their STEM education studies to complete their task, the students' project was chosen among five grand prize winners, earning their school nearly $140,000 in Samsung technology.\nRight now, through our Solve for Tomorrow Contest (which is open until Oct. 30), we're giving every school in the U.S. the chance to compete for approximately $2 million in technology and an opportunity to leverage it to create a better future for their communities.\nAs the largest technology company in the world, which relies on scientists, engineers and mathematicians to imagine and create the future, we believe that industry leaders have a role to play in ensuring that the leaders of tomorrow are being prepared today with the tools they'll need to make the world a better place for the generations to come.\nTechnology alone is not the key factor in this equation; it is how the technology is being used that makes the difference. When combined with traditional methods of teaching, technology can help create a fully immersive educational experience. Samsung is focused on turning that concept into reality by continuing to support students and teachers with technology and resources that address some of the implementation issues seen in schools today.\nThe evolution of the education process is in full swing. It is our mission to ensure that our future leaders are on board for the ride.\nTAGS: STEM education technology K-12 education computers Samsung", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0bw5%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Op-ed%3A%20Technology%20in%20the%20Classroom%20Is%20Gateway%20to%20a%20Brighter%20Future&summary=How%20technology%20is%20being%20used%20makes%20the%20difference%20in%20schools%2C%20Samsung%20says.&source=U.%20S.%20News", "http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/ccqcgz/education", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0bw5%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0bw5%3Fsrc=usn_su", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0bw5%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Op-ed%3A%20Technology%20in%20the%20Classroom%20Is%20Gateway%20to%20a%20Brighter%20Future", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0bw5%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Op-ed%3A%20Technology%20in%20the%20Classroom%20Is%20Gateway%20to%20a%20Brighter%20Future", "http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/students-computers-and-learning_9789264239555-en;jsessionid=1flbjl11s5eqi.x-oecd-live-03", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZe0bw5%3Fsrc=usn_fb"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:23:35.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
