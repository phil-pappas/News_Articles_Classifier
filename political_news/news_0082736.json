(AP) â€” A measure dubbed the \"Britney bill\" that would exempt stars who play at least four nights in Atlantic City from having to pay state income taxes on all shows in New Jersey that year is a step closer to becoming law.\nThe measure is the latest of many efforts to help the struggling seaside resort. It got its moniker because it encourages the sort of multinight engagements that Britney Spears, Celine Dion, Motley Crue and other artists have done in Las Vegas.\nIt was approved Monday by a state Senate committee. But a liberal think tank derided it as a \"silly\" waste of money.\nIt's sponsored by Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean and Senate Democrat James Whelan, who view it as a way to attract extended stands for A-list stars.\n\"There is tremendous value in the ability to consistently draw world-class entertainment here, especially considering widely successful A-lister residencies in Las Vegas, where there's no state income tax,\" Kean said. \"The more than 50,000 fans who paid to see A-list performer Maroon 5 in August gives a glimpse of how Atlantic City can transform into a premier entertainment destination, drawing tourists from the most densely populated Northeast Corridor, two of America's largest cities that are each less than two hours away, and from around the world via nearby international airports.\"\nThe bill would exempt artists from state taxes not only on their Atlantic City performance but also on shows at New Jersey venues including arenas in Camden, Trenton, Holmdel and Newark.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:10:35.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
