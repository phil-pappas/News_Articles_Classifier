Bobby Jindal's plan to use coastal restoration money to elevate Louisiana 1.\nThe timing of the ads are tied to a Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority board meeting scheduled for Oct. 21, where members are expected to vote on the proposal to use surplus money from $700 million in coastal restoration projects on the $350 million project to elevate the highway near Port Fourchon. The highway is part of the Coastal Master Plan, but the CPRA board has never voted to use money from the BP oil spill settlement for infrastructure.\nJindal's proposal -- which he's defended as important to economic development -- is allowed under the authority of the CPRA board. But opponents say the money should be used to restore coastal wetlands rather than build transportation projects, and the five groups say Jindal is \"trying to walk away from the state's commitment to preserve coastal funding for projects in the state's Master Plan.\"\n\"While the money from the BP criminal and civil fines will jump start our efforts to restore the coast, it won't come close to finishing the job,'' Steve Cochran, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta Coalition, said in a statement. \"Redirecting funds is a slippery slope that weakens our state's credibility, threatens our ability to secure future funding and puts our future at risk.\"\nThe coalition is being joined by the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Audubon Society and the National Wildlife Federation.\nPrint ads will run in seven newspapers over the weekend, including The Times-Picayune.\nGubernatorial candidates weighed in on the plan on Thursday (Oct. 8). (Check that story here. )\nJindal's office released this statement about the project on Thursday:\n\"The Louisiana 1 corridor's importance to both coastal restoration and Louisiana's economy, in addition to the global economy for that matter, is indisputable. That's why Louisiana has already invested $375 million in the LA1 corridor over the course of our administration. We will continue to seek funding and support opportunities for one of the most robust coastal zones in the country. The Louisiana 1 corridor ensures sustainability of restoration efforts, response capabilities and economic growth.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:25:37.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
