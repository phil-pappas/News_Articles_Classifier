That's right, pervs, soon we'll have five new ways to express the D in text message. Soon a dick could be represented by a carrot, a bumpy cucumber, a hefty baguette (if you're lucky), a potato (if you're not), or a croissant (we're not judging).\nFor those looking for vag, there is a taco, a pita, and the classic tulip. They need to get on that.\nWill any of the dick options actually surpass the eggplant as the best way to express a peen? We'll have to wait until June 2016 to find out, but here's hoping all of us get to use that baguette a lot in the future.", "external_links": ["http://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-candidates.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:29:18.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
