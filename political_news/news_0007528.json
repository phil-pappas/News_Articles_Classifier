Nikki Haley helps clean up a home in Forest Acres. (Cynthia Roldan/Staff) × FOREST ACRES — Gov. Nikki Haley spent Thursday evening wearing gloves, goggles and a facemask.\nThe Palmetto State’s governor was in one of the Midlands’ most devastated areas, Forest Acres, to help clean up a World War II veteran’s home.
