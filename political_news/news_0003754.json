Subcommittees of the group -- created by House Speaker Jay Lucas, R-Hartsville, in January -- will meet throughout the week to work toward improving the state’s rural schools. The subcommittees will discuss recommendations provided by plaintiffs from the Abbeville School District case, in which the state Supreme Court issued a ruling faulting both the Legislature and school districts for failing to provide a basic education for students in South Carolina’s impoverished rural areas. The Legislature has been tasked with coming up with that plan by the end of the 2016 legislative session with several interim target dates. The meetings come a week after Gov. Nikki Haley and other Republican leaders asked the court to throw out a Sept. 24 order that requires the Legislature produce a plan to improve education in rural and poor districts by Feb. 1. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit also filed a petition last week asking the court to waive intermediate deadlines in the General Assembly. The Educator Recruitment, Retention, Effectiveness, and Professional Development Subcommittee will meet 9 a.m. Tuesday, the Transportation and Facilities Infrastructure Subcommittee 1 p.m. Tuesday and the College and Career Pathways of High Quality Learning Opportunities in Elementary, Middle, and High Schools Subcommittee will meet 10 a.m. Wednesday. In the Senate, a Special Subcommittee in Response to the Abbeville Lawsuit also will meet 2 p.m. Wednesday with state Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman and other superintendents from Lexington, Saluda and Orangeburg. After a busy week last week with visits from several presidential candidates, this looks to be a quiet one for South Carolina as Republican hopefuls gear up for the CNBC debate on Wednesday. Democratic frontrunner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is scheduled to serve as the keynote speaker Friday at the Charleston Branch NAACP’s 98th annual Freedom Fund Banquet. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan could soon take over as House Speaker, with a vote expected to take place this week. After initially saying he was not interested in the job, he officially announced his intent to run for the spot last week.
