Steve Beshear says a new Ohio River bridge between downtown Louisville and southern Indiana is expected to open earlier than projected. \nMedia report Beshear announced Monday that the bridge, originally slated to open next year, will carry drivers by Christmas. He said the exact opening date hasn't been determined yet, but workers are ahead of schedule and on budget. \nBeshear said the bridge would temporarily carry two-way traffic as crews make more extensive improvements to restore the adjacent Kennedy Bridge, which currently carries Interstate 65 across the Ohio River. \nCrews broke ground on the long-awaited project in 2013. Beshear, who traveled to Louisville to make the announcement, said it was exciting to \"stand on a bridge that was for decades a nebulous vision.\" \nJoining him were Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, Indiana Lt. Gov. Sue Ellspermann and Jeffersonville Mayor Mike Moore, The Courier-Journal reported. \n\"I'm the happiest guy in the world right now.\" Moore said. Jeffersonville @MayorMikeMoore says it's obvious what the bridge will do for Ky, Ind., \"I'm the happiest guy in the world right now.\" — Lexy Gross (@lexygross) October 12, 2015 Jeffersonville @MayorMikeMoore says it's obvious what the bridge will do for Ky, Ind., \"I'm the happiest guy in the world right now.\" — Lexy Gross (@lexygross) October 12, 2015 \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
