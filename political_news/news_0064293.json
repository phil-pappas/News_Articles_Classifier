The woman involved had minor injuries, but she was with her two children, her 5 year old son, and her 8 year old daughter. The 8 year old girl was critically injured, according to the NY Daily News, with major head trauma, broken legs, and a broken pelvis. The other two children involved, a 7 year old girl and 11 year old boy, were also on the sidewalk and struck by the black livery cab.
