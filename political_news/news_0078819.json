(AP) â€” More than a week after historic rains inundated South Carolina, Interstate 95, the main north-south interstate on the East Coast is being reopened through the state.\nThe South Carolina Department of Transportation reports that the southbound lanes on a 16-mile stretch of the interstate reopened on Monday morning. The northbound lanes are expected to open late Monday or early Tuesday.\nThe interstate was closed as crews repaired 13 bridges spanning rivers and swamps along a low-lying section of the interstate.\nAlthough flood waters are beginning to recede in the state, dozens of bridges and hundreds of roads remain closed across the state.\nParts of almost state 225 roads and 100 bridges remain closed because of storm damage or so that their supports can be inspected.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
