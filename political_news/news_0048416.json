It recognises the need for copyright to reward creators for their works and to encourage their creation of new works, but it also recognises and supports the value generated from works in the public domain. LIANZA believes the loss and cost to the public from extending New Zealand's copyright term will outweigh any benefits that may come from such a move. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:14:38.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
