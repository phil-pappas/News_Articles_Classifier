Additionally, the Census Bureau will provide updates on other census topics, including 2015 National Content Test and 2016 Census Test activities.\nThe 2020 Census operational plan outlines key operations, the decisions made based on research and testing to date and a timeline for remaining decisions. The innovations planned for the 2020 Census will make it easier for people to respond and save taxpayers more than $5 billion over what it would cost using older methods.\nThe Census Bureau is releasing this plan five years prior to the 2020 Census - three years earlier than released for the last census. Through the smart use of technology and existing data sources, the 2020 Census can provide substantial taxpayer savings while maintaining a commitment to quality, accuracy and confidentiality.\nPresenters will take questions from on-site audience members following completion of their remarks.\nWhen: Tuesday, Oct. 6 , 1 to 4:30 p.m. EDT (detailed agenda to follow)\nWhere:\nU.S. Census Bureau Headquarters\n4600 Silver Hill Road, Census Auditorium\nSuitland, MD 20746\nWho:\nLisa Blumerman , associate director, Decennial Census Programs\nDeirdre Bishop , chief, Decennial Management Division\nLive Broadcast: Watch the event on \" Census Live .\"\nIf closed captioning is required: http://livewrite-ncc.appspot.com/attend?event=cb002\nRSVP: If you plan to join us in person, please RSVP by Oct. 2 to pio@census.gov .
