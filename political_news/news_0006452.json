Other cities have adopted the process, and O'Malley, now campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president, points to the agency's creation as a signature accomplishment of his mayoral tenure. \nRepublican Gov. Larry Hogan has already done away with O'Malley's StateStat program changing it into a new unit aimed at improving performance and customer service in state government. \nHogan issued an executive order creating the Governor's Office of Performance Improvement calling it an \"important step\" in his administration's effort to reduce waste and bureaucracy.
