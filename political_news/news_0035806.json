The measures announced by the Ponta Government were not compatible with Romania’s commitments to the EU and IMF, he added.\nAccording to the IMF estimation, the budget deficit would reach 3% in 2016, and would further grow to 4% in 2017, as the Government plans to increase most salaries in the public sector via a new law.\nRomanian MP Viorel Stefan, who is also the president of the Budget Committee within the Chamber of Deputies, came up with a different analysis of the talks with the IMF. He is a member of the Social Democrat Party, the main party in the ruling coalition, which has proposed various measures which are now challenged by the IMF.\nA new agreement with the IMF depended on the negotiations on the budget deficit, Stefan said. The Government needed to convince IMF that it was necessary to supplement the deficit, he added.\neditor@romania-insider.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:52:24.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
