Promoted stories \nThe idea is to attract businesses to the area and encourage private sector growth and investment. \nAreas in the proposed zone are unused land adjacent to Southampton Airport in Eastleigh towards the former railway works and the former Ford factory site, in Swaythling , totalling 65 hectares. \nIt is now more than two years since the Ford plant, which at its height employed more than 4,000 people, closed its doors for the last time and as previously reported demolition work at the site has been ongoing for weeks. \nEastleigh Borough and Southampton City councils both support the bid. \nTo open up the land near the airport it needs a new access road and outside funding would be required. \nMrs Davies said the strength of the site was its transport links with two close by railway stations, an airport and the M27 motorway and close proximity to Southampton and Portsmouth. \nIf the enterprise zone bid is successful she would expect an increase in infrastructure funding and hopes that this will strengthen the case for the Chickenhall Lane link road, helping relieve traffic in and around Eastleigh. \n“The Solent LEP has my full support with what is a robust application and I will continue to press their case ceaselessly in the corridors of power,” said Mrs Davies. Share article \nGary Jeffries, Solent LEP Chairman, said: \"The creation of a Southampton Airport Gateway Enterprise Zone is a critical component of our economic strategy and the area covered has the potential to be a major economic catalyst which brings the Solent and our key international gateway at Southampton Airport together with our rail connectivity to the rest of the UK and strategic road network interchanges at the M27 and M3.\" \nA decision on which applications will be successful is due by the end of the year.
