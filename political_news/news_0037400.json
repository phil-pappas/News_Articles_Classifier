Might have a look elsewhere after but what is his angle on this would be my first question. What is the slimy git planning. His apologising that he got the 'intelligence' wrong. One quote I can find, and this was a CNN program, “I apologise for the fact that the intelligence we received was wrong,”, if indeed that is quoted correctly. Cagy as hell that, not putting his hand up to being the cause. I shall re phrase that for him \"not our fault gov, little Jimmy said it was them and we had no reason to doubt him\" Really?! What a load of cobras.It's almost as if there was never any reason apply to critical analysis and judgement to intel, such that the internet codswallop Alastair Campbell peddled in his dodgy dossier could be relied on without a moment's hesitation.If Labour had been reading old copies of the Beano and Dandy rather than a social science PhD thesis (some of which belong in the same category, almost) they would presumably have started eating Cow Pie and beating up on anyone called Walter. \"Sorry Walter the intel we received was wrong\".
