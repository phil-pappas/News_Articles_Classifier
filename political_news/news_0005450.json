Party members are set to discuss policy positions at the Scottish Labour conference in Perth this week.\nAnnouncing her plans, Ms Dugdale said: \"With these reforms there will be no doubt that the main focus of Scottish Labour will be on Holyrood, where the key decisions affecting the daily lives of Scots are made.\n\"It won't be the Commons, the Lords or the European Parliament. They are important, of course, but the most important focus of Scottish Labour will be on using the powers at Holyrood to transform the lives of people in Scotland.\"\n'Narrow divisions' Ms Dugdale will also speak at the weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party in the House of Commons on Monday.\nSpeaking on Sky News , she urged the wider party to \"learn from the mistakes\" of Scottish Labour, adding: \"There's a chance here to reform and innovate how our party is organised and structured, if we get it right then our party will be in a much better and fitter position for the future.\"\nBut the SNP claimed there was \"chaos and confusion\" over the operation of Scottish Labour.\nA spokeswoman said: \"Most people are fed up hearing about Labour's narrow internal divisions when there are more important issues, like welfare cuts, the EU migrant crisis or holding David Cameron's government to account, that should be the priority.\"", "external_links": ["http://news.sky.com/story/1575904/scottish-labour-leader-wants-more-autonomy", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13C06/production/_86320908_hi029304557.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:08:07.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
