I think it’s bullying tactics.” \nThreats included that he would “close the House of Lords, that he will create 100 new Conservative peers”, she told the programme. \nMr Osborne insisted this week he was “comfortable” with the policy despite analysis by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) that the introduction of a higher minimum wage will not offset poor households’ immediate losses. \nThe IFS calculates that millions of people will lose up to £1,300 a year from the Budget changes. \nBut with the Lords set to make its opposition known – perhaps via a Church of England bishops’ motion decrying the failure to take into account the short-term impact – and senior Tory MPs leading a rebellion in a vote in the Commons later in the week, there are reports concessions may be made.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:36:58.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
