I will not remain silent.\n\n\"We will not allow the Prime Minister to sleep peacefully if women in Delhi do not get proper safety and the present trend of rapes continues, that is guaranteed,\" Kejriwal told reporters after meeting Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung.\n\n'Jungle raj' is prevailing in the capital and it was a matter of \"deep concern\", Kejriwal said and appealed to the Centre to \"stop being stubborn and hand over law and order control\" to his dispensation for one year.\n\nThe chief minister said his government was exploring all the options to ensure safety of women.\n\n\"A cabinet meeting, to discuss the issue, has been convened tomorrow,\" he said.\n\nOn his meeting with LG Jung, Kejriwal said he submitted figures relating to crime against women and cases of missing children.\n\n\"We met the LG along with last four year's record on crime cases. Around 31,000 cases of crime against women were recorded. Out of these, chargesheets were filed in only 13,000 cases and in 18,000 cases there was no charge sheet.\n\n\"Only 146 people were punished overall, so you can see how safe our women are,\" he said.\n\nKejriwal also ridiculed 'Himmat App' launched by Delhi Police and said that only 13 out of 4,000 cases were properly addressed that came in purview of this initiative.\n\nHe also said to have questioned Jung on \"democratic control\" over police during the meeting, which lasted around 45 minutes.\n\n\"There is absolutely no democratic control on Delhi Police which is very dangerous for a democratic country. I assure that we will change the whole Delhi as we have done in other areas under our control,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:07:15.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
