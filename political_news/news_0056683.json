Since then, Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, has had a dreadful year, rivaled in political misery only by Jeb Bush , Rand Paul and a few other Republican contenders who had to drop out. Nonetheless, if you asked those oddsmakers the same question today, on the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate, the answer still would be Mrs. Clinton. This time, however, that assessment wouldn’t reflect her strength, but rather the lack of a strong alternative at this stage. Even Democrats worried about her general election prospects — a growing population — dismiss the possibility of her rival Bernie Sanders winning the nomination. And they are skeptical that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will run or, if he did jump in, that he would win. The Republicans are in such chaos that a pathway to victory appears elusive. Yet looking at Mrs. Clinton’s problems, and some of her less-often-cited promise, suggests how on the mark those odds may be. Her reaction to the controversy over the use of her private email system is widely viewed as cavalier and clumsy, a case study in arrogance and poor political instincts. There is little evidence yet of a smoking gun, and the House Republicans’ Benghazi investigative committee, before which she will testify next week, is struggling to counter the impression that it is a partisan assault rather than a fact-gathering exercise. Yet she has taken a hit in the polls; voters don’t like revisiting the trials and tribulations of Clintonland. The campaign makes surprising blunders, leaking stories about tactics — Hillary will offer a softer image — or her electoral firewalls. Democratic professionals say that, in contrast to her last presidential campaign, she has strong leadership with John Podesta as chief executive and Robby Mook as campaign manager or chief operating officer. Privately, however, there is concern that crisis management sometimes comes down to a small coterie of personal intimates, her daughter, Chelsea, and Huma Abedin, a longtime aide and surrogate daughter. Still, there are also encouraging signs for Clinton supporters. After stiffing the news media for the first part of her campaign, Mrs. Clinton has done well in a series of recent interviews. She hates the press but does better when she engages. No campaign has offered more substance, even if it was overshadowed by the email contretemps. To be sure, some of this is politically calculated: Her biggest threat would be losing the first few nominating contests to Mr. Sanders, so her campaign is determined to protect the left flank. She still faces criticism for political pandering. She announced last week that she opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement involving the United States and 11 other countries — which encompass 40 percent of the global economy. But she had long supported such a pact, and even her supporters said the stated rationale for opposition was specious and could raise more questions about her credibility. There’s a lot of real meat elsewhere. No one has offered a more comprehensive proposal to deal with the crushing debt imposed on many families by the costs of college. The same holds for her proposals to establish a sliding-scale capital gains tax rate, her focus on longer-term economics, and initiatives to give financial regulators more powers and to impose a “risk fee” on big banks. These offerings have drawn fire from the left and the right. But the financial measures were carefully crafted: She consulted experts including top Wall Street executives and former Representative Barney Frank. Her July remarks on “quarterly capitalism” was one of the best economic speeches of this political season. The two big tests she faces over the next 10 days — the debate and the Benghazi hearings — are opportunities to reaffirm the current odds and overcome much of this year’s self-inflicted damage.
