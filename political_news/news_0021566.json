The new official will work to identify trends that can be used to help shape a national strategy. \nThough Carlin routinely speaks about the threat posed by the Islamic State, his speech Wednesday is more focused on violent extremists inspired by racist and anti-government ideologies. \nHe says more Americans have been killed in recent years in attacks by domestic extremists than in attacks associated with international terrorist groups.
