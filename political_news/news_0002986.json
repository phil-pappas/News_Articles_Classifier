All four parks provide recreational benefit to the surrounding neighborhoods, where 55%-75% of the residents are low to moderate income.\nThree of the four parks are located within the city of San Jacinto. Sallee and Mistletoe Parks are both owned and operated by the City, while Valley Wide Regional Park is owned and operated by the Valley Wide Recreation and Park District. The fourth park, Valle Vista Park, is also operated by Valley Wide Recreation and Park District and is located in the unincorporated community of Valle Vista, east of San Jacinto.\nThe proposed $500,000 in CDBG funds will be used to pay for new playground equipment, play surfaces, safety enhancements, and other upgrades. Valley Wide Recreation and Park District will be the applicant and recipient of the CDBG funding. The District possesses the capacity and experience to effectively carry out these improvements in a timely manner. “Working with the City of San Jacinto to find a solution to this matter has been one of my top priorities. I am very pleased to commit these grant funds to revitalizing these parks which will improve quality of life in the San Jacinto Valley” said 3rd District Supervisor, Chuck Washington.\n###", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:29:57.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
