The Consumer Prices Index measure, which takes in the costs of a host of consumer goods, fell to an annual rate of -0.1% in September from zero the previous month.\nThe ONS charted a 2.5% decline in the cost of food over the 12-month period while the cost of motor fuels fell by 14.9%.\nWhile clothing and footwear prices rose by 2.8%, they were at a much weaker level because of greater discounting and contributed to the easing of inflation.\nNegative inflation is good news for the consumer.\nFalling prices helps bring down household bills while a pick-up in wage growth at the same time has boosted overall spending power.\nThe latest official wage growth figures are due to be published by the ONS on Wednesday.\nThe rate of inflation has been hovering near the zero level for much of 2015, aided by the dual effects of weak oil prices and the supermarket price war which has slashed grocery bills for 15 consecutive months.\nThe Chancellor, George Osborne, tweeted: \"Inflation at minus 0.1% while wages rising at fastest rate in over a decade is a real boost for budgets of working families.\"\nThe figures also make it less likely that the Bank of England will contemplate raising the base rate of interest in the short term.\nThe Institute of Directors (IoD) called for the bank to start raising rates given the fall in oil costs would soon start to drop out of the inflation calculations.\nIts economic analyst, Michael Martins, said: \"We remain concerned that this temporary period of abnormally low inflation is blinding central bankers to the need to begin normalising interest rates.\n\"The Bank of Englandâ€™s job is to set interest rates for the medium-term, where inflation is set to pick back up towards the 2% target.\n\"Core inflation, which strips out some of the more volatile factors putting downward pressure on the headline rate, remains a steady 1%.\"\nThe pound was trading at its weakest level against the euro since May in the wake of the inflation figures' release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:39:34.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
