Trump responded initially by joking, \"I knew I shouldn't have picked her.\"\nHe then gave her a more thought-out answer, saying, \"Let me give you that answer right now. I respect women incredibly. I have had women working for me in positions that they have never worked in terms of construction, in terms of so many different jobs. I had a woman who was in charge of the building of Trump Tower many years ago … I have given women more opportunity than, I would say, virtually anybody in the construction industry.\"\n  Donald Trump, No Labels hero On  \nBy Byron York • 10/12/15 9:49 PM Trump added that his wife and daughter often encourage him to talk about women's health because he's supposedly very strong on the issue. \"I'm going to take care of women, and I have great respect for women and I do cherish women,\" Trump said.\nThis is not the first time that the former reality TV star has been challenged for his supposedly unfriendly treatment of women.\nIn October, during the first televised GOP debate, Fox News' Megyn Kelly asked Trump similar questions about remarks he has made in the past about various women.\n\"You've called women you don't like 'fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals,'\" she began. \"Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?\"\nTrump responded during the debate by explaining he has no time to be \"politically correct.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Gov.
