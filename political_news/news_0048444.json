Today, as you can see on Bureau Betak's Instagram, he blanketed the Cour Carrée du Louvre in lavender in prepartion for Dior 's spring 2016 show at Paris Fashion Week. The house and its designer Raf Simons are clearly botanical enthusiasts; you may remember that his fall 2014 couture show featured a backdrop of 150,000 orchids , and his debut show involved one million fresh flowers. Whatever we can expect from the show, at least we know one thing: it will smell amazing.", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/bureaubetak/"], "published": "2015-10-02T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:55:16.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
