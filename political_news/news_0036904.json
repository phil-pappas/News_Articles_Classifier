(John Mccoy/Los Angeles Daily News/Associated Press) October 18 at 7:46 PM Regarding Thomas Boswell’s Oct. 13 Sports column, “ MLB should dive into removing the takeout slide ”:\nWhy is second base the only one of the four at which a runner is allowed (even encouraged) to interfere with a fielder’s throw to another base? It makes sense to allow a slider the same latitude as a base runner who is attempting to avoid a tag in a rundown.\nLos Angeles Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley should not be vilified for sliding similarly to hundreds of other base runners over the years. But Mets infielder Rubén Tejada would seem to have grounds for a lawsuit against Major League Baseball for allowing runners to “take out” fielders outside the baseline.\nBill Smith , Bluffton, S.C.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:39:48.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
