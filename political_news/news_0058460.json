(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) October 23 at 4:57 PM As noted in the Oct. 20 editorial “ Preventable ‘accidents,’  ” possibly the most tragic element of our national immersion in guns is that children are repeatedly able to get hold of firearms and take the lives of other children or their parents or other adults.

In fact, they are completely preventable tragedies.\nWe are told that responsible gun owners will be unduly burdened by any regulation of gun and ammunition rights. Responsible gun owners would not allow children access to their firearms.\nAmid heated controversy regarding any regulation or limitation of gun rights, I would propose that anyone who provides, deliberately or inadvertently, a firearm used by a child to injure or kill another human being should be permanently banned from owning or possessing any type of firearm.\nCould this most basic gun proposal survive the National Rifle Association and gun lovers everywhere?\nJanet Lee , Takoma Park", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:21:32.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
