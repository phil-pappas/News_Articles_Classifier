Hillary Clinton will stand at the center of the stage, flanked by Bernie Sanders on her right, and Martin O'Malley to her left, and Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, who polled fourth and fifth, respectively, on each end. \nVice President Biden is not likely to participate , but should he have a last-minute change of heart and mind, CNN would welcome him on stage. In fact, they even have a podium designated for him. In case of Biden break out podium number 6. Here it is folks. #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/27B7ij3IEO — Jim Acosta (@Acosta) October 12, 2015 Where to watch: on TV: CNN; on computer: CNNgo Time: 8:30pm ET to 11pm ET What: Democratic presidential debate \nOne Democrat who will not be on stage is Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor who only announced his campaign last month, after raising $1 million for his single-purpose campaign: campaign finance reform. He did not meet the 1 percent support threshold set by CNN. \nAnd one of the DNC's top officials seems likely not to attend. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, a top official in the Democratic party, was originally invited, but she told the New York Times that she was disinvited from the Democrats' first 2016 presidential debate after publicly suggesting there should be more debates. \nCNN is also going to live-stream the debate in 3-D virtual reality, so that viewers who have the appropriate Samsung virtual reality headset and smartphone can watch as if they are in the live audience. What this means, according to a news release, is that users \"are able to hold a gaze on a particular candidate\" and \"catch off-screen interactions.\" © 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.
