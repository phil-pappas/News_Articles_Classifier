Trey Gowdy of South Carolina — was questioning Hillary Rodham Clinton about emails she received while secretary of state, from a family friend who once worked for President Bill Clinton.\nThe friend, Sidney Blumenthal, emailed Hillary Clinton frequently about Libya.\nThe line of questioning led the committee's top Democrat — Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland — to accuse Gowdy of unfairly attacking Hillary Clinton and mischaracterizing Blumenthal's emails.\nCummings demanded that Gowdy release a committee transcript of a closed-door interview with Blumenthal.\nGowdy refused. Then the committee leaders began shouting at each other. A bemused Clinton looked on.\nThe shouting went on for several minutes. Then the hearing abruptly adjourned for lunch, after more than three hours of testimony.\nAnd Gowdy says he's not done with questions about Blumenthal.\n___\n1:40 p.m.\nThe White House says it hopes the House Benghazi committee's hearing will bring finality to the issue.\nWhite House spokesman Eric Schultz says President Barack Obama didn't have specific plans to watch the hearing. But the spokesman says Hillary Rodham Clinton's testimony is a reminder of why Obama chose her to be secretary of state.\nSchultz says Clinton is committed to the safety and security of Americans serving in diplomatic posts, and he says she's someone who takes responsibility when something goes wrong.\n___\n1:15 p.m.\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan is accusing Hillary Rodham Clinton of not telling the American people that terrorists were responsible for attacking the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya.\nThe Ohio lawmaker suggests Clinton was motivated to portray Libya as a success story for the Obama administration — and the attacks came only 56 days before voters were to decide whether to re-elect President Barack Obama.\nJordan is citing Clinton's public statement after the 2012 incident — the statement said some people believed the attack came in response to an anti-Muslim video that prompted a protest at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo.\nJordan has produced copies of emails Clinton wrote her family, saying it was a terrorist attack by an al-Qaida-like group.\nJordan notes she also told Egypt's prime minister that she knew the Benghazi attack had nothing to do with the film — that it was a planned terrorist strike.\nClinton disagrees with Jordan's portrayal of what happened and is defending her actions. She says there was much conflicting intelligence in the fast-moving aftermath.\n___\n12:45 p.m.\nA Republican member of the House Benghazi committee wants to know why Hillary Rodham Clinton didn't fire anybody over the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans.\nClinton was secretary of state at the time.\nRep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas notes that no one lost a single paycheck over the attacks — and it was the first time an U.S. ambassador had been killed since 1979.\nClinton says an independent review board did single out several State Department employees for what the board felt was inadequately carrying out their duties — but the board didn't find any breach or dereliction of duty.\nFour senior State Department officials were put on paid leave after the board said security at the Benghazi mission on the night of the attacks was \"grossly inadequate.\"\nAfter a review, the department reassigned three officials to positions of lesser responsibility, and one official resigned.\nPompeo says his constituents don't think that amounts to \"accountability.\"\n___\n12:40 p.m.\nThe seats in the House hearing room are all taken, and dozens of photographers are on hand as Hillary Rodham Clinton testifies about the deadly attacks against Americans in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:46:00.439+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
