Through re-creations and stories of eye witnesses, these TV specials would recount claims of unexplained disappearances of aircraft and ships coupled with assertions that this area of the Atlantic was governed by paranormal forces that made its waters and airspace unusually treacherous to navigate. In the years since these programs aired, it appears that the popular belief in the Bermuda Triangle’s mysterious power has diminished, which I suppose is a consequence of numerous scientific inquiries that have debunked its proponents’ extraordinary claims. Although I was intrigued by the Bermuda Triangle myth as a youth, I am now persuaded that this part of the world is not possessed by an inexplicable force that gobbles up travelers who venture into its waters. However, in John Engle’s Advanced Leadership Program, I learned of another mysterious triangle that is fraught with both peril and opportunity that none of us can escape: the “relationship triangle.” Murray Bowen, M.D., is the researcher attributed with the early discovery and exploration of the relationship triangle in work he did exploring the way anxiety circulates in families where one family member suffered from schizophrenia. In particular, he noticed a common pattern in which the mentally ill family member would cause anxiety in another member who would invariably seek to relieve their anxiety by speaking to another person. He then noticed the exact same pattern of behavior in his clinical practice and, ultimately, in all relationships among the members of any group. This observation led to Bowen’s development of family system theory, which provides deep insights into factors that promote and retard productive human relationships and mental health. To understand Bowen’s theory and its connection to ethical principles and the quality of your relationships, let’s start with an example of a stereotypical relationship triangle we’ve all occupied on many occasions. Person A does something or says something that causes anxiety or upset in Person B who complains to Person C about Person A. Sound familiar? In any group of people, large or small, at work or at home, such triangles are both ubiquitous and unavoidable. As Bowen discovered, they are a mechanism by which groups regulate their anxiety just as a thermostat regulates the temperature in a room. When tension between two parties rises to a certain point, it automatically spreads to a third party, thereby reducing the tension between the original two. Although such triangles serve a useful purpose, when triangle participants fail to behave in an ethical manner, they can and do cause “stormy seas” that can lead to disaster. On the other hand, ethical behavior on your part—regardless of the position on the relationship triangle you might occupy—can promote healthy, productive interactions. For example, let’s suppose a person A engages in anxiety-provoking behavior by being rude to you at work thus inviting you to occupy position B in a relationship triangle. In such a situation, your response might be to get fairly worked up about A’s outrageous behavior and find a friend C to relieve your anxiety by engaging in a conversation that usually begins with “You won’t believe what A did to me today.” However, another more mature and ethical response might be to strive to consciously regulate your emotional reaction to A’s behavior by developing and tapping into your capacity to not let another determine your mental state. Said another way, you should never let a jerk take control of your peace of mind. This, of course, is much easier said than done, and books have been written on how you might achieve such a mature state of equanimity. This approach is not just the path to sustained mental health, it also affords you the flexibility to choose a response that is directed by ethical principles rather than a more base instinct to retaliate. Moreover, individuals with the ability to avoid upset induced by others’ behavior avoid creating relationship triangles by not letting their temperature rise in the first place. Similarly, if B seeks to relieve their anxiety by complaining to you about what A did to them, you can either choose to enable such behavior by affirming B’s assertions, or you could pursue the high ground by finding a respectful way to coach B about how they might better regulate their own reactivity or engage in a constructive dialogue with A with the object of producing a more productive relationship. Finally, although we cannot regulate others’ reactivity to our behavior, we can strive to govern our words and our deeds in accordance with the basic ethical principles we all learned as children: respect, responsibility, fairness, honesty and compassion. This coupled with the ability to be what Edwin Friedman (an expert in Murray Bowen’s family system theory) refers to as a “non-anxious presence” is not only the right thing to do, it optimizes the odds that the anxiety we provoke in others is aimed at promoting human flourishing rather than less laudable goals. If you reflect for a moment on difficulties you may have had navigating through your own relationship triangles, I’m supposing you’d agree with me that doing so in the future ethically, as recommended above, makes crossing the Bermuda Triangle appear to be child’s play by comparison. The harsh reality is that ethical navigation of relationship triangles requires a degree of self-regulation and equanimity that most of us do not possess. Building such skills requires a lifetime of devoted work to improve who we are at a fundamental level and how we choose to interact with others. However, the investment you make to acquire these skills is well worth the effort. It will not only help you avoid shipwreck it will also promote extraordinary relationships in your life both at work and at home. Jim Nortz is chief compliance officer for Carestream Health Inc.
