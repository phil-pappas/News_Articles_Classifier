More often than not splendor is the star we orbit\nwithout a second thought,\nespecially as it arrives and departs. One day it’s the blue glassy bay,\none day the night and its array of jewels,\nvisible and invisible.\nSometimes it’s the warm clarity\nof a face that finds your face\nand doesn’t turn away.\nSometimes a kindness, unexpected,\nthat will radiate farther than you might imagine.\nOne day it’s the entire day itself, each hour foregoing its number and name,\nits cumbersome clothes, a day that says come as you are,\nlarge enough for fear and doubt,\nwith room to spare: the most secret\nwish, the deepest, the darkest,\nturned inside out.” - Thomas Centolella", "external_links": ["http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/RunningcauseICantFly/~4/7gfve80t4cY"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:58:04.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
