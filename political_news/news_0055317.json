A federal grand jury indicted him Wednesday on human smuggling charges. \nAuthorities say they discovered the 39 Central American immigrants last month locked inside a semitrailer parked at a truck stop in Moore, about 40 miles southwest of San Antonio. Body camera video shows the immigrants’ packed in the truck’s rear, several gasping for air and pushing to get out as authorities opened the doors. Among those asking for help is a child. \nSome were treated for dehydration, as temperatures reached the mid-90s. \nIf convicted, Potter, of Watauga, faces up to 10 years in prison. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:31:51.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
