(\" NexPoint \") today announced that the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut has issued an order enjoining TICC Capital Corp. (NASDAQ: TICC) (\" TICC \" or the \" Company \"), its President and its Board of Directors (the \" Board \") from holding the special meeting of stockholders previously scheduled for October 27 (the \" Special Meeting \") until the Company corrects several materially false and misleading portions of its proxy statement so that stockholders are fully informed of the Board's conduct and incentives related to the Benefit Street Partners (\" BSP \") transaction.\nSpecifically, the court ruled that TICC made several material misrepresentations to stockholders in its proxy statement and other proxy materials, has ordered TICC to file revised proxy materials with regard to the points below, and has delayed the Special Meeting until the court is satisfied that corrective disclosure has been made.\nThe benefits to be received by Board members Cohen and Royce and TICC President Rosenthal. The court found that TICC violated federal securities laws by not disclosing the substantial compensation that these individuals stood to gain from the BSP transaction. Industry analysts believe the payment to these individuals may be as high as $60 million (a number which NexPoint believes was originally as high as $132 million prior to NexPoint's involvement); value that stockholders would be deprived of in order to enrich the interested directors and departing management team. The court found that the \"omission of those amounts by TICC is materially false or misleading and is thereby in violation of [federal securities law],\" and further, that \"[v]ague descriptors such as a 'significant conflict' and 'substantial payments' do not present the true nature of Cohen, Royce, and Rosenthal's multi-million dollar interests in the approval of [the BSP] deal being presented to shareholders as in their best interest.\" (emphasis in original) TICC's engagement with NexPoint : The court also found that TICC misrepresented its engagement with NexPoint, or lack thereof, to stockholders and would not allow TICC to mischaracterize the Board's perfunctory requests for information as substantive negotiations. The court found it \"apparent that a reasonable shareholder would place importance on the level of interaction the Board had with a third-party competing against a proposal being presented to them, specifically where the proposal favored by the Board is one that would provide tens of millions of dollars to certain of that board's members.\" The counsel provided by Wachtell and Morgan Stanley : The court took a similarly dim view of the Board's attempt to cloak its self-serving and conflicted rejection of NexPoint's offer with the imprimatur of law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and investment bank Morgan Stanley when in fact such firms were only engaged after the decision to deny NexPoint's proposal had been made and did not counsel the Board on the merits of the NexPoint proposal. The Court found that TICC's linguistic gymnastics with respect to the Company's disclosure on advisory counsel can \"reasonably be regarded as an effort to mislead stockholders.\" While the court did not order the NexPoint nominees to be included on the ballot, NexPoint does not believe the court considered the permissibility of a conditional election as a matter of law, and intends to continue to litigate that important issue and seek further relief prior to the rescheduled meeting.\n\"As expected the court saw through TICC and the Board's willful misstatements and continued attempts to conceal essential facts in order to mislead stockholders and distract them from several glaring deficiencies and conflicts related to the BSP transaction,\" said Thomas Surgent, NexPoint partner and deputy general counsel. \"We remain undaunted in our view that a soviet-style election like the one presented to TICC stockholders is illegal as a matter of law and NexPoint will continue to do what is in the best interests of stockholders by protecting their rights and investment through the legal system. NexPoint believes that stockholders will be irreparably harmed in the event that TICC fails to include NexPoint's nominees on the ballot for the Special Meeting and will pursue all available remedies to ensure recognition of its nominees, including asking the court to set aside the election results if NexPoint's nominees are not on the ballot. We look forward to the next steps in this process.\"\nPlease visit www.timetochangeticc.com for further information regarding NexPoint's proposals, including press releases, board nominees, questions and answers, SEC filings and proxy materials.\nAbout NexPoint Advisors, L.P.\nNexPoint, together with its affiliates, currently manages approximately $20 billion in net assets and believes that its core competences are squarely within the Company's investment strategy.
