That meant he owed $75,861.67 for the employee contributions he would have paid had he not announced he would no longer participate in the pension system in the midst of a reelection bid against another vociferous anti-pension politician.\nNow the county has to pay its part of the pension for those five years, too: $247,625.\n“I’m not real thrilled about it,” Nelson said. “It wasn’t like, ‘Hey, I got reelected, how can I go backward?’ OCERS called me. I didn’t call them.”\nBut emails and interviews show the dispute between OCERS and Nelson began when the organization tried to refund Nelson for contributions he made in 2010 before he opted out of the system. He rejected the refund, which initiated the discussion about his enrollment and back payments.\nWhile as of January he’s in the least expensive plan – beginning at age 65, he can draw 1.62 percent of his $145,000 supervisor salary annually, multiplied by his years on the board – his retroactive plan is more lucrative: 2.7 percent at age 55, multiplied by his years on the board. Nelson is 49.\nState Sen. Pat Bates, who is the only other county supervisor who’s chosen not to enroll in a pension, accused Nelson of using “legal doublespeak” and said his apparent disregard of his five-year-old anti-pension pledge is “very, very disturbing” and “kind of shocking.”\n“This is a breach of trust, as far as I’m concerned,” Bates said.\nBates agrees that the 2012 law forces all supervisors to enroll in the cheapest plan, but she said Nelson, who helped write the law, falsely portrayed it to voters as a way to reign in supervisor pensions when he knew it actually enabled him to ditch his pledge not to participate. She was the only supervisor who voted against certifying the law after it passed in June 2012.\n“It was something that was not fully vetted with the public. And to be using that as a rational? I’m dumbfounded,” she said.\nNelson said he knew the ballot measure would require him to sign up for a pension but said he didn't discuss that at the time because the topic never came up.\n“That wasn’t even in the discussion,” he said. “It wasn’t purposeful or negligent.”\nBates also said Nelson is wrong when he says OCERS told him his recent enrollment voided his decision to ditch his enrollment five years ago.\n“I do not believe that someone is forced to get retroactive pension benefits,” said Bates, who was twice elected to the Board of Supervisors before winning a state Senate seat last November. “I feel very disappointed that someone wants to distort the facts in the matter.\"\nNelson dismissed her criticism.\n“Pat’s entitled to say what she says. But Pat has no idea what happened in my circumstance,” Nelson said. “I wouldn’t go to Pat for legal advice, nor would anyone else. Including Pat.”\nBates isn’t the only one who disagrees with the retroactive pension participation. Auditor-Controller Eric Woolery for months refused to authorize payments to OCERS for the $247,625 owed for Nelson’s last five years.\nSo when Woolery noticed that county officials had authorized the first payment of $88,117 in what he described as a “sneaky” manner, he reversed it. OCERS then accused him of embezzlement, Woolery said, and District Attorney’s Office investigators showed up at his office in August.\nA spokeswoman for the District Attorney’s Office wouldn’t comment, but Woolery said the investigation has gone nowhere.\n“When somebody initiates a payment that I’m still researching, to me, they’re the ones who are trying to steal or take away county funds,” he said.\nWoolery said he’s requested an opinion from a lawyer other than county counsel, who reports to supervisors, but has been rejected. He still questions how Nelson can legally take back his agreement to abandon his pension enrollment, but he recently“reluctantly” allowed the first payment under the threat of legal action from county officials.\nOCERS officials did not respond to questions on Friday. County Counsel Leon Page, in an email from county spokeswoman Jean Pasco, emphasized that OCERS, not the county, determines eligibility.\nHe also confirmed that OCERS contacted the District Attorney’s Office because Woolery “has no authority to refuse to make a required payment to OCERS nor the authority to determine whether a payment is lawful.”\nEmails obtained by the Register show OCERS contacted county officials in December not about paying the last five years of contributions, but to reimburse Nelson and Bates for the contributions paid before he opted out of the system in 2010 and she opted out in 2007. But Nelson refused to take the reimbursement, reminding OCERS they had already told him that wasn’t allowed.\nTo get back on the pension system this year, the first thing he had to do was revoke an Aug. 26, 2010, document he signed stating his intent to opt out of OCERS, according to a document provided by the county’s executive office.\nStill, Nelson said this week he wouldn’t have enrolled in a pension this year if he’d known it would lead to him having to pay past employee compensations for the years he’d opted out.\n“I’ve got a lot less in my savings account now, and if I live long enough, I get a pension. Good for me,” Nelson said. But, he added: “I’m not a victim here. I’m an informed guy. I’m a lawyer. I was dumb enough to run for this office.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:11:34.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
