The cloud of suspicion that has been hanging over people who oppose the use of 1080 has now been lifted, as it has been shown that the accused, a businessman, had instigated the threat for monetary gain and had in the past been involved in the pest control industry. \nThough this chapter is coming to an end, the potential for environmental harm continues with TBfree and the Department of Conservation still actively using large quantities of poison over New Zealand in the coming year and into the future. The threat to our farming export market continues and the Government must be aware of the danger the use of this poison brings to the country. \nThe health of our people and the well-being of our environment are continually under threat from 1080 poison which is still being used as a dirty form of conservation.” Ends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:40:05.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
