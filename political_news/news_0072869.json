(Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press) By Editorial Board October 11 at 6:57 PM ACTING U.S. attorney Vincent H. Cohen Jr. seems to have been bypassed for permanent appointment as the District’s top prosecutor partly because of dissatisfaction with the office’s handling of the investigation into former D.C. mayor Vincent C. Gray’s (D) 2010 campaign. That’s troubling. The crackdown on corruption in city politics has been instrumental in setting a new tone for D.C. government; punishing the official who helped spearhead it sends the wrong message.\nChanning D. Phillips, a Justice Department official and former D.C. federal prosecutor, was nominated last week by President Obama to head the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District. Mr. Phillips, who will succeed Mr. Cohen on an acting basis pending Senate confirmation, is well regarded with solid experience. We don’t doubt his ability.\nOur concerns center on how Mr. Cohen, who enjoys widespread support from the legal community, was hurt by his involvement in the investigation of wrongdoing that helped Mr. Gray unseat former mayor Adrian M. Fenty in the 2010 Democratic primary. Mr. Cohen was deputy to former U.S. attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. , who led the effort. The nominating commission that screened candidates was, as The Post’s Keith L. Alexander and Ann E. Marimow reported, split between Mr. Phillips and Mr. Cohen, with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) recommending Mr. Phillips.\nCriticism of the prosecutors largely centers on the plea deal reached with businessman Jeffrey E. Thompson weeks before Mr. Gray’s loss in the 2014 Democratic mayoral primary in which there were allegations that Mr. Gray knew about illegal campaign finance activities. Mr. Gray, who denies the allegations, has not been charged, and his supporters fault the timing of the plea as politically motivated.\nWhile we agree that the investigation has gone on too long without resolution, there is no evidence that prosecutors were driven by anything other than the evidence they had at hand at the time. Keep in mind they were hampered by non-cooperation, including from Mr. Gray, and downright obstruction from others. Keep in mind especially that six people , including some closely associated with the former mayor, have pleaded guilty to federal felonies.\nThe direction of the investigation now becomes the responsibility of Mr. Phillips. No doubt the federal investigation of Mr. Gray’s corrupt campaign, along with separate probes that uncovered wrongdoing by three former D.C. Council members , cast the District in an unfavorable light. But the city is better off because of those — because, in part, of the diligence of Mr. Cohen.\nRead more about this topic:\nColbert I.
