Kennedy when he took office in 1968. Now his son has created similar buzz as a youthful and eloquent leader. \nIn fact, his Conservative Party rival, incumbent Stephen Harper, had run ads portraying the younger Trudeau as an empty suit with good hair and a celebrity's personality. \nYet, Justin Trudeau has promised more than superficial change. He has called for tax cuts for the middle class, tax increases on the rich and deficit spending on infrastructure and welfare to spur Canada's sluggish economy. He also favors legalization of marijuana \"right away,\" an increase in refugees accepted in Canada, better ties with the United States and more support for women's rights. \"I am a feminist. I’m proud to be a feminist,\" Trudeau wrote on Twitter late last month. \nTrudeau was born in Ottawa to two political families — his grandfather on his mother's side was a Canadian cabinet minister. Despite the political pedigree, he took awhile to follow in his father's footsteps. He worked as a teacher, actor, environmental activist, engineer and even a bungee-jumping coach. \nHe graduated from Montreal's McGill University in 1994 and married Sophie Grégoire, a model and former television personality. They have three young children. \nIn 2000, he delivered a moving eulogy at his father's state funeral that proved to be the defining moment leading to his political career. \n“More than anything, to me, he was dad. And what a dad. He loved us with the passion and the devotion that encompassed his life. He taught us to believe in ourselves, to stand up for ourselves, to know ourselves and to accept responsibility for ourselves,\" Trudeau said in his eulogy. “We knew we were the luckiest kids in the world. And we had done nothing to actually deserve it. It was instead something that we would have to spend the rest of our lives to work very hard to live up to.” \nHis political career began in 2007 \"in a parking lot. A grocery store parking lot, to be precise, directly across the street from a shawarma restaurant and a barbershop,\" he said in a statement on his party's website. \nHe became a member of parliament in 2008, and by 2013, Trudeau was leader of the Liberal Party, which he moved to the left as part of a plan to end nearly 10 years of Conservative rule.
