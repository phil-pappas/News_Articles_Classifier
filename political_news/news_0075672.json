The candidates stepped up their efforts in a battle increasingly dominated by TV attack ads, such as those aired by Pennsylvanians for Judicial Reform, an in-state political committee that supports Democrats, and the Washington-based Republican State Leadership Committee on the opposite side. \nBetween Jan. 1 and Monday, Supreme Court candidates spent roughly $3.5 million to air ads on broadcast television in Pennsylvania, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of political advertising data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a media tracking firm.
