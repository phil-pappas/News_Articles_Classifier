GOV. REEVES JACKSON – The Mississippi Medical Political Action Committee announced today its support for Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves re-election based on his investments in improving health care in Mississippi. MMPAC is an arm of the Mississippi State Medical Association which is the largest physicians’ association with more than 4,800 members across Mississippi. The organization serves as an advocate for its members, their patients and the public health. “With Tate Reeves as lieutenant governor, Mississippi doctors have a leader who understands the importance of ensuring patient access to physicians and encouraging physicians to remain in our state which generates positive economic benefits for communities all across Mississippi,” said MMPAC Chairman, Hugh Gamble, II, MD, from Greenville. “Mississippi physicians are proud to support Tate Reeves.” Over the past four years, Lt. Gov. Reeves has supported ways to increase the number of health care professionals in Mississippi, which is essential to improving access to quality care. Under his leadership, the state: · Invested in a new medical school at the University of Mississippi, · Expanded the rural physician scholarship program, which encourages new doctors to practice in small towns, · Established the Office of Mississippi Physician Workforce within the University of Mississippi Medical Center which oversees physician workforce development needs, and · Supported the development of telemedicine efforts to reach rural areas. “I appreciate the support of physicians in Mississippi,” Lt. Gov. Reeves said. “To increase the availability of quality health care, Mississippi needs doctors who are prepared to stay here and reach our rural areas. That is why I have supported efforts to increase the number of medical professionals in Mississippi.” 10/6/15 Posted October 6, 2015 - 9:06 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
