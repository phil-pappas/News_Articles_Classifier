The Blue Jays and Royals play Game 2 in Kansas City with a first pitch set for 4:07 p.m. The Cubs and Mets play the opener of the NL best-of-seven at 8:07 p.m. Here's a look at what's happening (all times EDT):\n___\n5:05 p.m.\nThe Blue Jays finally ended the scoreless innings streak by Royals pitchers at 18.\nKevin Pillar doubled off Yordano Ventura leading off the third inning, and Ryan Goins followed with a double down the left-field line, giving Toronto a 1-0 in Game 2 of the ALCS.\nThe Blue Jays nearly ended the streak an inning earlier.\nEdwin Encarnacion and Chris Colabello led off with singles. After struggling Troy Tulowitzki struck out, Russell Martin hit a scorcher up the middle. Alcides Escobar managed to snag it at shortstop with a diving catch, then doubled Colabello off second base to end the inning.\nDavid Price was cruising through three innings for Toronto, allowing just a single by Escobar leading off the game.\n___\n4:25 p.m.\nShadows are pretty severe in front of the mound at Kauffman Stadium in the first inning of Game 2 of the ALCS with the late afternoon start. It's g making for some tough at-bat for hitters against the Royals' hard-throwing Yordano Ventura and Blue Jays' David Price.\nVentura reached 99 mph in a perfect first.\n___\n4:15 p.m.\nRookie Noah Syndergaard will start for the New York Mets in Game 2 of the NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs on Sunday night.\nSyndergaard threw 17 pitches in the seventh inning Thursday against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the final game of the NL Division Series, the first relief appearance of his big league career, and warmed up four times before coming in.\nNew York manager Terry Collins waited until Saturday to announce his decision, wanting to make sure Syndergaard was not sore.\nCollins said rookie left-hander Steven Matz, his Game 4 starter, will be available out of the bullpen this weekend.\nJacob deGrom, who won twice in the Division Series, is set to start Game 3.\n4 p.m.\nSuper-fan and Hall of Fame golfer Tom Watson, dressed in a Royals jacket, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Kansas City played Toronto in Game 2 of the ALCS.\nIt was a strike because, well, everything thrown by anyone in Royals gear these days seems to be a strike. They entered the game on a franchise-record 16-inning scoreless streak.\nIt began with a superb outing by Johnny Cueto in the winner-take-all Game 5 of their Divisional Series against Houston, and continued with a 5-0 victory over the Blue Jays on Friday night.\nEdinson Volquez and three relievers combined on the three-hitter.\n___\n3:35 p.m.\nMets slugger Lucas Duda is slumping, and now he is sitting. The left-handed swinging first baseman was held out of the starting lineup for Game 1 of the NL Championship Series against Cubs lefty Jon Lester.\nDuda, prone to prolonged slumps and big surges this season when he hit 27 homers, went just 2 for 18 with 11 strikeouts in the Division Series against the Dodgers. He played all five games, including the four against left-handed starters.\nMichael Cuddyer will make his 16th start at first base this year. He last was in the lineup for Game 1 of the Division Series and struggled defensively in left field. He was 0 for 4 in the series, with two plate appearances as a pinch hitter.\n___\n2:40 p.m.\nRoyals starter Yordano Ventura will have the familiar figure of Salvador Perez behind home plate against the Blue Jays in Game 2 of the ALCS.\nPerez was ill for part of the divisional round, then took a bat off the back of his glove hand in the ALCS opener. Royals trainer Nick Kenney checked on Perez during that game, but the affable catcher decided to remain in the rest of the way.\nStill, there was some question whether Drew Butera might get the start Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:43:42.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
