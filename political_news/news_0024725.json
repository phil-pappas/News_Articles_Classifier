Furthermore, by openly and robustly addressing matters, I believe Kara George and I will be able to maintain and grow the support of our fellow trustees to ensure we work in a cohesive manner. \nObviously, the unauthorised release of information is not helpful and is a matter that we will deal with in due course. \nIt was necessary to utilise alternative funding to support this process to this point. From here, Tūhoronuku IMA has resolved not to utilise further Rūnanga funding but to work within the confirmed funding from the Crown. However, we now expect the Crown and the Crown Forestry Rentals Trust to be pro-active, consistent and align their funding strategies to prevent funding vacuums that impact on our cash flows, as has happened over the past year. \nThat our iwi authority has been generous of spirit during difficult times is an understatement. In fact, except for a few, Ngāpuhi have been very patient with this process and we will continue in an open and transparent manner as we have always done. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:03:26.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
