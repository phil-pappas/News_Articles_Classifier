It has found that New Zealand spends less on research than three-quarters of the OECD countries. \n\"That’s a huge embarrassment. The report shows clearly that National’s disregard for quality research is hampering our scientists. \n\"Dr Adam Jaffe of MOTU said that ‘there is no reason to expect diminishing returns if Marsden funding were increased’ and it is evident that we could easily double our investment in science and research. \n\"If Steven Joyce was serious about New Zealand being an innovation leader, his National Statement of Science Investment announcement on Monday would significantly increase funding for science and research. \n\"Instead of picking winners and funding vanity projects, the Government should commit to a properly funded sector and give young Kiwi scientists and researchers a reason to stay in New Zealand. \n\"We have two economic futures one as a price-taking commodity exporter and the other as a smart, high-value economy. Growing good jobs needs stronger investment in science, \"David Cunliffe says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:14:44.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
