The settlement resolves allegations from workers that they were shorted on pay at nine Papa John's restaurants in Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx. According to the state, the franchisees who run the stores admitted to violating minimum wage and overtime laws. The back wages and damages will be doled out to 250 workers who worked at the stores stretching back to 2008.\"Once again, weve found Papa Johns franchises in New York that are ripping off their workers and violating critical state and federal laws, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. \"Once again, I call on Papa Johns and other fast food companies to step up and stop the widespread lawlessness plaguing your businesses and harming the workers who make and deliver your food.\" \"Free Market\" means we can treat American workers like shit and just hope we don't get caught. What assholes. They need to be boycotted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:43:45.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
