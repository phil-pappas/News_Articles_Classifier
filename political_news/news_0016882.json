(Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT\nAssociated Press Oct. 9, 2015 | 5:56 p.m. EDT + More By IAN HARRISON, Associated Press\nTORONTO (AP) â€” Backup infielder Hanser Alberto singled home the go-ahead run in the 14th inning and the Texas Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-4 Friday for a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five American League Division Series.\nThe underdog Rangers will try to sweep the Blue Jays in Game 3 Sunday in Texas. Colby Lewis will start for Texas against Marco Estrada.\nAlberto, only in the lineup because star third baseman Adrian Beltre was out with a strained back, made an error that led to Toronto's first run. He delivered an RBI single with two outs in the 14th, and Delino DeShields followed with an infield hit for another run.\nTexas shut out the highest-scoring team in the majors after the fifth inning. The victory made road teams 5-0 in the postseason so far.\nKeone Kela (1-0) worked one inning for the win, staying calm after a dust-up with Toronto slugger Josh Donaldson. Ross Ohlendorf, with an old-school, double-armed windup, finished for a first save. LaTroy Hawkins (0-1) took the loss.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
