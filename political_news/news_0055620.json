Despite all its tyranny, the vulnerability of the occupiers will soon become clear.”\nAccording to Hamdan, Hamas does not remain silent in the face of Israeli violence, but -- on the contrary -- has remained at the center of recent events.\n“From the outset,” he asserted, “Hamas has insisted on the Palestinian right to resist occupation.”\n- ‘National resistance’\nHamdan went on to say that a “national resistance project” was currently in the process of being established.\n“This project embraces all Palestinian society, offering novel weapons and methods to be used against the occupation,” he said.\nHe added: “The main aim is to end the occupation and liberate Palestine.”\nRegarding ongoing violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, Hamdan said: “Israel was shocked by the response of Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem [to Israeli aggression] and tried to change the flow of events by targeting [Hamas-controlled] Gaza.”\n“We will not permit the forces of the occupation to control the region,” he added. “We will direct the current conflict to the benefit of the Palestinian people.”\n“A fresh assault on Gaza will not be easy for Israel,” he told Anadolu Agency. “The power of the Palestinian resistance has increased day by day, especially when you look at the results of the [Israeli onslaughts against Gaza] in 2008, 2012 and 2014.”\nHamdan also responded to claims by some parties that Hamas would forsake resistance if it were granted certain concessions.\n“Those who say this either don’t know Hamas or they themselves have forsaken the resistance [in return for concessions],” he said.\n“Hamas’ objectives are clear,” he went on. “It’s not possible for us to abandon our rights, which we demand in full… including the occupiers’ departure from our land.”\nHamdan concluded: “The experience of the [1993] Oslo Accords will not happen again under any circumstances -- neither in terms of the reigning political situation nor in terms of the Palestinian groups that Israel dealt with in the past.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:24:22.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
