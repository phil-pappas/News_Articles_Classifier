(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\nAssociated Press Oct. 9, 2015 | 9:39 p.m. EDT + More By KEVIN FREKING, Associated Press\nSEATTLE (AP) â€” President Barack Obama is looking toward the 2016 elections, stumping for Democratic Sen. Patty Murray with a fundraiser in her home state.\nThe seat is considered a safe one for Democrats. But Murray is leaving nothing to chance, particularly after her narrow victory with just 52 percent of the vote in 2010, her closest Senate contest yet.\nObama describes the four-term senator as a lawmaker who gets things done without a lot of drama and fuss. At the same time, he's also seeking to impress upon voters progress that he says the country has made during the nearly seven years of his presidency.\nObama will also travel to California over the weekend for fundraising events.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press .
