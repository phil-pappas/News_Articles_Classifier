I believe the Second Amendment is under threat.\" \nConservative leaders in Douglas County say they expect at least 2,400 to show up among three different protest sites. \nMeanwhile, another college shooting was reported Friday morning in Flagstaff, Arizona. At Northern Arizona University, a freshman killed one student and injured three others before surrendering to police. \nThe incident has fueled social media activity on both sides of the gun control debate. \nFollow the Twitter accounts of: Ian Kullgren and Jeff Mapes for political coverage. \nRebecca Woolington and Beth Nakamura are mixing with the protestors. \nWe'll also be updated this blog all day with news from the ground.

Oregon Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley are taking a front-and-center position in the push. \n11:28 a.m. It seems the mood and crowds look different, depending where you stand today.

Rick Halle, who is with about 10 other people, said he wants to have a peaceful protest that gets across the message that they don't want Obama \"pushing political agendas on us.\" \n\"We're upset that literally within moments of this tragedy Obama was using it to force a political agenda,\" Halle said. \nTV stations have been showing the crowd slowly grow in size since 9 a.m. Crowd tripled in size within hour at #Roseburg airport -- backing sheriff, slamming @POTUS #liveonk2 #UCCShooting pic.twitter.com/9cYroy7bXi \n#UCCShooting Tweets \n10:12 a.m. While we wait for Obama's plane in Eugene, let's start with some relevant reading. \nThis morning, Oregonian political reporter Denis Theriault published a story about how researchers and psychologists have made strides in identifying people who might be moved to rampage to stop them before they start. \n\"You're not going to be able to look at someone and say, 'Two years from now, he's going to be the next school shooter,'\" said Mario Scalora , a psychologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who consults nationally on how to thwart mass shootings and other targeted violence. \nBut Scalora and others said listening — and speaking up when something isn't right — can stop such crimes. A burgeoning field of study called risk assessment is also making a difference. \nMass shootings \"are very preventable,\" Scalora said. \"In a lot of cases, there are warning signs.\" \nRead the story: Stopping mass shooters: Experts share lessons since Thurston \nThat story reflects on an Oregon school shooting in 1998. Read about that one and other in this list of mass shootings in Oregon . \nHow do authorities determine what constitutes a mass shooting? We have your answer: How many U.S. mass shootings? Why it's so hard to pin down \n-- Molly Harbarger", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:42:59.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
