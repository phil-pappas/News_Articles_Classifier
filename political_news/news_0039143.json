But the Obama administration couldn't say specifically when two new search tools are going to be available.\n  Major public-sector union AFSCME endorses Clinton A union for state and local government workers says she has the best chance among labor-friendly candidates.\nBy Sean Higgins • 10/23/15 1:41 PM The administration is testing doctor and prescription drug lookup features where a consumer can check to see if a plan includes his doctor and covers the prescription drugs he takes.\nThe tools directly address a criticism of Obamacare from opponents who say that consumers are finding out their plan doesn't include their doctor in the network.\nHowever, the tools are still in beta testing and officials couldn't peg exactly when they are going to be released, only saying they are \"coming soon.\"\n\"We feel comfortable that we will have it ready soon,\" said Lori Lodes, spokeswoman for healthcare.gov in a press conference Friday.\nLodes couldn't say whether it would be ready for open enrollment or exactly when the tools would be rolled out during open enrollment.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Romney admits: 'Without Romneycare, I don't think we would have Obamacare' Romney explained that his signature achievement helped pave the way for the Affordable Care Act's passage\nBy Al Weaver • 10/23/15 2:01 PM The problem is that there is a lot of data that the administration has to validate and include into the tool.\n\"We have a little over half the data to be validated and we need that to be better,\" Lordes said.\nThe administration is confident that it will get enough data into the tools, said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees healthcare.gov.\nPatients already can search for their doctors or prescription drugs, but a consumer has to click on a link to the specific plan and search on the insurer's website.\nFor example, if you pick a certain plan from Aetna, you have to go to Aetna's site to make sure your doctor is covered.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner McCarthy fired up, wants cuts in debt ceiling deal McCarthy said a \"clean\" debt ceiling increase makes no sense as it would just allow the debt to soar higher.\n  1:32 PM The idea of the tools is to make it easier for consumers to find that information, said Kevin Counihan, CEO of healthcare.gov.\n\"We are taking that plan information and aggregating it in a way to make it simpler,\" he said.\nWhen the tools are released, the administration will \"tell enrollees that this is the first year and recommend they call the physician office and call the health plan just to make sure,\" Counihan said.\nThe out-of-pocket calculator will be available when open enrollment starts next month. Healthcare.gov will go live the morning of Oct. 25 so consumers can start shopping for plans.\nThe calculator works by asking questions about consumers' predicted medical costs throughout the year, such as how many times they visit the doctor and the amount of prescription drugs and lab tests are needed.\nAfter factoring in the plan selected by the consumer, the calculator gives the consumer an estimated out-of-pocket cost for that specific plan.\nThe calculator can help \"to really educate people on the plans they are picking,\" Counihan said.\nCounihan touted other new updates to the website, such as a more streamlined user experience that includes new screens that show whether a consumer is eligible for tax credits or Medicaid.\nThe Obama administration has set a modest goal for 2016 open enrollment, hoping to sign up or re-enroll 10 million people. That is about the same amount that has paid their premiums for Obamacare plans as of June.\nHealthcare.gov was the subject of much criticism when the website rolled out in 2013, as it frequently crashed and made it difficult for consumers to sign up for it.\nSlavitt said the administration has learned from its mistakes.\n\"The marketplace was a new experience, [and we] learned a lot from open enrollment,\" he said. \"As we enter year three, we continue to listen and learn.\"\nTop Story House Republicans vote to repeal key pieces of Obama's health law House GOP   Obamacare.\n  11:59 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:41:54.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
