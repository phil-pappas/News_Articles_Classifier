Coming in close behind are Montreal's Ville-Marie-Le Sud-Ouest--Île-des-Sœurs with 18,580, and Calgary Centre with 15,750.\n\"These numbers point out the importance of restaurant jobs not only in these ridings, but in every community across the country, particularly for young people,\" said Donna Dooher , president and CEO of Restaurants Canada. \"It's a matter of pride to us that one in five working young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are employed in the restaurant and foodservice industry.\"\nRestaurants Canada has met with candidates throughout the campaign, calling for policies to help operators continue to invest in their communities and create jobs. More than 1.2 million people are directly employed by the foodservice industry, making it the country's fourth-largest employer.
