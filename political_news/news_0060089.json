This violates the Human Rights of thousands of people who are in pain or suffering daily but do not have a terminal illness.\" \nCannabis Party policy would allow patients or their caregivers to grow cannabis or buy it from specialised medical dispensaries. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:28:19.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
