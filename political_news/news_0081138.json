Langone . This revolutionary cancer center, modeled after the most progressive, patient-centered human cancer hospitals, provides an integrative and centralized approach, utilizing the most innovative treatments to prevent, diagnose and care for animals diagnosed with cancer.\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, nearly 12 million new cancer diagnoses are made in dogs and cats each year, in comparison to 1.6 million new cancer diagnoses in humans. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in nearly 50 percent of dogs, particularly those over age 10 and the leading cause of disease-related death in cats. As healthcare for pets continues to improve, cancer can now be detected and treated more quickly, leading to better outcomes and allowing patients to live longer, happier lives?,\" said Dr. Richard Goldstein , Chief Medical Officer at Animal Medical Center. AMC's veterinary oncologists diagnose and treat all types of cancers, including: bladder, bone, brain, breast, colon, head and neck, liver, pancreatic, prostate, skin, testicular, thyroid, leukemia, lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and spinal tumors.\nThe 2,470 square foot Cancer Institute's visionary design provides AMC's 22-member oncology team, comprised of four board certified oncologists- including the only onsite, full-time Radiation Oncologist in New York State - with the optimal environment needed to diagnose and treat more patients, focus on early detection and work toward a cure for cancer through advanced research. \"The core mission of the Institute is to provide the highest quality of life for animals with cancer, as well as to maximize the amount of time owners can spend with their beloved pets,\" said Elaine Langone . \"Having lost quite a few dogs to cancer, Ken and I believed the new Cancer Institute at the AMC was an initiative worth supporting.\"\nThe Cancer Institute at AMC provides immediate benefits: veterinary oncologists are equipped with the most efficient working environment to conduct more clinical research in an effort to identify new treatments; expand the educational platform for matriculating interns and residents while providing owners and pets undergoing treatment therapies with much needed privacy. Additionally, the new Cancer Institute has the latest state-of-the-art technology and equipment often found in leading human hospitals; expanded exam and treatment rooms; a radiology suite; an onsite diagnostic laboratory to provide critical patient information within minutes of sample collection; and digital radiographic imaging that will allow AMC's oncologists to obtain superior quality diagnostic radiographs with less radiation exposure.\n\"We are so deeply grateful to Elaine and Kenneth Langone for their incredibly generous support, unwavering commitment to AMC and for their unique vision in helping us to create the new Cancer Institute,\" said Kathryn Coyne , AMC's Chief Executive Officer.\nIntegrative Treatment Provides Better Outcomes for Pets with Cancer\nA unified clinical approach to treatment can enhance outcomes and prolong lives. The Cancer Institute at AMC provides several 'unique' specialty services, including:\nInterventional Radiology and Interventional Endoscopy - tools traditionally used in human medicine, AMC's interventional specialty veterinarians employ intra-arterial chemotherapy to treat bladder cancers and cryotherapy to treat nasal tumors. Radiation Oncology uses pioneering radiation treatments for cancer available in veterinary medicine. The Cancer Institute at AMC is one of the few facilities in the tristate area that offers both Stereotactic Radiotherapy (Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy/SBRT; Stereotactic Radiation Therapy/SRT and Stereotactic Radiosurgery/SRS) and Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy/IMRT to treat tumors in the brain, nasal cavity, oral cavity, periocular region, thyroid, cervical spine, lumbar spine, sacrum and abdomen. Additionally, AMC offers the advantage of a board certified radiation oncologist onsite - a presence that is critically essential for offering high quality radiation treatment, while guarding against tissue damage and unsuccessful tumor control, resulting in the best care possible for patients. Integrative Medicine offers complementary and alternative therapies to work in concert with traditional cancer treatments. Among the modalities used: cold therapeutic laser, acupuncture, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy. The Animal Medical Center is home to some of the most important breakthroughs in cancer treatment for pets, such as the Canine Melanoma Vaccine developed in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. \"With the volume of clinical care, ongoing research of naturally occurring cancer in companion animals, and collaboration with leading physicians and researchers at premier NYC hospitals, the Cancer Institute at the AMC is setting the standard in cancer care for pets,\" said Dr. Nicole Leibman , Head of Oncology at Animal Medical Center.
