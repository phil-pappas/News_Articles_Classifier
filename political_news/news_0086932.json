(Ted S. Warren/AP) DEBT LIMIT TO HIT NOV. 5. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew notified Congress Thursday that lawmakers have until about Nov. 5 to increase the debt limit. Power Post has more: \n“The deadline puts additional pressure on Boehner to pass a debt limit increase before he leaves office to ensure that the country does not default on its debt. The Ohio Republican has said he would like to wrap up as much business as possible before leaving Congress at the end of October, but he will have to battle conservatives in his own party who are demanding that the next Republican leaders cut spending and reign in the debt.”\nJOBS REPORT COMES IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in Sept., lower than the 200,000 that have been added each month on average. The lower number calls into question the stability of the economy, reports the Post’s Ylan Q. Mui. \n“The U.S. labor market has made significant strides since companies shed hundreds of thousands of workers amid the nation’s worst downturn since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate hit 10 percent at its peak in 2009. Millions of workers were out of a job for six months or more , and many were so discouraged about their prospects that they simply quit looking .\nOn each of those measures, the job market is moving back to normal. But one critical area has remained stagnant: Wage growth has been stuck at about 2 percent for several years and did not budge last month. That means despite the recovery in the job market, many workers have yet to see a corresponding bump in their paychecks”\nDEMS STILL WANT SPENDING INCREASES. A group of the top Democratic leaders in the House and Senate met Friday to discuss upcoming budget negotiations with Republicans and walked away with one demand: increase both domestic and military spending equally. It is not a new demand. Democrats have said since early this year that it is their goal to bust the sequester caps but the pressure is on to get a deal before the latest stop-gap spending bill runs out in December. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) held a news conference Friday after the meeting to press Republicans to come to the negotiating table. The Hill’s Mike Lillis has more:\n“The comments from Reid and Pelosi foreshadow a tough fight ahead, as Republican leaders consider the across-the-board sequester cuts — enacted as part of the 2011 Budget Control Act — to rank among their top legislative victories under President Obama.\nExcepting for defense spending, which many Republicans want raised, GOP leaders want to keep the sequestration cuts intact in the name of smaller government and deficit reduction. They also face additional pressure from some conservatives to cut even deeper in pursuit of a balanced budget, something that would be a non-starter with Obama and the Democrats.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:11:37.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
