Diplomats had warned that the apparent slowdown in Britain would mean that summit would be little more than a “rendez-vous”, with no deal in sight until the March council at the earliest. \n“The pace will now quicken and I’ll begin setting out the four vital areas where we need change, laying down what those changes will be at the start of November,” Mr Cameron said. \n“So we quicken the pace and the quicker those negotiations in the run up to the December Council. I’m confident we can get a good deal for Britain we can fix these things that need to be fixed. I’m confident this process is well underway and making good progress.” \nEU officials had complained that the detailed legal work of the renegotiation was unable to begin without a text – withheld apparently for fear of leaks. Sources claimed they were told to read the Conservative manifesto and Mr Cameron's speeches to understand his demands, documents that are light on technical details. \nMr Cameron has set out four 'baskets' of reform he wants: increasing competitiveness, a four-year waiting period on migrant benefits, protecting Britain from eurozone integration and reater powers for national parliaments. \nThe remarks will help defuse what could have been a bruising row over dinner. Diplomatic sources had warned that several Prime Ministers were ready to confront Mr Cameron. \nHe was speaking after a lunchtime meeting with Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Council. He yesterday said that little progress had been made in technical talks running since June. \n\"To tango it takes two. I am not a splendid dance, but at least I know the rules which have to be observed by others,” Mr Juncker told the European Parliament. “We have to dance, and our British friends have to dance.” \nMartin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, said this morning: “I hope as far of the UK government is concerned and certainly with individuals and David Cameron, we can make steps forward. Above all we need clarity on what we are going to be discussing over the next few months.\" \nAngela Merkel and Francois Hollande had both pushed the Prime Minister to clarify what he wants at recent dinners at Chequers.
