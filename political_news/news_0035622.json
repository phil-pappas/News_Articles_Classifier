By Jason Stein and Patrick Marley of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 12, 2015 1:33 p.m. (0) Comments \nMadison — Mandatory probation for state workers would be doubled rather than quadrupled, under changes to a civil service bill that's one of several major proposals coming before lawmakers Tuesday. \nIn a crammed day at the Capitol Tuesday, committees are voting on bills focused on abortion provider Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and the proposed changes to the merit hiring of state workers. An overhaul of the state elections agency and a rewrite of rules on powerful wells will have hearings before lawmakers. \nTuesday's action sets up a string of floor votes later this month and in the first week of November, as the Legislature finishes its work for the fall session and the rest of the year. \nRepublicans say these wide-ranging bills will streamline state government and make the state's system of laws more fair. But Democrats said they're more about GOP lawmakers grabbing power for their side while ignoring the needs of the state's economy and environment. \nThe first bill up for a vote in the Senate Labor Committee would overhaul a century-old civil service system designed to ensure that taxpayers are writing paychecks to competent state employees rather than political hacks. \nThe measure would apply to some 30,000 workers from across state government, excepting only political appointees and employees at the University of Wisconsin System and the Wisconsin National Guard. \nThat proposal would have originally increased the probationary period for state workers from six months to two years. Under an amendment being offered by the bill's author, Sen. Roger Roth (R-Appleton), the probation would instead increase to one year, with state managers having the option to seek an extension to two years. \nDemocrats and civil service advocates are warning the bill could jeopardize the system first approved in 1905 during the state's Progressive Era. Gov. Scott Walker and the bill's GOP sponsors say the system needs reworking to become more efficient and help keep up with the crush of retiring baby boomers. \nThe proposal by Roth and Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke (R-Kaukauna) would establish uniform standards and gradually steeper penalties for employees who aren't performing. \nThe proposal would centralize human resources functions in the state Department of Administration and would: \n■ Drop the exams that job candidates for state government are often required to take in favor of a résumé system. \n■ Define \"just cause\" for firing employees to make it clear that the state could immediately dismiss employees for showing up to work drunk, being physically violent, engaging in sexual harassment, stealing taxpayer goods or not showing up to work for three days in a year with no notification. \n■ Implement a statewide system to fire, demote or reduce the pay of workers who aren't performing if agencies use a system of gradually ratcheting up discipline. High-capacity wells \nSeparately Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy is holding a hearing on a broad high-capacity well proposal that seeks to mediate between big water users like large farms and the environment. \nThe issue is one of the most contentious currently before lawmakers, drawing passion from dairymen and vegetable growers as well as anglers and the owners of lakefront homes. \nSen. Rob Cowles (R-Allouez), the bill's lead sponsor in his house and chairman of the Senate committee, has worked for the past year on the measure dealing with wells drawing more than 100,000 gallons of water per day . It's still not clear where some key groups such as advocates for clean water and the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation will come down on the proposal. \nThe measure represents just the latest statehouse conflict over these powerful wells, which farm and business groups say are needed to drive the economy and which environmentalists say pose a threat to the health of streams, lakes and wetlands, especially those in Wisconsin's Central Sands region. \nThe bill would set up a process for the Department of Natural Resources to recommend and then for lawmakers to approve \"sensitive resource areas\" where high-capacity wells would face added hurdles or conditions that would be established at that time. \nAlso Tuesday, committees of the Assembly and Senate will hold a joint hearing on bills that would dissolve the state Government Accountability Board and replace it with a pair of commissions on ethics and elections; rewrite campaign finance laws and double donor contribution limits; and allow people to use the Internet to register to vote. \nUnder another bill having a hearing Tuesday, people would still have to vote in person or by mail, but could get themselves registered over the web. \nThe accountability board, formed in 2008 with broad bipartisan support, consists of six former judges and is responsible for running elections and oversees ethics, campaign finance and lobbying laws. Republicans in recent years have said they believe the board has unfairly helped Democrats, in particular because of an investigation — now shut down — into how Walker's campaign and conservative groups worked together in recall elections. \nThe board members say they are guided by state law, not partisanship, and deny they have favored Democrats. \nThe bill would do away with the accountability board and create an Elections Commission and an Ethics Commission. Both would consist of six members — three Democrats and three Republicans. Backers of the bill say that will ensure fairness, but critics say it will lead to gridlock and let officials escape scrutiny. \nThe campaign finance bill would double how much donors can give to candidates and adjust those limits for inflation every five years. \nThe bill also would rewrite campaign finance laws that are out of step with a host of state and federal court rulings that have loosened campaign finance restrictions. In one change, it would codify the state Supreme Court's ruling this summer that issue groups and candidates can work together. \nThe Senate Health Committee will also vote on several bills that have picked up momentum in the wake of a conservative group's recording that Planned Parenthood critics say shows an official of the group discussing the cost of providing fetal body parts for medical research with anti-abortion activists posing as tissue buyers. \nThe first bill would allow ban research on certain tissues derived fetuses. The other two proposals would reduce millions of dollars in public funding — largely money from federal taxpayers — to Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin to provide services such as family planning and send that money elsewhere.
