Accra Won’t Make You President – Ephson Tells Nana Addo By Kasapafmonline.com/Ghana \nPollster, Ben Ephson says Nana Akufo Addo’s plan of winning the Greater Accra Region to secure him victory in 2016 elections, will not materialize as his projections are not backed by facts in Ghana’s electoral history. \nHe’s insisted it is critical for the leader of the Dankwa-Busia-Dombo tradition to review his estimations for the upcoming polls, since Gt. Accra region alone cannot be a litmus test for his overall victory come 2016 general elections. \nSpeaking on Anopa Kasapa on Kasapa 102.3 FM , Ephson said “from the year 1996, anybody who has won Gt. Accra region also wins Central and Western regions as well” \nThe NPP flagbearer has told party faithfuls in Greater Accra to ensure the NPP wins majority of popular votes and parliamentary seats in next year’s Presidential and Parliamentary elections. \nAccording to him, Greater Accra remains a key region that has to be won by all means, saying this is the only way to guarantee victory for the party in the 2016 elections. \n“The number one region in terms of population in Ghana today is no longer Ashanti Region. It is Greater Accra. The region is now the most populous region in the country. \n“Right from Kwame Nkrumah’s time until now they say you have to win Greater Accra to win Ghana. We have to win Greater Accra to win Ghana in 2016. \n“In 2000 we did it and we can repeat it in 2016. If we are going to win Greater Accra we have to have a language that appeals to everybody. Good positive language. \nHe was speaking at a rally in Tema to climax the first phase of his rise and build tour of the country.
