However, such a move would be widely regarded as weakening Mr Corbyn’s control over his party. \nMeantime, Downing Street defended Britain's response to the Syrian refugee crisis after it was condemned as \"deeply inadequate\" by more than 300 lawyers, including a former president of the Supreme Court. Promoted stories \nLord Phillips of Worth Matravers, the first head of Britain's highest court, three other former law lords and Sir Nicolas Bratza, the former president of the European Court of Human Rights, were among the signatories to a statement denouncing an offer to house 20,000 refugees over five years as \"too low, too slow and too narrow\". \nFive retired Lords Justices of Appeal together with Lord MacDonald, the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Carlile QC, the Liberal Democrat peer, and more than 100 other Queen's Counsel, were also on the list.
