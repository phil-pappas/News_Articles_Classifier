We recommend their rejection,\" the lead judge, Augusto Nardes, said after the court's panel voted unanimously. INSIDE STORY: Is Brazil's Dilma Rousseff facing impeachment?\nThe government says it did nothing illegal and that it was merely juggling funds in line with previous practices.\nThe court's ruling, which next goes to Congress, was likely to give powerful impetus to Rousseff's congressional opponents, led by the scandal-plagued speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, who has repeatedly threatened to push for impeachment. Late on Tuesday, another judicial body, the electoral court, or TSE, ruled in favour of probing alleged illegalities in Rousseff's 2014 re-election campaign.\nThat ruling will not immediately lead to sanctions, instead opening the door to a legal and political battle that in theory could result in Rousseff's narrow 2014 victory being declared invalid - and new elections being organised.\nEspecially worryingly for Rousseff was that one of the allegations in the complaint brought to the TSE by the opposition PSDB party was that some donations to the president's re-election coffers were linked in part to the massive Petrobras corruption scandal shaking the country.\nRousseff chaired Petrobras, the state oil giant, during the main period of the kickback and political payoff scandal that cost the company more than $2bn in 2014.\nBut the scandal - which has already seen dozens of politicians, high-ranking executives and lobbyists accused of corruption - has so far left Rousseff relatively unscathed.\nCliff edge\nNow facing two legal assaults and with the country plunged into steep recession, Rousseffs rule is on a cliff edge.\nAccording to the latest opinion poll, approval for Rousseff, from the long-dominant Workers' Party (PT), is at just 10 percent.\nThe government had made a failed last-ditch attempt to delay Wednesday's session of the Federal Accounts court, appealing to the Supreme Court over Nardes' alleged lack of impartiality.\nThe rejection of the legality of the government accounts was the first such ruling since 1937, when the 1936 accounts were thrown out, officials said.\nSource: AFP And Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:52:38.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
