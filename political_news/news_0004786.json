I just read on here about the socialists wanting to pay women a salary to stay home and breed. Well not them, but the evil business owners or the government. These mind numbing social justice warriors cannot seem to make up their minds. Should women be treated as equals or as vessels for offspring? Should a woman have the right to choose or should we provide a financial incentive for them to procreate? \"My reproductive choices are mine and mine alone\" I agree w/ so why should anyone shell out the cash for the little parasites besides those who plan on raising them? But here is the kicker, the world is over populated. These are the same people building tree forts to stop deforestation, chaining themselves to bulldozers to stop mining. This and that about climate change or the ozone layer and now they want to pay people to make more people! what the fuck? Creating another human is a sure fire way to shoot your carbon footprint thru the stratosphere. Check it out. Having children is the surest way to send your carbon footprint soaring, according to a new study from statisticians at Oregon State University. The study found that having a child has an impact that far outweighs that of other energy-saving behaviors. Take, for example, a hypothetical American woman who switches to a more fuel-efficient car, drives less, recycles, installs more efficient light bulbs, and replaces her refrigerator and windows with energy-saving models. If she had two children, the researchers found, her carbon legacy would eventually rise to nearly 40 times what she had saved by those actions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:55:58.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
