Michael Bennet on Thursday introduced new legislation meant to add safeguards to the nuclear deal the U.S. reached this summer with Iran.\nThe bill requires the administration to report regularly on Iran's nuclear development while also directing more aid to Israel, including the accelerated development of a missile defense system.\nIt \"ensures that Israel can defend against nuclear and conventional threats,\" said Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, at a news conference on Capitol Hill.\nBut added protection for Israel isn't the only potential effect of the bill, which likely has a steep path to passage in a Republican-controlled Congress.\nThe measure also could provide political cover for Democratic lawmakers, such as Bennet, who supported the Iran deal and have drawn fire from some pro-Israel and conservative groups.\nNotably one outfit called Advancing Colorado unveiled an ad last month that showed schoolchildren counting down to the detonation of a nuclear bomb. The ad then accused Bennet, who is up for re-election in 2016, of \"jeopardizing our safety.\"\nAdvertisement One prominent pro-Israel group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, did not take an immediate position on the new bill; a spokesman wrote in an e-mail that AIPAC was reviewing the legislation.\nGetting Republican support could be difficult, as the caucus roundly opposed the Iran deal. At the news conference, U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said the group had talked to Republicans but acknowledged they had yet to recruit a GOP ally.\n\"I did have discussion with Republicans, (and) they were interested in seeing how Democrats could come together. And I think this bill shows how Democrats could come together,\" said Cardin, who opposed the Iran deal .\nBennet noted that Democratic co-sponsors included lawmakers who took different positions on the Iran deal, which should bolster its credibility.\nHe said he had yet to speak with U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, his Republican counterpart from Colorado, although Bennet said he had discussions with other GOP members about the issue.\nGardner could be difficult to convince. He was an outspoken opponent of the Iran deal and in a statement Thursday expressed major qualms about the new proposal.\n\"This bill is not a solution to anything,\" Gardner said. \"It is just a list of dangerous problems that have been created by President Obama's nuclear deal with Iran. I'll review this proposal as I normally would any legislation, but I'm not interested in supporting legislation offered to try and place salve on a self-inflicted wound.\"\nMark K.
