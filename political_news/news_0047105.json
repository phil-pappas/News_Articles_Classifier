We have 30 years of experience bringing the community and film together, and public access has operated for 42 years in Austin under various umbrellas. We saw this as a way that AFS could expand opportunities for the people of Austin to learn creative media skills and appreciation – increasingly necessary to flourish in today’s media-rich world.\" \nThe new look station also comes with new management, with two new hires announced: • Mirasol Enriques as director of community media • Former Houston Cable One manager and KXII-TV producer/director Darla Doshier as Austin Public Access manager \nThere is also some continuity, as three veterans of the station will stick around: • Brian Blake will remain as IT manager. • Former programming director Doug Gray becomes community media facilitator. • Charles Wright will serve as equipment and lab coordinator. \nAFS is still finalizing plans for exactly what the content of the new public access channels will be, but are already hoping to increase storytelling opportunities for Austinites, as well as more educational collaborations and professional development (see \" Meet the New Boss ,\" Sept. 4). \nThere will be a bedding-in process as AFS gets ready to move forward. For example, for the next two weeks the building will be open, but AFS will not be releasing equipment to producers, or booking studio space. However, the expectation is that the reservation system will be back online by Oct. 16. \nFor more details, visit www.austinfilm.org/Austin-Public-Access .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:41:31.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
