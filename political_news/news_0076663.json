Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImage\nAs more details of Malia Obama’s pre-frosh visit to Brown surface, it really sounds like she got the full, authentic College Student Experience: She ate in the dining hall, slept in the dorms, went to a hall party, went off campus and got a burrito bowl at Chipotle — and then, in total authentic college fashion, someone leaked a Snapchat of her at a party.\nNow, there's no need to worry. There wasn't anything revealing about the Snap, really. She was captured in the vicinity of a beer-pong table but not playing beer pong; she was near some college dudes but wasn't interacting with the dudes. In fact, she looked a little bit bored by the antics going on around her. (I always knew you’d have great taste, MaBama — my little nickname for her.)\nBut here's what is revealing: Our collective reactions to seeing our Malia Obama, the child we’ve watched grow into a teenager, attend a college party. This pretty much exposes how old we all are in our souls. Here’s our best guesses for your age, based on how you responded to MaBama’s beer-pong escapades:\n“Man, college looks awesome!”: roughly 15 years old, without a learner’s permit.\n“Dude, I totally want to hang out with Malia.”: 24 and missing college.\n“Oh my god, she looks so young!”: 29 and missing college and your college metabolism before life ground it to a halt.\n“Oh dear lord! Get her away from that young man.”: 37 and in denial about missing college.\n“Her hair looks perfect.”: Inconclusive, could be any age.\nWell, look who it is. pic.twitter.com/6udrgD55iT\n— STEVE HOLT (@SteveHoltGDX) October 16, 2015", "external_links": ["http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/16/exclusive-malia-the-only-cool-obama-plays-beer-pong-during-college-visit-photos/", "http://t.co/6udrgD55iT", "https://twitter.com/SteveHoltGDX/status/655062778235850752"], "published": "2015-10-17T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:14:15.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
