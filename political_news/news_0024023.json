Chuck Grassley, R-New Hartford (Photo: Special to the Des Moines Register) 1 CONNECT 25 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIt’s long overdue that our elected officials are starting to focus on ensuring law enforcement and penalties for criminal offenders are fair and effective. But what about the penalties on people who may lose their homes, property and money without ever being charged for a crime? Buy Photo \nKathie Obradovich (Photo: The Register) \nU.S. senators Charles Grassley of Iowa and Rand Paul of Kentucky and others have spoken in favor of bipartisan legislation restricting the use of asset forfeiture by law enforcement. But when Grassley announced major, bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation last week, asset forfeiture was missing. \nGrassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday he is still working with other senators on asset forfeiture and he hopes to have draft legislation soon. But whether the measure could be part of the bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 remains uncertain. \n“I would like to have asset forfeiture as a part of this bill,” Grassley said during his weekly call with reporters. It still could be, he said, but it also may have to be a separate bill if the eight primary co-sponsors of the legislation can’t agree to include it. \nMore than six months ago, The Des Moines Register highlighted some alarming abuses of asset forfeiture laws that allow police to seize property from people suspected of criminal activity. The Register investigation showed Iowa law enforcement agencies had seized $43 million in more than 5,200 cases. A review of 600 cases found dozens in which people forfeited property without being arrested or charged. \nThe law enforcement agencies get to keep 90 percent of forfeited cash and property. They say it is a valuable tool to deter crime. Most is spent on equipment, training and coordination on task forces. But the Register found a few cases in Iowa of forfeited money used to buy scented candles, tropical fish and other items with no obvious law-enforcement purpose. \nOne of the goals of the proposed bill would be to eliminate what some have called the “profit motive” for police to seize cash and property without evidence of criminal activity beyond a traffic violation. But, Grassley said, one of the sticking points is how to replace that money in law enforcement agency budgets. \nWhen you get into the sausage-making of the legislative process, Grassley also has a tough choice to make. Inclusion in the larger criminal justice bill could significantly improve the forfeiture reform’s chances of passing the Senate and maybe even reaching the president’s desk. \nOn the other hand, opposition from law enforcement to watering down asset forfeiture could swamp the much-needed reforms to sentencing and corrections in the larger bill. Some good ideas may have to wait. \nAsset forfeiture reforms were also introduced in the Iowa Senate this spring, state Sen. Joe Bolkcom, D-Iowa City, said. The bill missed a committee deadline for consideration this year but should not be forgotten next year. \nIt’s both socially and fiscally responsible to find more effective ways than lengthy prison sentences to deal with non-violent criminals. But if police can still take and keep your property without even charging you with a crime, there’s no justice for anyone. \nCAUCUS PODCAST: Don’t miss the debut Thursday of the podcast “Three Tickets.” The 11-week series by Register reporter Jason Noble explores the past and present of the Iowa caucuses. You’ll hear interviews with former caucus candidates Bob Dole and Walter Mondale, journalists Chuck Todd and Mark Halperin, and political advisers David Axelrod and Joe Trippi, among others. \n“Three Tickets” will be available at DesMoinesRegister.com/ThreeTickets and on iTunes and Stitcher.
