When Congress flirted with the issue in 2011 it resulted in the US losing its prized triple-A credit rating. More Democratic debate for 2016 race As it happened \nThe issue is complicated by politics on Capitol Hill where the Republican-controlled House is in chaos since the resignation of Mr Boehner and an aborted bid to replace him with Kevin McCarthy , the majority leader. Both events were forced by the Freedom Caucus, a small but powerful faction that opposes raising the $18.1tn borrowing cap without a corresponding cut in government spending. \nGiven the enormous damage a default would do, most analysts expect Congress to authorise a suspension, or increase the ceiling, since few lawmakers want to be associated with the kind of breach that Ben Bernanke, when chairman of the Federal Reserve chair, warned would be a “recovery-ending event”. \nDoug Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, said the chaos would actually help resolve the issue. “Speaker Boehner has indicated he wants to clear the decks of issues during his final month. I’d assume this is one of the issues he will put on the House floor for a vote,” he said. \nBut Vin Weber, a retired Minnesota congressman with close ties to his former colleagues, worries that Congress will “play chicken” with the issue, which has also become a topic in the presidential campaign. Donald Trump, the frontrunner for the GOP nomination, has urged Republicans to use the threat of not raising the borrowing cap to force the Obama administration to cut spending. Critics have pointed out that raising the ceiling does not authorise new spending, but just allows the US to pay its existing debt obligations. \nEven if Congress ultimately raises the cap, the brinkmanship can still hurt financial market confidence and the economy. And even assuming a deal on the debt ceiling is achieved, a costly shutdown of the government could still occur in December if lawmakers fail to reach a budget deal. There is no way to predict the irreparable damage that default would have on global financial markets and the American people \n- Jack Lew, US Treasury secretary \n“We have learnt from the past that failing to act until the last minute can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence, raise short-term borrowing costs for taxpayers, and negatively impact the credit rating of the US,” Mr Lew said last week. “And there is no way to predict the irreparable damage that default would have on global financial markets and the American people.” \nIn addition to the downgrade, the brinkmanship in 2011 hit financial markets. The Monday after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 635 points. Annualised economic growth slowed sharply in the third quarter to 0.8 per cent, although the expansion quickly regained its footing in the fourth quarter, with the economy expanding 4.6 per cent. \nA report into the 2013 impasse — the last time Congress debated the issue — from the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog, uncovered damaging side-effects. Financial market participants avoided holding hundreds of billions of dollars in Treasury bills with payments due in late October through mid-November of that year because of their worries about default. \nYields on bills maturing in that period surged from about 1 basis point — one one-hundredth of a per cent — in mid-September to over 50 basis points before the showdown was resolved a month later. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, estimates that the extra borrowing costs as a result of the spike cost taxpayers $350m-$400m. Investors also stopped accepting at-risk securities as collateral during the period. The GAO said investors were warning earlier this year they would take similar steps if there were a re-run of the debt ceiling cliffhanger this year. \nThe debt limit was reset in March, restricting total borrowing to $18.1tn. Since then the Treasury has used extraordinary measures to avoid violating the ceiling. Mr Lew has said these will probably be exhausted on November 3 as the government’s cash buffer dwindles to less than $30bn. \nThe Republicans’ permanent revolution \nRead more \nThat does not give lawmakers much time to reach a deal — especially since some want to strike a broader two-year budget deal at the same time. Ironically, the latest debt-ceiling showdown comes at a time when US government finances are in strong shape. The deficit was just 2.5 per cent of GDP in 2015, far below heights of 10 per cent reached during the Great Recession. \nWhile the damage from a shutdown would pale in comparison to an outright debt default, it would still be costly. A review of the 2013 shutdown by the Congressional Research Service this year cited third-party estimates predicting a reduction of at least 0.1 percentage points in GDP growth for each week of the shutdown. \nFurloughs of federal workers during the 2013 closure were equivalent to 6.6m work days, with the number of employees on unpaid leave reaching 850,000 at the beginning of the shutdown. \nAmong the indirect impacts were damage to the travel industry because of closures of national parks, interruptions to the oil and gas sector because of the cessation of drilling permits, and disruption to small businesses that need loan guarantees from the Small Business Administration. \nA report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimated that the combined impact of the shutdown and debt ceiling brinkmanship meant around 120,000 fewer private sector jobs were created in October of 2013. \nWhile some federal spending was delayed, it was not permanently reduced, and furloughed federal employees were later paid in full. The US economy went on to expand by an annual 3.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013, suggesting the impact of the budget battles was relatively shortlived.
