Conveyor belts help excavate coal in Wyoming.\nBy Alan Neuhauser Oct. 6, 2015 | 5:40 p.m. EDT + More Coal companies should be charged as much as five times what it costs them for surface mining on federal lands, according to a new report from a nonpartisan think tank at the New York University School of Law.\nThe royalties that companies pay to mine coal on federal lands have not been upgraded in decades , and through a variety of loopholes and incentives, companies have been allowed to fork over just a fraction of what would seem to be required by law – leaving as much as $1 billion a year on the table for the past 30 years, the study notes.\n\"In some cases, it's gaming the system, in other cases, it's using the rules to the best of their advantage,\" says Jayni Hein, the study's lead author and policy director at the NYU School of Law's Institute for Policy Integrity, which released the report this week. \"There's no reason these companies should be able to lease coal for the same price they were able to decades ago.\"\n[ READ: U.S. Solar, Wind and Oil Production Rise, Coal Falls ]\nAdvocates on both sides of the aisle – fiscal responsibility groups seeking to make sure taxpayers earn their \"fair share\" and environmentalists focused on protecting ecosystems and slowing climate change – have found a common cause in calling for an overhaul to the coal royalties program, which is overseen by the Interior Department.\nAbout 40 percent of coal that's mined in the U.S. comes from federal lands, the report says. Since 1990, 36 percent of leases offered for sale have featured a royalty rate reduction\nThose discounts woefully undervalue U.S. coal, the report says. They also distort the free market, shifting the environmental costs of mining, shipping and burning coal onto consumers in the form of higher rates of lung disease, habitat loss and wildlife disruption.\n\"They're really imposing uncompensated costs on the public,\" Hein says.\nAbout 90 percent of the coal drawn from federal lands comes from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana, where mining costs about $1 per metric ton, Hein says. The institute's analysis, however, finds that coal's environmental consequences cost the public at least $5 per metric ton – and that's not even including the health impacts from particulate matter puffed into the air by the diesel freight trains that transport the coal.\n[ ALSO: Ski Towns Mull Future Without Skiing – and Put Coal in the Crosshairs​ ]\n\"These externalities are costing the public, so Interior could either tack on that $5 per metric ton in terms of what royalties are owed, or it could increase the royalty rate,\" Hein says.\nInterior Secretary Sally Jewell has vowed to make changes to the coal leasing program , which first launched in the 1920s, and the department held a series of listening sessions on reforming it this summer.\n\"Our task by the end of the administration is to put in place common-sense reforms that promote good government and help define the rules of the road for America's energy future on public lands,\" Jewell said during a March appearance at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the nation's capital.\nCoal companies, however, insist that the current program is sufficient – and, in fact, argue it overestimates the value of coal.\n\"Critics of the current program are doubly wrong,\" Hal Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association, said in a statement this summer as the Interior Department embarked on its listening sessions. \"They're obviously wrong in claiming the current royalty is too low, and they don't understand how their push for higher rates is out of step with current market conditions and a bad deal for all Americans.\"\n[ MORE: Interior Department to Ramp Up Energy Regulation ]\nCoal companies have faced stiff competition from natural gas, which has become cheaper as a result of the nation's domestic oil and gas boom, and which some policymakers say is cleaner to burn than coal. These market forces are also being reinforced by the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan , which is effectively encouraging states to switch from coal to natural gas and renewables like wind and solar to reduce their power sector emissions.\nBut even as coal's market share has been squeezed in the U.S., there remain lucrative markets overseas. Last year, exports accounted for about 10 percent of sales from coal produced in the U.S., the study says. The Interior Department, however, doesn't calculate royalty rates based on the export value of coal – instead, it determines a royalty from the \"first sale,\" which occurs in the U.S. and is therefore typically much lower.\n\"They're using a domestic sale price in order to pay their royalties, and that can result in a windfall for American coal companies and a loss to taxpayers,\" Hein says. \"Our recommendations really go to catching up to the current state of technology, the current level of understanding of environmental costs, and accounting for the duty Interior has to the American public to earn a fair return.\"\nTAGS: coal mining energy energy policy and climate change global warming environment Department of the Interior EPA NYU", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdy2gk%3Fsrc=usn_tw&via=usnews&text=Coal%20Royalties%20Leave%20%241%20Billion%20on%20the%20Table%2C%20Report%20Says", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdy2gk%3Fsrc=usn_li&title=Coal%20Royalties%20Leave%20%241%20Billion%20on%20the%20Table%2C%20Report%20Says&summary=A%20new%20report%20urges%20the%20Interior%20Department%20to%20make%20sure%20coal%20companies%20pay%20their%20%27fair%20share%27%20when%20mining%20on%20federal%20lands.%26nbsp%3B&source=U.%20S.%20News", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdy2gk%3Fsrc=usn_gp", "http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdy2gk%3Fsrc=usn_rd&title=Coal%20Royalties%20Leave%20%241%20Billion%20on%20the%20Table%2C%20Report%20Says", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdy2gk%3Fsrc=usn_fb", "http://policyintegrity.org/publications/detail/reconsidering-coals-fair-market-value", "http://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ft.usnews.com%2FZdy2gk%3Fsrc=usn_su"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T03:19:28.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
