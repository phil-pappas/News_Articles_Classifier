We must have systems in place to process and check that risk. \n“HortNZ will continue to work constructively with air and cruise lines, as well as the Ministry for Primary Industries, to help improve both passenger compliance and consequently passenger experience. Given our industry’s biosecurity expertise we can bring some value to the discussion about border compliance,” Julian says. \n“However, protecting our agriculture, horticulture and viticulture, and New Zealand’s unique natural flora and fauna - which forms a key part of the tourism experience - must be our first consideration.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:57:47.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
