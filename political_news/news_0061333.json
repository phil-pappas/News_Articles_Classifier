Our new genetic tests enabled us to retest samples from the first mortality event in 2012 and these revealed the bacteria were present then. It is possible it may even naturally occur here.” \nThere have been no reported increased mortality events in wild fish or in farmed salmon outside of the Marlborough Sounds. \nAs a precautionary measure the Marlborough farms put biosecurity controls in place to prevent any spread of the bacteria and MPI is enforcing this. \nThe future welfare of fish is also top of mind for MPI which is the lead agency in animal welfare. \n“We take animal welfare seriously and are working with the company to plan for the upcoming summer.” \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:36:46.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
