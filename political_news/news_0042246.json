The rest are involved in counterterrorism and other missions.\nTo Capitol Hill critics of the plan who say even the 5,500 number is too law, Carter responded that the Pentagon \"did a lot of homework\" on what the best estimate would be for a necessary U.S. force presence.\nPentagon press secretary Peter Cook said Carter had conversations about Afghanistan with NATO allies in Brussels last week and said the secretary left \"feeling confident\" that they will step up and contribute their own troops.\nHe said the Pentagon has an idea of the level of commitment it can expect from allies, but could not provide an exact breakdown.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Boehner's bucket list: Find a speaker, solve fiscal train wreck The current House speaker had hoped he could retire on Oct. 30.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/16/15 12:01 AM Top Story RNC chair: Republicans are 'cooked' if defeated in 2016 The Republican Party has become a \"a midterm party\" that struggles with the presidential elections.\nBy Al Weaver • 10/16/15 12:01 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:33:38.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
