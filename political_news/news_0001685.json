This year, hundreds of lawyers and judges are expected for the Oct. 21-23 conference at the Marriott Legacy Town Center in Plano , which will include a live trial featuring Wyatt Earp , a descendant of the infamous lawman who also carries his name.\n\"We're welcoming some of the country's most respected lawyers and judges, who'll be meeting with their colleagues and learning more about the incredible work being done in Eastern District courts,\" says conference chairman Clyde Siebman of Siebman, Burg, Phillips & Smith , who founded the EDTX Bar Association in 1995.\nA highly anticipated roundtable discussion set for 10 a.m. on Thursday, Oct. 22 , will focus on how courts can best address abusive patent lawsuits and make sure that only legitimate patent cases remain on the docket. The panel of retired and sitting federal judges from California , New York and Texas will be moderated by noted trial lawyer Doug Cawley of McKool Smith in Dallas .\nOn Friday, Oct. 23 , attendees will witness a mock trial involving wrongful death claims against Wyatt Earp filed by the family of Tom McLaury , who was killed during the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1881. Mr. Earp will appear in full period clothing as part of the program sponsored by the American Bar Association Section of Litigation and The Litigation Institute for Trial Training.\n\"This is a great opportunity to see an incredibly interesting trial based on one of the most storied events in our nation's history,\" says Michael Truncale , president of the Eastern District Bar Association and a partner in Beaumont's Orgain Bell & Tucker, LLP . \"The Wyatt Earp trial provides important lessons for today's lawyers even though the case originally was heard more than 130 years ago.\"\nThe Eastern District of Texas Bar Association is committed to facilitating justice in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas , which is headquartered in Tyler with divisions in Beaumont , Lufkin , Marshall , Sherman and Texarkana .
