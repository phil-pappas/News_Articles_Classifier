Even as the hearing became more contentious in its closing moments, Clinton largely avoided stumbles that could hurt her later in her campaign.\nFor Republicans, however, Clinton’s lengthy appearance on Capitol Hill will likely be touted as a sign of the party’s commitment to an issue that resonates with many of its voters.\nAs Clinton began her testimony, she urged lawmakers to “reach for statesmanship” and rise above partisanship on national security issues. When asked by a friendly lawmaker how it felt to be accused of contributing to the deaths of four Americans, she spoke in a soft tone about the emotional toll of the 2012 attacks.\n“I imagine I’ve thought more about what happened than all of you put together,” Clinton said. “I’ve lost more sleep than all of you put together.”\nAnd when the committee’s Republican chairman and top Democratic member heatedly argued about making public the panel’s earlier private hearings, Clinton sat back with an amused smile on her face for several minutes. She appeared more than happy to stay out of a partisan spat that seemed to bolster her campaign’s contention that the hearing was more about politics than uncovering new information about the violence in Libya.\nFor Clinton, the hearing in the cavernous House committee room was a setting that played to her strengths. She’s long been more comfortable delving into detailed policy discussions than giving lofty speeches or engaging in other trappings of political campaigns. And she’s often been at her best when she has an opponent with whom to draw a contrast — in this case, a Republican-led committee.\nClinton was sharply challenged by GOP lawmakers on a range of issues, from requests for additional security at the Benghazi compound that went unfulfilled to her frequent e-mail exchanges about Libya with Sidney Blumenthal, a longtime Clinton friend who had no role at the State Department.\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan also repeatedly revived questions about the Obama administration’s shifting accounts of what happened at the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi and nearby CIA compound, positing that the White House was eager to avoid political damage from a terror attack less than two months before President Obama faced re-election.\n“I’m sorry it doesn’t fit your narrative, congressman,” Clinton said in response. “I can only tell you what the facts are.”\nClinton’s testimony was unlikely to end Republicans’ quest to use the much-scrutinized Benghazi attack to question her judgment and leadership. Her performance also was unlikely to drastically affect her standing in the Democratic race, where she faces a challenge from Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Nearly half of Democrats and a majority of independents said they don’t have strong feelings about the Benghazi investigation, said an AP-GfK poll.\nStill, emerging from the hearing largely unscathed contributed to a sense of momentum around her presidential bid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:48:45.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
