That is a testament to the readiness, know-how and composure of householders across the Island, supported by the organization and skills of service-minded emergency workers who are there to help people in need and to make sure the operations that link us together stay working, often in the face of very challenging conditions. \n“Their presence is reassuring and a big reason why Bermuda handles hurricanes as well as any people on the face of the planet,” concluded Senator Woolridge. \nIn a separate statement, Shadow Public Safety Minister Walter Roban said, ”As Hurricane Joaquin moves away from Bermuda, and we reflect on the aftermath and Joaquin’s impact on the island, let us all be thankful that at most we may have to face is temporary power outages and loss of communications in some areas. \n“As a country we are extremely thankful to the work of the Emergency Measures Organisation [EMO] which has worked over the last 48 hours to prepare the island for the worst possibility. Their role remains crucial to our safety and preparedness through crisis. \n“Let us be thankful for the work of the hundreds of personnel inclusive of the emergency services, hospital, police, regiment, fire, public works, civil service and all other government workers who must take time from their families to make sure at rest of us our safe. \n“Included in this major thank you would be BELCO, BTC, Cablevision and others now working to restore their services to the public. \n“As we begin to move about, let us be patient and cooperate with those teams of workers out there working all over the island putting our infrastructure back in place. Continue to look for any of your neighbors who may be alone or somehow challenged. \n“Helping family, neighbors and friends transition back to normal is as important to assisting with the storm preparation. As residents we should all be thankful that Bermuda has once again seen itself through the storm with people safe, and all of us working together to clean up and get back to the regular course of Bermudian life,” concluded Mr Roban.
