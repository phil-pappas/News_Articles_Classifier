Gen. Enitan Ransome Kuti — a nephew of music legend Fela Ransome-Kuti — was sentenced to six months in jail for losing weapons to Boko Haram.\nArmy spokesman Col. Sani Usman said Ransome-Kuti was found guilty of \"failure to perform military duties.\"\nThe civilian deaths at the Jan. 2 battle for Baga, headquarters for a multinational force against Boko Haram, were not part of the case.\nLawyer Femi Falana said the military is discriminating since it has dismissed other courts-martial. Soldiers' death sentences for offenses including running away from battle have been reprieved.\nChadian troops regained Baga in March.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
