LEAD ATA also exposes its participants to the many tools available to industry executives through ATA.\n\"When we announced LEAD ATA in 2013, we set out to attract the best and brightest in trucking and provide them with the tools to direct our industry and ATA into the future,\" said Kevin Burch , ATA second vice chairman and president of Jet Express , Dayton, Ohio . \"The first two classes have been a roaring success and I am anxious to see what this next group has to offer ATA and the trucking industry as a whole.\"\n\"Leadership is very difficult to come by, but even more challenging to maintain and pass down from generation to generation. From the moment that we heard about LEAD ATA, we felt an instant affinity to the mission and ideals of this innovative program,\" said PeopleNet General Manager Mark Kessler . \"Witnessing the thought leadership that the past graduating classes are doing by engaging in committees and taking on our industry's toughest challenges, makes us even more proud of the legacy that LEAD ATA will leave behind.
