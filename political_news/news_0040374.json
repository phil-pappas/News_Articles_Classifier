(John Minchillo/AP) By Laura Vozzella October 22 at 3:53 PM Follow @LVozzella RICHMOND — Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg’s gun-control group will bankroll a $1.5 million advertising campaign for a Northern Virginia state Senate candidate, in its second massive ad buy in the state in as many days.\nLess than two weeks before Election Day, Everytown for Gun Safety on Thursday announced that it would spend $1.5 million in TV and online ads for Democrat Jeremy McPike. He is running against Manassas Mayor Harry J. “Hal” Parrish II (R) to succeed retiring Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D-Prince William).\nA day earlier, Everytown said it would spend $700,000 on ads for Democrat Dan Gecker, who is battling Republican Glen Sturtevant to represent part of Richmond and surrounding suburbs in the Senate. That seat is being vacated by retiring Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan).\nThe ad campaigns, featuring the father of a Roanoke TV journalist shot to death on the air in August, target the two seats considered most up for grabs in the 40-member Senate. Democrats need to pick up one seat to take control of the chamber and give Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) a chance for legislative success for the final two years of his term. The GOP enjoys an overwhelming majority in the House of Delegates.\n[ McAuliffe’s hopes hang on two Senate races ] \nThe size of the ad buys are startling by state Senate standards, particularly in the less expensive Richmond TV market. In the Richmond-area race, the $700,000 ad campaign is on par with the $772,000 that Sturtevant took in through September, and more than half as much as the $1.2 million that Gecker had raised. The $1.5 million that Everytown is plowing into the Northern Virginia race approaches the $1.6 million that Parrish and McPike raised between the two of them.\n[ Bloomberg gun-control group rolls out $700K ad buy in critical Va. Senate race ] \nAsked at a public appearance outside Richmond Thursday if he had spoken with Bloomberg about the ad buys, McAuliffe said no. But he responded coyly when a reporter asked if he had any contact with Bloomberg’s “people.”\n“Oh, I didn’t say that, but I haven’t talked to Mayor Bloomberg,” McAuliffe said.\nEverytown’s big investment in Virginia reflects not only the stakes of the Senate races for McAuliffe but also the belief among gun-control advocates that their cause has begun to gain steam even in gun-friendly states following high-profile mass shootings, such as the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n“Even in the NRA’s backyard, political leaders are standing up against gun lobby interests and pledging to put gun safety, and the safety of Virginians, first,” Everytown President John Feinblatt said in a statement. “The political calculus has changed and this is what Virginians and Americans expect our elected leaders to do to prevent gun violence.”\nIn announcing the latest ad buy, Everytown touted “decisive victories in 2014 that proved that gun safety is a winning issue at the ballot box, including the passage of I-594, Washington State’s background check ballot initiative, and the victory of more than 80 percent of Everytown’s endorsed candidates. Among them were governors in states that passed background check legislation since Sandy Hook including Governor Dannel Malloy (CT), Governor Andrew Cuomo (NY) and Governor John Hickenlooper (CO).”\nOn the campaign trail in 2013 and since taking office, McAuliffe has often noted that he is a hunter who owns several guns. But he also has pushed for what he described as “common-sense” gun restrictions, such as closing a loophole that allows gun buyers to avoid background checks if they purchase from private sellers. His proposals have gone nowhere in Richmond’s Republican-controlled House and Senate.\nMcAuliffe stepped up his calls to close the “gun-show loophole” after a gunman killed two Roanoke journalists on live TV in August. WDBJ reporter Alison Parker, 24, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, were attacked by a troubled former colleague, Vester L. Flanagan II.\n[ Two Roanoke journalists killed on live television ] \nGun-rights legislators and activists have accused McAuliffe and others of politicizing the tragedy because Flanagan legally bought his gun from a licensed dealer, passing required background checks. There was nothing in the way of a criminal or mental-health history to prohibit his purchase.\nParker’s father, Andy Parker, appears in both of the TV ads, calling for closure of the gun-show loophole but also acknowledging that “we can’t stop all gun violence.”\n“My daughter, Alison, and her cameraman were gunned down on live television,” he says in the opening of the ad, titled “Condolences.” “I know we can’t stop all gun violence, but we can save lives if our leaders take action.”\nIn the latest ad, a narrator picks up from there, saying, “But we can’t count on Hal Parrish to act. He gets an A from the gun lobby. They fund his candidacy while fighting against background checks to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Parrish will make us less safe.”\nParker then closes the 30-second spot with: “Politicians’ condolences aren’t enough. It’s time for them to act.”\nParrish’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSturtevant campaign manager Matt Brown pushed back against the ad, saying the candidate cares about the “difficult issue” of gun violence as the father of three young children. Brown also noted that Sturtevant’s brother was at Virginia Tech the day of the 2007 massacre, and that his father worked in the Washington Navy Yard and lost colleagues to a shooting there in 2013.\n“Glen is committed to ensuring that our federal and Virginia gun laws are strictly enforced and no one ineligible to possess a firearm does so, that our brave men and women in law enforcement have the resources they need to keep us safe, and that we do a better job of identifying and treating mental illness before it leads to tragedy,” Brown said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:37:08.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
