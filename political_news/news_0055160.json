But after much thought I have decided to end my campaign for president today. I would like to take this opportunity one last time to advocate for a chance be given to peace,” he said. The former Rhode Island governor and senator had little to no support in early polls, and put in a widely-mocked performance at the first Democratic debate last week.

Vice President Joe Biden decided not to run on Wednesday, and former Virginia senator Jim Webb said goodbye on Tuesday. Chafee said in his statement that he was worried Republicans would set back women’s rights and is looking forward to a Democratic victory. “Since today is all about women’s leadership it reminds me of one of my favorite Greek plays; Lysistrata, a comedy from about 400 BCE by Aristophanes. In that play, a group of women, fed up with the war mongering of their husbands, agree to withhold their favors until peace returns. And it worked!” OK, Lincoln, sure. Thanks for the memories.
