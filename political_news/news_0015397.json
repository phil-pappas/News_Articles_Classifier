(AP) - Five pastors and a deacon met with Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear's chief of staff on Tuesday to again urge the outgoing governor to accommodate Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis' wishes to not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The ministers from four counties gave the governor's office a petition they said had 1,700 names on it asking the governor to call a special session of the state legislature so lawmakers could pass a law exempting Davis and others from issuing marriage licenses. \nRELATED: AG candidates wrangle over Davis case Beshear cannot run for re-election because of term limits. Beshear's chief of staff told the pastors the governor would not call a special session because it would cost too much money for an issue that only affects a few county officials.
