Kiran Kumar Reddy Hyderabad: The “GAME Tower”, to promote animation and the mobile gaming industry, which was planned in Raidurg on the city outskirts, has failed to cross the tender stage even after almost three years. Tenders have been called twice but there was no response from bidders.\nThe TS Industrial Infrastructure Corporation, which was formed more than a year ago, has not been able to finalise any tenders. It had called for tenders with a deadline of September 10 this year. But there was poor response. Following this, it had extended the deadline to September 29 but in vein.\nWhile the project had got stuck due to controversy over land allotment in the beginning, it failed to take off even after the issue was resolved.\nFormer chief minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy had laid the foundation for the Rs 350-crore project on January 8, 2014. The facility was aimed to provide ready-to-use infrastructure for gaming, animation, multimedia and entertainment companies and would have common facilities to help small firms and start-ups access latest technologies and software. The Tower was planned with 8 lakh square ft of space spread over 30 acre.\nThe project hit the first roadblock after realty major DLF sought the same plot of land earmarked for the development of the Game City project. DLF sought this land after cancellation of an earlier allotment of a plot to it in the same area after the Heritage Committee refused to permit construction on the plots.\nThe plots were auctioned by APIIC in 2008 without considering heritage issues, which could crop up later in the area due to its proximity to the Golconda Fort and Durgam Cheruvu.\nOut of 13 plots sold, Bengaluru-based Purvankara had bought 20 acre with Rs 400 crore and DLF had bought 30 acre with Rs 600 crore. But the Heritage Committee, whose approval is mandatory along with municipal authorities in select regions, refused permission to both companies.\nTSIIC officials said the Tower, aimed to provide employment for 15,000 people and with an export target of $50 crore, would be expedited and a reputed international consultant would be roped in for the purpose soon.\nStates: Telangana nation Current affairs South Golconda fort Also Read Campaign against girl child abuse in Coimbatore Cops go moral, harass actor, pal Rohtak sisters’ award on hold; bus driver and conductor reinstated K Chandrasekhar Rao fails to get Golconda", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151012/nation-politics/article/‘game’-plan-lies-limbo", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Kiran%20Kumar%20Reddy.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Kiran%20Kumar%20Reddy.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:35:39.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
