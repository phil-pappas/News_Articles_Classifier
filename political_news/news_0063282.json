Bramlett, Jr. of Clarksdale, who was a pioneer of the Mississippi Republican Party and worked as a Cochran field representative in the Mississippi Delta for almost 13 years before his retirement in March 2014: \"I am saddened by the passing of Leon Bramlett. He was a gentleman and as fine a man as you would want to meet. His service to the people of Mississippi is indicative of a life characterized by service to others and a love of family, the Delta and our country. Leon was a friend. My staff members and I extend our sincere condolences to the Bramlett family.\" ### WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, R-Miss., issued the following statement regarding the death of Leon Bramlett: “We have lost one of our most distinguished Mississippians. Leon represented the best of the greatest generation – the kind of patriot that made America great. At the Naval Academy he was an All-American football player and decorated boxer. He served his country as a Marine Corps officer and spent his life dedicated to serving our state. He was a pioneer for the two party system in Mississippi. I believe that Leon would have made an outstanding Governor. Gayle and I extend our deepest sympathy to his family.” 10/19/15 Posted October 20, 2015 - 4:55 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
