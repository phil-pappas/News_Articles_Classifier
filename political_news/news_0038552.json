The former Virginia senator complained repeatedly during last week's first Democratic presidential debate that he wasn't being given enough time to speak. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- the two contenders dominating in the polls -- were the focus of attention, he contended. Webb is holding his news conference at 1 p.m. ET at the National Press Club. His campaign is billing it as a discussion of \"his candidacy, the campaign and his views of the political parties in the current election cycle.\" <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Race to the White House More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:33:55.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
