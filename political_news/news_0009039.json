Other ministers believe the letter illustrates the political sensitivity of the decision.\nThe Cabinet Office said they would not comment on leaked documents, but the anxieties in government are real and are twofold.\nThere are concerns over any comments making the final decision more vulnerable to a legal challenge - tying up the decision in the courts for years to come.\nAnd there is significant political opposition around the cabinet table, including from the London Mayor, Boris Johnson.\nDecades of dithering He, along with others, is all too ready to remind David Cameron of his own vow in 2009, \"no ifs, no buts\", ruling out a third runway at Heathrow.\nBut the business community is eager for a decision to be made, after decades of political dithering.\nAnd the government, particularly the chancellor, have made big promises about pushing ahead with big infrastructure decisions, even citing the Airports Commission as an example of how the case for major projects should be independently made.\nBut resistance to Heathrow is passionate and powerful. The prime minister and the chancellor have promised to make a decision by Christmas, but that promise won't be easy to keep.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3B9B/production/_86195251_f11fb00e-3495-456c-b4b4-5a6537304008.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/245B/production/_83970390_heathrow_expansion_nw_runway_sat_624.jpg", "http://static.bbci.co.uk/news/1.91.0426/img/correspondents/circles/laurakuenssberg.png"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:07:52.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
