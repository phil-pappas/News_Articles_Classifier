He also admitted he made all his interns read Atlas Shrugged, dishing them out as Christmas presents. But here's the political problem for Ryan. Many were queasy when George Bush cheesily described Jesus as his favourite philosopher, but at least he knew his market. In contrast, few books can be as hostile to the Christian faith as Atlas Shrugged. For Rand, the good Samaritan was not simply a chump: he was in fact doing something wicked. We are saved only by selfishness. So how can an American politician, who has described himself as a \"staunch Catholic\" and in what is supposed to be an electorate dominated by Christian values, side with one who so thoroughly rejected all the teachings of Jesus? Ryan has now predictably backtracked. \"I reject her philosophy. It's an atheist philosophy. If somebody is going to try to paste a person's view on epistemology to me, then give me Thomas Aquinas.\" By the way, this is the same Thomas Aquinas who insisted that, \"Man should not consider his material possession his own, but as common to all, so as to share them without hesitation when others are in need,\" thus espousing the very collectivism that Rand so loathed. Words are cheap, especially on the campaign trail. By your deeds shall you know them. And Ryan's deeds, and in particular his budget plan for slashing the role of the state, are pure Rand, as a group of Jesuits from Georgetown University have insisted: \"Your budget appears to reflect the values of your favourite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Her call to selfishness and her antagonism toward religion are antithetical to the Gospel values of compassion and love.\" The US Catholic bishops' conference, not well-known for its progressive politics, has said much the same. Ryan is a hypocrite...but a true follower of Ayn Rand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:26:01.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
