(AP) â€” The Miami Dolphins led 35-0 midway through the first half, and while the rest of the sideline celebrated, interim coach Dan Campbell stood alone, staring at the scoreboard and managing to keep a straight face.\nFor Campbell it was business as usual, with blowouts the norm so far.\nThe Dolphins' astounding turnaround under their new coach gained momentum Sunday, when Ryan Tannehill completed his first 18 attempts and threw for four scores in first 16 minutes to help beat the Houston Texans 44-26.\nThe drubbing was even more emphatic than Miami's 38-10 win at Tennessee a week earlier in Campbell's debut as a head coach. Fans chanted his name as the game ended.\n\"It's not me; it's this team,\" Campbell said. \"These guys want it. To watch the transformation they've made and the ownership they've begun to take, I'm glad I'm part of it.\"\nCampbell is only the fifth interim coach of 26 in the NFL since 2000 to win his first two games, according to STATS. Since the firing of Joe Philbin on Oct. 5, the Dolphins (3-3) have gone from notorious underachievers to contending for their first playoff berth since 2008.\n\"I always said this team had the players and playmakers and talent to play like we have the last two weeks,\" Tannehill said. \"For whatever reason we weren't showing up the way we wanted to. Give credit to Dan and rest of the coaching staff that they've turned it around.\"\nThe Texans (2-5) are heading the other direction. To compound their misery, running back Arian Foster hobbled off the field late in the game with an Achilles tendon injury that might end his season.\nThe Dolphins had been 0-7 previously against Houston, the only team they had never beaten. Miami faces a quick turnaround before playing Thursday at AFC East leader New England (6-0).\nMiami became the first team in at least 75 years to score four offensive touchdowns of at least 50 yards in a half, according to STATS. Tannehill extended his two-game streak to 25 consecutive completions, an NFL record, before he threw his only incompletion in the fourth quarter.\nJarvis Landry scored on a jaw-dropping 50-yard catch and run through most of the Texans' defense.\n\"Somehow he makes 46 guys miss,\" Tannehill said.\nLandry also caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Tannehill. Lamar Miller scored on a 54-yard reception and an 85-yard run. Rishard Matthews scored the game's first points when turned a short pass from Tannehill into a 53-yard score.\nThat was all in the opening half, when the Dolphins built a 41-0 lead. They tied a franchise record of 21 points in the first quarter, done three other times, and 35 points at halftime set in 1967, their second season.\nThe Dolphins began pulling their regulars at halftime. The Texans drew little solace from scoring four touchdowns in the second half.\n\"Terrible,\" O'Brien said of their performance. \"It's something I take full responsibility for.\"\nThere were signals before the game that not of the Texans were ready. Former starting quarterback Ryan Mallett missed the team flight and made the trip on his own.\n\"You've got to be on time,\" Mallett said. \"That's not the leadership role I need to exhibit. I need to be better.\"\nThe Dolphins, by contrast, were nearly flawless until a missed extra point kick after their sixth touchdown.\nMiller rushed for 175 yards on 14 carries, all in the first half. Tannehill went 18 for 19 for 282 yards, with a perfect passer rating of 158.3.\nMiami did not have a 50-yard play from scrimmage previously this season. Tannehill became the first quarterback to throw three touchdown passes of 50-plus yards in a first half since Randall Cunningham in 1998, according to STATS.\nReshad Jones scored for the defense on a 23-yard interception return, snatching a deflected pass and somersaulting into the end zone for the second week in a row. He became the first Dolphins player with a pick-six in consecutive games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:07:36.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
