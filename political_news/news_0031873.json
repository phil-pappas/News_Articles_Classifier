If the government wants to cut taxes honestly, it needs to permanently tie tax brackets to inflation. \n\"Bracket creep has cost the average household $1036 since 2010, far more for higher-income families, and the bill keeps rising. \n\"Bill English even admitted in March that the government relies on this hidden tax increase as a revenue stream, but with surplus finally reached, it’s time he made this tax-by-stealth strategy a thing of the past. \n\"Ending bracket creep would ease long-term tax pressures on households. Better yet, it would force future governments to make tax changes openly and honestly, instead of simply hoping Kiwis won’t notice the effects of bracket creep tax increases.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:14:43.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
