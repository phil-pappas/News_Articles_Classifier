Promoted stories \nCarterton and Witney, separated by a journey distance of up to three hours from Oxford, have failed to fulfil their economic potential. You can travel to Gloucester or Cheltenham from Witney in much less time than it may take you to reach the centre of Oxford. \nIf this situation continues, Witney will be deprived of the social and economic diversification it desperately needs and simply left serving Cotswold tourists and second homes. \nThe county council has attempted to grapple the problem through a series of master plans. \nIts first iteration of Connecting Oxfordshire, the plan for the county’s transport, presented a surreal dream of a high tech Oxford served by monorails, an international airport and new links to London. \nEverywhere to the west of Cassington was ignored. \nIn the run-up to May’s General Election, a BBC survey found the A40 issue to be more important to the people of Witney than all other issues combined – more than the NHS, austerity, housing or Trident. \nThe county council is now desperate to be seen to be doing something. \nSo it’s busy arranging consultations galore in an attempt to reassure us that it can offer hope of salvation and a say about which solution to favour. \nOf course, we know there are choices to be made. The council has just received its consultant’s report on the options – and their cost. \nWe might bring back the train we once had, and even use part of the old track bed. Or we might have light rail, or perhaps a tram. Or we might give the existing buses a hand with dedicated bus lanes, or even guided bus ways. Then there is the option of 50 years ago, turning the A40 into a dual carriageway, an option that seems obvious to Witney’s Chamber of Commerce. \nThe Oxfordshire car lobby sees the right to drive as a basic freedom, whatever the costs to the public purse, or the environment. \nThe county council, however, is obliged to spend the funds allocated by the Local Enterprise Partnership on a public transport solution. \nSo the new vision is to have bus lanes from Oxford as far as Eynsham, where a park-and-ride will accommodate those who take to the buses. \nWOT believes that this choice is mainly dictated by the limited funds being allocated, rather than by a proper evaluation of needs. \nWe also see a blatant disconnect between the planned cuts to rural buses and the proposal to rely on buses to connect Witney (and surroundings) with Oxford. Where is the coordinated long-term strategic approach in all this? \nOur preference would be for a modern, integrated rail option made up of series of sequential transport exchange nodes (car, bike, buses, rail). \nThese could be built in several stages, spreading costs over a period of years, as well as requesting major housing developers to contribute. \nWe strongly dispute the figures by the recently appointed consultants; given that mile for mile their estimated cost of reopening the link between Yarnton and Witney would be much higher than that of opening the Scottish Border railways. \nA serious problem requires a serious solution. Share article \nThe council should lobby central government for real funds, not just a few crumbs. It should also aim to extract as much compensation as possible from developers. \nOther local authorities around the country have demonstrated that where there is a real will to provide cutting-edge long-term transport solution the appropriate funds can be found.
