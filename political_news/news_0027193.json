Ms Thomson’s property deals involved the “back to back” buying and selling of houses, owned by vulnerable people. They were bought at below full market value and then resold at far higher prices, often on the same day.\nAt First Minister’s Questions on Thursday, Nicola Sturgeon claimed that she had known nothing about Thomson’s business activities until she read about them in newspaper reports. .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:20:48.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
