In kindergarten, she wouldn't talk to anybody. In middle school, she had her first panic attack . In high school, she asked teachers to move her to lower-level classes, where she was less likely to have to give presentations. Through the years, she'd intentionally \"forget\" her gym clothes so she could sit on the sidelines instead of participating. She dropped college classes that wouldn't exempt her from public speaking and told prospective employers she wouldn't take the job if it meant talking in front of others. \"This idea of people watching me made me very anxious,\" she says.\nIt wasn't until Genova got screened for anxiety in college that she learned she wasn't just timid – she had social anxiety. \"I went in and nailed that test,\" she says.\nSocial anxiety disorder , which affects about 15 million Americans, is a psychiatric diagnosis characterized by the \"extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations,\" according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America .\nShyness, on the other hand, is a more subjective label describing people who want to interact with others, but can't do so comfortably, says Koraly Perez-Edgar, an associate professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University, where she studies shyness and social anxiety. More than 60 percent of parents think their teens are shy, and about half of teens call themselves shy, according to a 2011 study in the journal Pediatrics.\n\"If you're shy, you might be like, 'I wish I could participate more, or I feel held back and this is uncomfortable,'\" Genova says. \"Where social anxiety is rampant in your head: 'What's wrong with me? Why can't I talk? Will this go away? People are going to think I'm strange. I'm going to walk away and worry about this for days.'\"\nWhy So Shy?\nAs many parents know, two kids from the same gene pool can have very different personalities. Shyness, which can surface in children as young as 1 year old, is no exception, says John Walker, a professor in the Department of Clinical Health Psychology at the University of Manitoba and director of St. Boniface General Hospital's Anxiety Disorders Program​.\n\"Some children and young people are quite shy and uninhibited, and others are very bold and outgoing,\" he says. \"There's good evidence there's a strong genetic component.\"\nIn Perez-Edgar's work, for example, she's found some kids seem to be biologically predisposed to backing away when they don't understand or can't control the world – especially the social world – around them. Toddlers who pay particular attention to things they consider threatening​ – say, interpreting someone's diverted glance as disapproval or even being especially wary of a jack-in-the-box​ – are less likely to grow out of their shyness and develop anxiety, her ​2011 study in the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology found.\n\"It's adaptive and normal for people to be on the lookout for threats in their environment, whether they be physical or social, because you want to protect yourself,\" she says. \"But if you have an individual who seeks out threats too much or has a low threshold for what they consider threatening … they're more likely to withdraw and look shy.\"\nEnvironment matters, too. Parents who are too harsh or overprotective , for example, can boost their children's odds of going from shy to socially anxious. Kids who have just one or two good friends​, on the other hand, are likely to grow up into well-adjusted adults, Perez-Edgar says.\n\"There's a huge component from the environment and what actually happens to the child over the course of development,\" she says.", "external_links": ["http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3756613/", "http://www.adaa.org/social-anxiety-disorder", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3208958/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:29:52.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
