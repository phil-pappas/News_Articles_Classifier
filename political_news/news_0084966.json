Trade ministers from a dozen Pacific nations meeting in the United States have extended talks on a sweeping trade deal until Saturday in a bid to get a final agreement on the most ambitious trade pact in a generation. \nThe talks in Atlanta were originally scheduled to wrap up on Thursday but have been extended in a determined effort to produce a breakthrough on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would liberalise trade in 40% of the world economy for a region stretching from Vietnam to Canada. \n\"No-one wants to leave without an agreement,\" Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told Reuters after a second plenary session of top officials from all 12 nations. \"The good news is that we will not leave here without one.\" \nNew Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser has flown from New York to Atlanta to attendng the negotiations - something he previously said he would not do if the parties were still so far apart a deal did not seem possible. \nâ€¢ Peters hits back at Clark's TPP comments \nObservers pointed to progress on vehicles, Canada's pledge to compensate farmers hurt by imports and signs of a possible compromise on patent protection for new drugs as evidence of advancement. \n\"We are starting to see the path to an agreement and have agreed to make final efforts,\" Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari said, although conditions were still difficult. \nSeveral officials said a final deal could come quickly if key issues - intellectual property protection for medicines and trade in dairy and autos - are cleared in remaining talks. \nThe alternative would be for ministers to try to reconvene next month, although that risked losing momentum in a process that has already run five years. \nA deal would be a legacy-defining achievement for United States President Barack Obama. \nBut the trade deal is seen as a threat by an array of interest groups from Mexican auto workers to Quebec dairy farmers to cancer patients who worry that it could push the cost of new therapies out of reach. \nCONGRESSIONAL CONCERNS \nIn a reassertion of concern in Congress, a group of US lawmakers from both parties sent a letter to US Trade Representative Michael Froman and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Wednesday. \n\"We urge you to take the time necessary to get the best deal possible for the United States, working closely with us,\" said the letter signed by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch as well as the senior Democrats on those two committees. \nSeveral Republicans attacked a new US proposal to ensure governments would be free to enact anti-smoking measures without fear of legal action by tobacco companies. \nThat could prevent companies like Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco Inc from using rules to protect foreign investors to challenge public health measures but falls short of the sweeping measure anti-smoking groups had hoped for. \nGuajardo said talks on auto trade had progressed but were not over yet. \nThe auto issue is crucial for Japan, whose automakers, led by Toyota Motor Corp, depend on sales to the US market and want flexibility on sourcing auto parts. \nBut Mexico, which has experienced a boom in auto-related investment over the last two decades, wants to protect its manufacturers against increased competition from Asia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:37:34.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
