Xing/Nature via AP)\nAssociated Press Oct. 14, 2015 | 1:06 p.m. EDT + More By MALCOLM RITTER, AP Science Writer\nNEW YORK (AP) â€” Scientists say dozens of fossil human teeth from a cave in China show that people lived in southern Asia more than 80,000 years ago,\nThat's more than 30,000 years earlier than the fossil record had previously established.\nOur species, Homo sapiens, is thought to have appeared in Africa around 200,000 years ago. The details of its dispersal from there are still murky.\nThe scientists report finding 47 teeth in a study released Wednesday by the journal Nature. They estimated that the teeth are 80,000 to 120,000 years old.\nThe researchers said the finding raises the question of why it took so long for our species to enter Europe later on. They said maybe it was because Neanderthals were already there.\n____\nOnline:\nNature: http://www.nature.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
