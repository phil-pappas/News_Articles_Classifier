Marco Rubio on Monday: a 24-bottle care package with the label “Trump Ice Natural Spring Water.” The set of bottled water was sent to the Rubio campaign’s Washington office on Monday. The package also had two towels with the “Make America Great Again” Trump campaign slogan, Trump campaign bumper stickers, and a note that said “Since you’re always sweating, we thought you could use some water. Enjoy!” according to CNN .\nIt’s a jab at Rubio who awkwardly reached for a bottle of water right in the middle of his 2013 State of the Union rebuttal to President Barack Obama. It’s also the latest attack in the squabbling between Trump and Rubio. Both candidates have been delivering strong poll numbers in the Republican primary field, sparking tensions.\nDuring a recent debate, Trump poked Rubio for being sweaty.\n“Rubio, I’ve never seen a young guy sweat that much,” Trump said during a recent appearance in South Carolina. “He’s drinking water, water, water, I never saw anything like this with him with the water.”\nFollow @politico <div", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/politico", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/05/politics/donald-trump-marco-rubio-care-package/index.html?sr=tw100515donald-trump-marco-rubio-care-package0949PMVODtop&linkId=17706589"], "published": "2015-10-05T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:10:29.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
