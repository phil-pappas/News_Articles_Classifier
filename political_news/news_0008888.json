John Kasich is planning to spend $11.5 million on-air in New Hampshire through the primary election The figure is well short of the $22 million Jeb Bush's super PAC is planning to spend there Washington (CNN) The super PAC supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich is planning to spend $11.5 million on television ads in New Hampshire through the February 9 primary, laying down a clear marker in a state Kasich has said is a must-win for his campaign. The group \"New Day for America\" reserved $5 million in airtime in New Hampshire and Boston media markets from November through the primary. That's on top of the $6.5 million the group has already bought on-air from July through October. WMUR first reported the ad buy. Connie Wehrkamp, a New Day spokeswoman, confirmed the details to CNN Tuesday. That newest tally makes Kasich a strong presence in the New Hampshire ad war for now. But a blast from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's \"Right to Rise\" super PAC proved just how quickly the field can change. \"Right to Rise\" announced last month it would spend $22 million on-air in New Hampshire as part of a larger $37 million buy in early primary states. Kasich's PAC spent heavily on-air early in New Hampshire, coupling with his late entry into the race to give him some much-needed attention this summer. But others, like Bush, have much bigger war chests to work with in the ad war; the pro-Kasich group raised $11.5 million through the end of June, while Bush's super PAC pulled in an eye-popping $103 million in the same period. Read More Kasich and Bush are relying heavily on a win in New Hampshire, but both candidates have been eclipsed in polling so far by Donald Trump and other outsider candidates such as Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson. Kasich is on a four-day bus tour of the Granite State this week and is set to outline his economic plan at Nashua Community College on Thursday. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> Race to the White House From Our Partners", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:54:08.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
