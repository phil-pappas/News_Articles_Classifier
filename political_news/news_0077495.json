An NPP victory, Akufo-Addo stressed, will be a victory for all Ghanaians, as 'it will be a watershed in the development of our country', adding that 'I am confident that Almighty God will look on our hard work and grant us victory in 2016. This victory will not be an NPP victory, but a victory for all Ghanaians.' Nana Akufo-Addo made this known on Saturday, October 10,in a series of meetings with regional and constituency executives, as well as parliamentary candidates from 14 constituencies in the Ashanti Region. The constituencies were Asawase, Manhyia North, Manhyia South, Oforikrom, Suame, Old Tafo, Kwadaso, Nhyiaeso, Bantama, Asokwa, Offinso North, Offinso South, Subin and Bosomtwe. \nStop begging The NPP flagbearer, who has so far toured 8 other regions assured the private sector of the provision of fiscal incentives to stimulate growth of the sector when he becomes President. Nana Akufo-Addo, shocked by President Mahama's decision, literally to beg investors to set up their industries in Ghana, stated that this was not the way to go if Ghana is to industrialize and create the thousands of jobs needed for the teeming masses of unemployed Ghanaian youth. 'What Ghanaians demand from a President of Ghana, endowed with all the power of the State, is to put in place policies and measures which will stimulate the growth of local production, and not to go begging,' the NPP flagbearer said. 'We are not looking for a President who will go and beg for us. We want proper policies that will make it possible for our industries to grow. If you put in place polices aimed at strengthening your currency, reducing interest rates and putting in place an effective fiscal policy, these are the things that will stimulate local production, and not begging,' he added. \nSource: Office of Nana Akufo Addo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:17:31.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
