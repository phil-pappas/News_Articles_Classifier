Dr Colin Tukuitonga, Director General of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), will speak on the future of Pacific regionalism at the University of Canterbury on Tuesday, 27 October. \nDirector of the Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies , Professor Steven Ratuva says that this year’s lecture is an opportunity to find out more about the future of the Pacific, including New Zealand. \n“Pacific regionalism presents significant opportunities and challenges. Dr Tukuitonga will discuss ideas on how regionalism can be appropriately defined and articulated and how a new reconfiguration can impact on the future of Pacific countries, including New Zealand.” \nDr Tukuitonga will examine some of the challenges of development, security and governance in a fast-changing Pacific and the role New Zealand can play. The Pacific is under pressure to work together as one region and Dr Tukuitonga will explore questions relating to what form regionalism should take, what direction it should follow and what collective agenda might be adopted. \nAs the former Chief Executive of the Ministry of Pacific Island Affairs, former Associate Professor in Public Health at the University of Auckland and former Director of Public Health at New Zealand’s Ministry of Health, Dr Tukuitonga has a wealth of knowledge about the issues confronting the Pacific. He now heads the SPC, a regional organisation with a membership that includes 22 Pacific island countries and four founding members: New Zealand, Australia, the United States and France. \n‘The future of Pacific regionalism: Challenges and prospects’ will be held in the A3 Lecture Theatre at the University of Canterbury at 5.30pm on Tuesday 27 October. This event is free and open to the public. \nends", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:36:46.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
