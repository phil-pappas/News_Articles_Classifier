Period.\" \nNow, he's not, according to Katz. \n\"Ted Wheeler is the right choice for job. He can bring together the community to take on the challenges we face and make progress on the issues that matter,\" Katz said in a prepared statement, released Wednesday by Wheeler's campaign. \"Portland needs new leadership, Portland needs Ted Wheeler.\" \nKatz served with Hales on the City Council from 1993 to 2002. \nWheeler, Oregon's state treasurer, also announced endorsement from former mayors Tom Potter and Sam Adams. \nThe endorsements represent a major political victory for Wheeler, who considers himself the underdog in the 2016 race. No Portland incumbent has lost a re-election bid since 1992. \nSarah Bott, a spokeswoman for Hales' re-election campaign, said she hadn't yet spoken to Hales (who is in a City Council meeting) and couldn't immediately comment. \nOther prepared quotes from Wheeler's announcement: \n\"Portland needs to reach its fuller potential to tackle issues like racial and economic inequality, public safety and climate change,\" said Adams, who won election in 2008 but did not seek re-election in 2012. \"Ted Wheeler has the experience and progressive values to make this happen.\" \n\"Portland continues to grow into a diverse, vibrant community. It is critical that city government adapt to better include communities of color and other voices that have historically been pushed to the margins,\" said Potter, Portland's mayor from 2005 to 2008. \"I am confident that Ted Wheeler has the commitment and passion to take on these important conversations and forge new relationships that ensure the will of the people is heard at City Hall.\" \n-- Brad Schmidt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:50:11.310+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
