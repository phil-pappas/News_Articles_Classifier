(AP) - Wisconsin Republicans on Tuesday moved closer to dramatically restricting the secret John Doe techniques that investigators used against Gov. Scott Walker’s campaign and his former aides, bringing a bill to the floor of both legislative houses that would prevent prosecutors from using the process to investigate political wrongdoing. \nJohn Doe proceedings are similar to grand jury investigations, in that information is tightly controlled. Prosecutors secretly present evidence to a judge and can force witnesses to testify in secret. A judge ultimately decides whether a crime has been committed. \nUnder the bill, prosecutors could use John Does to investigate serious physical crimes and drug activity but not allegations of campaign finance violations, misconduct in office or campaigning on government time. Prosecutors would have to obtain permission from a majority of the state’s chief judges to extend investigations beyond six months. Secrecy orders would apply only to judges, prosecutors, court officials and investigators; witnesses and suspects would be allowed to discuss such investigations openly. \nDebate in the Senate began around midday and lasted all afternoon before minority Democrats objected to a final reading of the bill, the last step before a vote. The move means the Senate can’t take the vote until the next calendar day; Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, told member the chamber would reconvene for the vote at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday. \nThe bill’s supporters began the back-and-forth in the Senate by insisting the bill would protect free speech rights and bring a stop to meandering investigations. Sen. Tom Tiffany, R-Hazelhurst, the bill’s chief Senate sponsor, insisted the bill would make John Doe investigations more transparent and prevent prosecutors from abusing the process. \n“I can tell you I want this to be my legacy,” Tiffany said. “We are protecting the weakest among us.” \nOpponents said the measure is designed to shield politicians and will open the door to corruption. Sen. Jon Erpenbach, D-Middleton, called it a “black eye.” \n___ Senate confirms new WEDC chief officer \nMADISON, Wis. (AP) - The state Senate has confirmed Gov. Scott Walker’s decision to appoint a campaign donor to lead his troubled economic development agency. \nWalker appointed Mark Hogan to replace Reed Hall as CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation in September. The Senate confirmed the appointment on a 23-9 vote Tuesday. \nAccording to government watchdog group Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, Hogan has given Walker’s campaign $24,375 since 2005. Federal campaign finance records show he gave $10,000 to Unintimidated PAC, a super PAC that Walker’s former campaign managers formed to support Walker’s 2016 Republican presidential bid. \nWEDC has been plagued by gaffes and missteps since Walker created it in 2011, including failing to demand proof that award recipients were creating or retaining jobs and making contracts with recipients that didn’t conform to state law. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:46:15.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
