Bernie Sanders. While Sanders has wooed the Democratic base with his liberal positions on issues like income inequality and college debt, he's struggled to defend a more mixed record on gun legislation — a reflection, he says, of his rural, gun-friendly home-state. \nAfter the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2013, Sanders backed all the Democratic gun bills brought up in Congress. But in 1993, he voted against the landmark Brady handgun bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period for gun purchasers, and he backed the 2005 legislation granting legal immunity to many in the gun industry. \nSanders now says he supports banning assault weapons and closing the so-called \"gun show loophole\" that exempts private, unlicensed gun sales from background checks. \nClinton declined to directly go after that record on Monday morning, saying she'd let \"Senator Sanders talk about himself.\" \nBut she said she wasn't surprised by his recent rise in New Hampshire polls, mentioning his long tenure representing a neighboring state. \n\"I really believe this is great for the Democrats and this election,\" she said of the unexpectedly competitive contest. \"We really want to turn out as many people as possible.\" \nClinton has emerged as one of the fiercest proponents of tougher gun control after a series of shootings over the past several months has reignited debate over gun laws in the presidential campaign \n____ \nFollow Lisa Lerer on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/llerer Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:56:05.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
