The Vermont senator entered to the song \"Disco Inferno” and flung some disco-style moves to the lyrics “burn, baby, burn.”\n“You came out here dancing Bernie! That’s fantastic, that’s wonderful. Thanks for being here,” DeGeneres said in a pre-released clip.\n“Thank you for the very positive energy you provide to the American people,” Sanders replied.\nDeGeneres commented that a lot of people like Sanders. She pointed to his interjection during the Democratic debate Tuesday in which he shouted to Hillary Clinton, “The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.”\n“I think that’s the exact thing that people are sick of, is people being political,\" she said. \"I think people just need to hear you say what you feel.\"\n“I think that’s absolutely right,” Sanders responded, noting he’s never run a negative political ad.\nSanders also did a lightening round of questions. For each question he answered “honestly” or “correctly” — with DeGeneres as the judge — the show offered to donate $1,000 for breast cancer research. His responses earned $10,000 in donations.\nSome highlights: If Sanders had to be on a deserted island with one GOP rival for the White house, it would be Marco Rubio because “he’s used to the sun.”\nBernie dances on Ellen Bernie Sanders cuts a rug on Ellen.\nBernie dances on Ellen\nHis Ben & Jerry’s ice cream flavor would be “Burn, Bernie, Burn.”\nHe has been handcuffed before — though he clarified that it was for a civil rights demonstration.\nHe also thinks his hair is better than Donald Trump’s. “That goes without saying,\" he said, pointing to his head.\nSanders said he would sing a song from “Saturday Night Fever” at a karaoke bar, though he needed some help to remember what it was called. “John Travolta walking down the street” is how he described it — it turned out to be the Bee Gees' “Stayin' Alive.”\nHe is not a boxer guy; he’s all about briefs.\nAsked his favorite swear word, Sanders declined to answer.\n<div", "external_links": ["http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:26:23.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
