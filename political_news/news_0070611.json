Trey Gowdy repeatedly asked why Clinton often received and forwarded information from a source who was not an employee of the State Department and did not have particular expertise about Libya. \nAn even-toned Clinton responded that the information from Blumenthal was “originally unsolicited” but that some State Department officials occasionally found the data useful. \n“I think that the sharing of information from an old friend, that I did not take at face value, that I sent on to those who were experts, is something that makes sense,” she said. “But it was certainly not in any way a primary source of or the predominant understanding that we had of what was going on in Libya and what we needed to be doing.” \nClinton maintained throughout the hearing that Blumenthal was not an adviser to Clinton, a claim that Republicans dismissed as unfounded based on the volume of email correspondence between the two. \nAfter Georgia Republican Lynn Westmoreland elaborated on the the frequency with which Blumenthal messaged her on her private account, Clinton did acknowledge that Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was killed in the assault, did not have her personal email address. But she added that Stevens was in constant contact with officials in the State Department. \nWhile Clinton avoided fiery responses to questions, Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the panel openly warred with Gowdy at the conclusion of the morning’s session, and demanded that the committee release Blumenthal’s private testimony to lawmakers in full. \nSpeechless at times, Clinton sat smiling at times as the committee’s top two members argued with raised voices. \n“You asked for the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth!” Cummings said. “Well that’s what we want to have! Let the world see it!” \nAfter the mid-afternoon break, the committee voted along party lines not to release the transcript. \nClinton also fielded a plethora of questions in regards to her role in addressing security concerns as the situation in Benghazi worsened. \nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio questioned the former secretary of state at length about the Obama administration’s initial claim that the attack was a spontaneous response to a video considered offensive to Muslims, pointing out that Clinton acknowledged in messages to “her family” and to the Egyptian prime minister that the attack was not related to the film. \nClinton argued that the situation was fluid in the hours after the incident, and she also said that her public statement alluded to the video because it was meant as “a warning to those across the region that there was no justification for further attacks.” \n“I’m sorry that it does not fit your narrative, Congressman,” she added. “I can only tell you what the facts are.” \nRep. Susan Brooks (R-IN) asked about the slew of emails Clinton sent or received about the deteriorating security situation in Libya, with the Democrat responding that she did not use email for the majority of her work at the time. \n“I did not conduct most of the business that I did on behalf of our country on email,” Clinton said. “I conducted it in meetings, I read massive amounts of memos, a great deal of classified information. I made a lot of secure phone calls, I was in and out of the White house all the time. There were a lot of things happening that I was aware of and that I was reacting to.” \nClinton then proceeded to answer inquiries about why she did not respond to requests from Ambassador Stevens in a call for help to bolster U.S. security at facilities in Libya. She went on to maintain the position of never seeing the requests, which were routed through diplomatic security professionals. \n“I communicated with [Stevens] about certain issues; he did not raise security with me,” she told Gowdy. “He raised security with the security professionals. Now I know that’s not the answer you want to hear because it’s been asked in many different ways by committee members. But those are the facts, Mr. Chairman.” \nRep. Peter Roskam (R-IL) attached Clinton’s name to the decision to deploy an air attack in Libya. \n“Our Libya policy couldn’t have happened without you,” he told Clinton. “After your plan, things in Libya today are a disaster.” \nClinton then reiterated that President Barack Obama, not her, made the decision to use force in Libya. \n“Congressman, I was the secretary of state,” she responded. \nIn the afternoon, a round of questioning included Roskam reading from emails Clinton and her staff exchanged about highlighting her work on the Benghazi policy, claiming the former secretary of state spend significant time trying to bolster her political image. \nRoskam and Clinton exchanged words about the role in Libya policymaking. “I don’t understand why that has anything to do with what we are talking about today,” Clinton said. \nEarlier in her testimony, Clinton alluded to accusations that the committee was politically motivated, saying that her appearance was to honor the four Americans lost in the September 11, 2012 attacks. \n“Despite all the previous investigations and talk about partisan agendas, I’m here to honor those we lost, and to do what I can to aid those who serve us still,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:04:20.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
