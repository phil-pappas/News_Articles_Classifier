The crab industry has been under heightened scrutiny due to the increased reporting of illegally caught seafood entering the U.S. market. The Presidential Taskforce, assigned to combat Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) fishing, has also identified the King Crab imports industry as a clear and present offender. While many companies are trying to distance themselves from the negative publicity, International Seafood Ventures is taking the issue on full steam ahead.\n\"We enlisted the help of Frequentz and their traceability solution to demonstrate without a doubt to our customers that our King Crab is legitimately caught,\" says Stuart Kozloff , International Seafood Ventures President. \"It is important for our customers to know we take a responsible approach to our seafood sourcing, and Frequentz's traceability solution provides that extra layer of assurance, not only for our King Crab, but our whole Asian, Arctic and Aqua Chef Line of products. In today's market we need to be responsive to our customers' requests and by enlisting Frequentz's assistance, we feel we can accomplish the important goal of confirming our sustainability claims to these strategic alliance customers.\"\nWith close to 90 percent of all seafood sold in the U.S. coming from imports, supply chain transparency is the only way to assure consumers that what they are being sold isn't a wild fish tale. Frequentz's technology also has applications beyond seafood, as consumer demands are driving supply chains to be more forthcoming across industries such as life sciences , agriculture and automotive. Consumers want to have enough information to make a responsible buying decision, whether that is based on sustainability of the species or some other driving factor. Frequentz assists these industries by offering comprehensive traceability, serialization and information management technologies that promote intelligent analytics and consumer safety. Their transformative tools bolster businesses and brand reputations by improving productivity, product quality, and profitability. Frequentz accomplishes this by providing valuable insight into end-to-end supply chains, and critical business processes by collecting, storing and analyzing serialized, life history data.
