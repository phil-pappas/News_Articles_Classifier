Image caption Bradwell nuclear plant stopped producing electricity in 2002 Caroline Baylon, a cyber security specialist at the Chatham House think tank, says Chinese investment is a \"good thing\" for the UK but \"when it comes to very sensitive sectors of the economy we have to be very, very careful\".\nSome argue that China would not attack its own nuclear plants, she tells BBC News, but it could obtain access to UK technologies that would give it an insight into any vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure systems.\nChina is \"well known for cyber-espionage\" and, in common with other advanced nations, is already seeking out such vulnerabilities to allow it to hide potentially malicious software that could be activated later, says Ms Baylon, who recently co-authored a report on cyber-security at civil nuclear facilities .\nThe trend in the global nuclear industry is towards the nationalisation of nuclear power, or at least the sourcing of components from \"friendly countries,\" to safeguard critical systems - but the UK takes a very \"permissive\" attitude to the issue that is potentially \"very dangerous,\" she warns.\nThere is a \"gentleman's agreement\" between nations not to attack infrastructure, but Ms Baylon adds that \"if the international situation changes, the UK may find itself in a tricky spot if this Chinese deal goes through. Today's alliances are not tomorrow's alliances.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/20151005CyberSecurityNuclearBaylonBruntLivingstoneExecSumUpdate.pdf", "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4587446.ece", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15B67/production/_86153988_b0a0b9e1-ac59-494c-86d4-0f0850a336f9.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/BF27/production/_86153984_b523e838-b52f-4bf2-8157-4f91c095982b.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:03:29.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
