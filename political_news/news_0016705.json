In the last fiscal year, the state allotted $3.7 million to Planned Parenthood, including Medicaid reimbursements. \n\nThe decision to bring the bill to Senate for a vote comes after two hearings of testimony, just one short of the standard three. \n\nCommittee Chair Sen. Bill Coley, R-Liberty Township, said more than 50 individuals had signed up to testify at today’s hearing but insisted a third hearing would only slow down the process of approving a bill he’s confident will pass. \n\n“I think there’s a broad consensus of support of the bill, I think it's close to two-thirds of all the senators are going to vote in favor of this bill,” said “We want to get it moving and get it enacted into law as quick as possible.” \n\nMany who testified against the bill cited the services Planned Parenthood provides other than abortion, including sexual health education, contraceptives and cancer screenings. \n\nThough many advocated for the often low-cost services Planned Parenthood provides in the state, Sen. Coley said he believes Planned Parenthood’s outreach lacks in some rural parts of Ohio. \n\n“The one thing you didn't see today was Planned Parenthood out there telling you that they have services close by to woman that need those kind of services in (rural) areas,” Coley said after the hearing. “The non-abortion services talked about today, they don't provide in rural Ohio. They’re not there. That's not where their locations are, so the important thing we’re focusing on today is making sure those services are more widely available to all Ohioans throughout the state.” \n\nKelly Novak, director of education and outreach for Planned Parenthood of greater Ohio, said that while Planned Parenthood centers are not in every county of the state, they oftentimes provide care for people in need. \n\n“Many of our patients have said that we’re their only provider, so we go out of our way to provide both health care and education to underserved individuals,” she said. “While there may be other healthcare providers in different communities, we have a business model that allows us to see people often on very short notice.” \n\n— Dina Berliner is a fellow in the E.W.
