And Democrats said the evidence suggests Mrs. Clinton was trying to navigate a tricky intelligence picture in the hours and days after the attack. \n“After seventeen months and millions of taxpayer dollars spent, the Select Committee on Benghazi has uncovered nothing that alters our core understanding of the facts as revealed by the other eight investigations,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat and a member of the panel. “When you consider the committee’s obsessive focus on attacking Secretary Clinton , the reason becomes quite clear: the majority has little interest in the events in Benghazi except to the degree they can be used to diminish her standing in the polls.” \nThe new Democratic report releases excerpts from some of the more than 50 interviews the committee has done so far, and in each of those snippets the witnesses deny some of the harsh accusations against the State Department and Mrs. Clinton , including that she told the military not to mount a rescue mission. \n“None of the 54 individuals interviewed by the Select Committee identified any evidence to support this Republican claim against Secretary Clinton ,” the Democrats concluded. \nMrs. Clinton is slated to testify in public on Thursday, and Democrats have tried to dent the committee’s credibility in the run-up to that, saying that the direction of the panel indicates it was meant to target her politically. \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy appeared to lend credence to those suspicions when he said that the investigation into Mrs. Clinton ’s email practices had hurt her poll numbers. Mr. McCarthy has since said he spoke badly, and committee Chairman Trey Gowdy has said he stands by his work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:13:34.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
