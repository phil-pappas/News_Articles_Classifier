The court took cognisance to charges against Patel in a sedition case for provoking a Patel youth to kill a policeman. \nJudical magistrate JK Chauhan was hearing a remand petition filed by the Surat Detection of Crime Branch (DCB) seeking seven-day remand of Patel. \nDuring the hearing, which took place late in the evening, prosecutor Nayan Sukhadvala submitted before judicial magistrate JK Christian said that the probe agency needed to interrogate Patel to find out whether anybody else was involved in “hatching the conspiracy to kill policemen”. \nPatel gave an inflammatory statement before TV cameras it in itself was akin to acting against the national interest, he said. DCB was going to conduct ‘voice spectrography test’ of Patel at FSL to validate the evidence of TV footage, he said. \nThe government slapped the charge of sedition to subdue Patels’ movement. The alleged statement was made against the police and not against the government or the country, said Yashvant Singhvada, Patel’s lawyer. \nHardik, 22, was produced before the court after he was interrogated by DCB officials at Hajira police station. He had on October 3 allegedly advised a Surat-based Vipul Desai to kill cops rather than killing himself. “If you have any courage…then go and kill a couple of cops. Patels never commit suicide,”Hardik had allegedly told Desai, who announced to commit suicide in support of the agitation. The police registered an FIR 16 days later. \nRajkot rural police took Patel into custody before third India -South Africa ODI as he threatened to disrupt it. On Monday, he was arrested for allegedly insulting the tricolour. After he was given bail, Surat police arrested him in a sedition case. \nMeanwhile, Hardik’s petition against the sedition charge would be heard by the Gujarat High Court on 21 October. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:50:23.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
