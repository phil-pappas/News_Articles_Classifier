Bunnings can confirm that it will not make wholesale changes to our teams’ roster patterns, however some changes may occur when required. Any and all changes will take place in full consultation with the team member, with at least 4 weeks advance notice given, so that any significant commitments, such as family responsibilities, can be raised and taken into account. Team members normally receive notice of their proposed rosters six weeks in advance. \nBunnings remains committed to providing an environment in which our team are appropriately rewarded for their efforts and feel valued as the best team delivering the best service. \nBunnings Team Members also enjoy a number of other benefits including: \nBirthday Leave - Long Service leave – Superannuation \nBunnings are committed to providing an employment package that supports and recognizes the value of our whole team. In addition to the above benefits that are specified in our Agreements, we continue to provide our Team Member Discount Program, Share Plan, Annual Bonus, flu shots and counselling services. \nBunnings is still actively involved in negotiations with First Union and will continue to strictly adhere to the process in good faith. \nENDS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:52:40.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
