That I deserve to suffer for weeks or months in tremendous amounts of physical and emotional pain? Why should anyone have the right to make that choice for me?\" Last November, Maynard took medication to end her own life , making what her website called \"a well thought out and informed choice to Die With Dignity in the face of such a terrible, painful and incurable illness.\" Her last few days might have been different had California had the same legislation that it has now (and that Oregon had last year.) Opponents: Bill will 'push people into cheaper lethal options' Others championed that cause after her death. There were many, though, that opposed the effort and urged Brown to veto the legislation. They included those tied to Californians Against Assisted Suicide, whose spokesman Tim Rosales said that many spoke against the effort, including \"progressive legislators representing low-income districts.\" On its website, Californians Against Assisted Suicide lists dozens of organization opposed to the bill Brown signed Monday. They include the American Academy of Medical Ethics, the American Medical Association, the California Catholic Conference, the Disability Rights Center and many others. \"We all know that 'choice' is a myth in the context of our unjust health care reality,\" the group said after the state Senate passed the bill last month . \"End-of-life treatment options are already limited for millions of people -- constrained by poverty, disability discrimination, and other obstacles. \"Adding this so-called 'choice' into our dysfunctional health care system will push people into cheaper lethal options.\" The reaction to Brown's decision Monday was far different on the website dedicated to Maynard's memory. Barbara Coombs Lee, the head of Compassion and Choices, noted that it means \"we are providing this option\" -- for the incurably ill to end their own lives -- \"to more than 1 in 10 Americans.\" The signing was cheered by Christy O'Donnell, a 47-year-old single mother from Santa Clarity with lung, brain, spine, rib and liver cancer who testified in support of the legislation. \"I'm overjoyed for all the terminally ill people in California, who can now relax knowing they finally have the choice of aid in dying as one of their end-of-life options!\" said O'Donnell. \"No more worrying that they will suffer great physical and emotional pain at the end of their life when they have already suffered painfully for so long as a result of their terminal illnesses.\" CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from US", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:17:46.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
