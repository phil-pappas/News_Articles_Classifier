'Our phones are ringing off the hook' Published: 8 mins ago \n(BREITBART) — Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT), a former Commander at Navy SEAL Team Six before his election to Congress last year, confirms he is openly considering a run for the Speakership of the U.S. House of Representatives. \n“Well, I’m looking at it,” Zinke said on Andrew Wilkow’s Wilkow Majority on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 on Tuesday afternoon. \nThe Speaker is about leadership and not policy and we’re at a point in our nation’s history where we’ve had a Speaker resign, we’ve had a presumptive Speaker resign and quite frankly we’re facing what I think is a leadership crisis. In our country’s history, there have been other freshmen Speakers—though it has been a long time. But it isn’t about policies. It’s about getting the Congress to do their duty: And that’s the defend the principles that made this country strong and defending the Constitution. I’ve taken an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. It’s time to rise and put our country first, and yourself second. It’s about leadership. We’re looking at it. Our phones are ringing off the hook because I think America wants something different. I haven’t decided, but what I have decided is that Congress better do our duty and defend our values of this country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:28:23.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
