The group is called Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, and Serpas is a co-chair.\nAfter declaring the group's belief that the country's prison population needs to be reduced, Serpas said, \"We believe we can do it and protect public safety at the same time.\"\nWe are used to law enforcement officers giving law and order speeches. We are used to them taking the lock-em-up approach, the throw-away-the-key approach. But this is something else. This, we can hope, is a turning point. If a large group of big-time law enforcement officers lift their voices in opposition to mass incarceration, who's left to defend this embarrassment.\nAnd make no mistake. It is an embarrassment. Not even the world's most repressive regimes lock up their people the way the United States locks up its people. We're number one! Even in incarceration. That's a reality that belies our claim that we're the land of the free.\nAmericans outside Louisiana can point to states where mass incarceration is more of a scandal. But Louisianians can't. We're the worst of the worst. Louisiana leads the world in incarceration. It's fitting, then, that a law enforcement official who spent so much of his career in Louisiana would be a leader of a group of law enforcement officials opposed to the overuse of prisons.\nAlso Wednesday USA Today published an op-ed co-written by Serpas and Garry McCarthy, Chicago's police chief, under the headline \" Cut incarceration and crime at the same time .\"\nIn that piece they make the unimpeachable statement that \"our criminal justice system has grown into a massive enterprise.\" They also make another argument that prison reform advocates have been making for quite a while: that, rather than rehabilitating people, our prisons have become training grounds that convert minor criminals into major ones.\nOr as Serpas and McCarthy put it, \"Prison often turns first-time offenders into repeat criminals and, thus, can actually harm public safety. Research suggests smart policing, treatment, alternatives to prison and educational programs are what work to bring down crime.\"\nPolice and prosecutors can take some steps toward a solution on their own, Serpas and McCarthy argue, but what they really need is the cooperation of lawmakers across the country. They say that the laws in this country tie up police officers' hands and force them to, say, pursue marijuana smokers. That's time they could be devoting to other things.\nReducing marijuana possession to a misdemeanor is one of the ways lawmakers could reduce the prison population, Serpas and McCarthy write. But consider what happened in Louisiana last legislative session. State Sen. J.P. Morrell put forward a bill that would make possession of a personal-size stash of marijuana a misdemeanor in all cases.\nBut law enforcement officials who have a different view of things than Serpas and McCarthy objected. And when the Louisiana Sheriffs' Association objects to something, Louisiana's lawmakers get all weak in the knees and capitulate. That's what happened this time. The sheriffs decided that repeat violations of our state's marijuana prohibition should continue to be treated as felonies punishable by prison time for violators.\nSerpas and McCarthy are right when they say that our criminal justice system \"has grown into a massive enterprise.\" What that means in practice is that other law enforcement officials who have a financial stake in keeping prisons full of minor offenders are going to use their political muscle to keep custody of those minor offenders. Because keeping prisoners is profitable.\nIn the 2012 series about Louisiana's world-leading incarceration status, we reported that the state was giving its sheriffs $24.39 per prisoner, per day and that some of those sheriffs were spending as little as $1.43 per day to feed each prisoner. Also, those skinflint sheriffs were declining to pay for rehabilitation programs that would help reduce recidivism.\nWhen our sheriffs look at prisoners and see dollar signs, when our sheriffs can snap their fingers and bring lawmakers to heel, then it should be no surprise that we have the problem we have.\nIt's good to see such a large group speak out against mass incarceration, but a much higher percentage of their brethren must be brought on board if we have any hope of change.\nJarvis DeBerry can be reached at jdeberry@nola.com .
