While that is tied up in court, he has basically commanded the DHS to stop arresting and deporting illegals. Now, with the upcoming campaign for president just months away, there is talk of new executive orders.\nFox reports :\nDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton on Monday proposed tighter gun-control measures, including expanded background checks, and suggested that if elected she would use executive powers to achieve her goals.\n“I want to push hard to get more sensible restraints,” Clinton said on NBC’s “Today” show. “I want to work with Congress, but I will look at ways as president.”\nIf she gets in, there is no doubt that she will not only try and push this through, but also might simply pull and have Obama and speak this law into existence. It is unclear what the legal ramifications would be, but it is sure that she will try. She is not only going after the buyer, she is also going after the manufacturer.\nFox continues:\nHer campaign says her proposals also include a repeal of legislation shielding gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers from most liability suits, even in the case of mass shootings like the one that killed nine students and teachers at an Oregon community college on Thursday.\nIf Clinton pushed this, then victims’ family could then sue the makers of the gun used. This for 2nd Amendment opponents this is welcome news. It would necessarily jack up the cost of buying a weapon. The company liability insurance would skyrocket. But there is a problem, this could open up other lanes of litigation that no one could expect.\nRead more at Freedom Outpost:\nhttp://freedomoutpost.com/2015/10/executive-order-on-stricter-gun-laws-soon-to-come/#BYLwyF88oc9pfswV.03", "external_links": ["http://thewashingtonstandard.com/enumerated-powers-of-congress/", "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/05/hillary-clinton-to-push-new-gun-control-proposals-executive-action-expanding/", "http://freedomoutpost.com/2015/10/executive-order-on-stricter-gun-laws-soon-to-come/#BYLwyF88oc9pfswV.03", "http://www.amazon.com/Hillary-Rodham-Clinton/e/B000APZ9VU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&qid=1444101342&sr=8-1&tag=freedomoutpos-20&linkId=PDN7KV6AJJ7BJYYR", "http://conservativepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/obama-gun-control-confiscation.jpg", "http://freedomoutpost.com/2014/11/obama-amnesty-illegals-im-going-break-law-congress-agrees-wont-breaking-law/"], "published": "2015-10-06T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:19:05.760+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
