Contractors accidentally severed the pipe on Thursday, causing a gas leak which led to the evacuation of the nearby Premier Inn and Ashbridge Inn. Avondale Road, Chapel Lane and Pontrhydyrun Road remain shut while work is carried out to repair the pipe. Wales & West Utilities said it could not say how long the work would take. A spokesperson said engineers had worked through the night and were working as quickly as possible to make the pipe safe. No gas supplies have been affected by the leak.
