Forces in Motion encourages students to explore physics through a unique and interactive program\nMORRIS PLAINS, N.J. , Oct. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Honeywell (NYSE: HON) and NASA will bring their award-winning, hip-hop physics education program, FMA Live! Forces in Motion, to more than 40 public, private and military-connected middle schools in the Midwest this fall. The widely popular show brings hip-hop music, dancers, larger-than-life demonstrations and audience participation to illustrate how physics plays a role in everyday life. FMA Live! has been performed before 415,000 students in more than 1,100 schools from all 48 contiguous U.S. states, as well as in Mexico and Canada , since its creation in 2004.\nThe fall tour is rolling into Missouri and Kansas this week, hosting several shows at local middle schools in Kansas City, Missouri (University of Missouri–Kansas City), Grandview, Missouri ( Grandview Middle School ), and Olathe, Kansas (Mission Trail Middle School).\n\"Today's students are tomorrow's engineers and scientists,\" said Mike Bennett , President, Honeywell Hometown Solutions, the company's corporate citizenship initiative. \"We know that science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) learning teaches students critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that are applicable to nearly every career field. Our goal is to expose students to programs such as FMA Live! Forces in Motion to pique their interest in pursuing STEM education and career paths.\"\nNewton's Universal Law of Gravity and Three Laws of Motion are key elements in the unique program. Named after Newton's Second Law of Motion [Force equals Mass times Acceleration], FMA Live! Forces in Motion captures the audience's attention with outside-the-box demonstrations. It aims to inspire future innovators to pursue careers in STEM.\n\"Every child should have a solid foundation in STEM, which can open doors they may not have known existed. Getting them excited is the first step – from there, the career possibilities are endless,\" said Donald James , NASA Associate Administrator for Education. \"This has been a great collaboration between NASA and Honeywell, and I'm proud of how many schools and students we've engaged through FMA Live!\"\nDuring the fall 2015 tour, FMA Live! will perform in 10 states: Minneapolis , Wisconsin , Indiana , Illinois , Iowa , Missouri , Kansas , Kentucky , Tennessee and North Carolina . The program also will travel to the west coast of the United States in spring 2016.\nSupporting Resources\nRead more about FMA Live! Forces in Motion Visit the FMA Live!
