More than 5,000 Venezuelans have attended Watchdog forums, and CEDICE has generated more than 2,500 press appearances, a remarkable feat in a country where the State controls 80 percent of the media.\nWhat : CEDICE's Watchdog for Freedom and Democracy project named one of six finalists for Atlas Network's prestigious $100,000 Templeton Freedom Award\nWhen : Nov. 12, 2015, 7:30 p.m.\nWhere : Liberty Forum & Freedom Dinner closing ceremony – Capitale, 130 Bowery, New York, NY 10013 (Bowery and Grand St.)\nPress Contact : Daniel.Anthony@AtlasNetwork.org or (202) 449-8441\nAwarded since 2004, the Templeton Freedom Award is named for the late investor and philanthropist Sir John Templeton.
