(AP) â€” After four dry days, rain is back in the forecast for South Carolina as the state tries to recover from devastating floods.\nForecasters expect no more than an inch of rain, which shouldn't make flooding worse. Last weekend, more than a foot of rain fell across a wide area of the state.\nAfter the weekend, forecasters predict several more dry days.\nThere is still flooding in South Carolina. All that water from Columbia continues to move toward the sea, although authorities says rivers are near their crests and don't expect the devastating damage that occurred when up to 20 inches of rain fell over South Carolina's capital over two days.\nIn Columbia, officials continued to be heartened by acts of generosity, but warned tempers were flaring in some places.\n___\nBeam reported from Summerville, South Carolina.
