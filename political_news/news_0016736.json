One week after reversing his pledge to pull American troops out of Afghanistan before he leaves office, Obama is turning to two political dimensions of the war. One is the Taliban’s use of Pakistani territory as sanctuary. The other is the set of obstacles to a negotiated Afghan peace deal. Obama is welcoming Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to the White House on Oct. 22 for talks also are expected to touch on the future of U.S. financial assistance to Islamabad and prospects for Pakistani acceptance of limits on the scope of its nuclear weapons arsenal.
