Meals consist of traditional, seasonal ingredients and include turkey, green beans, stuffing, corn, and cranberry sauce. The Greater Boston Food Bank also offers alternative options including chicken, fish, and tofu for those with dietary restrictions.\n\"One in nine eastern Massachusetts residents doesn't know where his or her next meal will come from, and is often forced to choose between food and other necessities, like rent or mortgage payments,\" said Catherine D'Amato , president and CEO of The Greater Boston Food Bank. \"Our Holiday Meal Drive channels the spirit of giving and aims to provide these individuals and families with a healthy and delicious holiday meal so they have one less tough decision to make.\"\nThe Greater Boson Food Bank initiated the Holiday Meal Drive in 2010 to supply individuals and families in 190 eastern Massachusetts cities and towns with nutritious holiday meals.\nAbout The Greater Boston Food Bank\nThe Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB) is the largest hunger-relief organization in New England and among the largest food banks in the country.
