(AP) â€” Under one of the biggest land development plans ever proposed in Florida, a tract more than six times the size of Manhattan could be transformed from a home for cows and alligators into new housing developments for half a million people.\nOver the next six decades, the plan being developed by the Mormon church-owned Deseret Ranch promises to convert the largest undeveloped section of metro Orlando into more than a dozen bustling neighborhoods. In the process, it would radically reshape Osceola County, a suburb that has been transitioning from cowboy culture into a major destination for Puerto Ricans moving to the mainland.\nOpponents say the plan to convert cattle pastures to cul-de-sacs could destroy tens of thousands of acres of important habitat near the headwaters of the St. Johns River flowing north and the Kissimmee River flowing south. They also worry that Osceola County has been doing the bidding of Deseret Ranch, one of the nation's largest ranches. County commissioners approved the ranch's plan unanimously in September and now it awaits a state review.\n\"There are no checks and balances happening,\" said Karina Veaudry, a landscape architect, who is with the Florida Native Plants Society. \"The county has been bending over backward pretty much to do whatever they say.\"\nBut other environmentalists who once opposed Deseret's proposal have dropped their objections, saying the plan shifts population growth to east of the county's urban core, rather than to its south where development might pose a greater threat to the headwaters of the Everglades. They also say it's better to have a comprehensive plan rather than breaking off 1,000-acre tracts at a time for piecemeal development. Osceola County currently is about three-quarters rural.\n\"The future of that property is better with this plan, than the plan not being there,\" said Charles Lee, director of advocacy for Audubon Florida. \"Doing it on a large scale gives you a lot of possibilities for preservation.\"\nThe plan looks ahead six decades for property that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began purchasing more than six decades ago. The church began acquiring ranchlands in 1950 to have resources for food production in times of need. The ranch now has 42,000 cattle and more than 80 workers, and straddles three counties in an area nestled between two of central Florida's iconic institutions: Walt Disney World to its west and the Kennedy Space Center to its northeast.\n\"This is the way we're going to grow for the next 60 years, maybe 100 years,\" said Commissioner Fred Hawkins before the vote.\nDeseret Ranch general manager Erik Jacobsen called the development plan a way to meet growth pressures smartly in what's expected to be one of the nation's fastest growing regions in the coming decades. He said it will be bicycle- and-pedestrian-friendly and an economic boon, connecting Orlando's medical research hub south of the airport with tech companies along the Space Coast. The county, one of the nation's fastest-growing, currently has a population of 310,000, expanding by 15 percent since 2010.\n\"It provides a very important framework for the future,\" Jacobsen told commissioner before the vote.\nThe first shovel of dirt won't be turned for another two decades and the 133,000 acres of pastures, citrus groves, and woodlands slotted for development make up less than half of the ranch's nearly 300,000 acres.\nDeseret would likely rely on outside developers. By 2080, the former ranch land could accommodate up to half a million residents, which would make it Florida's 10th largest metropolitan area in today's population. In a best-case scenario, the plan could lead to a quarter million jobs and have an economic impact worth hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more, said Jeff Jones, the county's economic development chief.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:05:01.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
