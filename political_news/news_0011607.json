(Picture Courtesy: YouTube) YouTube comedian Roman Atwood seems to have crossed a line this time by playing a shocking trick on his girlfriend, Brittney Smith, even though the video of the stunt has managed to gather more than 2.5 million views on YouTube in just 24 hours.\nIn the video, Atwood manages to pull off the elaborate prank with the help of his young son. He is seen telling his girlfriend that he and their son had been test-driving a quad bike and were thinking of buying it. He then asks her to get their checkbook from their car so that they can purchase it. As soon as she turns her back and starts walking towards the car, Atwood tell their son, Kane, to run and hide while he swaps the boy for the dummy. This dummy is wearing the same helmet and clothes like Kane.\nThe quad-bike suddenly revs up, being secretly remote-controlled by Atwood, even as Brittany runs behind the vehicle thinking itâ€™s their son. She gives out a terrifying scream as the bike flies over a jump and explodes in a 30ft fireball.
