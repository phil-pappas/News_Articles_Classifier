Injuries and ineffectiveness have plagued several top-10 quarterbacks entering the season, but some pleasant surprises have emerged. The question is whether they can be trusted for the long haul.\nAndy Dalton, Bengals\nOwners have been burned by Dalton before. In 2013, he finished the first half of the season with a three-game run he never had had before, totaling 1,034 yards and 11 touchdown passes. But that amounted to almost a quarter of his passing yardage and a third of his touchdowns for the year.\nThis season is different. He has the most points of any player in a basic-scoring system (112), thanks to his 1,518 yards, second-most in the league. He has thrown only two interceptions after entering the season with an average of 16.5 per year. And after enduring years of criticism about his deep ball, he’s averaging a career-high 9.5 yards per pass, also second-best. His previous high was 7.3.\nThe Bengals’ schedule is hit or miss. He still has two games against the Browns, who have allowed 10 touchdown passes with one interception. The Cardinals, Rams and Broncos (championship week) are formidable, but so are the Seahawks, and Dalton beat them. Start him with confidence.\nJosh McCown, Browns\nIn the last three weeks, McCown has averaged 385 yards with two touchdown passes in each game. He had the most points of anyone in Week 5 with 35, thanks to a 457-yard performance.\nBut a big reason for that has been the Browns’ reliance on the pass. In those three games, McCown threw 141 times, and the team had only 60 carries. The Browns have taken what the defense has given them, but you have to expect running backs Isaiah Crowell and Duke Johnson to see more action.\nPlus, the schedule gets tougher. In the next three games, McCown will face teams ranked in the top five in fewest points allowed to QBs . Either sell him high or stash him as a potential bye-week fill in.\nBlake Bortles, Jaguars\nFinally, with his top playmakers available, Bortles had his best game of the season last week, throwing for 303 yards and four touchdowns, good for 28 points. In fact, he’s seventh in QB scoring.\nGranted, his big day came against the Buccaneers, who have allowed the seventh-most points to quarterbacks. But Bortles’ interceptions are down, and his supporting cast is improved. Consider him a bye-week fill-in in regular leagues and a starter in two-QB leagues.\nTyrod Taylor, Bills\nRex Ryan’s surprise choice to start is tied for fourth in scoring among quarterbacks. He hasn’t thrown for 300 yards, but he has two games with three TD passes and he ranks fourth in rushing yards among quarterbacks. He reportedly will miss time with a sprained knee suffered Sunday, but he has shown enough to be in your lineup when he returns.\nFollow me on Twitter @JeffreyA22.\nEmail: jagrest@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:17:40.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
