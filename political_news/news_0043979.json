More personalised learning requires a change in approach. \n\"Concerns raised today by teachers and school leaders about modern learning environments need to be taken seriously. They're rightly pointing out that the quality of teaching will always be a far bigger contributor to student success than the building it happens in. \n\"Schools also need more flexibility to determine what kind of learning spaces will work best for their student community. I agree that the Ministry of Education can be too inflexible when signing-off school building plans. \n\"Recruiting, training and supporting the best teachers will be Labour's top priority in education. We will raise the bar for new teachers entering the profession, revamp teacher training, and provide much more professional development and support to teachers throughout their careers. \n\"Old schools do need to be rebuilt and modernised. But to get the best return from that investment, it needs to be matched with investment in the people that work in them,\" Chris Hipkins says. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:32:58.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
