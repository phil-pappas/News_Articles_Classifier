For instance, Morales's mom found her son standing in the kitchen wearing cleaning gloves — and he later asked for a blanket that he began shoving into a plastic storage tote.\nMorales later said that Donnie was playing outside on his own — something he wasn't allowed to do. A subsequent search failed to locate the boy, prompting Segura to call 911.\nBefore police arrived, Morales rode away on his bicycle, allegedly to look for Donnie.\nShortly thereafter, the boy's body was found under the blanket in the tote. He had a cord around his neck and blood was seen around his neck and mouth.\nTiffany Segura during an interview after the death of Donnie Jr. Fox31 file photo After Morales was located and taken into custody, the report continues, he was questioned by authorities but was evasive until he was allowed to see his mother.
