Remember, there is no runoff in the mayor's race. The top vote recipient at the end of the night is the mayor, regardless of whether that person receives 50 percent of the vote.\nA federal court struck down the runoff provision in citywide Memphis elections in the summer of 1991. Since then, three elections have been won by candidates with less than 50 percent of the vote, all by Willie Herenton — in 1991, 1999 and 2007.\nWith four relatively strong candidates, the likelihood that tonight's result becomes the fourth such occurrence is strong.\nYou'll still hear the word \"runoff,\" though — it'll just be in single-member City Council districts, where they remain in place (and will be held Nov. 19). Super districts and the city court clerk's race will not go to a runoff.\n2. Turnout matters — and could be the difference-maker. The quiet reality of the past few weeks is that candidates up and down the ballot have been working on ways to make sure their voters make it to the polls — either old-fashioned ways or sophisticated ones, too. In a tight mayor's race, it could be all the difference.\nIt doesn't look like weather will make much of a difference — memphisweather.net predicts a high of 88 degrees and no chance of rain.\nJudging by early voting numbers, total turnout is expected to be between 110,000 and 120,000. That's a welcome increase over the most recent mayoral election, where turnout dipped well under 100,000. But it's noticeably lower from even 2007, when 165,397 voters cast ballots in the mayor's race.\nAnd it's alarmingly low compared to that Herenton-Dick Hackett race in 1991, when the individual totals for each candidate were in the 122,000-range.\n3. How much will race matter by night's end? In a city where race is always top of mind, it's particularly present here: Strickland could end the night as the city's first white mayor since Hackett's 1991 loss.\nShould that happen, how he arrives there will make a major difference in how he governs. If Strickland is, as his campaign has long pushed for, able to get a decent slice of the pie of African-American votes, it could lend credence to him — kind of like county mayor Mark Luttrell, district attorney Amy Weirich or U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, all white politicians who benefit from racial crossover.\nBut it isn't just a Strickland question.\nCould Wharton, for instance, who has in the past benefited from winnable chunks of both racial electorates, get a balance of both? If so, he could take up a mantle of unifying the city with a cross-racial cross-section.\nThe election in the final days has all seemed to be about courting undecided blacks, and that could matter not only to the result Thursday night but the narrative Friday morning, too.\n4. Don't sleep on the City Council races. With the departure of six incumbents from that 13-member body, its makeup will unquestionably change. Whether that shows up in its policy directions is another matter.\nTake the city employee benefit cuts and the city's larger fiscal health, for instance. If names like Philip Spinosa, Frank Colvett Jr. and Berlin Boyd are victorious by night's end, don't look for that trajectory to change.\nIf names like Kenneth T. Whalum Jr., Rachel Knox and Keith Williams are among the victors, though, perhaps a change on that front could be in order.\nOf the seven single-member districts, look for as many as four races to head to a runoff.\nFollow more politics and policy coverage from the InforMemphis team on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/informemphis", "http://media.jrn.com/images/ELECTION+guide+2015+copy.jpg", "http://www.twitter.com/informemphis"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:40:56.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
