This would replace Wales' seven local health boards.\nCredit: Plaid Cymru Addressing leaders in the sector in a keynote address in Cardiff Bay later today, Elin Jones will say that the changes will end the funding turf war between health and social care, getting rid of the administrative boundaries that prove infuriating for staff, and reducing unnecessary delays for patients.\nSpeaking ahead of her speech, Plaid Cymru Shadow Health Minister Elin Jones said:\nPlaid Cymru is today proposing the biggest change to the way care is delivered since the advent of the NHS in 1948. This is a once in a generation change, but it will deliver huge improvements to the way health and social services are delivered.\n– Plaid Cymru Shadow Health Minister Elin Jones However a spokesperson for the Welsh Government's Health Minister Mark Drakeford told ITV Cymru Wales that Plaid Cymru was planning to break-up the NHS which would lead to years of chaotic and costly reorganisation.\nPlaid’s plan means that decisions about hospital services will no longer be made in local communities by local people accountable to the local population; instead decisions about Bronglais Hospital, for example, would be made by the single national board based in Cardiff.\nDecisions about hospitals in North Wales would be made by the single national board in Cardiff. When Plaid was last in government it worked with Labour to end the old split between hospital trusts and local health boards, which wasn’t working for people in Wales, to create integrated health boards responsible for planning and providing all healthcare services.\nBut now Plaid is intent on taking Wales back to the failed past by proposing a disruptive and disastrous reorganisation which will see the end of the NHS as we know it.\n– Welsh Government spokesperson Last updated Thu 8 Oct 2015 Read more 3 updates Abolish charges for elderly care says Plaid Cymru Health Wales Plaid Cymru", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:33:50.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
