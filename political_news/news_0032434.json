Like the other firms swept up in the SEC’s MCDC mania, they neither confirmed nor denied any wrongdoing. But both self-reported — as encouraged by the SEC — that in the past five years they might have served as underwriter for some municipal bond issues in which the continuing obligation to make disclosures to bondholders was not fulfilled to a T. \nThe MCDC initiative doesn’t end with the financial penalties, which have totaled more than $13 million with more to come. Every company has had to engage an “independent consultant” to review policies and procedures for compliance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:48:27.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
