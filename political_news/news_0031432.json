Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican running for House speaker, said Monday he would attempt to give more power to rank-and-file House members if they pick him to be their new leader. \"The American people are saying they're not comfortable with the way the House runs. That's why our numbers are around 11-12% in approval,\" Webster, who's considered a longshot to get the job, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" Webster cited his experience as speaker of the Florida state House of Representatives as evidence of his ability to delegate power. He said Monday he would \"push down that pyramid of power\" that exists now in the U.S. House. Webster declined to hit the clear front-runner for the job, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, for his comment last week that the special Benghazi House panel had succeeded in bringing down Hillary Clinton's poll numbers. But Webster did say he wouldn't have made that comment himself. Webster is running against McCarthy and House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, to lead the House. <div id=\"ad_rect_atf_01\" class=\"ad-ad_rect_atf_01 ad-refresh-adtop\"></div> More from Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:06:20.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
