Jerry Brown signed Saturday requires California drivers who are eligible to vote to be signed up automatically when they get a new license -- a dramatic expansion of voting rights that could grow the state's voter rolls by millions of people. \nWhen Assembly Bill1461 takes effect in January, California will become the second state in the nation to adopt an automatic voter registration system at a time when many states are restricting their citizens' right to vote. Oregon enacted a similar law earlier this year. \nSecretary of State Alex Padilla first promised to expand access to the polls last year as a candidate on the campaign trail. \nHe sponsored the legislation and applauded Brown for taking swift action to help the 6.6 million Californians who are eligible but not yet registered to vote, noting that citizens need not \"opt-in\" to other fundamental rights such as free speech or due process. \n\"In a free society, the right to vote is fundamental,\" Padilla said. \"The New Motor Voter Act will make our democracy stronger by removing a key barrier to voting for millions of California citizens.\" \nUnder the legislation, which was authored by San Diego Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, a Democrat, Californians who are legal residents and who visit the DMV to apply for, renew or change the address on a driver license would be registered to vote by the Secretary of State's Office. Advertisement \nVoters would still retain the right to cancel their registration or change their party affiliation at any time. The new law also would continue to protect those covered by existing confidentiality policies, such as victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. \nRepublican lawmakers voted against the measure, but its only other opponent was the American Civil Liberties Union. Since California's DMV now issues driver's licenses to immigrants who are living in the country illegally, the group fears those drivers will be registered to vote mistakenly, risking their ability to stay in the country. State and federal laws strictly forbid illegal immigrants from voting. \nAB1461 was one of dozens of bills Brown acted on Saturday as Sunday's deadline to take action on legislation approaches. \nOther bills the governor signed into law include Senate Bill21, authored by Sen. Jerry Hill, D-San Mateo, which requires nonprofits that pay for lawmakers' travel to disclose their donors. Contact Jessica Calefati at 916-441-2101.
