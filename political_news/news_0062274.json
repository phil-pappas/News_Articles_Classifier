In the case relating to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) allocating additional spectrum that had allegedly led to a loss of Rs. 846.44 crore to the exchequer, a former Telecom Secretary,Shyamal Ghosh, and three telecom firms – Hutchison Max (P) Ltd, Sterling Cellular Ltd and Bharti Cellular Ltd – were charge-sheeted by the CBI . “I find that there is no incriminating evidence against the accused and the accused deserve to be discharged,” the court ordered. Special CBI Judge OP Saini observed that the CBI tried to mislead the court and the chargesheet filed by it was full of “distorted facts”. \nCBI Director was also told to conduct an inquiry against the “erring officials” for filing such a chargesheet in the case. “I am reading out the last paragraph of the order. It’s a false and fabricated chargesheet and there is no incriminating evidence against any of the accused so they are discharged. The chargesheet is full of distorted facts and an attempt has been made to mislead the court,” the judge said. On August 31, the court had reserved its order after hearing arguments on framing of charges against the accused. Shyamal Ghosh, a 1965-batch retired IAS officer, was the Telecom Secretary between February 7, 2000 and May 31, 2002. The investigating agency had earlier argued that Mr Ghosh had given additional spectrum to the telecom companies at “throwaway prices” causing a huge loss to the exchequer. */", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:36:07.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
