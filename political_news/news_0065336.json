According to Reeves, there are three key areas that lead to long term job growth in our state. First is a fiscally responsible government that limits spending. Second is a tax code that is simple, fair and encourages economic development. Third is improving public education state-wide, starting with our preschoolers. “When you talk about workforce development, it really starts at pre-kindergarten. It really starts with ensuring that we get more kids to graduate from high school and also ensures that more of our kids who graduate from high school go to one of our community colleges to either learn a skill or to get better prepared to go to one of our four year institutions. If we’re going to continue to improve our workforce, we need more college graduates,” said Reeves. WXXV Posted October 15, 2015 - 7:13 am YallPolitics.Com now uses Facebook for comments.
