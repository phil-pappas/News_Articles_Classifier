Animals can take from 12 to 48 hours to die and there is no antidote. \n\"While the poison is active, New Zealanders are at risk from affected water and food supplies. \n\"The SPCA wants to see an end to this stuff and so does New Zealand First,\" says Mr Prosser. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:17:32.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
