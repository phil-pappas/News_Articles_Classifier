The research confirms two things we knew in our hearts to be true: Everybody we date kind of looks the same, and somewhere, our junior-high boyfriend is probably still obsessing over us.\nTo round out the episode, we applaud a recent spate of super-hot interracial lesbian sex on network TV and discuss why you should join hosts Allison P. Davis, Maureen O’Connor, and David Wallace-Wells as they dim the lights, pour some wine, and check out last week's episodes of Empire and How to Get Away With Murder .
