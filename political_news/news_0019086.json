That damn Terry Branstad is a real piece of work too. He is a follower of the Scott Walker anti-labor brigade. They love all their attention when it is caucus time.

Religion is right in the middle of every idiot who votes against themselves. Yep, god bless their hearts. Meanwhile, big corporations are eating away at all the family farmland and turning it into huge corporate farms dotted with disgusting factory feed lots (so many turkeys, pigs and birds) which also helps to eliminate small farmers with animals. They read their Good Books while Terry Braindead works to strip away labor protections, and big companies come from out of state to take contracts (taxpayer money) to build stuff people don't need. Braindead says it is going to help increase jobs and the economy, but those out of state businesses truck in their own immigrant labor, so no new jobs and none of the money (taxpayer money) stays in the state. Now I hear that governor is also shutting down mental health facilities and people are being tossed out. What a bunch of crap. Midwestern values, I guess. Sorry, I really do love Midwestern people, and many of them are so nice, but these Iowa Republicans are not a bright bunch. It seems they are more out to gut their pretty little state and sell off all the rich farmland, animals and people to the highest bidder.

Corporate warehousing of the mentally ill is in store. let's not forget the fracking being done. And it's been corporate farming for quite some time. And the undocumented workers in the meat packing plants were presented as being \"new Yorkers\" which the born again evangelicals accepted. Privatizing is the number one priority in Iowa. Each teabagging governor has his own agenda. Each Koch Brothers check brings new destruction of our constitution and our country. Brandstad it union busting. http://www.desmoinesregister.com/sto...ures/30082843/ Quote: he state’s largest public employees union and 20 Democratic legislators are suing Gov. Terry Branstad over his closure of two state mental hospitals. The American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees said Monday that it filed suit in Polk County District Court against Branstad and Department of Human Services Director Charles Palmer. The suit seeks to force Branstad to reopen the state mental hospitals at Mount Pleasant and Clarinda, which the administration closed last month. The suit cites a section of Iowa Code spelling out that the state shall have mental hospitals at those two locations and at Cherokee and Independence.“Iowa law clearly states that the state of Iowa shall operate Mental Health Institutes in Mt. Pleasant and Clarinda,” state AFSCME President Danny Homan said in a news release. “This was the law when the governor announced his decision to close these facilities. This was the law when the Legislature passed, with bipartisan support, the funding to keep these facilities open. This was the law when he closed these two facilities. It is still the law today. No one is above the law. That includes the governor. We are filing this lawsuit to hold him accountable for breaking the law.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:49:16.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
