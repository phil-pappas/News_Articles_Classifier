Gov. Scott Walker has asked the Legislature for $200 million more in borrowing to keep that project and others on track. By Jason Stein of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 20, 2015 10:28 a.m. (2) Comments \nMadison — Gov. Scott Walker's administration asked lawmakers to approve $200 million in borrowing this year to help limit delays in completing major highway projects in the state. \nThe Republican governor's administration announced recently it was delaying five major projects along with dozens of other smaller-scale jobs because of funding cuts that Walker and GOP lawmakers made this summer. \nIn the letter sent to the Legislature's budget committee, Transportation Secretary Mark Gottlieb said that spending the money now could help prevent further declines in the condition of state highways. \n\"An investment in infrastructure now will prevent more costly repairs later,\" Gottlieb wrote in a letter to the Joint Finance Committee \nWalker has said the five major projects could be on schedule if lawmakers release additional borrowing that was set aside in the budget signed in July. But Gottlieb's letter suggesting that at this point releasing the $200 million this year and an additional $150 million next year might only limit the delay on the projects to one year rather than two. \nThe governor is expected to address the issue Tuesday during a stop at a construction site in Neenah. \nThe payments on the loans would come out of a fund that normally pays for programs such as schools and health care rather than out of the state's road fund as they normally would. \nRep. John Nygren (R-Marinette), co-chairman of Joint Finance, has said the long list of delays shows the need for his committee to issue more bonds for roads. The major Zoo Interchange in the Milwaukee area is mostly staying on track, while projects elsewhere in the state are being put off — and that's not fair, he said. \nBut Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), who sits on the Joint Finance Committee, has said more borrowing is not the solution. \nMarklein has said he could back an increase in the gas tax, but acknowledged that's politically difficult. Highlighting that point, Walker has repeatedly ruled out raising the gas tax increase unless taxes in other areas were cut — a position he staked out in his re-election bid last year. \nThe five major projects that are being delayed are I-39/90 from the Illinois state line to Madison; Highway 151/Verona Road in Madison; Highway 10/441 in the Fox Valley; Highway 23 between Fond du Lac and Plymouth; and Highway 15 near New London in Outagamie County. \nThe additional projects being put off cover everything from simple resurfacing jobs to top-to-bottom reconstructions. They include bridge rehabilitation work on I-43 in Milwaukee County and the resurfacing of a segment of Highway 18 in Waukesha County. \nWork has not yet begun on many of the projects and on others work is underway. Without the state borrowing additional money, road crews will either delay starting or completing the projects for an additional period of time of up to two years. \nLast spring, Walker sought to borrow a record $1.3 billion over two years for transportation to avoid raising gas taxes, but his fellow Republicans reduced that to borrowing $500 million initially as part of the state budget approved in July. Lawmakers gave the administration the ability to ask over two years for an extra $350 million in borrowing, which would be released with Joint Finance approval. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
