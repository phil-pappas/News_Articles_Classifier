Barbour Jr., granted the request by inmates at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility in Meridian on Tuesday in their lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections .\nJudge Barbour wrote in his opinion that there was sufficient evidence that the prison had failed to appropriately address complaints that inmates were being denied “adequate food, shelter, medical and mental health care, and safety.”\nFurther, the judge wrote that evidence, including inmate statements, showed that prisoners had been subjected to “unreasonable harm from other inmates and from prison staff who routinely use excessive force.”\nAs part of the evidence reviewed by Judge Barbour, a captain at the prison said in a deposition that prisoner-on-prisoner violence was commonplace, that corrections officers were poorly trained, and that guards facilitated inmate violence by opening cell doors and then failed to intervene when prisoners were assaulted.\nBut Judge Barbour wrote that for the inmates to prevail in the lawsuit, they must prove that prison officials were aware of the potential for harm that the conditions in the facility created and did not take reasonable measures to abate them.\nThe company that operates the prison, the Management & Training Corporation , based in Utah, also runs another Mississippi prison, the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, which is under federal court oversight for conditions including severe and systematic violence against inmates.\nIssa Arnita, a company spokesman, referred questions to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. A spokeswoman for the department, Grace Simmons Fisher, said, “We are prepared to defend the case as one lawsuit on its merits in court.”\nThe inmates are being represented by several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nMargaret Winter, associate director of the A.C.L.U.’s National Prison Project , said Thursday that substandard conditions at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility had existed for years.\n“We hope that the state will reconsider the wisdom of counting on a profit-motivated industry to run the prisons humanely and safely,” she said.\nAt the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, about 70 percent of the 1,200 inmates have some form of mental illness, advocates say. Inmates there say that they are punished for seeking medical care, that toilets often do not work and frequently overflow, and that some inmates live in near-total darkness because light bulbs are not replaced.\nTo attract the attention of corrections officers, prisoners who live in solitary confinement units set fires that the guards sometimes allow to burn out. The inmates use contraband matches or loose wires to set the blazes.\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
