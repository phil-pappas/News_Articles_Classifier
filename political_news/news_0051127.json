SIRC is on record noting that reviews of foreign operations are particularly resource intensive.\"\nThe new Liberal government has indicated it will revamp \"problematic elements\" of C-51, for instance by ensuring all CSIS warrants respect the charter. It also plans to create a security-cleared committee of parliamentarians who could see any relevant information held by federal agencies.\nA parliamentary committee, \"while not insignificant,\" can't do all the work, said Paterson. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has joined Canadian Journalists for Free Expression in a court challenge of C-51's constitutionality.\nExisting intelligence watchdogs \"need to be strengthened and made able to deal with inter-agency activities,\" Paterson said.\nForcese agrees, saying he hopes \"the Liberal government understands this, and won't confine its accountability reform to simply creating a special security parliamentary committee.\"\nRelated Stories Ten things to expect from the Liberal rewrite of Bill C-51 Canadian spies might blow our efforts abroad if caught by authorities: RCMP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:38:22.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
