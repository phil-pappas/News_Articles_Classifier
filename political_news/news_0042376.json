The agency is hosting the workshop to collect proposals for locations on Mars that would be of high scientific research value while also providing natural resources to enable human explorers to land, live and work safely on the Red Planet.\nThe first human explorers on the journey to Mars are expected to be quite mobile, with the ability to explore long distances from their habitat, a region being called an \"Exploration Zone.\" In current planning activities, NASA assumes an Exploration Zone radius of approximately 60 miles (100 km).\nNASA plans to use existing assets at Mars, such as the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) and the Odyssey spacecraft, to support the selection process of potential Exploration Zones. However, the life expectancy of MRO and Odyssey are limited. NASA is eager to take advantage of the remaining operational years of those Martian imagers to gather high resolution maps of potential Exploration Zones while the spacecraft remain operational.\nStarting at 2 p.m. EDT ( 1 p.m. CDT ) Tuesday, Oct. 27 , the workshop will be webcast live via UStream at:\nhttp://www.ustream.tv/channel/YMjupNHukn7\nBecause of limited capacity, in person attendance is limited to registered workshop participants. Reporters interested in attending the workshop in person must contact David Steitz at david.steitz@nasa.gov before 4 p.m. Friday, Oct. 23 .\nFor more information on NASA's journey to Mars, visit:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/journeytomars\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nasas-first-human-landing-sitesexploration-zones-on-mars-workshop-oct-27-30-in-houston-300162838.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.lpi.usra.edu/", "http://www.ustream.tv/channel/YMjupNHukn7", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nasas-first-human-landing-sitesexploration-zones-on-mars-workshop-oct-27-30-in-houston-300162838.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DC33132&Transmission_Id=201510200934PR_NEWS_USPR_____DC33132&DateId=20151020", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20081007/38461LOGO", "http://www.nasa.gov/journeytomars", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081007/38461LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:18:47.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
