Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will make a surprise visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories on Tuesday, in a high-profile gambit to bring an end to the monthlong wave of violence that has plagued the region.\nThe visit comes amid unrest that erupted in Jerusalem a month ago over tensions surrounding a Jerusalem holy site sacred to Jews and Muslims. It soon spread to Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem and then to the West Bank, Gaza and Israel. The spate of daily attacks have caused panic across Israel and raised fears that the region is on the cusp of a new round of heavy violence.\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Malki told Palestinian radio that Ban, who is currently in Europe, will arrive later Tuesday and meet with both sides. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin's office confirmed that the president will meet with Ban.\nAdditional details of the visit were not immediately available, but reports said the country's new ambassador the United Nations, Danny Danon, was on his way home to prepare for a meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nPrior to the visit, Ban issued a video message late Monday calling for calm on both sides.\nHe said he understood the Palestinian frustration but that violence would only harm their legitimate aspirations.\n\"I know your hopes for peace have been dashed countless times. You are angry at the continued occupation and expansion of settlements,\" he said. \"I am not asking you to be passive, but you must put down the weapons of despair.\"\nAddressing Israelis, he said he understood their concerns and fears due to the security deterioration, but added there was no military solution to the situation.\n\"When children are afraid to go to school, when anyone on the street is a potential victim, security is rightly your immediate priority,\" he said. \"But walls, checkpoints, harsh responses by the security forces and house demolitions cannot sustain the peace and safety that you need and must have.\"\nOver the past month, nine Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, most of them stabbings. In that time, 41 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, including 20 labeled by Israel as attackers, and the rest in clashes with Israeli troops. An Eritrean migrant died after being shot and beaten by a mob that mistakenly believed he was a Palestinian attacker.\nThe outbreak was fueled by rumors that Israel was plotting to take over Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, a hilltop compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine and a key national symbol for the Palestinians. Israel has adamantly denied the allegations, saying it has no plans to change the status quo at the site, where Jews are allowed to visit but not pray. It accuses the Palestinians of inciting to violence through the false claims.\nIsrael has struggled to contain attacks by Palestinian assailants. Authorities have blocked roads and placed checkpoints at the entrances of Palestinian neighborhoods in east Jerusalem. Other security measures include ID checks and requiring some Palestinian residents to lift their shirts and roll up pant legs as they exit their neighborhoods to prove they are not carrying knives. Soldiers have been deployed in Jerusalem and cities across Israel.\nPalestinians say the violence stems from anger over the Jerusalem holy site and nearly 50 years of occupation, as well as a lack of hope.\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli military arrested top Hamas official Hassan Yousef in the West Bank, saying he had been \"actively instigating and inciting terrorism\" by encouraging attacks against Israelis.\n\"Hamas' leaders cannot expect to propagate violence and terror from the comfort of their living rooms and pulpits of their mosques,\" said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:14:59.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
