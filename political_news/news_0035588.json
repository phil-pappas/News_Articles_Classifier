The PYD and its fighting unit, the YPG, however, are not. \nNevertheless, Ankara still regards the PYD and the YPG as terrorists, directly supporting Kurdish fighters in Turkey who have been fighting against government forces. \nWelcoming Russian intervention \nA Kurdish official who spoke to G2 Bulletin said that if the open conflict between the government of Turkey and its 20 million Kurds continues much longer, a civil war could result. \n“The Kurds welcome whatever assistance they can get,” said the Kurdish official, who asked not to be identified for security reasons. \nAt the same time, he said, the U.S. just dropped 120 tons of weapons to the YPG. \nThe Syrian Kurds are “happy with the shift of policy toward helping the YPG,” the Kurdish official said. \nHis comment was in reference to the Turks’ stipulation that the U.S. not help the Syrian Kurds directly, especially from Turkey’s Incirlik Airbase. The U.S. previously was providing some airstrike support. \nRussian assistance, however, appears to be more significant. \nSalih Muslim, leader of the PYD, told the Turkish newspaper Amberin Zaman that his group welcomes Russian intervention in Syria. \n“We will fight alongside whoever fights Daesh (ISIS),” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:20:54.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
