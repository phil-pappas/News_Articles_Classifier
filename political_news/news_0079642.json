It's the sixth baby born to Puget Sound's three orca pods since last December, boosting their numbers to 82.\nMichael Harris , the executive director of the Pacific Whale Watch Association , says the whale watch community is referring to the baby boom as the \"class of 2015.\"\nThere could be more babies on the way.
