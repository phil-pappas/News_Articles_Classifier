He referred specifically to two chapters, or policy areas in accession negotiations, pertaining to judiciary and fundamental rights, and justice, freedom and security. Greek Cyprus, internationally recognized as the Republic of Cyprus with its territory covering the whole island, is a EU member state since 2004, despite assurances to Turkey that it would be a member before a permanent solution on the island.
