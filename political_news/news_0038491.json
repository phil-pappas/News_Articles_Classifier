VA officials scheduled to testify next week are likely to oppose the idea, presented in a 4,000-page report last month by the MITRE Corp.\nShortcomings in the EHR played a role in the long backlogs for VA appointments that became a national scandal last year, but VA officials are proud of the physician-friendly software in their system.\nThe Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture is probably the oldest continuously used EHR in the world, with roots in code developed in the 1960s.\nIt’s been upgraded in thousands of ways over the years by VA clinicians. But while longtime VA officials are fiercely proud of the EHR, the MITRE report concluded that it is “in danger of becoming obsolete.”\n“VistA is a great big Buick with whitewall tires and tail fins that gets about 8 miles to the gallon,” said Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), a physician and member of the veterans committee, who noted that the VA is spending 80 percent of its IT budget on maintenance. “It gets you from A to B, but will it last 20 years?”\n“I’m not saying they should switch” to a commercial system, he said, “but when you ask sophisticated people can VistA work for the long run, the answer will be no. When you’re spending 80 percent of your car budget on maintenance, most of us figure it’s time to buy another car.”\nVistA’s problems “stymie interoperability between Veterans Health Administration facilities as well as with DoD and non-VA providers,” according to the MITRE report.\nThis is an increasingly salient point since Congress last year ordered the VA to allow veterans to see private doctors — and in fact 75 percent do.\nThe MITRE report recommends that VA “implement a single, integrated set of system-wide tools centered on a common EHR,” and begin the process with a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether those objectives can be met better by upgrading VistA or replacing it with a commercial EHR.\nThe VA’s systems for patient scheduling, staff hiring, supply-chain management, billing and claims payment are “stagnant, lack automation and have more limited capabilities than their private-sector equivalents,” Brett Giroir and Gail R. Wilensky, who co-chaired the blue-ribbon panel that studied the issue for MITRE, wrote in a recent New England Journal of Medicine article.\nThe question of the switch to a commercial system is “one question we’ll ask,” Roe said. Any immediate switch is unlikely.\n“Without a cost benefit analysis, which VA has never truly done, it's hard to say if an off-the-shelf solution is the best option at this point,” a committee staffer said.\nYet some health IT question how long VistA will remain.\n“While VistA was a highly innovative, ahead-of-the curve system when it first launched, it is now a dated system that has not integrated modern technological approaches and tools,” said Robert Wachter, a UCSF hospital leader and author of \" The Digital Doctor .\"\nIf VA put together an independent team to evaluate commercial options, Wachter said, “I would be surprised if it ends up recommending a VistA-like approach over the long haul.”\nSome VA users and IT specialists, however, argue that VistA would be just as usable as an Epic or Cerner system if VA had the resources and organization to implement the needed changes.\n\"It's a matter of risk,\" a former senior VA IT official said. \"If you go with the commercial route, you're laying the responsibility on the contractor.\"\nHaggling over the DoD and VA electronic health records has gone on for years, with ample congressional oversight and frustration. The administration in 2009 ordered the two agencies to create a single, integrated system but dropped the project three years later because of irreconcilable approaches to the problem.\n“When DoD has a software problem, their instinct is to buy a solution,” said another VA IT veteran who is now a contractor. “VA's instinct is to program it themselves.”\nDoD announced in July that it was buying a commercial EHR system offered by Cerner, Leidos and other contractors. It’s expected to be deployed in 2024 and cost in the neighborhood of $11 billion .\nThe VA system is the biggest in the world and versions of VistA are used in 1,800 places around the world, including the national health care systems of Finland, Egypt and Jordan.\nBut it was designed to function extremely well within a hospital, not in a network. VistA's ability to share data among its facilities and with other others has improved, but requires work, as does its ability to bill third-party payers, the contractor said.\nVistA came under congressional scrutiny last year when whistleblowers revealed a massive coverup of long backlogs for doctor appointments.\nSince 2012, the VA has sought to replace its scheduling software — its current software can’t schedule more than 8 hours of appointments per day — and in August, it awarded $624 million to a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin to overhaul that system.\nEpic Systems is said to have wanted to replace VistA for the VA, whose 300,000 employees operate 167 medical centers and 1,400 other sites that cared for six million veterans last year.\nBut now that Cerner defeated the Epic/IBM team vying for the Pentagon contract, it’s not clear whether Epic would bid on such a contract, CEO Judy Faulkner told POLITICO during a meeting with journalists this week at Epic’s Wisconsin headquarters.\n<div", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/shinseki-apologizes-for-va-health-care-scandal/2014/05/30/e605885a-e7f0-11e3-8f90-73e071f3d637_story.html", "http://www.va.gov/opa/choiceact/factsheets_and_details.asp", "https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=15a1662edc40008378cbeed3d94d2e1d&tab=core&tabmode=list&=", "http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1511438", "http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/612714", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071849467"], "published": "2015-10-23T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:50:43.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
