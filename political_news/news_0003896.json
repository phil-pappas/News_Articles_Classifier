This is in compliance with the order of Bombay High Court.\n\"We have resumed manufacturing of Maggi Noodles at three of our plants, at Nanjangud (Karnataka), Moga (Punjab) and Bicholim (Goa),\" said a Nestle India Spokesperson.\nHe further said: \"In compliance with the orders of the High Court of Bombay, fresh samples from these newly manufactured batches will be sent for testing to the three accredited laboratories designated by the High Court.\"\nThe company would start selling in the open market only after the fresh samples are cleared.\n\"We shall commence sale only after the samples are cleared by these laboratories,\" he said.\nBesides, Nestle India is also engaging state authorities and stakeholders at its production locations to commence manufacturing at the earliest, he added. On October 16, Nestle had said that all samples of Maggi (old batches) have cleared testing by three laboratories as mandated by the High Court.\n\"We have received test results from all three laboratories mandated by the Bombay High Court to test Maggi Noodles samples. All the 90 samples, covering six variants, tested by these laboratories are clear with lead much below the permissible limits,\" Nestle India had said in a statement.\nIn June, the FSSAI had banned Maggi noodle product saying it was \"unsafe and hazardous\" for consumption after finding lead levels beyond permissible limits. The company had withdrawn the instant noodle brand from the market.\nNestle India, which took a hit of Rs 450 crore, including destroying over 30,000 tonnes of the instant noodles since June when it was banned because of alleged excessive lead content, had stated that it would continue with the existing formula of the product and would not change the ingredients.\nThe Consumer Affairs Ministry had also filed a class action suit against Nestle India seeking about Rs 640 crore in damages for alleged unfair trade practices, false labeling and misleading advertisements. It was for the first time that the ministry dragged a company to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) using a provision in the nearly three-decade-old Consumer Protection Act.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:13:09.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
