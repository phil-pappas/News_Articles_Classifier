He noted that \" Turkey has seen an increase in terrorism activity inside and around its borders. In response to a series of such attacks, the previous ceasefire between the Turkish government and the terrorist group PKK has ended. And since then, we've seen an escalation of violence that needs to be addressed.\"\nProfessor Michael Reynolds said that he hasn't quite seen the level of negativity towards Turkey that he does now and added that Americans are frustrated because Turkey is fighting with PKK instead of ISIS. \"This is by far the biggest existential crisis that Turkey faces. It is very difficult to solve. The expectation from Turkey to turn around and fight ISIS when they have PKK is absurd,\" he noted. Questioning PKK's strategy in Syria , Reynolds said that instead of focusing on ISIS, \"dedicating so much effort to fight in Turkey shows that despite the ceasefire they have been preparing for this war.\" Reynolds concluded that \"backing of the Kurds by Americans runs the risk of making American foreign policy more difficult. A Turkey that is riddled by civil war and less democratic is not in the interest of American foreign policy.\"\nEmphasizing both regional and Turkey's dynamics, Dr. Joshua Walker said that \"there is no solution in Syria that does not involve Turkey . I don't think United States or the EU are being constructed in the process and as a result there is a constant miscalibration of expectations on both sides of the Atlantic.\" Walker also said that due to Russia's involvement there is now a \"softening of U.S. policy on Syria and U.S. needs to help Turkey walk back its rhetoric on Assad.\"\nExperts noted that under these new developments, the U.S. should put more emphasis on its cooperation with Turkey not on YPG, the organization that is part of the train and equip program, or any other entity.\nIn addition to U.S. and Turkish government officials, attendees to the roundtable discussion included representatives from the Syrian-American Council, Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq and Middle East analysts from various think-tanks.\nAbout the Turkish Heritage Organization\nThe Turkish Heritage Organization (THO) is a non-profit organization established to promote discussion and dialogue around Turkey's role in the international community and issues of importance in the U.S.- Turkey bilateral relationship. Founded by a group of Turkish-Americans with backgrounds in business and community leadership, the THO and its Advisory Board of global scholars strive to foster a deep and comprehensive dialogue to strengthen the relationship between Turkey and the United States , as well as the larger international community.\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/274062\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150423/201251LOGO\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/turkish-heritage-organization-assembles-panel-to-address-turkeys-pivotal-moment-isis-kurds-and-the-pkk-300154318.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20151005/274062", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/turkish-heritage-organization-assembles-panel-to-address-turkeys-pivotal-moment-isis-kurds-and-the-pkk-300154318.html", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnvar/20150423/201251LOGO", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151005/274062", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY20210&Transmission_Id=201510051540PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY20210&DateId=20151005", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150423/201251LOGO"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:50:28.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
