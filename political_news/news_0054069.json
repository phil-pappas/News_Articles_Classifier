Peirce was previously a Republican staffer for the Senate Banking Committee and has served as a staffer at the commission.\nThe SEC, which is tasked with protecting investors and regulating financial markets, is required to have at least two commissioners who are not from the majority party.\nMore from the Washington Examiner Paul on CNN poll rise: 'It's just part of my movement upwards' The Kentucky senator says it's indicative of his unrivaled support among young voters.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello • 10/20/15 3:55 PM Having both a Democratic and a Republican nominated at the same time could ease the nominations process. Nevertheless, nominations for top financial posts have been held up by Richard Shelby, the Republican chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\nA spokesman for Shelby said that the \"nominees will be vetted thoroughly and the Committee will consider them at an appropriate time.\"\nSherrod Brown, the Ohio senator who is the top Democrat on the committee, called for the nominations to be processed quickly, saying in a statement that they \"deserve thorough, fair, and swift consideration\" along with 11 other nominations currently before the committee. Among those are two nominees for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\nObama also has yet to name picks for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as well as for the position of vice chairman for supervision at the Fed, a post that could be filled with an existing governor.\nIf confirmed, the nominees would face the task of finishing some of the rules mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform laws, as well as enforcing existing rules.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Reid a Paul Ryan 'fan' for speaker \"He appears to me to be one of the people over there who would be reasonable,\" Reid said.\nBy Susan Ferrechio • 10/20/15 3:41 PM \"We face a critical juncture at the SEC, with crucial unfinished business ranging from Wall Street reform to crowdfunding rules to corporate political spending disclosure hanging in the balance,\" said Sen.
