Documents obtained by the auditors also allude to concerns with both the size and healthiness of meals served in prison. \nThose concerns mirror complaints received by The Tennessean from inmates and their families. TRICOR notes the state aimed to save money through \"portion control.\" While TRICOR depicts the change in meal portions as a benefit, it also notes that officers who eat prison meals don't follow the same portion control guidelines created for inmates. The agency also acknowledges there's a chance for \"prison unrest\" because of a \"drastic change in the food service program.\" \nThe auditors recommended TRICOR team with state financial experts to help find a way to better manage their programs. \n\"As noted throughout this finding and the audit report, we have identified numerous errors and misstatements in TRICOR's fiscal operations and financial reporting process. Based on the results of our work and in-part corroboration of the allegations, we have serious concerns about whether TRICOR's management has the ability to report accurate financial information,\" the audit states. \nTRICOR denies any intentional wrongdoing, but acknowledges it dismissed two officers charged with financial management who were not doing a good job. \n\"We concur that the previous chief financial officer (CFO) and controller were not performing their duties and overseeing their responsibilities to a satisfactory level,\" the agency wrote in response to the audit, noting both people were dismissed earlier this year. \n\"Once management became aware that problems existed in their performance they acted swiftly to correct the problem.\" Experts say longer sentences don't reduce crime \nThe TRICOR agency is a state inmate rehabilitation service that's independent from the department. The board relies almost exclusively on inmate labor to provide products such as manufactured flooring, license plates and meals. In turn the department relies on the board to provide the millions of meals it serves to inmates through something called the Tennessee Cook Chill program. Meals prepared by inmates in Nashville can be chilled and shipped to prisons or other customers across the country. \nAlthough TDOC and TRICOR work together to provide meals, the audit found they didn't actually have a contract for that arrangement. But the department and board fundamentally disagreed as to the cost of the meals: The department believes it should continue to pay the original $2.99 per meal, while TRICOR wants the state to pay $3.59 per meal. The department hasn't paid the difference. That led to the Tennessee Cook Chill program losing more than $4 million, according to the audit. \n\"(The board) is providing meals to the Department of Correction through the Cook Chill program without a written interagency agreement that delineates entities' respective authority, responsibility and fiscal relationship. As a result, each entity's expectations are unmet, and the Cook Chill program is in jeopardy,\" the auditors reported. \nTRICOR could cover the loss with some of its reserves, but the agency's available cash dropped by more than $7 million from 2014 to 2015, according to the audit. \nThe audit includes letters between TDOC Commissioner Derrick Schofield and TRICOR Chief Executive Officer Patricia Weiland that illustrate the fundamental disagreement and confusion created by having no written contract for meals. A March 24 letter from Weiland says her agency not only plans to require the department pay more money to receive bills, but that it also must pay $3.16 million to the agency by April 1 to account for the difference in meal prices. \nIn a response to that memo included in the audit, the department essentially says it's not their fault that TRICOR decided to charge less money for meals than it costs to make those meals. \n\"If it is now your position that the agreed upon price was roughly 1/3rd of your actual costs, while unfortunate, that is not something TDOC can assist you with. It is still the department's position that it has paid in full for every item received and that the reconciliation bill is in error,\" the department response states. \nIn July TRICOR told auditors that the department had agreed to pay $3.15 per meal, representing a 5 percent cost increase. Even at that rate, though, Weiland told the auditors that the program was not financially sustainable. \nThe letter also notes that the TRICOR agreement with the state is set to run out at the end of the year. The department will \"continue to evaluate all options, including TRICOR,\" said spokeswoman Alison Randgaard. TN prison chief says ready for scheduling, discipline changes \nThe audit also provides more details about meals provided to inmates. TRICOR provided roughly 18.8 million meals, based on the idea it would take 15.6 million meals to feed every prison if they were at 100 percent capacity. \nIn a recent presentation included in the audit, the agency also notes it's more expensive to provide inmates with a healthy meal, compared to meals served to inmates at prisons operated by Corrections Corporation of America. \n\"The current menu is 'nutrient dense' which affects the cost considerably. TDOC inmates housed at South Central Correctional Complex which is operated by CCA are provided a menu that contains more carbohydrates, sugar, etc., thus lowering the cost to produce,\" the TRICOR presentation states. \n\"You cannot maintain a low daily cost for a nutrient dense meal.\" \nThe presentation goes on to say TRICOR is working to develop an alternate menu at the request of the department that will \"maximize plate coverage.\" \n\"The current CCA menu is being evaluated as well as other less nutrient dense menus in an effort to keep the per meal cost reasonable and provide sufficient food for the offender population,\" the presentation states. \nState Comptroller Justin Wilson will appear Wednesday at a legislative hearing to present lawmakers with the audit findings. The hearing is set to begin at 9 a.m. in Room 12 at Legislative Plaza. \nReach Dave Boucher at 615-259-8892 and on Twitter @Dave_Boucher1 .
