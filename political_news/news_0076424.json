Kevin McCarthy got slammed for a slip-up that connected the Benghazi committee investigation to Hillary Clinton’s tanking poll numbers, but Bill O’Reilly is not denying the link – at all. “If you don’t think the Benghazi thing is political, of course it’s political,” O’Reilly said on Fox News’ “The Five” on Thursday. “But that doesn’t mean we shouldn't know what exactly happened and why the secretary of state was ignorant about the security problems in Benghazi, Libya.\"\n“But if you think those guys, those Republicans on that panel, don’t want to bring down Hillary Clinton, you’re 6 years old, because they do, so it is political,” O’Reilly said.\nThe conservative journalist said he doesn’t mind that it’s politically charged because it boils down to figuring out what happened.\nDespite all the spectacle surrounding the investigation, O’Reilly said that the House probe isn't going to be what brings down Clinton – it will be what the FBI discovers.\n“And here is the bottom of it: Hillary Clinton will not be president of the United States if the FBI comes back and says she broke the law,” he said. “And they may well. So that's it. It's the FBI, it's not the House Committee on Benghazi. Whatever they say isn't going to matter to Hillary Clinton. The FBI will matter, and we should have that, I would say, in three or four months.”\nIn a statement provided to POLITICO, the Clinton campaign said O'Reilly’s comments were part of “a penchant for truth telling” that was “spreading across the Republican Party. ”\n“While the American people have always known that the Benghazi Committee is a taxpayer-funded campaign against Hillary Clinton, the continued admissions by leading conservatives is a sign that even they are done pretending that this was ever about anything other than hurting Hillary Clinton,” the statement said.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:39:08.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
