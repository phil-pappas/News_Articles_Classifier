Wagner, who has pushed to have an outside investigator look at this controversy. The state board instead left the investigation to Yost and the state Inspector General, who won't confirm whether he's looking at the issue or not.\n\"I've come to the conclusion, with all of the delays, that they're trying to hide something,\" Wagner said.\nYost Press Secretary Brittany Halpin said Yost staffers \"are a little puzzled\" by Gunlock's response and that she hopes the full board will agree to release the records.\nYost is seeking access to communications between Ohio Department of Education employees and the department's legal office - items that are normally private because of attorney-client privilege - as he conducts his annual audit of the department.\nYost asked Gunlock last week to waive that privilege so he can better determine if it broke state law when former school choice chief David Hansen left F grades of online schools out of the evaluations of charter school oversight agencies, known as \"sponsors\" or \"authorizers.\"\nState school board members considered that exclusion illegal. Hansen resigned in July after the board and State Sen. Peggy Lehner questioned him about it publicly.\nAs a backdrop to this latest debate is a tangle of political loyalties and affiliations.\nHansen is the husband of Gov. John Kasich's presidential campaign manager Beth Hansen , State Superintendent Richard Ross has close ties to the governor, Gunlock was appointed to the board by Kasich and Yost, though elected, has endorsed Kasich in the presidential race.\nIn his letter to Gunlock last week, Yost listed three reasons why he wants those records:\n- \"First, in order to audit for compliance with the applicable laws, it is necessary to know whether employees of ODE acted against the advice of counsel.\"\n- \"Second, if there are otherwise privileged communications that explain how Department officials and employees should act under applicable law, those explanations would assist in informing this office's understanding of the law.\"\n- \"Third, it may be necessary to interview officers and employees at ODE. Those interviews will only be productive if the witnesses feel free to discuss their understanding of the law and what they were advised.\"\nGunlock disagreed, saying that attorney-client privilege is not something to waive without a real reason.\n\"Your in-house lawyers can read and interpret the sponsor evaluation statute and come to their own independent legal conclusion on whether the five sponsor evaluations that were released by the former employee in question and later rescinded by ODE followed that statute or not,\" he wrote. \"As you already noted in letters sent over to legislators, ODE has already admitted that the former employee did not follow the law.\"\nGunlock added: \"Thus, whether the former employee was given bad legal advice by an ODE lawyer or whether he was given proper legal advice and disregarded it is irrelevant to your ultimate legal determination on whether the law was followed.\"\nWagner, a former judge in Dayton, disagreed and said there are broader issues the records could explain.\n\"There are a lot of other laws that apply to charter schools on how they're reviewed and how they're renewed and how they're licensed,\" Wagner said. \"are they (ODE) overlooking things in renewals, complaints and investigations?\"\nHalpin said that when Yost was investigating grade-scrubbing issues in the Columbus school district, the district waived attorney-client privilege. She said she hopes the state school board will follow Columbus' lead.\nGunlock noted in his letter, however, that the evaluations were caught before any money was spent, \"in marked contrast to the data scrubbing scandal at the Columbus City Schools\" where school report cards were affected.\nHere is Gunlock's letter:\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2454042/gunlock-response-to-yost-letter-10-7-15.pdf\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Gunlock Response to Yost Letter 10 7 15 (PDF)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br /&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2454042/gunlock-response-to-yost-letter-10-7-15.txt\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Gunlock Response to Yost Letter 10 7 15 (Text)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;", "external_links": ["https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2454042/gunlock-response-to-yost-letter-10-7-15.txt", "https://ohioauditor.gov/", "http://education.ohio.gov/", "https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/2454042/gunlock-response-to-yost-letter-10-7-15.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:47:21.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
