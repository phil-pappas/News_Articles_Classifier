Zelman immediately began to educate herself about this disease and to seek the best available care. When she responded favorably to her treatment, Debbie founded DDF, which now has 29 chapters throughout the United States , Canada , and Germany and a Medical Advisory Board of 30 renowned doctors from across the country. Now, seven years later, Debbie is still receiving chemotherapy and is thrilled to be able to watch her three children grow up.\nDebbie's Dream Foundation is committed to raising awareness about stomach cancer, providing funding for research, and helping to provide education and support to patients, families, and caregivers around the world. The disease is estimated to be the fourth most common cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of death among cancers. Eighty percent of stomach cancer patients are diagnosed at stage IV, and those who are diagnosed with stage IV have a four percent chance of being alive in five years.\nThe organization is the leading 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to raising international awareness about stomach cancer, advancing funding for research, and providing education and support to patients, families, and caregivers. Debbie's Dream Foundation seeks as its ultimate goal to make the cure for stomach cancer a reality.\nMedia Contact:\nAdriana Bates\nCommunications Coordinator\nDebbie's Dream Foundation: Curing Stomach Cancer\n(954) 475-1200\nEmail\nwww.DebbiesDream.org\n releases/debbies-dream-foundations-1st-chicago-stomach-cancer-education-symposium--webinar-featuring-distinguished-line-up-of-medical-professionals-300165141.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://pressreleaseheadlines.com/contact?pid=293058", "http://www.debbiesdream.org/portal/chicago-symposium", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "http://www.debbiesdream.org/", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=PH36111&Transmission_Id=201510230835PR_NEWS_USPR_____PH36111&DateId=20151023", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151022/279687LOGO", "http://www.DebbiesDream.org/portal/chicago-symposium", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/debbies-dream-foundations-1st-chicago-stomach-cancer-education-symposium--webinar-featuring-distinguished-line-up-of-medical-professionals-300165141.html"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:11:13.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
