The members of Tuesday Group look forward to working with him to govern, to address the many challenges facing our nation and to provide a clear and hopeful vision to the American People.\"\nRyan met with the RSC Wednesday.\n\"After hearing Paul lay out his vision for the future of the Republican conference, I am confident that he is the right person to lead the House going forward. He has the policy expertise, conservative principles and strong values we need in our next Speaker,\" RSC Chairman Bill Flores said in a statement.\nFollow @CNNpolitics", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CNNpolitics"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:13:04.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
