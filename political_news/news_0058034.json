This has very practical value to old and new clients alike. They can be assured that their primary counsel is benefiting from the resident knowledge of the entire firm.\n\"Whether it is a corporate mater or a matrimonial dispute, no contemporary legal entanglement exists in a vacuum. Therefore, clients have the right to expect that in addition to working with a specialist attorney that has a concentrated skill set, that attorney has a broad array of professional talent that he or she can call on to best serve the complex legal issues facing their client,\" Fensterman points out.\n\"Small, generalist law firms and small hyper-specialized firms certainly have a place in the legal market, as do the super large firms,\" says Fensterman. \"But increasingly, the small firms are not meeting client expectations when the matter at hand goes beyond a narrow band-width engagement. Likewise the very large firms are experiencing the inescapable challenges that are directly related to their size and overhead. Large firms are finding it difficult to effectively deliver cross-expertise talent to clients due to the silo structure that typically characterize these firms. Additionally, the operating cost associated with large firms makes it difficult for clients to extract value for money. Even large corporations are today engaging mid-size law firms to handle assignments that, in the past, would always go to larger firms,\" adds Fensterman\nAs many U.S. and foreign corporations struggle to \"right-size\" in order to meet profitability targets and customer demands, from Howard Fensterman's vantage point, his and other mid-size law firms are in the right place, at the right time.\n releases/howard-fensterman-managing-partner-of-long-island-ny-based-abrams-fensterman-sees-mid-size-law-firms-well-positioned-to-deliver-the-critical-combination-of-expertise--value-for-todays-complex-legal-entanglements-300161600.html\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/howard-fensterman-managing-partner-of-long-island-ny-based-abrams-fensterman-sees-mid-size-law-firms-well-positioned-to-deliver-the-critical-combination-of-expertise--value-for-todays-complex-legal-entanglements-300161600.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY30568&Transmission_Id=201510191100PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY30568&DateId=20151019", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:44:40.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
