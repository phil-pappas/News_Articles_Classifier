The IMPIC was formed to defeat Initiative 42, a Democrat-led effort to put all education funding and policy decisions into the hands of a Hinds County Judge. Previous campaign finance reports for pro-42 organization Better Schools Better Jobs show millions of out-of-state dollars have been funneled to Mississippi to support this liberal initiative that will create years of litigation and enrich trial lawyers at the expense of schools and taxpayers.
