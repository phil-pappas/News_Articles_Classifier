Chandrasekhar Rao at a function to mark centenary celebrations of former minister J.V. Narsing Rao, in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (Photo: DC) Hyderabad: Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday asserted that the TRS government would not take any decision that would have an adverse effect on the future generations. “We are cautious in taking each step. Every step we take is for the good of the people. People believed TS would be safe in the hands of the TRS and they voted for us. Several people have fought for a separate Telangana, including J.V. Narsing Rao, but could not see it become a reality,” he said. Participating in the J.V. Narsing Rao centenary celebrations and releasing two books “Telangana muddu bidda J.V. Narsing Rao” and “J.V. Narsing Rao, a gentleman politician”, Mr Rao said “JV Saab would be suitably honoured after consulting his associates and family members.” He said that TS leaders, intellectuals and other prominent personalities like Narsing Rao, a former minister, were ignored in united AP. He said that these people would be suitably honoured on the lines of P.V. Narasimha Rao, Dasaradhi, Kaloji, Konda Laxman Bapuji, Prof. Jayashanker, G. Venkataswamy and others. “I don’t know why there is a growing intolerance in politics. Intolerance in politics is not good for the state, country and society. I assure you that the future of TS is bright and we are on the right track. We will not do anything wrong, come what may. One wrong step would affect the future generations,” he said.
