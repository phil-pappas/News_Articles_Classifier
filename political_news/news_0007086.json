Libertarian activists gathered in New Hampshire for a Republican Liberty Caucus convention said years of action to force Washington to recognize the anger pulsing through the populist wing of the Republican Party was finally showing results.\n\"It's a sign that we're finally seeing the anger crossing the country make its way into DC,” said Matt Nye, the chairman of the caucus.\nThe House Republican Freedom Caucus deserved particular plaudits for McCarthy's decision, argued Drew Ryun, the political director for The Madison Project. On Wednesday, that group of conservative lawmakers endorsed Rep. Daniel Webster for speaker over McCarthy.\n\"I think it's a new day for conservatives,\" Ryun said. \"I mean this House Freedom Caucus, everybody was wondering when they would have some conservative victories. … Make no mistake they had a role in (McCarthy’s decision.) That is their first legislative victory. That will dictate legislation going forward.\"\nWebster wasn’t the only name uttered in Nashua as activists discussed possible House speakers. Di Lothrop, program chair of the Republican Liberty Caucus convention, named Jason Chaffetz as a better conservative candidate than McCarthy.\nAfter McCarthy's exit, who's in the running to replace Boehner? By Lauren French\nRepublicans on the presidential campaign trail also cheered the news, and aimed to align themselves with the conservative voices channeling the right’s frustration with Washington.\n“Every elected congressman and every elected senator should be very aware that the grassroots is unhappy,” Sen. Rand Paul, a 2016 contender whose candidacy had been based on his libertarian and anti-establishment roots, said on Fox News. “They're very upset that official Washington does not appear to be using the full force of our office. They wonder why they expended so much effort to elect conservatives and then it turns out they're not using their full force.\"\nAnd Sen. Ted Cruz, one of the most conservative Republicans in the 2016 field and an ally to the House conservatives, called on GOP leaders to start listening.\n“Leadership isn’t listening or honoring promises they made to the American people,” Cruz said during an interview on a local Boston radio station. “The volcanic frustration with Washington spilled over, spilled over to a point where every one of us was sick and tired of leadership who doesn’t stand up and fight Obama on anything.”\nEliza Collins contributed to this report.\n<div", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:19:11.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
