According to Texas Lyceum Poll numbers released Thursday, Trump is supported by 21 percent of Texas Republicans. He's followed by 16 percent who chose Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). \n\"Not too surprising, there's a little bit of a native son effect,\" said pollster and University of Texas Professor Daron Shaw. When it comes to Ben Carson, who polled third at 12 percent, Shaw suggests the soft-spoken neurosurgeon is more than meets the eye. POLL: Trump, Cruz tops among Texas Republicans \n\"Ben Carson is the second choice of a lot of Republicans,\" said Shaw. \"I think 21 percent of people who had a preference besides Carson said that Carson was their second choice.\" \n\"It's not about the loud voices on the stage, it's about leadership,\" former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told ABC this week. Bush rounds out the top four among Texas Republicans with 10 percent support, and continues to ramp up criticism of the party front runner. Bush told reporters in New Hampshire, \"Donald seems to have a harder time taking criticism, and he probably needs to put on his big boy pants too.\" \nTrump's biggest critic, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, dropped out of the race while the poll was out. Perry was registering just one percent in his own state. \nHillary Clinton leads Democrats with 36 percent, followed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 24 percent and a hypothetical Vice President Joe Biden candidacy at 15 percent. \n\"Mrs. Clinton's lead isn't quite as sizable in Texas as it is nationally,\" said Shaw. \"It looks more like some of the early primary states in that sense.\" \nHead to head in a general election, Clinton loses Texas to nearly every Republican candidate except one: Marco Rubio. Shaw suggests it is likely due to few Texans being familiar with Rubio. \nTexas, with its 155 delegates, could be a big prize on super Tuesday, but rules assigning delegates proportionally and the cost of advertising may dull its influence. Still, Shaw says winning Texas \"perceptually is a big deal,\" which could bolster a candidate's perceived strength and viability. \nRepublican candidates will debate in Houston on February 26, then Texans will head to the polls March 1.
