And we would tie the raising of that debt limit to some very significant actions so that we are not here again next year,\" Carson said on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"This is something that happens year after year after year. We always get right up to the deadline Now it's do or die, and you're forced to do it. And that's a stupid way to run a government.\" \nCarson gave a muddled answer when he was asked about raising the debt ceiling last week, discussing the future federal budget instead of money the U.S. has already spent. \nThe neurosurgeon also defended a passage in new book, \"A More Perfect Union,\" where he wrote that it was a \"combination of removing guns and disseminating propaganda\" that allowed the Nazi party to take power in Germany. He late said in a CNN interview that, \"the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:28:28.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
