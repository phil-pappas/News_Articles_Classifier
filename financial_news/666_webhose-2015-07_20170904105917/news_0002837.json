ADVERTISEMENT That could complicate efforts to pass the bill, whish is seen as \"must-pass\" legislation, with conservatives strongly opposing Ex-Im. Supporters say it helps create jobs and open markets to U.S. exports, but critics question using taxpayer money for it, and say that work should be left to the private sector.\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) hasn't ruled out filibustering the transportation bill if it includes a provision saving Ex-Im. \nLawmakers will also turn their attention to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, which is turning five years old this year. Both Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) will hold hearings on the law. \nOn Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee will examine transparency at the Financial Stability Oversight Council. \nSince it was created under Dodd-Frank, the council has been controversial and Republicans have pressed the group --made of the heads of the top financial regulators -- for more transparency. \nThe House Financial Services Committee well meet Thursday for a hearing dubbed \"Ending 'Too Big to Fail': What is the Proper Role of Capital and Liquidity?\" \nThat same day, the Senate Banking Committee will have an hearing about how to measure the systemic importance of U.S. bank companies. \n\nHatch presses Lew on Puerto Rico, by Pete Schroeder: http://bit.ly/1gFog7o \nSenate Finance turns to expired tax breaks, by Bernie Becker: http://bit.ly/1GqPbbO \nThree more Swiss banks sign up with Justice, by Bernie Becker: http://bit.ly/1e599C9 \nSenate Dems to Yellen: Don't rush rate hike, by Pete Schroeder: http://bit.ly/1KcG7ip \nEx-Im chairman says he's following the law, by Kevin Cirilli: http://bit.ly/1HDNMR1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T19:54:15.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
