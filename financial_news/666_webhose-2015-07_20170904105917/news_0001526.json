Nine months ago they put the business up for sale and since then have worked through several options for full and partial sales with Australian and international investors.\nNo financial details of the agreement have been provided, but the outgoing investors will make money on the deal.\nLJ Hooker, launched by the legendary Sir Leslie Hooker in 1928, remained one of the nation's best-known brands.\nThe group had more than 700 franchise offices and 8000 people across Australia and in New Zealand, the Pacific and Asia, along with international partnerships. Beyond the ubiquitous real estate shops, the group had a commercial real estate franchise network and, in LJ Hooker Home Loans, a significant mortgage broking operation.\nFor almost 20 years, after the collapse of Hooker Corporation in the early 1990s, LJ Hooker languished under the control of Suncorp.\nThe new owners had to inject more capital into the business and upgrade the management, first under Mr Hooker and then under George Chmiel, now director of the listed iProperty Group, and since 2013 under former Salmat chief executive Grant Harrod.\nMr Harrod wrote that that business would \"continue to work together to build Australasia's number one real estate group.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:07:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
