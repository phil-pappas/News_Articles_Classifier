Sir, you may begin. Paul Alexander (VP - IR): Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Kimberly-Clark's second-quarter earnings conference call. Here with me in Dallas today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO, Maria Henry, CFO and Mike Azbell, VP and Controller. Here is the agenda for our call. Maria will begin with a review of our second-quarter results. After that, Tom will provide his perspectives on our results and outlook for the full year. We'll finish with Q&A. As usual, we have a presentation of today's materials in the investor section of our web site. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements today. Please see the risk factors section of our latest annual report on form 10-K for further discussion of forward-looking statements. We will also be referring to adjusted results and outlook. Both exclude certain items described in this morning's news release. The release has further information on these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn over to Maria. Maria Henry (CFO): Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be in my first earnings call as part of the Kimberly-Clark team. I've had the opportunity to meet some of you and I'm looking forward to meeting many more of you is I begin traveling to meet with investors this quarter. Let me go ahead and turn to our results for the second quarter, starting with some headlines. First, we achieve organic sales growth of 4%, in line with our full-year target of 3% to 5%. Second, we delivered excellent cost savings and margin improvement and solid growth in adjusted earnings per share. And third, we continue to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. Now let's cover the details of our results. Second-quarter sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 6%, driven by a 10 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose 4%, highlighted by a 10% increase in our developing and emerging markets. On profitability, adjusted gross margin was 35.8% in the second quarter, up 140 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17%. That's up 130 basis points. Operating margins were up in each major geographic region, North America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets. Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund the investments we're making behind our brands. Second-quarter FORCE savings were $105 million, equaling our previous all-time high. For the full year, we now expect that FORCE savings will be at least $350 million. That's up from our previous expectation of at least $300 million. In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and generated $20 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $40 million benefit in the quarter, mostly from oil-based materials. We now expect that deflation for the full year of be between $100 million and $200 million. On the other hand, we continue to experience significant currency headwinds. The total earnings drag from currency was approximately $0.30 per share in the second quarter. For the full year, we expected that currency will negatively impacts earnings by more than 20%. On the bottom line, second-quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.41. That's up 6% year-on-year and includes an approximate three point benefit from a lower share count. Now turning to cash flow and capital efficiency, cash provided by operations in the second quarter was healthy at $772 million. Compared to the year-ago quarter, that was down $70 million, driven by the spin off of the healthcare business. Our second-quarter working capital cash conversion cycle improved seven days compared to the 2014 full-year average. We now expect our full-year improvement to be six to seven days and that's ahead of our original three- to four-day improvement target. This is mostly driven by additional progress on payables. 1 of 11", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T16:19:29.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
