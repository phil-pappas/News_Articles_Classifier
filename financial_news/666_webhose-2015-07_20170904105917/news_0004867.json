Surprised and disappointed,\" Mr Shorten said. \nHe said Australia won't be ready to face the challenges of the future if governing is reduced to a democratic \"tit-for-tat\". \nHe said if new prime ministers spent the first half of their term dismantling everything their predecessors built and in the second half promising everything to cling to power, it would only create uncertainty for the Australian people, business and investors. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Shorten to help firms become corporates AAP \nA Labor government would make it easier for small businesses to become corporations to gain all their added benefits. â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:32:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
