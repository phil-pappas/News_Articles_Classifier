Part-time work fell 71,200 while full-time rose 64,800. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected employment would fall by 10,000 and the jobless rate would rise to 6.9 percent.\nJune’s employment drop comes on the heels of other recent data -- a fourth straight month of falling output, the second-largest trade deficit on record -- that build a case for a faltering economy. That may lead Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz to cut interest rates for the second time this year on July 15.\nRegionally, Quebec posted the biggest declines, with the loss of 33,300 being the most since May 2005. The province’s unemployment rate rose to 8 percent from 7.6 percent.\nBy industry, the largest drop came from a 16,800 decline in the “other services” category that includes personal and laundry work. Business, building and other support services fell by 13,700 and manufacturing by 7,200 in June.\nThe self-employment category decreased 22,200 and workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose 15,900.\nPrivate companies cut 26,300 workers and public-sector employment rose by 42,200 in June.\nGovernor Poloz earlier this year said the shock of a plunge in crude oil prices was “front loaded” and gains in other parts of the economy would take over around the second half of this year. The central bank will update economic forecasts on July 15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:02:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
