We explain how to lock in cheap power \nFamilies overpaying by up to £400 on their annual energy bills were hope this week by the Government's launch of a new 24-hour switching service. \nThe new \"switch guarantee\", which promises to transfer a household's energy supply in just a day, won't be in place until 2018 but householders can still save money today. \nGas and electricity prices have reached five-year lows, and this is reflected in a raft of cheap deals, starting at £899 a year for typical use. The average price most householders pay, by contrast, is more than £1,200. \n• Here's proof that phantom calls CAN be added to your phone bill \n• Save '£700' a year by outsourcing your household bills \nWholesale gas and electricity is 20pc cheaper than in 2014, according to ICIS, an energy price tracker. \nThe price drop comes after a landmark report also found firms are routinely overcharging householders. \nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the Big Six energy firms pocket an extra £1.7bn a year, or £50 per household. \n= Are we being overcharged - and by how much? = \nEnergy firms are \"exploiting\" customers who forget to sign up to a new tariff once their fixed-term contract ends. These people are moved to a more expensive \"standard variable\" rate that typically costs £160 more than a fixed deal, the CMA said. \nThe Big Six suppliers were accused of using their dominant position to overcharge customers on \"standard variable tariffs\", which around 70pc of energy customers are signed up to. \nThe graphs, below, show the price difference between being on a standard tariff compared with being on the cheapest available plan. \n\"Loyalty doesn't reap rewards in the energy market,\" said Mark Todd of Energy Helpline, a comparison website. \"There's pressure on the Big Six to cut their prices - but there is also a likelihood they will do nothing.\" \n= Can I claim money back if I've been on a standard tariff? = \nSuppliers must, by law, tell customers who are on a standard tariff if they offer a cheaper plan. But when energy bills run to six pages, this information is often missed by customers. \nIf a supplier fails to provide clear information, you could be eligible for a refund. Customers need to make a complaint to the Energy Ombudsman, a dispute resolution service. \nHowever, the Energy Ombudsman said that customers who are automatically transferred to a standard variable tariff, but don't switch, would be unlikely to have a claim. \"It would be up to the customer to switch to an alternative tariff,\" a spokesman said. \n= How can I lock in cheap energy prices today? = \nSigning up for a short-term fix is the cheapest option, with the lowest-cost energy deal (£899) from SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) . This is for a dual fuel customer consuming a typical amount of energy. \nEnergy firms are now in a sales push to sign up customers for longer fixes, citing cheap wholesale energy. \n• Cheapest ever energy deal for four years is offered by npower \n\"Companies are marketing their customers to fix for longer - but it's not cheap,\" said Mr Todd. \"This is more profitable for the firm as the difference between fixing for one year and three years is as much as £200 a year.\" \nSSE, for example, sells a three-year fix which is £100 more expensive per year than the one-year deal. \nkate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T19:00:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
