Sources in the City said yesterday’s statement, which revealed “flaws in the business model” could prompt GO to “agitate for a deal”. \nThere has long been speculation of a tie-up between Premier Farnell and Electrocomponents but whether the latter’s new boss, Lindsley Ruth, has a merger on his agenda is uncertain. Analysts also said pressure on management could see Premier Farnell offload some of its non-core assets, such as brands CPC or MCM, to help the floundering company get in shape for a possible sale. \nThe shares fell 26.6p, or 16pc, to 140p. \nAll eyes were on GlaxoSmithKline (Other OTC: GLAXF - news ) as it reported its first set of quarterly results since buying Novartis’ vaccines unit and selling its cancer drugs unit to the Swiss group. GSK’s shares jumped 46p, or 3.5pc, to £13.75 after it beat second-quarter profit forecasts thanks to increased demand for its new drug to fight HIV. The pharma giant reported a 6pc increase in sales to £5.9bn. \nAnalysts at UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) said GSK’s “US sales performed very strongly”, citing the continued benefit from the launch of Flonase, an allergy nasal spray. However, foreign currency headwinds weighed on profitability, impacting it negatively by 220 basis points. \nMeanwhile, Hikma leapt 86p to £24.07 after a broker upgraded the stock following Tuesday’s announcement that it will buy US generics unit Roxane . Jefferies raised the target price to £26.15 from £21.34 and lifted its rating to “buy”. James Vane-Tempest, of Jefferies, said “the deal provides a platform and pipeline to grow its business with opportunities to create further value from potential synergies.” \nIn the broader market, Britain’s benchmark index was boosted by an injection of strong corporate results and updates. The FTSE 100 climbed 75.72 points to 6,631. * Chinese markets bounce back as Beijing steps in British American Tobacco also surpassed analysts’ downbeat profit expectations, sending the shares 129p higher to £36.81. Nonetheless, revenue for the first half of the year fell by 5.9pc to £6.4m . \nWhile Eddy Hargreaves, of Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) , reckons the results were reassuring, he said “longer-term concerns such as e-cigarette incursion, the potential introduction of plain packaging and volume attrition in the core business remain”. \nTwo days after five brokers slashed their price targets , platinum producer Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) found itself back in the firing line. UBS lowered its guidance from 75p to 45p following Friday’s mine shaft closures. \nHowever, Danielle Chigumira, of UBS, does not believe the closure of the Hossy and Newman mine shafts will result in a significant decrease in unit costs in the long-term. The stock was changing hands at 55.6p by the close down 3.5p, or 5.9pc. \nElsewhere, mounting speculation of a tie-up between InterContinental Hotels (Other OTC: ICHGF - news ) Group and US company Starwood continued to circle the City, with the latter’s stock advancing 1.4pc to £26.23. \nFastjet (LSE: FJET.L - news ) slipped 1.1pc, after it issued a statement saying “it knows of no material trading reason for the recent share price movement”. The stock had fallen 7.5pc on Tuesday. \nFinally, Aim-listed Sable Mining climbed 2.1pc to 0.5p after it unveiled encouraging metallurgical results for its Nimba iron ore project in Guinea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T22:06:50.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
