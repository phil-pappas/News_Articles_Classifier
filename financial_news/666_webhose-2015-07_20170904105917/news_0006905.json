This weekend now looms as the climax of a five-year battle to contain Greece’s debts, potentially splintering a currency that was meant to be unbreakable.\n“The direct effects of the Greek crisis, for the path of the commercial and financial links, should be modest for Italy and for the region even in the worst scenarios, Visco told the Italian Banking Association’s annual meeting in Rome. ‘‘The crisis will, however, have more serious repercussions if it rekindles in investors the fear that the euro isn’t irreversible.”\nThe consequences of Greece’s possible euro exit are weighing on Italian banks’ stock prices, as the country’s sovereign bonds, mostly held by them, are perceived riskier by investors. While lenders have limited direct exposure to Greece, their holdings of Italy’s government bonds stood near a record high of 415.5 billion euros ($458.7 billion) in April.\n“The interruption of negotiations between Greece and its international creditors, and the results of last Sunday’s referendum, have had on the whole limited consequences so far on financial markets of the euro area,” Visco said.\nThe spread between Italy’s 10-year BTP and the benchmark German 10-year bund has widened 39 basis points since June 26, the day before the Greek referendum was announced. The yield on Italian 10-year debt has risen to 2.26 percent from a low of 1.13 percent in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T12:27:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
