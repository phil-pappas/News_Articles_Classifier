Volkswagen (Other OTC: VLKAF - news ) was down 3 percent after Manager Magazin said the company's China manager was readying a cost saving programme because the carmaker's full-year group profit could fall by more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) due to weak demand in the country. \nAggreko plummeted 12 percent after issuing a profit warning and Spain's Abengoa (NasdaqGS: ABGB - news ) tumbled 9 percent despite saying it would act to prevent speculative trading on its debt, a day after losses for its bonds, credit default swaps and stocks. \nThe FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1 percent at 1,562.72 points by 1522 GMT after falling to 1,562.57, the lowest in a week. The index headed for a weaker weekly close after gaining in the previous two weeks. \nAnalysts said that the market weakness was mainly due to a sharp decline in commodity stocks and less because of news on Greece, where talks on tying up a new bailout deal failed to start on Friday as had been expected, with officials blaming security worries for delaying the negotiations. \nSome companies got boost from their positive earnings updates. Telecom major Vodafone rose 3.4 percent after results that showed improvements across major markets in Germany and Britain. \nFrance's defence group Thales (Paris: FR0000121329 - news ) rose 6.7 percent to an all-time high. Its first-half operating profit rose by a larger-than-expected 18 percent to 473 million euros ($519 million), buoyed in part by a tighter grip on costs in its defence and security business.
