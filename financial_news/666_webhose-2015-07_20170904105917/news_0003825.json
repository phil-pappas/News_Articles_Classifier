It is slated to arrive in Spain, Italy, and Portugal in the final quarter of this year. \nAlong with investing in supporting more languages and show libraries tailored to various markets, Netflix is making a priority of optimizing its service on mobile devices since they are the main tools for accessing the Internet in emerging markets, according to the company.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T03:03:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
