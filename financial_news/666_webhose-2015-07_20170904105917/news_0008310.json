Written by: Janet Al-Saad 07/27/15 - 3:15 PM EDT \nNEW YORK (MainStreet) -- First came the student loans. Then came the massive debt bubble totaling over $1.2 trillion, and financial institutions hungry to carve out their share of the student loan pie. Personal finance website NerdWallet is the latest company entering the student loan re-servicing scene, expanding its services to include a refinancing engine. But what’s merely smart business for NerdWallet represents a seismic shift in the way student loans are viewed by financial institutions, since refinancing offers new revenue sources. And so far, it’s mostly smaller players making a buck off your debt. \nThe Little Guys Take Over \nEver since the government cornered the market on federal student loans half a decade ago, financial institutions have been scurrying to re-capture some of the lost revenue. Enter student loan refinancing companies, such as SoFi and CommonBond , which hope to lower your interest rate by re-financing and/or consolidating your loans, and aggregators such as Credible, which powers NerdWallet’s engine by providing users a simple search engine interface for finding such a re-financing provider.
