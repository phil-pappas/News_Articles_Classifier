Supplied. Share on twitter by Lucille Keen Employment Minister Eric Abetz is investigating an official complaint against Fair Work Commission vice president Michael Lawler, the partner of embattled former union leader Kathy Jackson.\nSenator Abetz has written to commission president Iain Ross seeking more information about Mr Lawler's work performance and his attendance at the tribunal.\nThe government is under pressure to resolve the controversy over Mr Lawler, who has been on sick leave for nine months of the last year on full pay of $435,000 a year.\nHowever, Senator Abetz would not commit on Sunday to the government taking specific action against Mr Lawler.\n\"Well, I'm going to go through this step by step, and come to a determination in due course. Whether or not any action needs to be taken and, if so, by whom,\" Mr Abetz told conservative commentator Andrew Bolt on Sunday.\nFor the past nine months, Mr Lawler has been supporting his defacto Kathy Jackson who is being sued by her former employer, the Health Services Union, for $2.5 million and is accused of misusing $1.4 million of union members funds.\nHe has been in the spotlight recently for his push to have the house they share moved into his name, after Ms Jackson filed for bankruptcy.\nIn a sworn affidavit Mr Lawler makes it clear he wishes to return to his role at the industrial tribunal but claims he has been under attack by members within the body.\n He also claims to have been \"debilitated\" by his own mental health, suffering from stress.\nShadow employment minister Brendan O'Connor said Friday it was \"incumbent upon\" the government to examine the conduct of Mr Lawler, \"given the questions that are now being raised publicly regarding the discharging of his duties as an officer of the commission\".\n\"There is a growing concern that the reputation of the Fair Work Commission will be called into question and consequently a potential loss of public confidence,\" Mr O'Connor said.\nOutcome A spokesman for Mr Abetz said last week that the Fair Work Commission was independent of government and its members are independent quasi-judicial officers.\n\"The long standing position has been that it is not the relevant Minister that determines whether members remain in office, but rather, this power rests with the Governor-General and the Parliament,\" the spokesman said.\nMr Lawler, a former barrister, was appointed to the old Industrial Relations Commission in 2002 by then Employment Minister Tony Abbott.\nPresidents and commissioners are employed at FWC until they reach 65. Greg Smith, is set to retire next week after almost 30 years while four others, Wayne Blair, Alan Boulton, Danny Cloghan and John Lewin are due to retire by year's end.\nThe last person who was removed from such a position was Jim Staples, who was not reappointed by the Hawke government in 1989 when it replaced the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.\nThe Australian Bar Association, the peak body for barristers, released a statement claiming the law stated it was up to the Parliament to deal with the situation.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/lucillekeen"], "published": "2015-07-12T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:56:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
