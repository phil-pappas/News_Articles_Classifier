Joe Armao Melbourne, controversy, cold weather and AFL. It all goes hand in hand, doesn't it.\nAnd, boy, has there been plenty of all that lately.\nTake the increasingly big issue of booing Adam Goodes situation . The champion footballer has supporters, like his Sydney Swans chairman and Moelis Australia boss Andrew Pridham who said the booing is racist, and sadly, detractors.\nThe AFL boss Gillon McLachlan has struck some difficulty with an admittedly vexed situation, with AFL folk waiting for him to come out strong on the topic. Luckily on Thursday Gill can set things straight and get on the front foot with a big speech at a sold-out American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) function in Melbourne.\nHe's long been booked for the gig but we bet AmCham are stoked to get Big Gill at a big time for the code. Alas, the event won't be widely covered as the media are not allowed for the \"fireside chat\". (It's cold in Melbourne.) So we'll never know if the crowd boo.\nGill will try to chat to the press afterwards though, but does have a busy schedule.\nMeanwhile, AFL chairman Mike Fitzpatrick , who was spotted heading back towards the Paris end of Collins Street after lunch on Wednesday, is also keeping busy as chair of Treasury Group.\nThe group's sale of its share in RARE Infrastructure for $200 million to Legg Mason was the latest inspiration for boutique managers everywhere, many of whom were excited to note it follows Bill Gross 's new employer Janus Capital Group buying a 25 per cent stake in US fixed-income house Kapstream Capital earlier this year.\n Numerate types were quick to calculate what the deal implies for for founders Richard Elmslie and Nick Langley who are keeping 15 per cent of their fund. That's probably worth about $75 million, on our best guess, based on Treasury having 40 per cent stake as per its last annual report. And for those more focused on property than infrastructure, Langley may be better known as the buyer of a $30 million Leslie Wilkinson -designed house in Sydney's Point Piper last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:38:06.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
