Itâ€™s whats going on in the Chinese markets right now. The worst sell-off today in over 8 years is what has hammered Baidu today going into its June quarter earnings this afternoon after the close of trading. ( i am long BIDU, GOOGL, options)\nThe Chinese authorities came out with a statement a little while ago that they stand ready to buy and support their markets when they open for trade tomorrow. IN other words, their plunge protection team stands ready.\nHowever that is still scary from my point of view. We all know that China is a managed economy and everything about it is tightly planned, regulated and controlled including its vaunted GDP growth and now also its stock market as the world recently found out.\nHaving said that, lets start with how I positioned myself going into tonights earnings. I have owned Baidu for about five and a half years or so now and I consider it one of the best ways to obtain direct exposure to the China growth story, manufactured or not.\nHaving said that here is what I have done to mitigate long only risk going into earnings:\nI have bought at the money (ATM) puts expiring this Friday (weekly puts) in the event that the company disappoints or gets caught up in a continued Chinese market selloff tomorrow were that to occur.\nIn addition, I have also bought slightly out of the money (SOTM) calls expiring the third week of August (aka monthly calls) to offset the cost of the hedges and goose my returns.\nI continue to think that the company will report better than expected results however the nasty selloff in China overnight has me leaning cautious when otherwise I might not have been so.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T23:36:39.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
