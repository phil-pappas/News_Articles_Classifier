Clopton found that Uber had not complied with the state’s laws to ensure all passengers were treated fairly.\nJudge Clopton found Uber had failed to provide:\n● Information on the number and percentage of customers who requested accessible vehicles for wheelchairs and service animals.\n● Information on the number of rides requested and accepted, requested and not accepted, and fees paid, by postcode.\n● Driver safety information, including the cause of any incidents drivers were involved in.\nAn Uber spokeswoman said the ruling and the associated fine were “deeply disappointing.”\nThe Uber app on a mobile phone Source: AFP\n“We will appeal the decision as Uber has already provided substantial amounts of data to the California Public Utilities Commission, information we have provided elsewhere with no complaints,” she said.\n“Going further risks compromising the privacy of individual riders as well as driver-partners. These CPUC requests are also beyond the authority of the Commission and will not improve public safety.”\nUber also faces suspension because of the ruling, but while its appeal is on foot, the suspension will not be enforced.\nOn Thursday morning, Premier Colin Barnett publicly backed Uber, saying he would be happy to use an Uber taxi.\n“The reality that I have to face and the Transport Minister has to face is that people are using it, they find it an alternative service.”\nMr Barnett said the government “would like to somehow bring Uber within the law, maybe that means them adjusting, maybe it means the law adjusting, maybe it means the taxi industry adjusting.”\nHe also said the service would have to “play along” with regulation but that “Uber is here to stay, in one way or another”.\nA spokeswoman said Mr Barnett would not have been aware of the judgement when the comments were made.\nThe Uber spokeswoman welcomed Mr Barnett’s comments.\n“We’re also looking forward to seeing the Government’s Green Paper and moving forward with implementing sensible, safety-based ride-sharing regulations as quickly as possible,” she said.\nTransport Minister Dean Nalder’s office said “No thanks” to commenting on the Californian judgment.\nDuring his interview on ABC, Mr Barnett also confirmed his current term would be his last in parliament.\nColin Barnett: “Uber is here to stay, in one way or another.’’ Source: News Corp Australia\nOriginally published as Uber ‘here to stay’ amid $7.3m fine ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/colin-barnett-will-lead-libs-for-2017-election-backs-uber-taxi-service/story-fnkgde2y-1227444661051?sv=2ecf53a261925f4f820c3401c870ddf8&h=Uber+%26%238216%3Bhere+to+stay%26%238217%3B+amid+%247.3m+fine", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/colin-barnett-will-lead-libs-for-2017-election-backs-uber-taxi-service/story-fnkgde2y-1227444661051?sv=2ecf53a261925f4f820c3401c870ddf8&title=Uber+%26%238216%3Bhere+to+stay%26%238217%3B+amid+%247.3m+fine", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/colin-barnett-will-lead-libs-for-2017-election-backs-uber-taxi-service/story-fnkgde2y-1227444661051?sv=2ecf53a261925f4f820c3401c870ddf8", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Uber+%26%238216%3Bhere+to+stay%26%238217%3B+amid+%247.3m+fine&c=AN+INFLUENTIAL+Australian+has+backed+Uber%2C+saying+it+was+%26%238220%3Bhere+to+stay%26%238217%3B%26%238217%3B+%26%238212%3B+on+the+same+day+the+ride+sharing+service+was+fined+%247.3+million+in+its+home+state.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/colin-barnett-will-lead-libs-for-2017-election-backs-uber-taxi-service/story-fnkgde2y-1227444661051?sv=2ecf53a261925f4f820c3401c870ddf8", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/colin-barnett-will-lead-libs-for-2017-election-backs-uber-taxi-service/story-fnkgde2y-1227444661051?sv=2ecf53a261925f4f820c3401c870ddf8&title=Uber+%26%238216%3Bhere+to+stay%26%238217%3B+amid+%247.3m+fine", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/colin-barnett-will-lead-libs-for-2017-election-backs-uber-taxi-service/story-fnkgde2y-1227444661051?sv=2ecf53a261925f4f820c3401c870ddf8", "http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/colin-barnett-will-lead-libs-for-2017-election-backs-uber-taxi-service/story-fnhocxo3-1227444266944"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T01:28:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
