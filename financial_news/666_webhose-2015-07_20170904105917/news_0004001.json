The combination of poor job prospects and crippling student debt has many millennials are saying “no” to plastic. According to a recent Bankrate.com survey , six in 10 millennials don’t have credit cards . \nIt’s true that some millennials who have credit cards sometimes struggle to pay off the balance every month. Interest, finance charges, and late fees can ratchet up card balances, bringing millennials closer to their credit limits and hurting their credit scores. Yet many millennials who demonstrate responsibility with the best credit cards reap much better credit scores along with major lifetime savings on mortgages, cars, and other big purchases. If you’re a millennial, think twice before swearing off credit cards for good. \nWhy Failing to Build Credit Will Cost You \nAcademically, you probably understand that a good credit score means better interest rates on your purchases. Take a look at what that means for you in real dollars. \nCar Loan \nIf you take out a three-year, $10,000 car loan at 4 percent interest, you’ll ultimately pay $10,628 for your loan. At 6 percent, you’d pay $10,944 for the cost of your loan. In other words, you’d make one additional unnecessary car payment — plus some — simply because you have no credit history. \nMortgage \nA 30-year, $250,000 mortgage at 4 percent ultimately costs $429,674. At 6 percent, the same loan costs $539,595. You’ll pay an extra $109,921 for your home. Your monthly payment for a 4 percent mortgage would be $1,194 as opposed to $1,499 for a 6 percent mortgage, for a difference of $305 per month. \nSuppose you invested the extra $305 in an IRA instead of dumping it into your mortgage. Assuming an 8 percent annual return, you’d have $417,686 in your IRA after 30 years. In other words, a lower credit score means choosing between over $400,000 in the bank or a loss of over $100,000. No investors would choose to lose $100,000 when they could make $400,000 instead. \nNot Everyone Who Has a Credit Card Misuses It \nCertain personal finance gurus push the false assumption that having a credit card is a one-way ticket to financial doom. In truth, although some credit card horror stories are all too real, most people use their cards responsibly. Current Nasdaq statistics paint a far more balanced picture of credit card use in America . \nAs of 2014, just one in three American households carries monthly credit card debt, a drop of 44 percent since 2009. Defaults account for some of the plunge, as do fears of another financial crisis. For whatever reason, two out of three households now pay their balances in full every month. Also, total credit card debt per household has dropped 17 percent in the same period. \nAmericans as a whole are using credit cards more responsibly. Also, thanks to the Credit CARD Act , most college students now carry little credit card debt. The median debt for freshmen is just $47, and the median debt for seniors is just $184. Although credit cards come with certain risks, they’re still a vital way for young adults to build credit. \nPitfalls to Avoid \nCertain households and demographics still struggle to manage their cards, particularly households that rely on credit cards as financial safety nets. For instance, households in which at least one member had no health insurance between 2009 and 2012 were 20 percent more likely to have credit card debt. These households often charge staples, like food, utilities, and housing, to their credit cards. You should never open a credit card account if you can’t afford your staples every month. \nOn the other hand, if you’re making a decent income, and you’ll pay the balance in full every month, choosing not to have a credit card makes little financial sense. Just as not every person who drinks alcohol is an alcoholic, not every credit card holder is on a slippery slope toward indebtedness. Rejecting credit cards may seem like a good financial decision today, but it will cost you down the line. \nLike it or not, there’s no more efficient way to improve your credit than getting a credit card and using it wisely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T01:06:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
