Tuesday, July 21, 2015 10:00AM IST (4:30AM GMT) Check Your 'Love-o-Meter' Says Monster.com New Delhi, Delhi, India \nPaul Grahm in his essay ‘How to do what you love’ said, “Finding work you love is very difficult. Most people fail. Even if you succeed, it’s rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or forties. But if you have the destination in sight you’ll be more likely to arrive at it.” The essence thus, is to keep looking for the work you love. A recent poll by Monster.com further validates this belief that finding work you love is not easy. The poll reveals that 56% of respondents have been unable to find a job that meets their passion. In today’s age there are two types of job seekers - one for whom compensation is the criteria for job satisfaction and the other who pursue their passion to make careers; irrespective of pay. The revelation from Monster’s poll is that the first segment is only a meager 17 percent as compared to the latter (83 percent). Interestingly, there still exists a 14 percent who are unsure of their passion. For those who are not sure of where their passion lies, there is a quick exercise at the bottom at the end of the article. In order to bring more happiness in work and more integration of passion with work life, Monster.com has launched ‘Love What You Do’ - a campaign that aims at provoking and inspiring people to love what they do and pursue their passion in their jobs ( http://goo.gl/YpkOn3 .
