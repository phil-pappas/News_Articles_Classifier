These facilities are providing significant additional supply to the 1.8 million customers served by National Grid in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island. \nThe New York Bay Expansion is designed to deliver an additional 115,000 dekatherms a day of natural gas into National Grid’s distribution system through the Rockaway Delivery Lateral and the Narrows meter station. That’s enough gas to meet the needs of 500,000 homes and will supply National Grid’s immediate and growing needs for the 2017/2018 winter. \n“A reliable and resilient supply of energy is critical to the local New York and Long Island communities we serve,” said Ken Daly, President, National Grid New York. “Williams’ New York Bay Expansion project will help ensure affordable, cleaner, safe, reliable, secure and stable energy to meet our customers’ needs and support the region’s economic vitality.” \nThe New York Bay Expansion Project, which is estimated to cost as much as $130 million, will include installation of additional horsepower at three existing Transco compressor facilities, in addition to uprating Transco’s existing Lower New York Bay lateral and replacing approximately 0.25 miles of 42-inch pipe in Middlesex County, New Jersey. The project will also include modifications to existing Transco meter and regulator stations in Middlesex County, New Jersey, Chester County, Pennsylvania and Richmond County, New York. The work is confined to existing company property or rights of ways. \n“Demand for natural gas in New York City and other major markets continues to grow as customers recognize its value as a clean, affordable and abundant energy source,” said Rory Miller, senior vice president of Williams Partners’ Atlantic-Gulf operating area. “Our extensive footprint in North America gives Williams a strategic advantage to leverage across existing infrastructure to meet emerging needs. Whether it’s incremental growth like the New York Bay Expansion or large-scale organic projects, our focus as a premier natural gas infrastructure provider is connecting the best supplies with high-value markets.” \nTransco, the nation’s largest-volume and fastest-growing interstate natural gas pipeline system, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Williams Partners L.P. ( WPZ ), of which Williams owns 60 percent, including the general-partner interest. Transco delivers natural gas to customers through its 10,200-mile pipeline network whose mainline extends nearly 1,800 miles between South Texas and New York City. The system is a major provider of cost-effective natural gas services that reach U.S. markets in 12 Southeast and Atlantic Seaboard states, including major metropolitan areas in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. \nAbout Williams \nWilliams ( WMB ) is a premier provider of large-scale infrastructure connecting North American natural gas and natural gas products to growing demand for cleaner fuel and feedstocks.
