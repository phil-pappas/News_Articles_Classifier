The PPIs will be reloadable instruments, subject to an outstanding limit of Rs 2,000 at any point of time.\nApart from the mass transit system, the instrument can be used at other merchants whose activities are allied to or are carried on within the premises of the transit system, RBI said.\nRBI said the migration of micro- and small-value cash payments can play a significant role in achieving the vision of a cashless society.\n“One such area where a large number of small-value cash payments take place relates to mass transit systems,” it said.\nThe semi-closed PPIs, it said, will be issued by the mass transit system operator (PPI-MTS) after authorisation under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act.\n“The PPI-MTS will necessarily contain the Automated Fare Collection application related to the transit service to qualify as PPI-MTS,” read the guidelines.\nHowever, no cash-out or refund will be permitted from these PPIs, the central bank added. Furthermore, the issuer may decide on the desired level of KYC, if any, for such PPIs.\nFor Updates Check Banking News ; follow us on Facebook and Twitter\n 09, 2015 10:11 pm", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress", "http://twitter.com/financialxpress"], "published": "2015-07-10T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:34:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
