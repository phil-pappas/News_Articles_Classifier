All these recent critiques coming from different ideological quarters (different, but yet so similar), at a time of frank internal reflection and evaluation on challenges facing the Alliance, and after a number of important Tripartite Alliance gatherings, including the Alliance Summit, the SACP's 3rd Special National Congress and COSATU's Special National Congress, all of which pledged the necessity of strengthening unity, to ensure that our differences do not get in the way of \"working together in common action to realise the objectives of the National Democratic Revolution\". \nThe recent flow of anti-SACP articles, including Bell's tongue-in-cheek critique, all have similarities, including a clear agenda of attempting to spread division amongst the ranks of the Alliance, of predicting outcomes and \"splits\" from the sidelines, of promoting and publishing individual personalities to spite organisations based on collective principles and generally being void of any real analytical thinking in terms of the outcome, decisions and resolutions of these recent historic gatherings. \nWhat is most significant in Bell's piece, albeit slightly camouflaged, is the narrow trend of diluting and belittling everything the Party does, to a state power debate. For a \"labour columnist\" to resort to this trend without even considering the resolutions decided upon at the SACP's Special Congress, quite clearly points to Bell's personal alignment with the exasperated anti-SACP, anti-alliance and anti-Government narrative. \nPerhaps it is time, therefore, to ensure that young and upcoming political writers and analysts do not become confused and disgruntled \"Fukuyamists of the left\" and are equally not overly influenced by witty tabloid pieces, but instead form their own objective ideas and focus their energy on the content and context of historic events and decisions. \nAs for the SACP, Mr Bell, the palest pink/red of our flag (and t-shirt) is a result of ninety-four years of tireless and dedicated unbroken struggle in serving the working class. \nMitchell is SACP Western Cape 2nd Deputy Provincial Secretary.
