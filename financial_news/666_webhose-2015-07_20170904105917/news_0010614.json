There were two options: an improvement of the proposals, or temporary 'Grexit',\" said the source, who had seen the paper. \nHardline Germany is leading a chorus of scepticism as eurozone finance ministers study leftist Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's new reform plan for a third rescue package worth more than 80 billion euros ($89 billion). \nThe European source was commenting on a report in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper that said the plans appeared in a one-page German finance ministry \"position paper\" which was handed to other member states. \nThe new Greek proposals for a third bailout \"lack areas of important reforms,\" which is why they cannot serve as the basis for a new three-year bailout programme, the ministry reportedly said. \nIt urged Greece to quickly improve its reform proposals and seek parliamentary support for a fund to sell 50 billion euros in financial instruments to reduce the debt burden. \nIf not, the paper said, Greece should leave the 19-country eurozone for at least five years and restructure its debt while remaining a member of the 28-nation European Union and receiving humanitarian aid and other support. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T02:27:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
