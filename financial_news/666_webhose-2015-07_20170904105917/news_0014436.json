A 'No' to a vision of the eurozone as a boundless iron cage for its people,\" he said. \nHowever, Germany's Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said new negotiations with Greece are \"difficult to imagine\" after the No vote . \nGreece's Interior Minister Nikos Voutsis said turnout was over 50% and voting took place with \"only a minor amount of problematic behaviour\". \nDefence Minister Panos Kammenos tweeted that the Greeks \"proved they don't bow to blackmail, to threats\". \nEU leaders have previously warned a No vote could push Greece out of the euro - forcing a return of its drachma currency. \nMr Tsipras spoke with French President Francois Hollande on the phone as 'No' campaigners celebrated their victory. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to fly to Paris tomorrow for urgent talks with Mr Hollande. \n\"The talks with the French president from 6.30pm and over dinner will be about a common assessment of the situation after the Greek referendum and the continuation of the close German-French cooperation on this subject,\" said a spokesman for Mrs Merkel. \nMr Tsipras had indicated he would step down if the Greek people voted Yes - showing they are in favour of budget cuts and tax increases in return for more financial aid. \nGreece's creditors had asked for major reforms and spending cuts in exchange for extending its bailout deal until November in an offer worth several billion euros. \nWhen talks between the government and creditors collapsed last week, the extension was refused and the bailout ended as scheduled on 30 June. \nGreeks have therefore been voting on an offer which is no longer on the table. \nMany shoppers have been panic buying from supermarkets - purchasing essentials such as pasta and flour - as the country's fate unfolds. \nOn Friday, Greece was officially declared in default by the European Financial Stability Facility - days after the nation fell into arrears with the IMF. \nBanks across the country have been closed over the past week, with customers only able to withdraw €60 a day from cash machines. \nEarlier, when Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis arrived at a polling station in Athens, he was asked by Sky News why people should believe his claim that banks will re-open on Tuesday when they are running out of money. \nHe replied: \"You're spoiling a celebration of democracy with your impertinent questions.\" \nExperts say Greece's banks will not be able to open unless they receive further cash from the EU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T23:31:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
