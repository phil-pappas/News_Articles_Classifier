The economy’s growth potential rate would be more like 1.5 percent if Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government delivered on a full package of structural reforms, Ganelli said in an interview on Wednesday.\nHe highlighted progress in female participation in the labor force, while emphasizing that adjustments to the tax system could encourage more women into employment and foreign workers may be the solution to ease shortages in some industries.\nA middle ground was also needed between the rigid system for permanent workers and the insecure job contracts used for temporary workers. said Ganelli. Inequality in both compensation and employment security is a problem for Japan, he said.\nHe and his colleagues at the IMF are watching changes to Japan’s corporate governance regime with great interest. Ganelli said increasing the sway of shareholders with the companies they invest in is vital to ensure that corporate Japan puts its cash hoard to productive use.\nOutlook Change The IMF’s medium-term estimate for economic growth in Japan was close to 1 percent last year, before being cut to about 0.65 in April.\nAbe came to power in 2012, with a three-part plan to boost government spending, unleash monetary stimulus and bring structural reform to the economy. The first two of these so-called three arrows have been fired. Economists are debating the progress of structural reform.\n“A lot has been achieved in terms of Abenomics,” said Ganelli. “There is a room to do more. Basically, all the three arrows should be fired.”\nThe government should promote so called gentei seishain labor contracts that offer a similar level of job security to traditional permanent positions without the same kinds of rotations through multiple departments and locations, he said.\nA lack of legal clarity so far on gentei seishain contracts means that companies are hesitating to make more use of them, he said.", "external_links": ["https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=64&pr.y=8&sy=2012&ey=2019&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=158&s=NGDP_RPCH&grp=0&a=\\"], "published": "2015-07-30T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T00:41:28.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
