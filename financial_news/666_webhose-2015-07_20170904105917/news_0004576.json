It is an exercise in futility. It is void ab-initio. It is nothing more than a photo opportunity. These are the same people who said that terror and talks cannot go hand in hand, these are the same people who called off talks after Pakistani High Commissioner met Hurriyat. What has really changed?…. This meeting is an absolutely unprecedented disaster,” Tewari told ANI.\nPrime Minister Modi will hold bilateral talks with Sharif on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Ufa, Russia today.\nAccording to reports, Prime Minister Modi will, during the talks, strongly raise India’s concerns on terror and the release of Lakhavi with Pakistan.\nThe meeting between the Prime Ministers of both countries comes a day after Pakistani troops had fired at a Border Security Force forward post in Kashmir, killing a jawan. This was the second such incident in the past week.\n 10, 2015 10:28 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T01:35:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
