He also argued the law should give only the NPC Standing Committee the authority to shut down the Internet. \nShen Yi, a professor of international politics at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the government has already shown it will cut Internet access, so the proposed law is simply putting that power in writing. \nOfficials in the far western region of Xinjiang shut down the Internet amid unrest in Urumqi in July 2009. That violence involved clashes over several days between Han Chinese and Uygurs, a minority group that speaks a Turkic language and follows Islam. The Internet blackout lasted 10 months, the longest China has ever seen. \nThe draft law requires Internet service providers to help authorities maintain national security and assist in criminal investigations. It also restates a rule the legislature announced in 2012 requiring companies offering social media services to know the real identities of users. \nThe latter requirement is not necessary because Internet service providers and the government can already tell who is using the Net, Wang said. Lawmakers would be better served if they tried to strike a balance between control of the Internet and the protection of privacy and right to freedom of communication, he said. \n\"People using the Internet should not be forced to feel like they are standing naked in front of service providers and regulators,\" Wang said \n(Rewritten by Li Rongde) Proposed Law Gives Gov't Too Much Control of Internet, Experts Say Clauses of draft cybersecurity legislation criticized as vague, especially when it comes to when authorities can shut down Net access By staff reporter Zhao Fuduo and intern reporter Song Baoling SHARE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T17:37:38.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
