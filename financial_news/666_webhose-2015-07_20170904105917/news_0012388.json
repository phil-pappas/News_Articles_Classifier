Such bargains have become harder to find after the stock market’s strong performance over the past six years. \nBut Mr Dixon, who runs the GLG Undervalued Assets fund, views market falls, like those experienced this week as investors fretted over Greece, as an opportunity to buy the shares he rates more cheaply. \nHere he identifies some of his targets and gives his number one rule for identifying what to avoid. \n= What do you look for in an out-of-favour share? = \nMy number one safety check is to look at how much money is produced by the company after all costs have been accounted for, shown by the net cash flow figure. I will not buy when the figure is negative. Such businesses have too much debt and shareholders often end up paying the price, in the form of a dividend cut, unless the management team can take action themselves. \nWhen we buy out-of-favour shares we first look at how cheap the shares are versus their peers. Then we examine the business and make a call on whether they can overcome their problems and become more profitable. As a sanity check I want to see that the problems are cyclical, related to the business cycle and the economy, rather than signs of structural issues in the company itself. \n= Greece is dominating the headlines at the moment and sending stock markets lower. How are you playing it? = \nFor my investment style the volatility we have seen this week opens up more buying opportunities. For the stocks that I like I am happy to buy more at a lower price, particularly the smaller firms outside the FTSE 100, which tend to sell off more aggressively in a downturn. One share I am monitoring and happy to buy on dips is Thomas Cook. \n= Over six years the FTSE All Share index has returned 66pc. Do any bargains remain? = \nOn the main valuation measure I look at, called the “price to replacement” cost, which compares the market value of a company with what it would cost to recreate its business, only 25pc of British shares are cheap. Six years ago around three quarters of the market was in bargain territory. \nBut there are plenty of opportunities. The oil sector is one and I have been adding to my holdings in Dragon Oil (LSE: DGO.L - news ) and Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) . I would like to buy more oil shares but the cash flow of other businesses is frankly not good enough. By contrast, half of Dragon Oil’s market value is accounted for by its cash. \nBanks are the other sector I regard as cheap. Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) , for instance, is trading at a discount to the value of its assets. I have also recently been buying Amlin (LSE: AML.L - news ) , the insurer; it has a p/e of 10 and a yield of 6pc. This is a business that will benefit when interest rates rise as it holds a substantial amount of short-dated bonds, which are earning next to nothing. \n= Which shares have you been selling? = \nEighteen months ago I held 15pc of the fund in European shares, but this is now 5pc. We buy European shares that are cheaper than their UK-listed peers. This is why we bought Belgian Post and CTT, the privatised Portuguese postal system. At the time they were cheaper than Royal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) . The most recent share I have sold is Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) , the house-builder. I still like the sector, owning Bovis Homes (LSE: BVS.L - news ) , but Taylor Wimpey has simply become too expensive compared with its peers. \n= Which shares do you tend to avoid? = \nUtility and pharmaceutical shares do not generate enough cash, so these are two sectors that I am avoiding. I have also resisted buying the food retailers. It has been well documented that the supermarkets are going cheap, but I am not buying. I worry about the value of Tesco’s business given that it has outlined plans to sell some of its property assets. \n= Do you invest your own money in the fund? = \nYes, and so does my wife. My two children also invest in the fund, but they don’t know it yet. \n= What would you have done if you hadn’t become a fund manager? = \nI took cricket reasonably seriously and would have loved to play the game professionally. \n= OUR VIEW = \nThe GLG Undervalued Assets fund has been around only since November 2013 but is popular with brokers and financial advisers. \nBen Willis, of Whitechurch Securities, the wealth manager, said Mr Dixon has had success running essentially the same fund since 2008 at a company called Matterley, which he co-founded. \nAndrew Johnston, an analyst at Square Mile, the fund rating firm, is also a fan, but cautioned that the fund’s investment style might unsettle the more cautious saver. \n“Because the fund invests where others fear to tread it will look and act very differently from other UK growth funds,” he said. \n“Although this can lead to impressive periods of outperformance, there is also the propensity for it to struggle when this investment style is out of favour.” \n• Share (Frankfurt: 5CI.F - news ) tips: three cheap 'under-the-radar' income shares \n• See all our investment stories on your Facebook (NasdaqGS: FB - news ) page like us at facebook.com/telegraphinvesting \nArtemis UK Special Situations and Fidelity Special Situations are viewed as two alternative funds worth considering. \nMr Johnston said that he held the contrarian investors who manage the funds, Derek Stuart and Alex Wright respectively, in high regard. \nMr Willis tipped Miton UK Value Opportunities as an alternative. The fund is managed by George Godber and Georgina Hamilton, two of Mr Dixon’s former colleagues at Matterley. \nLee Robertson, of wealth manager Investment Quorum, tipped Neptune UK Opportunities . \n= How to buy the fund as cheaply as possible = \nThe fund has a total cost (the “OCF” or “TER”) of 0.98pc a year. Be sure to buy the right “share class”, which is “C”. The investment shop through which you buy the fund will also levy a charge. Some will charge a percentage of the amount invested, others will apply a flat annual fee.
