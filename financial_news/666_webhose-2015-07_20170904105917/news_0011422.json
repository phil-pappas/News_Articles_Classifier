Photo: David Ramos\nI arrived back in Australia in the past week having spent some 10 days in the northern hemisphere, three of them in Spain. I've made many good friends there over the years through my time in advertising and the arts.\nThe history of Spain reaches right around the world from the days when it sought global domination on every habitable continent except ours.\nWe were a near miss however, when Luis Vaz de Torres passed between New Guinea and Cape York in 1606 along a narrow stretch of water which was later named the Torres Strait.\nIllustration: Cathy Wilcox\nAnd that was more than 100 years after Christopher Columbus headed out from Barcelona and found what's been called the \"New World\" â€“ the Americas.\nPity he didn't stay a bit longer in the Bahamas where he first landed. His considerable wealth might have got a boost from tax arrangements that eventually succeeded him.\nToday Spain has the 13th largest GDP in the world, which makes it about the same size as Australia but with a population of 46 million.\nAnd it's fast becoming a \"new world\" of growth itself. The Spaniards copped the GFC like everyone else but finally, after seven years of stagnation, the European Central Bank has announced it has a very respectable growth of 2.8 per cent.\n\"But that's stronger than ours,\" Louise says.\nDespite its unemployment rate still being high it's dropping significantly and is now one of the fastest growing countries in the EU.\nThe Spanish recovery is attributed to banking and labour reforms and protection of family businesses. Consumer confidence is now at a record high.\nOn its track out of serious financial crisis, Spain imitated Germany by focusing on exports aided significantly by the labour reforms that made employment conditions more flexible.\nWe could certainly learn something from its experience in its booming tourism industry in particular. Talk to the cafe owner in Double Bay who has to pay 300 per cent loading for Sunday work. How stupid are we?\nSpain has created 25,000 new jobs alone with Spanish-based car manufacturers. Even Mercedes-Benz has opened a factory.\nThe Spanish story is a good one. It says, just like I reported on Britain last week, you need to get tough and smart. We worry about immigrants in Australia but Spain has 6 million of them.\nIn 2005, they granted an amnesty to 700,000 migrants who were working in Spain but did not grant them permanent residency.\nThe move boosted their tax take by $200 million because they turned three-quarters of a million illegal arrivals working in the black economy into regular taxpayers.\nSpain faced its border and immigration problems with humanity, understanding and pragmatism. And as a result, a new legal population of enthusiastic workers who contribute to the common good has further boosted its continuing economic growth.\nWe keep worrying about Greece and the Greek debt but I think we make too much of it given that the first repayment it missed to the IMF a couple of weeks ago, was half the amount that Australia spends on pet food every year.\nIt's just not a big deal for us and we should stop wringing our hands about things that just don't matter in the big scheme of things. It just becomes a drain on confidence.\nSpain is a great story about pulling back from the abyss and building confidence.\nIt's a story that also gives us an opportunity to learn something about the role real estate can play in wealth generation AND depletion.\nSpain had a massive real estate boom in the 10 years up to 2007 that led to huge levels of debt.\nWhen the global financial crisis finally popped the property bubble in 2009, Spain officially entered recession with very harsh consequences for its people and many of its businesses including the financial sector. The housing market crash nearly took the entire banking industry with it.\nIt's a salutatory lesson for us. Concern about our high housing prices here is real. Perhaps our government should have a good look at Spanish history if it is serious about leading us into a \"new world\".\nWe still have much to learn from a region that some still stupidly call \" the old world\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:51:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
