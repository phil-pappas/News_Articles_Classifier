They were sitting on bubbles and everyone knew it. They were highly leveraged.\nAll of these things are true, but they should be dragon-like warnings to investors everywhere — or should I say black swan alerts?\nThe reason why the Chinese market crash is threatening is for reasons you can’t measure. As John Maynard Keynes said in the 1930s, it’s the “animal spirits” you can’t gauge.\nWhat are animal spirits? Irrational exuberance. Unbridled optimism. The belief that you should borrow to the hilt to buy stocks because there’s no tomorrow.\nWe’ve seen this herd run over a cliff before: the 1920s, 1999, 2007. Almost routinely, all the usual experts are telling us that stocks are not overpriced at the time and there’s room to grow.\nBut you need to look at the evidence to see what classic behaviors trigger market crashes. Here are some observations from Michael Zhuang of MZ Capital Management in Washington, DC.\nThe stock market crash there just vaporized $3 trillion worth of investor wealth, all within a month. 99% of those investors are domestic Chinese investors.\nAccording to a Goldman Sachs research, Chinese investors are highly leveraged. By some estimate, a 30% loss in market index could translate into a 60% loss to the average investor.\nThe growth engine for the Chinese economy is domestic consumption, not export or investment any more. Domestic consumption has been growing 10% a year in the past few years, you bet it’s going to be affected by the market crash.\nThere are 90 million stock investors in China, larger than the entire communist party membership.\nChinese investors are panicking, fearful, resentful, restless. As they have been conditioned to believe in the party, now they are blaming the party for their losses.\nThe specter of massive single issue social unrest can not be ruled out. China is the second largest economy in the world, and the biggest growth engine, should a massive unrest breakout, the effect will reverberate across the Pacific.\nBefore the recent 30% tumble, the Chinese market has gone up 150%. Even after this massive tumble, it’s still up about 70% from a year ago. So maybe not all investors lost money.\nThe Chinese stock market, like its internet, is walled in. Foreign investors can only invest in Chinese shares in the Hong Kong market, which is much more mature and stable. This has the effect of containing the economic disaster within China.\n“In summary,” Zhuang concludes, “the situation in China bears close watching. The economic impact on us is limited, but fear can not be walled in, fear could spread to other Asian markets and even to our shores. Should that happen, remember what FDR said: “The only thing to fear is fear itself.”\nWhen it comes to the contagion of fear in the markets, there are no international border police. The next market rout will move at the speed of light around the globe.\nPage 1 / 4 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071815473", "http://www.mzcap.com/about_us.htm"], "published": "2015-07-10T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T14:35:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
