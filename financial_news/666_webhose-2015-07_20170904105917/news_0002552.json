Whether it is technology or any other aspect of human life change is the only constant to embrace and rely on. That reality will be clear from a simple example. Decades ago chalk markers were extensively used in the industry. These are still not out of favor but slowly going down the pecking order of workmen as far marking is concerned.  are the latest ‘movers and shakers' in the industry and getting increasing favor from the workmen in need of them.  A new pack of liquid chalks descended from the den of All That Jazz NY Group and as per reports in the recent times the users are exuberant about its quality. Every brand claims they bring the best but now it seems that \"real best has finally arrived\" said one of the users. Words spread quickly and more and more of the potential buyers are allegedly hopping onto the bandwagon. Liquid varieties are markedly different from ordinary chalks and won hearts of users as soon as they arrived in the market. \n are more versatile in the sense that they can be used on a variety of hard surfaces including LED board mirrors glasses wooden frame etc for the purpose of marking. The former type is more prominent and comes in a variety of colors helping the users choose the right one that will make marking clearer and brighter on a pitch-dark surface. The best part of them is they don't leave the medium cluttered like their ordinary chalk counterparts. \nThe American company has chosen Amazon.com for promoting their product that is currently available with a host of offers including gift wraps. If the intending users purchase the pack now they will have get 25% less. However that offer is subject to use of promo code IW6U58TL. The brand was always sure of enjoying customers' satisfaction and even went ahead to announce an offer of ‘full money back' if the users are satisfied but less than 100%. They have also promised delivery without any shipping charge for an order valuing more than 35. \nAt the time it was unveiled officially at a press conference the company professionals highlighted several plus points. One of them is about ‘pull and flip' feature that facilitates its use. The chief officer for marketing explains that its width provides ultra comfort to the users. If width is too much the users find it hard to grip it and that uneasiness often leads to aching and other problems. She mentions that the company has brainstormed ‘Reversible Tip' and assures high quality resin as well as pigment used in ink will not create any bad effect like rash or odor. \nAbout GlowShark\nGlowShark is the company that distributes  a Top Quality Erasable Markers.
