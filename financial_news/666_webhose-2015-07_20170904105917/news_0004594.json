The euro fell 0.6 percent on Wednesday to $1.1075, while the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was little changed. Greek bonds fell for a fourth day, although Italian and Spanish debt extended a rally amid hopes Greece would be able to reach a deal, or that the ECB would act to protect other markets.\nThe leaders of all 28 European Union countries will meet in Brussels on Sunday to decide their response to Greece’s proposals. The ECB, which on Wednesday said it was leaving unchanged its level of aid to Greek banks, will meet next Monday to consider its own next moves.\nSunday’s gathering may represent the climax of the five-year effort to contain Greece’s debts, which exceed 170 percent of gross domestic product. A departure from the euro would represent a severe blow to the currency, which was designed to be irrevocable, and to the broader European project.\nStomach Reforms Securing a deal with creditors will almost certainly require Tsipras and his Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, to stomach reforms it has resisted since coming to power in January. Greek voters emphatically rejected a program of spending cuts and tax hikes in exchange for a new bailout in a July 5 referendum.\nOn Wednesday, Greece put the first formal steps of its latest plea for a bailout into motion with a letter to the European Stability Mechanism, the body that co-ordinates financial assistance to member states.\nAfter months of often-contentious interactions with creditors, the document signed by the new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, struck a relatively conciliatory tone. It said Greece planned to honor all its debts and introduce tax and pension reforms as soon as next week. Although the document was thin on details, pension cuts had previously been characterized by Tsipras as one of the “red lines” Greece would not cross.\nThe ESM has begun the formal process of reviewing the request, which will be followed by more detailed proposals by the end of Thursday. Greek banks will remain closed this wek and on Monday to stem withdrawals, which are capped at 60 euros per person per day, causing long lines at cash machines.\n“Should the Greek proposals be found wanting, the Europeans will go for Grexit quickly, instead of letting the country slowly slide into ‘Grexit by stealth,’” Gilles Moec, chief European economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in London, wrote in a note to clients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:27:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
