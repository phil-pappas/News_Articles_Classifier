Michele Mossop Share on twitter by Tony Boyd The Boao Forum for Asia's Sydney Conference is providing those caught up in the sharemarket-induced pessimism about China good reason to consider the country's long-term upside potential. Showing his penchant for looking over the horizon, Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens said capital markets should prepare for a world where China invests $400 billion a year offshore .\nThat portfolio investment will mainly find its way into Asia. Stevens said that could test the \"depth and quality\" of regional capital markets and called for better regulation of financial markets. He said it also posed problems for Chinese authorities in sequencing the opening process and said they had to be \"pragmatic and opportunistic\".\nStevens was speaking on the same panel as KC Chan, secretary of the Treasury of Hong Kong, who predicted the recent volatility of the Shanghai stock exchange would not stop China opening up its capital markets. \"From Hong Kong's perspective, we see the current volatility as part of an emerging market situation. Investors are taking higher risk and taking high leverage. Chinese regulators are also improving regulation in shadow banking and margin financing sector,\" Mr Chan said.\n\"They are making good effort into that, and I do not think recent volatility will slow down financial markets opening, which is very important and very well understood by Chinese leadership.\"\nAustralian business is getting its mind around these big picture issues as shown by comments made to Chanticleer on Thursday by Henderson Group chief executive Andrew Formica from London, who said Henderson's board is watching developments in China's capital markets and trying to position the company to take advantage of the long-term opportunities that will flow from China's deregulation and opening of its capital markets.\nHenderson's Asian funds management team is based in Singapore but the company has opened an office in China. This week it appointed the former head of Macquarie Capital Asia, Kalpana Desai, to its board as a non-executive director. She is based in Hong Kong and has worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BZW, Schroders and Coopers & Lybrand. Boards have an obligation to their shareholders to be familiar with the risks and opportunities presented by China for the simple reason that its power and influence in global markets will inevitably increase.\nDon't underestimate China Global fund manager AllianceBernstein this week released a report highlighting the potential dangers from underestimating \"China's extraordinary capacity to marshal its social and economic resources in the pursuit of policy objectives\".\n The report, written by Hayden Briscoe, Anthony Chan and Stuart Rae, listed six likely disruptive changes from reform. The first three were the use of the renminbi expanding to account for nearly half of the country's global trade settlements, GDP growth falling to 5 to 6 per cent, with a larger proportion of consumer demand, and the inclusion of China's indices in global market indices taking China's share of emerging market equity indices from 20 per cent to 30per cent.\nThe rest were the maturing of China's capital markets, including growth in local pension funds, China moving up the manufacturing supply chain and the creation of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, which will challenge the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. That last disruptive force was a topic of discussion at the Boao Forum in Sydney. The chief executive of the Asian Strategy & Leadership Institute, Tan Sri Michael O.K. Yeoh, said China was under-represented in global multi-lateral groups which were dominated by the United States, Japan and Europe. He said the AIIB was an essential addition to the investing framework in Asia given the forecast showing ASEAN needs about $US9 trillion in infrastructure investment.\nAustralia is well positioned to take advantage of the increase in China's international investment forecast by Stevens.\nAndrew Forrest , who co-chairs the Australia China Senior Business Leaders Forum and is chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, which met at the Boao Forum this week, is focused on the opportunities in Northern Australia.\nStrong support for closer ties with China Forrest dismissed the recent xenophobia in relation to the Australia-China free trade agreement. Former Australian ambassador to China and FMG director, Geoff Raby, said the latest survey by the Lowy Institute showed strong Australian support for closer links with China.\nForrest said the SBLF conversations at the Boao Forum in Sydney had demonstrated the value of the \"dynamic and open discussion that this group can lead\". \"We have covered topics of critical importance to China and Australia's shared future, providing both thought leadership and pragmatic commercial input to the ongoing development of the bilateral relationships between our two countries.\"\nChina will play a leading role in the transition of the Australian economy from a resources reliant economy to one that is increasingly reliant on the services sector. Analysis published this month by HSBC's chief economist Paul Bloxham found the services sector was getting significant support from rising demand from Asia, particularly China.\n\"Although resources dominate the value of Australia's exports and will continue to do so, it is worth keeping in mind that services are a larger share of value-added and are likely to have a larger impact on the domestic economy than the resources sector,\" he said. \"Estimates from the RBA, based on numbers from the World-Input-Output-Database, reveal that although services have only accounted for 22 per cent of the value of Australia's exports in recent years, they accounted for 41 per cent on a value-added basis, which is little ahead of resources exports.\"\nTourists drive growth Bloxham said tourists from China are driving growth in tourism exports .\n\"Chinese visitors now make up around 13 per cent of total visitor arrivals, up from 6 per cent in 2009,\" he said. \"Arrivals from China over the 12months to May 2014 were 21 per cent higher than over the previous year. The increase in Chinese arrivals reflects the increased propensity of Chinese people to travel. Chinese visits to Australia have increased to 920,000 over the past year, from 370,000 five years ago.\"\nBut the real numbers to focus on are the total Chinese outbound tourism in 2014 of 109 million people. About a million jobs would be created in Australia if Chinese tourists matched their travel plans to their stated preferences which rank Australia highly in many areas, according to research by a major listed company.\nBloxham Quote: d recent work by the RBA suggested that demand for leisure tourism from China generated $1.9billion in export receipts in 2013-14 and has accounted for half of the growth in Australia's leisure travel exports over the past decade. This could rise to $4.4 billion by 2022-23, according to Tourism Australia.\nMr Stevens said China's move to create the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was a sign of \"leadership and engagement\". Australia has joined the AIIB but Japan and the US are wary of it.\nHe said a lot of progress had been made since the global financial crisis in improving coordination between financial regulators in Asia but it was still \"a journey\".\nAt the same panel discussion KC Chan, secretary of the Treasury of Hong Kong, predicted the volatility of the Shanghai stock exchange would not stop China opening up its capital markets but it had exposed weaknesses in financial regulation in the country. \"I don't see it slowing down financial market deregulation.\"\nHuman resources still safe If the experience of Caltex is any guide, abandoning traditional performance reviews will not mean the death of the human resources department.\nCaltex got rid of its performance review system last year and started a new system from January 1.\nThe company told Chanticleer the old system was bureaucratic, unproductive and uninspiring. The performance ratings for individuals was out of five. But the company found if you rated someone a 3, they acted like a 3 and not a 5.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-30T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:11:21.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
