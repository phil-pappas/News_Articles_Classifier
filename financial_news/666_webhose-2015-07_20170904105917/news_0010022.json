Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Christopher Joye Following The Australian Financial Review 's critique last week Westpac has been forced to improve the margin on its new non-voting, perpetual equity \"hybrid\" called Westpac Capital Notes III (ASX: WBCPF), which is being peddled to mums and dads. Yet the prospective $1 billion-plus deal could still be a dud and buyers should beware any brokers, bankers and advisers recommending it if they're receiving lucrative commissions from Westpac of up to 1 per cent (or 100 basis points) on every cent invested.\n\"Westpac was doing initial soundings on a margin around the 3.8 per cent to 4 per cent over bank bills,\" says Matt Christensen, director of the financial advisory firm Hill Capital. That equated to a total cash return of between 5.94 per cent and 6.04 per cent, given a 2.14 per cent bank bill swap rate, which compares poorly to the current grossed-up dividend yield on Westpac's voting equity of 7.7 per cent.\nLast week this column argued that the mooted return made it a \"dud\" with no issue concession or discount to peer securities, which is standard in institutional equity and debt land. NAB, for example, offered $5.5 billion of voting shares recently at an attractive 16.7 per cent discount to the prevailing price.\nThe history of hybrids over the past few years has been that banks have sold them at uber-expensive levels through commission-incented channels to mums and duds who cannot price them properly. And since a dear hybrid for you translates into cheap funding for the bank, they have issued excessively large volumes that have typically left a long overhang that weighs down secondary pricing.\nFair value today could look expensive tomorrow. This has meant investors have been hammered once the hybrids start trading. The $1.3 billion and $3 billion of retail money that went into Westpac and CBA's 2014 hybrids are currently sitting on capital losses of 5.4 per cent (ASX: WBCPE) and 6.4 per cent (ASX: CBAPD) respectively, which wipes out most of their income return.\n\"As a result of the AFR's analysis last week there was clearly investor resistance and Westpac was forced to push up the margin a solid 20 basis points to between 4.0 per cent to 4.2 per cent,\" Hill Capital's Christensen says. That implies we've boosted the total cash return investors get to between 6.14 per cent and 6.34 per cent. With no commission!\nAnnoyed While we were overwhelmed with positive feedback from institutions and advisers, Westpac's treasurer Curt Zuber was telling anyone who would listen how annoyed he was by this turn of events. But that's totally understandable: Zuber's job is to ensure Westpac can raise equity at the cheapest price possible, which conflicts directly with the interests of investors buying securities off him. (I understand some brokers on the deal were also annoyed we dared to question its value.)\n Yet I still have problems with the pricing and the communication of the hybrid's risks. First, I've seen brokers sending clients promotional emails spruiking the deal with no disclosure in the email that they're receiving commissions of 0.8 per cent to 1.1 per cent from Westpac (other than noting they're one of the transaction managers).\nAnd Westpac has appointed every man and their dog to flog the hybrid, including CBA, ANZ, NAB, UBS, Morgans, JP Morgan, Deustche Bank, Macquarie Bank, and Ord Minnett. If you received an email from any of these groups (many people I know were inundated), they are likely getting commissions. I understand Westpac is also offering financial advice groups 1 per cent commissions, so you should check whether your counterparty is conflicted.\nSecond, in one research report on the hybrid distributed to investors, and separately in a broker email pumping the offer, I've seen repeated references to a higher \"yield to maturity\" or \"yield to call\" of 6.7 per cent. The two problems with this are: the security has no \"maturity\" at all (the regulator insists the hybrids are \"perpetual\"); and it is not a \"fixed-rate\" investment that guarantees you a return over time. The hybrid offers a \"floating-rate\" return, which is between 4.0 per cent to 4.2 per cent above the current bank bill swap rate. Crucially this return can fluctuate up or down every three months, depending on where the bill rate is.\nTo produce the more appealing \"yield to call\" or \"yield to maturity\" of 6.7 per cent one has to assume the hybrid has a fixed return over the next 5.5 years, which it does not. The research report in question has added a 4.0 per cent margin to a 5.5-year swap rate of 2.70 per cent. Note that this 2.7 per cent swap rate is way above the current three-month bank bill rate of 2.14 per cent. It is, of course, easier to sell the hybrid if investors think they're getting a 6.7 per cent rather than 6.1 per cent return, which is also conveniently much closer to the 7.7 per cent dividend yield on Westpac's shares.\nNo discount My analysis suggests the hybrid has effectively no discount or issue concession at a 4.0 per cent margin with 20 basis points of upside at 4.2 per cent (see chart). That's based on where the market was at on July 27. It is worthwhile noting, however, that the closest comparable security, which is a NAB hybrid with the ASX ticker NABPB, was offering a 4.22 per cent margin only four weeks ago. So fair value today could look expensive tomorrow.\nThe hybrid is preferred equity that does rank ahead of ordinary shares in most downside scenarios. I would personally considering buying it if the total return was within 100 basis points of the dividend yield on the voting equity, which implies a margin above bills of 4.5 per cent or better. (We can invest up to 25 per cent of one of the portfolios I help run in ASX hybrids, but have never allocated capital to date because we continue to believe the sector is way overvalued.)\nOne of the risks investors face is that banks may have to issue many more Additional Tier One (AT1) capital hybrids as they seek to build up loss-absorbing equity. My best estimate is that the four majors are currently short a minimum of $32.5 billion of equity capital, which could drive a surge in supply of substitutable CET1 and AT1 securities. This is why I would want a minimum margin of at least 4.5 per cent above bills.\nAnother drawback is that in contrast to the shares your maximum income return is capped at 4 per cent above bills (assuming it prices there). With real voting equity you have an uncapped claim on the bank's net profits. This difference is reflected in the pre- and post-global financial crisis performance of hybrids and bank shares. CBA's Perls III hybrid (ASX: PCAPA) suffered a maximum 36 per cent mark-to-market capital loss between 2007 and 2009, which was better than the 61 per cent peak-to-trough fall in CBA's share price (although not remotely comparable to cash.) Whereas Perls III is still trading today at a 1.3 per cent capital loss to face value, CBA's stock is now 41 per cent higher than its November 2007 peak. So the equity has massively outperformed on both a capital and income basis.\nA positive for the AT1 hybrids is that the major banks are going to lift their junior-ranking CET1 capital from 8.7 per cent to well north of 10 per cent over the next two to three years. This means the risk of the hybrid being automatically converted into equity in a crisis if the CET1 ratio falls below 5.125 per cent is materially reduced.\nThe author is a director and shareholder of Smarter Money Investments, which manages fixed-income portfolios that can, but do not, invest in bank hybrid securities.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-07-28T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:13:14.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
