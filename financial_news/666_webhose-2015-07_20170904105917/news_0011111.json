Photo: Photo: David Wong \nHong Kong's Exchange Fund yesterday reported a 64 per cent year-on-year drop in net investment income. \nBlaming the poor performance on forex valuation losses and bond investments, the city's de facto central bank warned of more challenging times ahead in the second half due to the volatility in mainland Chinese stock markets. \nThe fund's investment income was HK$20.4 billion in the first half, down from HK$56.4 billion in the same period last year. \nNorman Chan Tak-lam, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said first-half investments had been volatile, which would continue into the second half. \n\"The global macroeconomic environment and financial markets will remain highly uncertain in the second half, clouding the investment outlook,\" Chan said. \n\"As the start of the US interest rate normalisation draws closer, the timing and trajectory of the US rate [rises] will have strong bearing on global financial markets. The aftermath of the Greek debt crisis, the development of the mainland [Chinese] equity markets and other uncertainties will likely bring continuing volatilities â€¦ and the investment environment will be more challenging.\" \nThe HKMA manages the HK$3.326 trillion fund that is used to defend the Hong Kong dollar. The fund, which includes the government's fiscal reserves and other assets, is invested in stocks, bonds, property and cash. The fund paid the government HK$22.8 billion in the first half. \nThe poor investment return was partly caused by valuation losses on the fund's foreign-currency asset holdings of HK$25.1 billion. The same assets generated a profit of HK$400 million in the first half of last year. \nForex valuation of assets returned to positive territory with gains of HK$8.1 billion in the second quarter after HK$33.2 billion of losses in the first quarter and HK$24.7 billion of losses in the fourth quarter of last year. For the whole of last year, the fund lost HK$52.7 billion on forex valuation of assets held in euro, yen and pound. \nA HK$7.7 billion loss in bond investments in the second quarter also offset a HK$12.2 billion gain in the first quarter, slashing bond investment gains for the first half to HK$4.5 billion, down 83 per cent from a year earlier. \nThese undid the gains from the fund's Hong Kong stock portfolio, which returned HK$18.8 billion in the first half, up 889 per cent year on year. Returns from other stock investments also increased 5 per cent to HK$20.5 billion in the first half. \nBen Kwong Man-bun, an executive director and head of research at KGI Asia, said the strong stock market rally only took place between April and early June while the past few weeks had seen many blue chips take a dive. \n\"The poor performance of the stock markets in Hong Kong and mainland [China] would be reflected in the Exchange Fund result in the second half. Returns of bond investments will continue to be hurt by expectations of an interest rate rise while the US dollar is likely to continue to be strong,\" Kwong said. \n\"The Exchange Fund could hardly be expected to match last year's returns,\" he said. It returned HK$44.7 billion last year.
