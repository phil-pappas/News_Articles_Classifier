We have achieved good results, but clearly local consumption today is less robust than in the past,\" said BRF's chief financial officer Augusto Ribeiro in a conference call to reporters.\nBRF's sales are split evenly between local and foreign markets. While it exports a lot of poultry, the company has a large processed food operation in Brazil, with a line of ready-to-eat products.\nDespite a smaller profit than projected by analysts, other indicators were positive.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of operational efficiency known as EBITDA, rose 43.6 percent from a year ago to 1.38 bln reais ($409 million), slightly above the 1.3 billion reais analysts polled by Reuters had forecast.\nTotal revenues increased by 12.8 percent in the second quarter to 7.91 billion reais ($2.34 billion).\nIts EBITDA margin went from 13.7 percent last year to 17.4 percent now.\nRibeiro said the company has no plans to reduce investments in Brazil despite the recession.\n($1 = 3.37 reais) (Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; editing by Leslie Adler, Dan Grebler and Diane Craft )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T02:48:41.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
