Businesses will be hit alongside individuals, as the hike will apply equally to corporate insurance premiums. \nThe Association of British Insurers estimates that the new tax rate will add £9.48 to the average annual household insurance policy and £12.25 to the average annual comprehensive motor policy. \nDefending the increase, Mr Osborne said that it would affect just one in five premiums, as other types of insurance such as life and critical illness cover are not affected. He added that the cost of household insurance policies is falling and Britain’s insurance premium tax is well below the rates in many other countries. \nBut David Bearman, UK insurance tax expert at EY, said the 50pc tax rise was “unexpected and significant”. \nHe warned that it could encourage a number of consumers to “forego buying insurance, which increases their personal risks, and in the case of motor insurance could mean a rise in illegal drivers”. \nThe Government estimates that the move will raise an additional £1.5bn a year for the Treasury. \nNicholas and Fabienne d’Adhemar, who live in Fulham, south-west London, recently sold their two-bedroom flat and bought a large family home to accommodate their growing family. \nMrs (LSE: MRS.L - news ) d’Adhemar, who works for a London law firm, said the cost of buying a property is high enough without the added pressure of increased home insurance premiums. \n“When you’re moving up the property ladder you tend to really stretch yourself to the maximum financially. To then find that the cost of your house and contents insurance is increasing on top is an extra financial burden that many families will struggle with. An increase of 3.5pc is not an insignificant amount. \n“The fact that other types of insurance such as motor cover will also suffer the same increase just adds to the growing list of expenses that families are being forced to factor into their budgets.” \n>> For full Budget coverage from Telegraph Money, get our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T23:12:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
