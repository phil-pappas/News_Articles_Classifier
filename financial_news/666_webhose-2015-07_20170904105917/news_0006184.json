Supermarket Pricing Is Confusing, Says CMA By (c) Sky News 2015 | Sky News – 10 minutes ago View Photo \n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has criticised major supermarkets after a three-month probe, saying their pricing is \"confusing\". \nThe investigation was launched after a super-complaint from the consumer group Which?, which contended that pricing practices in the supermarket industry were \"misleading and opaque\". \nAs part of its investigation the CMA found examples of \"pricing and promotional practices that have the potential to confuse or mislead consumers\", but concluded that the problems are not widespread and systematic. \nThe CMA has announced a series of measures designed to bring more clarity to the supermarket sector, including recommending the government publish guidelines on best practices. \nNisha Arora, CMA Senior Director, Consumer, said: \"We welcomed the super-complaint, which presented us with information that demanded closer inspection. \n\"We have gathered and examined a great deal of further evidence over the past 3 months and are now announcing what further action we are taking and recommending others to take. \n\"We have found that, whilst supermarkets want to comply with the law and shoppers enjoy a wide range of choices, with an estimated 40% of grocery spending being on items on promotion, there are still areas of poor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers. \n\"So we are recommending further action to improve compliance and ensure that shoppers have clear, accurate information.\" \nIn reponse to the report Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: “The CMA’s report confirms what our research over many years has repeatedly highlighted: there are hundreds of misleading offers on the shelves every day that do not comply with the rules. \n\"This puts supermarkets on notice to clean up their pricing practices or face legal action. \n“Given the findings, we now expect to see urgent enforcement action from the CMA. \n\"The Government must also quickly strengthen the rules so that retailers have no more excuses. \n“As a result of our super-complaint, if all the changes are implemented widely, this will be good for consumers, competition and, ultimately, the economy.” \nMore follows...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T09:25:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
