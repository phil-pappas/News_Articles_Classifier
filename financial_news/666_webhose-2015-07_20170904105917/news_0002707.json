The regulatory body will review the intake of caffeine and other ingredients in these drinks after conducting the study, an official said. \"The consumption of caffeinated and energy drinks in India has shown an upward trend during the past decade. The FSSAI intends to review the caffeine standards after a detailed study on the consumption pattern of these drinks,\" a senior FSSAI official, who did not wish to be named, told IANS. According to the draft standards notified by the FSSAI, caffeinated beverages are classified as water-based non-alcoholic flavoured drinks and should contain not less than 145 mg per litre and not more than 320 mg per litre total caffeine from whatever sources it may be derived in the formulation of the product. The regulatory body has also invited expressions of interest for appointment of a suitable agency to conduct the study, he said. The Expression of Interest (EoI) needs to be submitted along with technical and financial bids by July 30. The bids will be valid for three months from the date of submission. A bidder would be selected by August 25, and is required to complete the proposed study and give the report by November 30, the official added. The FSSAI lays down science-based standards for food products and regulates their manufacturing, storage, distribution, sale and import to ensure the availability of safe food for human consumption.
