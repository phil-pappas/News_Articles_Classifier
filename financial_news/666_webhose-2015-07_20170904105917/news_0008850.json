It's almost become the new normal. The reality is it isn't normal. \n\"If rates increase as inflation increases, a lot of people are in for a shock. \n\"Even if you're on a fixed-rate mortgage, when you come off that rate, the step from what you are used to to the new environment will be a shock.\" \nSimon Tyler, of broker Tyler Mortgage Management , said: “Wages have barely been rising for years but many people have stretched to get on the housing ladder, often only with the aid of government assistance. These people may find a rate hike hard to cope with.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T08:23:47.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
