Your credit score will also determine the interest rate you pay on your loans. Banks give much lower interest rates to people with high scores. And in some states, your credit score even impacts how much you will pay for auto insurance.\nThere are a lot of myths out there about how to improve your credit score. One of the most common is that you have to go into debt in order to have a good credit score. Almost every week at least one person asks me if they should borrow money on a credit card or personal loan to improve their credit score.\nHere are two important facts that can help you save money and keep a good credit score:\nYou do not need to borrow money and pay interest in order to have a good credit score. Using your credit card, and paying your balance in full every month, should be enough to give you a good score. Personal loans can help improve your credit score. But the biggest help comes from using the proceeds of a personal loan to pay off a credit card. You should never borrow money that you donâ€™t need just to improve your score. I will explain this in more detail.\nHow To Get A Good Credit Score\nThe three most important parts of your FICO score are:\nDo you make your payments on time? Any late payment can have a meaningful negative impact on your score. Missed payments are typically reported to credit reporting agencies when you are 30 days or more delinquent. Do you have a lot of debt? The less debt you have, the better. Too many people think you need to have debt in order to have a score. What you need is a statement balance on your credit card. And the lower the balance, the better. As a general rule, I encourage people to keep their statement balance below 20% of their credit limit. How long have you had credit? The longer your credit history, the better. And you need to have activity every month in order to get the best credit score. You can have an excellent credit score with just one credit card. Make one purchase each month on the credit card that is not more than 20% of your available credit limit. Pay your credit card bill on time. And repeat that every month. You never need to pay any interest to get a good score.\nDo I Need A Credit Card?\nA credit card is the best way to build and keep your credit score high. But, as I explained in the previous section, you do not need to borrow money on the credit card. So long as you use the card every month and pay the balance in full each month, you will build and maintain an excellent score. You do not need to borrow money or pay interest to keep your score high.\nWill A Personal Loan Increase My Score?\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/whatsinyourscore.aspx"], "published": "2015-07-21T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:52:42.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
