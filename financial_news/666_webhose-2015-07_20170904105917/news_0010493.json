That was assuming the full and timely implementation of structural reforms and primary budget surpluses above 4% of GDP on a medium-term basis. \nHowever, at present Europe will need to at least significantly extend the maturity of its loans to the Mediterranean country and additional financing on similar terms will have to be provided. \nFurthermore, if the reforms asked of Greece are weakened further - particularly through a further lowering of primary surplus targets and even weaker structural reforms - then 'haircuts' of over 30% of GDP on debt will become necessary to meet the 120% debt-to-GDP target set out in 2012. \nIf not, then debt would remain \"very high for decades and highly vulnerable to shocks\". \nNonetheless, the IMF clearly states that: \"had the program [of reforms] been implemented in full then no further debt relief would have been needed.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T02:19:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
