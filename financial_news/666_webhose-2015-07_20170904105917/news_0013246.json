Some of these people will have to navigate the complications concerning the way that some apparently separate banks count as part of the same group, while others that have a common owner still maintain separate banking licences. ( There is a guide to this here. ) \nMany savers will have large sums tied up in fixed-rate accounts. If they try to move any excess money today to keep their balance below the new compensation limit, they will generally have to pay a penalty, such as forfeiting several months’ interest. Transitional arrangements are promised, but we have no details. \nBut the bigger concern is that, just a few years after we saw people queuing on the street to withdraw money from banks they no longer trusted, this change needlessly plants doubt in savers’ minds about how safe their savings are. \nAs I wrote here in October last year , the complexity of the compensation scheme could have played a part in Northern Rock savers’ decision to withdraw their cash. At that time only the first £2,000 of bank deposits was 100pc protected. For bigger sums, only 90pc cover applied. There was no protection at all above £35,000. \nSo it was a welcome step forward when the current system 100pc protection up to £85,000 was introduced. That sum has gradually sunk into savers’ brains, so they are, I suspect, relaxed about the safety of their savings as long as they don’t breach the limit. \nTinkering with the scheme risks reintroducing doubt. \nThe worst thing about this change, though, is that it is completely unnecessary. It is being made because the FSCS rules ultimately derive from an EU directive, which sets the compensation limit across the EU at €100,000 to be converted into local currency for non-members of the eurozone. But the FSCS said the directive also forced national authorities to recalculate the limit every five years in accordance with the current exchange rate. \nBecause the euro has weakened since the directive came into force, the new FSCS limit is lower. \nThe value of the pound overseas has no bearing on the concerns of British savers. Fluctuations in foreign exchange can in any case easily be reversed, and are far less important than a reliable depositors’ safety net. \nInsisting on a regular recalculation of the limit is crazy bureaucratic nitpicking by the EU at the expense of the people the whole system is supposed to serve. \n• richard.evans@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T22:06:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
