The stock tumbled a record 11-straight trading days before climbing Friday. The company has been struggling to replicate its European success in the U.S. after efforts to brand itself as an alternative to Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. didn’t align with shifting consumer preference for healthier options.\n“There was a high expectation built into the market,” Steven Schoenfeld, the New York-based founder of BlueStar Global Investors LLC, a financial research firm focused on Israel, said in a phone interview. “The market was very disappointed when Soda couldn’t execute well in the U.S.”\nSodaStream reported first-quarter sales of $90.3 million, missing the $100.9 million estimate of 9 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and down from $118.2 million a year earlier. The slump in adjusted revenue was mainly the result of foreign currency fluctuations and lower demand for carbonated water makers and flavors in the U.S. and France, according to a company press release .\nTurnaround Plans SodaStream’s U.S. office didn’t respond to requests for comment on Friday.\nThe company’s stock soared briefly last month after Chief Executive Officer Daniel Birnbaum said he didn’t expect much competition from the Keurig Kold machine -- a soda maker set to be released later this year by Keurig Green Mountain Inc. It didn’t take long for investor disillusionment to set back in.\nThe company’s attempt to turn around its flagging business began late last year. It involves re-branding the company as a health-conscious maker of sparkling water, which can be plain or lightly flavored. New machines are expected to reach Bed, Bath and Beyond in late July and and other retailers in September and the company is making gas cannisters more widely available, according to a July 7 note by Susquehanna International Group.\nThe re-branding makes sense since the majority of SodaStream’s customers already use it for sparkling water, Jim Chartier, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co Inc, said by phone. Six percent of U.S. customers use the SodaStream machines to make only soda, while 60 percent use it to make only carbonated water, according to the company.\nHype Machine “For the last few years it’s been a volatile stock,” Chartier said by phone. “Most investors are taking a wait-and-see approach to see how the re-positioning plays out and how it translates into improving sales and profitability for the company.”\nSodaStream’s stock is set to rebound as the company’s turnaround efforts take hold in the second and third quarters, according to Pablo Zuanic, an equity analyst Susquehanna who rates the stock a buy. Susquehanna Financial Group is a market maker in SodaStream and beneficially owns more than 1 percent of the company.\n“By the time they hold the conference call for the third quarter in late October, early November, I expect we will have some positive news that will move the stock up, both in terms of improved sales and new retail relationships,” Zuanic said by phone.\nSodaStream has approached retailers including Whole Foods Market Inc. and Vitamin Shoppe Inc. in an effort to expand its in-store presence, Birnbaum said in a July 1 conference call. It may seek to partner with coffee producers for the launch of Ultimate by SodaStream, a combined hot and cold beverage machine, in 2016.\n“They need to do something almost revolutionary, like they did four, five years ago,” Schoenfeld said. “It had so much hype built into it that now investors are in the mood for ‘Show me, prove it, deliver earnings.’”", "external_links": ["http://sodastream.investorroom.com/2015-05-06-SodaStream-Reports-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2015-Results?printable\\"], "published": "2015-07-12T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T00:26:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
