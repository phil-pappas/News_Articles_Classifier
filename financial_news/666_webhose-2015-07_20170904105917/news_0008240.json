Investors will be closely watching the release of the Fed's statement on Wednesday at the end of its two-day monetary policy meeting.\n\"As much as the Fed has said they want to tighten in 2015, that has all been contingent upon the realization of a forecast that just doesn't look realistic at this point, based on inflation and recent weakness in commodity markets,\" said Tom Simons, money market strategist at Jefferies & Co. in New York.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries traded up 16/32 of a point in price in late U.S. trading, driving the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to 2.21 percent, its lowest level since June 9..\nThe 30-year U.S. Treasury rose more than one full point in price, edging to its session high after a stronger-than-expected 3.4 percent rise in June U.S. durable goods orders.\nThe 30-year bond traded up 25/32 of a point in price, pulling the yield down to 2.93 percent.\nBuying in the Treasuries market began after Chinese stocks slid more than 8 percent despite an unprecedented government rescue plan to prop up equity valuations. That raised serious concerns, after three weeks of relative calm, that Beijing's efforts to stave off a deeper crash will fail.
