If you look at the development of air combat over the years then there have been two main themes: aircraft performance and the struggle for situational awareness. \n“Speed, height and agility all developed but for many years situational awareness was all visual. It wasn’t until radar in the Second World War that we saw the first mechanism for trying to gain an advantage there.” \nPerformance and technical developments such as better radar and missiles that can shoot targets beyond visual range continued apace to produce so-called “4th generation” fighters such as the Typhoon and F-18 that are the pinnacle of these two streams of technology. \nHowever, in recent years a separate theme has come to the fore with advances in computing power, electronic warfare and stealth technology, which makes aircraft hard to pick up on radar. Combining these attributes with agility and situational awareness to create 5th generation aircraft such as the F35 means aerial combat of the future will be very different, said Mr Linstead. \n“All modern aircraft have speed, agility and situational awareness equipment now,” said Mr Linstead. “What discriminates the F-35 is the way it gathers and processes all the information to the pilot in a ‘fused’ way and its [stealth] allows it to operate where aircraft might not have been able to go before.” \nBig picture: The new jet's sensors will give a clear understanding of the battlefield in the air and on the ground \nThe F-35’s sensors can create a picture of the battlefield in the air and on the ground that pilots can easily understand and share with each other and ultimately with other friendly forces allowing them to make smarter decisions and pick fights where they have the advantage. \n“Previously pilots might have had to fight their way in to a hostile area,” said Mr Linstead, who now works for Lockheed Martin, the lead contractor on the F-35 programme. “The battlefield picture they now have means they can avoid their adversary or choose to fight in a way that will give them a better outcome. \n“In the Tornados I flew in during the 1990s, the struggle was to make sense of what was going on. We had a lot of tools to pick up information but they were not fused and you had to put the information together in your head. \n“The hardest thing to understand about flying a fast jet is that it is not easy to understand what is really going on,” he added. “Being given better situational awareness is a weapon in itself.” \nThe F-35’s advanced sensors and difficulty in detecting it mean that the jet’s tactics could see it position itself to shoot down adversaries from a distance before they are even aware it is nearby. However, this doesn't mean that hard-turning, high-speed dogfights such as those seen over London during the Battle of Britain are gone. \n“The F-35A is an agile aircraft, it has speed and can pull a 9G turn like an F-16,” said Mr Linstead. “It would be trite to say dogfights are over. But if an F-35 got into a dogfight situation then the pilot would have probably done something wrong.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T00:29:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
