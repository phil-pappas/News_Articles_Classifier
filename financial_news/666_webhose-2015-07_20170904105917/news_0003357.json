Germany has made a big contribution to all packages and has taken on big risks.\" \nThe struggle over Greece's latest debt deal has nevertheless exposed growing rifts within the euro zone. \nGabriel said it would be wrong to take on risks related to Greece without asking the country to make changes because Italy, Spain and Portugal would then have to receive the same treatment and \"the euro zone could not survive that\". \nHe said there was a good chance Athens would implement the reforms. \"Then it will be proved that this path is right,\" he added. \n(Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by David Goodman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T16:11:03.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
