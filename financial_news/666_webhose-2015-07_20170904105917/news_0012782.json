The ban stalled Vale's $4 billion strategy in China, the world's biggest market for the commodity.\nA spokeswoman for Vale declined to comment on the rule change.\nSigns of a thaw began appearing last September after Vale signed a deal to sell and lease back ships from China Ocean Shipping Co (COSCO), the country's largest shipping conglomerate.\nChina in February issued ship design guidelines recognising ships of 400,000 dwt. Ports that want to receive Valemaxes will be able to apply for permission if they meet these standards, the NDRC said.\nA Valemax previously owned by the Brazilian firm anchored at Qingdao's Dongjiakou port this week, Reuters mapping data showed. The Yuan Zhuo Hai is now owned by China Ore Shipping, a Cosco joint venture, which it bought from Vale in May.\nThe ability of Valemaxes to take cargoes directly to China and cut costs, by $4-6 a tonne, comes at a crucial time for the firm, with iron ore prices struggling around their lowest since 2009 due to a global supply glut.\nWhile the price collapse has driven higher-cost miners out of the market and increased the market share of giant producers, higher freight charges and longer delivery times means that Vale has not benefited as much as Australian rivals such as Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton .\nAustralia alone supplied 241.7 million tonnes of iron ore to China in the first five months of the year, up 14.8 percent compared to last year and amounting to almost 64 percent of the total. Brazil supplied 70.89 million tonnes, or 18.7 percent.\nSpot prices for ore delivered into Tianjin port .IO62-CNI=SI dropped 5.3 percent on Thursday to $55.8 per tonne, the sixth consecutive daily decline and its lowest rate since April 23.
