Currently executive vice president, Mr Pessina has occupied the role on an interim basis since Walgreen veteran George Wesson departed after a power struggle in December. The 74-year-old Italian was the chief architect of Alliance Boots’ £5bn merger with Walgreens last year, creating a company employing 370,000 people. Mr Pessina’s elevation to the top role comes despite his insistence earlier this year that a search for a new chief executive was underway. “I don’t care about managing the company,” Mr Pessina told The Telegraph in January. “What I want, what I care about, is steering the company towards a certain direction and to be influential, very influential, on the strategy.” In the company’s third-quarter update on Thursday, executive chairman James Skinner said Mr Pessina had done an “extraordinary job” in his six months in charge. “Through his leadership, our organisation is meeting the challenges of combining our two companies, and many of the opportunities we anticipated from our strategic combination are now becoming a reality,” Mr Skinner said. “In order to continue this momentum and to recognise the progress that is already being made, the board concluded Stefano is the very best person to achieve our vision to be a truly global health care champion, the first choice for pharmacy, health care and wellbeing across the world.” Boots is to cut 700 jobs in the UK Walgreens Boots Alliance reported net earnings up 39.9pc to $1.1bn (£715m) in the third quarter, while sales rose 48.4pc to $28.8bn. “In just six months since the strategic combination that formed Walgreens Boots Alliance, we are beginning to make progress in our operations, as we were able to deliver another strong quarter,” said Mr Pessina. “I don’t care about managing the company\" Stefano Pessina in January 2015 However the new chief executive warned that the fourth quarter was “typically the slowest quarter” and cost control remained important. Last month the company cut 700 non-store roles at Boots in the UK as part of a $1.5bn global cost-cutting programme that will run until 2017. Separately, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced it had bought UK skincare brand Liz Earle from Avon Products. The all-cash deal valued the brand at £140m. \"Liz Earle is the perfect fit for Walgreens Boots Alliance where it already has a strong presence in its retail stores,” said Sheri McCoy, Avon chief executive.
