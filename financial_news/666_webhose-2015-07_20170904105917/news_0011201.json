But with oil prices still low and Iran about to return to the oil market, demand was slack and only two of 14 blocks that were up for auction attracted bids large enough for deals to be sealed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:43:04.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
