Although retail outlets located in London will not be as severely affected owing to already high labour costs that exceed the current minimum wage, regional operations are likely to be more affected. \n“Ultimately, we expect retailers to pass on higher labour costs to customers.\" \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Britain’s leading retailers fell on the day of the Budget as investors digested the proposals. \nPublicly, retailers have given the Chancellor’s living wage a lukewarm backing, but privately they are frustrated at the lack of consultation over the measure. \nIn a statement, Tesco (Xetra: 852647 - news ) said: “At Tesco we know it is important to reward colleagues well, and that’s why we pay one of the highest hourly rates in retail. \n“But we firmly believe in offering colleagues a total reward package and our benefits include a 10pc colleague discount, shares scheme and pension, which we know they really value. \n“That said, in line with our approach of offering sector-leading pay and a generous benefit package to all colleagues, we are supportive of the introduction of the national living wage.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T22:13:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
