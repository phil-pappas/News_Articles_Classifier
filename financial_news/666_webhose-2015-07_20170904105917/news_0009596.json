This is beaten only by Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) funds offered to customers of Hargreaves Lansdown (LSE: HL.L - news ) for 0.06pc. \nThe cost of BlackRock's US trackers will fall from 0.16pc to 0.08pc, while the continental Europe fund will cost 0.1pc a year, down from 0.17pc. \n• New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) research names Britain's best tracker funds \nTony Stenning of BlackRock said: “BlackRock’s heritage in index investing dates back to the early 1970s when we pioneered the first index strategy. Through our scale, we’re pleased to be able to offer investors five key index equity exposures at a competitive price.” \nRival fund groups Fidelity and Vanguard also provide UK tracker funds for core markets at less than 0.1pc. Many of the cheapest trackers, particularly for overseas markets, are exchange-traded funds. \nLaith Khalaf of Hargreaves Lansdown said: “This takes the BlackRock funds to being, if not the very cheapest, among the cheapest and that competition is a good thing. If you look at the American market, where the scale of some funds is even greater, there could even be room for more price cuts.\" \n• Tracker fund prices fall again but beware the big catch on 'low-cost' funds \nHe added: “The most important thing, though, is that there are still some trackers charging around 0.7pc. Investors should review what they hold to ensure they’re not overpaying.” \nTracker funds now represent 12pc of overall UK funds under management, almost double the size of 10 years ago. They have gained popularity with investors who are increasingly conscious of the effect that cost has on their returns. \nAs an example, an investor setting aside £200 a month into a portfolio that achieves growth of 7pc a year with an annual charge of 1pc would see their pot grow to £90,464 after 20 years. If the annual charge fell to 0.5pc the pot would grow by an extra £5,597 in that time. \n• Calculator: How your investments might grow with monthly saving \nCurrent market conditions have also led many investors towards passive rather than active funds. \nDeveloped stock markets such as the UK and US have been bolstered by efforts to boost their economies through low interest rates and measures such as quantitative easing. \nPassive funds have been able to capture these gains without the need to pay for an active manager. \n• Newsletter: Get a weekly round-up of the best of our investment ideas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:11:01.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
