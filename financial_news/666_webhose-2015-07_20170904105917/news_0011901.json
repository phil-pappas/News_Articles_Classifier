He is sceptical that South Africa needs to belong to another foreign development investment bank. \n\"What remains to be seen is whether it is going to remain one of those diplomatic points that the country scores without necessarily speaking to the needs of society,\" he said. \nFor President Putin, hosting of the seventh BRICS summit comes at a great time. The sanctions imposed by the European Union and the United States over the country's involvement in the conflict in Ukraine continue to bite, and Russia is looking to strengthen its economic ties elsewhere. \nAndrew Foxall, the director of the Russia Studies Centre at London-based thinktank the Henry Jackson Society, believes Putin is using the opportunity to show the West that the country isn't isolated economically. Foxall told RFI that \"the dynamics within the BRICS has changed a lot\" over the period that the bloc has been in existence, and the \"shining star\" of Russia has been waning. \nThe summit runs Thursday and Friday.
