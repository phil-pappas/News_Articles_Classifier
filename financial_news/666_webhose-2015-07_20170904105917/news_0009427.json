Pat Scala Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston High-rise apartments development in Australia has been dealt a blow by changes in the significant investment visa rules with more than a dozen funds that channelled investment money into such projects now barred from doing so.\nHall & Wilcox partners Harry New and Eugene Chen have advised on and created over a dozen significant investment visa funds for residential real estate projects.\n\"We have a number of Australian based developers and – they are frustrated because they had projects geared towards residential development using SIV funding and now that cannot be done,\" Mr Chen said.\n\"We have a lot of development permits outstanding in Melbourne at the moment and these SIV changes may prevent some of these developments from ever getting off the ground.\"\nOn July 1 the federal government's new rules on significant investor visas – the ticket for which millionaire foreigners can gain residency in Australia by investing $5 million into complying investments – came into affect but not everyone has been happy with the outcome.\nThe new rules exclude bonds as an investment type and seriously curtail the level of investment in residential projects. ​Previously SIV compliant investments could include an investment in a large residential development now they can only invest through a managed investment scheme whose investment is no more than 10 per cent the value of the relevant scheme's net assets under management.\n\"We have fund managers in China who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars preparing these funds [for residential development investments] and all the legal documents but now they can longer do this,\" Mr Chen said.\n\"We think about 90 per cent of [the funds] are no longer compliant.\"\n As of March 2015, Australia has received $3.755 billion in significant investment visa funds. A breakdown of how much of this money is channelled into property is not recorded but the flow into managed funds – the likely place for real estate development – is roughly 52 per cent.\nThe new rules also force part of the required $5 million into such products as venture capital and small capitalisation equities funds, which some say could cause a dangerous speculative run on the sharemarket instead of addressing possible housing affordability problems.\n\"If the justification is that they wanted Chinese investors to invest in increasing housing supply then they should have allowed investment in development,\" Mr New said.\n\"Where there is under supply of residential housing or overpricing of residential housing this SIV investment in residential property development could potentially going a long way in addressing the issue,\" Mr New said.\nBoth Mr New and Mr Chen believe the future of the scheme will be dictated by politics.\n\"The outcome may also have been politically influenced due to the large volume of property acquisitions by Chinese and the perceptions it generated.\"\nMore than 90 per cent of successful SIVs are for Chinese, equating to more than $3.3 billion in funds.", "external_links": ["http://www.border.gov.au/about/reports-publications/research-statistics/statistics/work-in-australia/significant-investor-visa-statistics", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1", "http://www.austrade.gov.au/invest/significant-investor-visa-and-premium-investor-visa-programmes#1"], "published": "2015-07-28T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:08:34.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
