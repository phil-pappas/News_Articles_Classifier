The Nikkei stock index was up 1.6 percent in afternoon trading.\nThe benchmark 10-year JGB yield was up 1 basis point at 0.440 percent, while the 20-year yield added 1 basis point to 1.205 percent. The 30-year yield was 1.5 basis points higher at 1.455 percent.\nThe 10-year JGB futures price was down 0.07 point at 147.16 in afternoon trading.\nInvestors lacked any incentive to take new positions as they awaited the outcome of an emergency euro zone summit meeting in Brussels to discuss a compromise proposal on a third bailout for Greece. A full session was set to reconvene later on Monday, a spokesman for summit chairman Donald Tusk said.\nOn the supply front, the Ministry of Finance will hold a 300 billion yen ($2.45 billion) liquidity enhancement auction for off-the-run superlong JGBs on Tuesday, and a monthly sale of 2.5 trillion yen of 5-year JGBs on Thursday.
