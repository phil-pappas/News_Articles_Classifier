What that means is the timing will be carefully done. That is something which we have to watch,” Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian told PTI.\nYellen on Friday had said that the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates towards the end of 2015, but sounded cautious over the slack in job market.\nThe bank has kept benchmark federal funds rate at zero since the end of 2008 to help the economic recovery.\nSince early last year the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s policy arm, had been expected to move on rates around mid-2015, but the decision is being delayed to push the economic growth further.\nThe Reserve Bank had earlier said that India is prepared to deal with foreign fund outflows as the country has significant forex reserves.\nIndia’s foreign exchange reserves marginally declined by USD 700 million for the week ended July 3 to USD 354.5 billion.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 2:12 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:35:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
