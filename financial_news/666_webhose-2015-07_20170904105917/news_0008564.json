It strengthens GKN Aerospace's market leadership, manufacturing footprint and technology,\" GKN's chief executive Nigel Stein said in a statement. \nReporting its half-year results, GKN said its pretax profit rose 4 percent in the period to 307 million pounds, helped by growth in its auto-parts supply business, and repeated guidance for 2015 to be another year of growth. \n($1 = 0.9035 euros) (Reporting by Sarah Young, Editing by Paul Sandle)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T10:14:39.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
