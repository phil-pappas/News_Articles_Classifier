NRAM said the original decision would have cost it £258m in redress for poorly worded loan documents. \nNRAM, which manages the state-owned assets of Northern Rock following its 2008 nationalisation, successfully argued in the appeal that larger borrowers were not protected by the Consumer Credit Act 1974, despite loan paperwork that declared the opposite. \n“NRAM is committed to acting in full accordance with the law and to treating customers and taxpayers fairly. For this reason, we sought clarification of the law by conducting a case in the High Court and subsequently the Court of Appeal,” NRAM said in a statement. \nNorthern Rock collapsed in 2008 \nTogether mortgages were offered by Northern Rock from 1999 to customers who wished to take an unsecured loan of up to £30,000 alongside their mortgage, and repay the “top-up” loan at the same rate. \nMore than 150,000 smaller borrowers were told in 2012 they were in line for £270m worth of compensation for blunders in the loan paperwork, even if they had not suffered losses as a result. However, those with top-up loans above £25,000 were excluded from the scheme. \nNRAM forms part of UK Asset Resolution, the taxpayer-owned body that controls the state-owned financial assets including shares in RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) and Lloyds. Any compensation would have been paid out of the public purse. \nLast year, NRAM brought a test case against an employee who held such a mortgage, to try and establish that it had no obligation to pay compensation to those with loans of more than £25,000. The High Court disagreed, and ruled in December that 41,000 borrowers should be paid an average of £6,300 each. NRAM lodged an appeal in early 2015.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:21:32.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
