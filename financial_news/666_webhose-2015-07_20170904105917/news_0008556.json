In the last quarter, this tire manufacturer had posted a positive earnings surprise of 20.00%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement. \nWhy a Likely Positive Surprise? \nOur proven model shows that Goodyear is likely to beat earnings estimates this season because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. \nZacks ESP : Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +1.32%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. \nZacks Rank: Goodyear currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. \nGoodyear’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP, when combined, make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat on Jul 29. \nWhat is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings? \nGoodyear regularly launches innovative products and services to boost sales. In May 2015, the company introduced the Goodyear EfficientGrip SUV tire in Latin America. In Mar 2015, Goodyear unveiled two concept tires. Also, in the first quarter of 2015, the company introduced the new Kelly Edge line of tires as well as the Fuel Max LHS. These product launches are expected to enhance sales volumes for the second quarter. \nGoodyear expects tire unit volumes to grow 1–2% in 2015.The company anticipates annual segment operating income to increase 10–15% this year. These indicate the possibility of higher tire unit volumes and segment operating income in the second quarter as well. \nHowever, Goodyear’s revenues have been declining over the years due to unfavorable foreign currency translation, lower sales in other tire-related businesses, a decline in price and product mix, and lower tire volume. This trend of declining revenues is expected to continue in the second quarter. Moreover, the continuing economic and political uncertainty, difficulty in importing raw materials and finished goods, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, government price and profit margin controls in Venezuela, are expected to adversely impact Goodyear’s operating income from Latin America. \nStocks that Warrant a Look \nHere are some companies in the automobile sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: \nGentherm Incorporated THRM has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company’s second-quarter 2015 results are scheduled to release on Jul 29. \nO'Reilly Automotive Inc. ORLY has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company will report second-quarter 2015 financial numbers on Jul 29. \nBorgWarner Inc. BWA has an Earnings ESP of +1.21% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company will report second-quarter 2015 earnings on Jul 30. \nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.
