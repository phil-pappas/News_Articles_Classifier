Today’s TV customer demands better, faster, smarter and easier to use video products that provide anytime, anywhere access to content, across any device. \nAs the marketplace evolves, Comcast continues to add new features and offerings to meet the needs of everyone who loves TV. Announced just this week, the company’s most recent video innovation — called Stream — is a new streaming video service for consumers who prefer internet -based service to traditional cable. \nThe service will offer customers, via their existing home equipment, a simple, easy way to add a skinny cable package to their broadband subscription and enjoy immediate access to programming. With Stream, customers can watch live TV from about a dozen networks — including all the major broadcast networks and HBO — on laptops, tablets and phones in their home. The service also includes thousands of on demand movies and shows to watch home or away. \nStream costs $15 per month and will launch in Boston, Chicago and Seattle later this year. Comcast expects to roll out Stream in Denver in early 2016. \nIt’s an exciting time to be a TV fan – there is more quality content than ever and seemingly limitless ways to keep up with all the shows and movies people are talking about. Comcast will continue to experiment by creating offerings like Stream, so that users can choose the service that works best for them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:25:15.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
