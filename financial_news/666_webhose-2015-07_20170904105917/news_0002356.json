Pat Scala Melba Marginson came to Australia from the Philippines as a teacher. She recalls Teachers Federation meetings in the 1980s where men were all but banned from the conference halls, and if they were allowed in, weren't allowed to speak. It was like secret women's business.\n\"I was amused at it, but I understood immediately, because when you allowed men into the room, they would dominate discussions. It's true. Because it was part of their daily life to have an entitlement to speak, and they would speak and speak without thinking.\"\nHow to behave Marginson is founder and executive director of the Victorian Refugee and Immigrant Women's Coalition through which she created a leadership course for immigrant women, having spent several years as a Diversity Planner with Maribyrnong Council.\n She says women from different backgrounds don't always know how to behave in Australia. \"Can you be very frank, do you have to pretend that you are assertive? It's hard to say. Often the culture where you grew up becomes dominant in how you behave, and then you will make a mistake, because that behaviour is not the one that everyone else in the room expects.\"\nFor immigrant women, \"it's not a glass ceiling, it's a rock ceiling\". Marginson says people consciously or otherwise put them in the box of \"hard to communicate with\" and assume they're stupid because their English is not perfect, even if they have a PhD, or speak five other languages fluently.\nThe trick to boosting inclusion and diversity is Facilitation-101. Immigrants and refugees will always position themselves at the back of the room, shyness is the norm: Pacific Island women, for example, must always defer to men. \"That infiltrates into the way they operate at work, too,\" Marginson says.\nWhen you're in the meeting, give everyone a chance to speak. It's a very basic etiquette of facilitation. If there are people from another background, name them, ask them to speak, be very direct.\"\nHidden rules Head of Linguistics at Macquarie University, Professor Lynda Yates says she avoids \"essentialising\", saying everyone from one place speaks a certain way, because it's not like that. \"But we all hold secrets, or unacknowledged rules in our head about how people should behave, and they're not all the same across languages and cultures.\"\nShe recounts a Colombian designer, who she interviewed as part of their research into the 'hidden rules of communication' in Australia. He said the biggest challenge was learning that you couldn't give direct criticism to a junior. \"Where he was from, if somebody's designs you didn't like, you would just say so. In Australia, you must do it in a much less direct, more face-saving way.\n\"He called the challenge: 'how can you say, without saying?'\"\nLike Marginson, Professor Yates says, put it all on the table. \"Say 'where I come from, we're very direct, I'm not meaning to be rude'. On the other hand if you see someone you think isn't contributing as you'd expect, ask them about it, elicit more.\n\"If we are as upfront as we can be about what we are doing, and why, then that's the safest thing you can do.\" Whether that would work for interrupters, is another matter.\nDouble-voiced discourse A 1975 study by Zimmerman and West found that in conversations between people of the same gender, the total number of 'overlaps', positive linguistic tools to keep conversation flowing and show engagement, were 22, and interruptions happened seven times.\nIn conversations between men and women, that changed to nine overlaps and 48 interruptions, 46 of which were by the male. And a person's perceived professional standing makes no difference, with two separate studies in the 1990s showing that during doctor-patient interactions, female doctors were interrupted more frequently by patients than their male counterparts.\nWhile \"hidden norms\" are the issue for cross-cultural interactions, between men and women, the issue is what British linguist Dr Judith Baxter calls \"double voice discourse\".\nHer 18-month study of board meetings in FTSE-100 companies found that gender segregations in linguistic patterns had changed at board level so much that there were \"very few differences between them\", except for double voiced discourse, which women use four times as much as men.\nHedging observations, being self-deprecatory, speaking apologetically or using humour to diffuse tension, are all examples. As are phrases such as, \"I am probably speaking out of turn, but…\" and \"Sorry to cut across you like that but…\"\nBaxter says while women can use it to their advantage, particularly when facing confrontation, if used badly, it will undermine their credibility and authority.\nIt's not all bad news for women in business (the same is not true in low-paid jobs where gender segregation in language remains rife).\nAs more alpha females learn to add male-speak to their repertoire, they \"have the edge\", she says, over men who are only now beginning to inject emotional-intelligence into their interactions, \"because they [women] constantly think about how they speak\".\nProfessor Yates says that what's so interesting about Mansplaining these days is that women in power quite often do the same thing.\n\"So a good question to ask is whether it's always Mansplaining, or it is Powersplaining?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:07:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
