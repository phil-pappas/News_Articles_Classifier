I paid extra for the website’s “Full Flex” package, which allows for a 90% refund if a passenger cancels.\nThis was essential in case my father’s original airline managed to secure him a seat on another suitable flight. Only after I had paid did I discover this refund was only valid up until 48 hours before the flight. I was sold this package 36 hours before the flight.\nI’ve spoken to Bravofly four times, and each time it’s been promised that a manager will call me, but they never have. It has also now stopped responding to emails and I cannot get through on the UK phone number. RD, London\nThe two emails Bravofly did send in reply to your complaint completely miss the point that you were sold an invalid package. The press office acknowledges the difficulty, but seems to think that the fact that terms and conditions are set out during the booking process is exoneration. Moreover, the technology required to prevent invalid policies being sold seems currently beyond the wit of the company, now part of Lastminute.com. “We are working on a solution to prevent the sale of the package within 48 hours of the departure – this is currently being developed by our IT department,” a spokeswoman reassuringly says.\nIn the meantime, presumably, other customers may be unwittingly purchasing cover that will not be valid if they need to make a claim.\n■ We booked return flights to Paraguay through Bravofly. On the day of our departure we received an email saying that our booking had been cancelled due to “technical problems”. The airline said that if we could show the card used for the booking at check-in there would be no problem. When we did we were told the card was different to the one used to book, even though our online statement showed otherwise. We had to pay $385 each for new tickets and can’t get through on Bravofly’s telephone numbers. EB, London\nBravofly insists the booking was cancelled by the airline for technical reasons, which may be why your card was required. It says it will process a refund when it receives receipts for your extra tickets. In the meantime, it evidently needs to work on its communications.\nIf you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
