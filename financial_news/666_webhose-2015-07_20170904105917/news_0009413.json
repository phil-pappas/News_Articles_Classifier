Photo: 4Corners Images Comments \nThe Murray International investment trust has slipped to a small discount for the first time in five years, creating a “rare buying opportunity”. \nThe popular trust, managed by the highly experienced stock-picker Bruce Stout, is viewed as one of the best global funds savers can buy because of its impressive track record for growing both capital and income. \nThe fund has returned 166pc over the past decade, compared to 117pc for the average global income fund. \nIts performance is sluggish over shorter time periods, however. It has returned 4pc over three years against 46pc in its sector, and 33pc versus 62pc over five. \nThis has panicked some of the trust’s savers, who have sold out and driven down the premium from 9pc a month ago to a small discount of 0.4pc now. Over the past three years the trust has consistently traded on a high single digit premium. \nThe rough patch has been in part down to a high weighting to shares in emerging market and Latin American exchanges, accounting for around 20pc of fund. \nExposure to Brazil, one of the favoured countries, in particular has not helped. \nThe country is fighting to avoid a recession that is forecast to be its worst for 25 years and has upped interest rates to 13.75pc. This has weighed heavily on the country’s stock market, which is down 11pc over the past year. \nStephen Peters, of Charles Stanley Direct, the broker, said the fund’s low weighting to strongly-performing US shares has not helped either. \nThe fund holds 15pc of its money in America while the majority of other global funds hold between 40pc to 60pc. \nMr Stout is cautiously positioned, believing that stock markets that have been injected with quantitative easing, such as in the US and Britain, are artificially high. To reflect these views Mr Stout is focusing on capital preservation and only buying reliable dividend payers until stock markets correct and valuations cool. The biggest holding in the fund is British American Tobacco, followed by Unilever Indonesia. \nMr Peters said Murray International is a buy for cautious investors who agree that stock markets are looking expensive. \n“This is the first time in years the trust has offered investors an attractive entry point and the chance to buy a skilled fund manager who has an excellent long term track record,” Mr Peters said. \n“But it is worth bearing in mind is that if performance does not improve it is likely to become even cheaper and widen out onto a bigger discount.” \nIain Scouller, an investment trust analyst at Stifel, which acquired Oriel Securities last year, also has the trust down as a buy. \n“Mr Stout has not become a bad fund manager overnight and this is a good opportunity for investors to buy at a sensible price for the first time in five years,” Mr Scouller said. \n“With a yield of 5pc it is one of the one highest on offer in the investment trust world and is an attractive proposition for income seekers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:32:09.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
