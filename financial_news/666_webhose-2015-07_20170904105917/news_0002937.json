The gifts you receive are totally free and clear, but the gifts you give are subject to one of the most complicated areas of the tax code. And while it's a tax that mostly applies to the well-to-do, the threshold for what constitutes the \"well-to-do\" might be lower than you think. \nThe Origins of the Gift Tax \n\"It dates back to old tax law and philosophy,\" says Marc J. Minker, the private client services national practice leader with CBIZ, Inc. in New York. \"Very few people today remember when we had marginal tax brackets in the 60 to 90% range.\" He notes that through a lot of political wrangling, the marginal tax brackets were trimmed back, leaving the IRS with a problem: It needed to find alternative sources of revenue for the Treasury.
