Of this amount, GH¢5.1 billion will be sourced from the International Capital Market, part of which will be used to buy back Ghana's Eurobond which matures in 2017. Domestic financing of the budget is estimated at GH¢4.97 billion, indicating a downward revision by GH¢2.6 billion from the estimate in the 2015 Budget.' \nBy moving expeditiously to curtail expenditures, the country has now been spared the overestimation of petroleum revenues that occurred in 2012 with major adverse effects for the economy, he stated. \nWorld Bank gas guarantee The Finance Minister also mentioned that the World Bank is expected to provide a US$700 million Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) support to leverage the substantially larger gas payment flows and facilitate investments of up to US$7.9 billion by the private sector, adding that the Bretton-Woods institution is likely to approve the deal in the coming weeks. \nPRG covers lenders against the risk of Government non-performance of its contractual obligations to a specific project such as the risk of non-payment by Government/SOE, change in law/regulatory risk, expropriation risk, etc. \nMr Terkper noted that with the signing of an agreement for the development of the natural gas reserves of the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP), the Sankofa Gas Field project would provide 170 million cubic feet of gas per day for nearly 15 years to supply an additional 1,000MW of power in Ghana. \nThe Sankofa Gas field will come on stream in 2018 when gas from other fields is expected to decline. \n'The Tweneboa-Enyenra-Ntomme Fields Development is 57 percent complete and the project is on course to meet the deadline in gas supply and bring on stream additional gas and crude oil supplies in the second half of 2016. \n'Work on the Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure project is completed. However, some ancillary works are still ongoing. This will improve power output and the prospect for power exports. \nCurrently, the Atuabo Gas Processing plant is delivering 80mmscf of gas/day for thermal plants at Aboadze, as well as 400 metric tons of LPG a day to the domestic market.' \nBy Samuel Boadi", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:21:29.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
