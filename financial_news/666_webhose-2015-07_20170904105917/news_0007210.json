It gives time for the internal people to show what they can do and it gives time to identify thoroughly the (external) people that haven't been identified in other searches,\" he added. \nBarclays finance director Tushar Morzaria is the favourite to succeed Jenkins. If he is chosen, McFarlane may want to work alongside Morzaria as executive chairman for a substantial period to speed up the bank's turnaround plan . \nOther candidates could include Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) executive Colm Kelleher or Australia and New Zealand Bank CEO Mike Smith, industry sources said. \nIf Barclays opts for an external candidate, it could take up to a year for the new recruit to take the reins, depending on the conditions of their current contract. \nChairman John McFarlane is in no hurry to find a new CEO \nMcFarlane, who became Barclays chairman in April , is assuming executive duties until a permanent successor is in place as he did at insurer Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) in 2012. On that occasion he was executive chairman for eight months. \nOne of the key tasks will be to accelerate changes to Barclays' investment bank, expected to be further slimmed down to cut costs and improve profitability. \nThe bank played down a report in The Times that investment bank head boss Tom King would leave the bank by next March. \n\"Tom King is fully committed to leading the investment bank and on the implementation of the operational plan agreed with the board just two weeks ago. There are no plans in regards to Mr King's departure from Barclays,\" a spokeswoman said on Friday. \nKing had considered retiring early after a row last month with Jenkins over the scale of cuts in the investment bank, but was persuaded to stay by McFarlane, a source said previously.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:58:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
