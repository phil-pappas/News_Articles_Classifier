An earlier-than-estimated revision of the target is seen hurting the government’s credibility and worsening the outlook for an economy set for the worst recession in 25 years.\n“That could certainly jeopardize the nation’s credit rating,” Jason Vieira, the chief economist at Infinity Asset Management, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “It would be terrible news for the economy and for investors alike.”\nBrazilian stocks had entered a bull market in April, after rallying more than 20 percent from this year’s low, amid speculation that government measures would help shore up the budget and avoid the loss of the nation’s investment-grade status. Since then, the shares have dropped 10 percent on concern that Congress opposition to Rousseff’s belt-tightening agenda would make the administration’s goals harder to achieve.\nThe Ibovespa retreated 1.1 percent to 50,916.63 at 1:45 p.m. in Sao Paulo, led by oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Banco do Brasil SA fell the most among banks, while lender Itau Unibanco Holding SA extended a four-day rout. The real slid 1.7 percent to 3.2240 per dollar, the most in two months.\nSpending Cuts President Rousseff has been reducing spending and increasing taxes to stave off another downgrade after Standard & Poor’s cut the nation’s rating to the cusp of junk in March 2014. Moody’s Investors Service, which met with officials in Brazil last week, has a negative outlook on the country’s Baa2 rating, the second-lowest level of investment grade.\nAnalysts surveyed by the central bank forecast the government will miss its 2015 primary budget surplus target of 1.1 percent of gross domestic product. Rousseff decided to lower the fiscal goal in a meeting with the nation’s economic team last night, Folha de S. Paulo newspaper reported, without saying how it got the information.\nWhile a downgrade of Brazil’s credit rating to junk in 2015 is unlikely, Citigroup Inc. says that such a move is possible next year, depending on the pace of economic recovery.\n“Brazil’s rating is under renewed scrutiny,” Eric Ollom, a debt strategist at Citigroup in New York, wrote in a note to clients. “Banks are most exposed.”\nA gauge of financial shares in the MSCI Brazil index extended this year’s plunge to 19 percent, led by Banco do Brasil. Itau and Banco Bradesco SA slumped at least 1.4 percent.\nHering, Vale Century-old retailer Cia. Hering sank to a five-year low, pacing losses among companies that depend on domestic demand. Vale SA, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, followed a slide in commodities to a 13-year low. Power utility Energias do Brasil SA rose after Bradesco’s brokerage unit raised the stock to the equivalent of buy.\nA wider-than-forecast current account deficit also weighed on Brazilian markets Wednesday. The central bank reported that while the gap in the broadest measure of trade in goods and services narrowed in June, it was wider than the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\nThe real extended this year’s slide to 18 percent, the most among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Swap rates fell 0.03 percentage point to 13.30 percent on the contract maturing in January 2017, the lowest level on a closing basis since May 28.\nThe cost to protect against a Brazil default surged to the highest level since March. The nation’s five-year credit-default swaps advanced as much as 13 basis points to 278. The measure dropped on Tuesday after Finance Minister Joaquim Levy said Brazil’s government will make budget cuts if required as it strives to meet this year’s fiscal targets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T20:01:18.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
