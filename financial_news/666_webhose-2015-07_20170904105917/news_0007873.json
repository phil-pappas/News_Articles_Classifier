By offering a complete line to our customers, grocers will be able to meet the needs of every type of consumer seeking coconut products, eliminating the reason to shop elsewhere.” \nTrailblazer has sold sweetened and unsweetened shredded and flaked coconut for over 15 years, and the company has deep experience and longstanding relationships with coconut processors in Southeast Asia. Trailblazer has leveraged these relationships to secure favorable pricing. \nThe company’s coconut experts have personally visited coconut processors in Indonesia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and the Philippines and have determined which operations adhere to the strictest global food safety standards. For most of Trailblazer’s competitors, the supply chain for coconut products is long and complex, but Trailblazer is able to work directly with premium vendors. The company is also able to provide retailers with a complete collection of products under one label, removing the need for multiple suppliers and invoices. \nAll the coconut products are available to grocers as of July 1, with the exception of coconut milk, which will be available in September. Trailblazer is marketing the products under the Trailblazer Foods brand, but retailers can also order private-label versions. For pricing details please call the sales team at 503-666-5800. \nFor more information on Trailblazer Foods, its history in the Pacific Northwest, and the company’s product and service capabilities, visit www.trailblazerfoods.com . \nAbout Trailblazer Foods \nInspired by the rich agricultural bounty of the Pacific Northwest, Trailblazer Foods was incorporated in 1984.
