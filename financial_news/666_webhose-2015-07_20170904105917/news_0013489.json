An online survey went live on Thursday, asking consumers to describe their experiences of accessing their cash, to provide details about fees and charges and of any justifications for these from pensions providers.

One explicitly asks: “Has the existence of an exit charge impacted on any decisions you have made to access the pension flexibilities?” \nConsumers are also asked to provide “as much information as possible” if they have been charged an exit penalty for cashing in their pension early, including how it was calculated, and the reasons their provider gave for imposing it. \nThe survey, which is open to those who have accessed pensions cash and those who are considering it, will run in tandem with a 12-week industry consultation promised by Chancellor George Osborne last month. \nThis will consider whether exit charges should be capped, or whether a voluntary industry-led approach would work. \nThe industry has consistently played down the need for a cap on early exit fees, stating these generally apply to older pension schemes. \n“No pensions sold on the market today have early exit fees and nearly nine out of 10 people making use of the pension freedoms will not face an early exit fee,” said Ben Gaukrodger, savings policy manager at the Association of British Insurers. \nHowever, Danny Cox, chartered financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was not a small problem because older policies were “riddled with exit penalties”. A voluntary cap was highly unlikely to work, he said. \n“Given that the worst of the exit penalty offenders are from providers who no longer seek new customers, there are no market forces to incentivise them to change.” \nSince the reforms came into force, pension savers have cashed in more than £1.8bn. Consumer groups were quick to point out that even if a cap were introduced, it would come too late for many. \n“Our research shows that over a quarter of over 55s with a pension are planning to make, or are in the process of making a withdrawal,” said Hannah Maundrell, editor-in-chief of the advice website Money.co.uk. \n“There is bound to be a peak of interest at the start of the initiative. My concern is by the time the changes are implemented many will already be hugely out of pocket.” \nThe Treasury said the consultation would explore options to address exit charges, including a legislative cap “if there is sufficient evidence”. \nThere is very limited research on the prevalence of exit fees, although Ros Altmann, the pensions minister, has already instructed the Financial Conduct Authority and the Pensions Regulator to gather information from the industry about fees and charges. \nThe Department of Work and Pensions believes that as many as one-in-10 savers in workplace pensions could be affected by transfer charges. \nThe consultation will also address how to make transferring a pension from one provider to another quicker and smoother, and further clarity on financial advice for consumers.
