The problem has been exacerbated in recent weeks by a French ferry workers' strike which has blocked traffic around the port. \nMay said the secure waiting area would hold 230 vehicles, the equivalent of a 2.5 mile (4 km) queue of traffic. \n\"This should transform protection for lorries and their drivers - removing them from the open road where they can become targets for migrants attempting to board their vehicles,\" May said in a statement to parliament. \nMay's office said the zone would be policed by French authorities and was expected to be operating before December. It would replace an existing 90-lorry waiting area, and be set up behind established fences, which French and British authorities are working to improve. \nMay said that over 8,000 attempts by illegal migrants to enter Britain were successfully intercepted by border authorities between 21 June and 11 July.
