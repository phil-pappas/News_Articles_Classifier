The government revised construction spending data going back to January 2013. \nThe construction spending report added to robust data on employment, consumer spending, consumer confidence and housing, in suggesting that growth was gaining steam after gross domestic product shrank at a 0.2 percent annual rate in the first \nquarter. \nThe economy was hit by bad weather, port disruptions, a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector at the start of the year. \nIn May, construction spending was lifted by a 0.9 percent increase in private construction spending to the highest level since July 2008. Outlays on private residential construction rose 0.3 percent, reflecting gains in home building and a slight increase in renovations. \nSpending on private non-residential construction projects increased 1.5 percent to the highest level since December 2008. \nPublic construction outlays rose 0.7 percent to a seven-month high. Spending on state and local government projects - the largest portion of the public sector segment -gained 0.2 percent, also touching a seven-month high. \nFederal government outlays jumped 6.3 percent after two straight months of declines. \n(Reporting By Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci) Read the original article on Reuters .
