Sources have said Tanaka and Sasaki would resign in the coming months and most of the board would be replaced to take responsibility for the shortcomings. \nThe report says much of the improper accounting, stretching back to fiscal 2008, was intentional and would have been difficult for auditors to catch. \nThe report said Tanaka and Sasaki, who were also successive presidents, had set operating profit targets that the heads of divisions were required to meet, applying pressure by hinting at withdrawing from areas that underperformed. \n\"Within Toshiba, there was a corporate culture in which one could not go against the wishes of superiors,\" the report said. \n\"Therefore, when top management presented 'challenges', division presidents, line managers and employees below them continually carried out inappropriate accounting practices to meet targets in line with the wishes of their superiors.\" \nThe investigation comes as Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying to improve the country's corporate governance in order to attract more foreign investors. \nThis is the country's biggest business scandal since camera and medical equipment maker Olympus Corp's 13-year cover-up of $1.7 billion in losses blew up in late 2011. \nThe scandal also shakes a stalwart of Japanese industry. Toshiba remains Japan's 10th-biggest company by assets and market value despite its stock price falling 26 percent since the scandal surfaced in early April. \nToshiba has not been able to close its books for the latest year because of the probe, which also forced the company to cancel its annual dividend. \nTanaka and Sasaki will likely step down and more than half of the board will be replaced at a shareholders' meeting in September, sources said. \nThe committee is to hold a news conference at 7 p.m. (11.00 a.m. BST) on Tuesday, according to the filing. \n(Additional reporting by Reiji Murai, Taro Fuse and Takahiko Wada; Editing by William Mallard and Mike Collett-White)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T19:42:35.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
