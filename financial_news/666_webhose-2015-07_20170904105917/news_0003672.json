Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston Queensland developer Citimark has lodged an application for 775 apartments at Surfers Paradise, building up its workbook of high-rise apartments at the Gold Coast to almost $1 billion.\nThe company, headed by Angus Johnson and Robert Pullar, has also lodged a development application for a $110 million, 21-storey apartment high-rise at Chevron Island at the Gold Coast and has already received a separate development approval for another $160 million, 45-storey apartment high-rise to be named the Markwell a block away from Queensland's tallest tower Q1.\nWestpac's St George bank is backing the Markwell project in the first sign of traditional banks re-entering the Gold Coast market which scorched the big banks during the financial crisis.\nIn the last 12 months a surge of investment from Asia-backed developers such as the Wanda Group, into residential projects, coupled with billions of dollars in infrastructure and a falling Australian dollar which fuels tourism, has provided much-needed impetus to the Gold Coast.\nOn Chevron Island on the Gold Coast, Citimark plans a high-rise apartment project over 21 levels. \"The Gold Coast was one of the most significantly over-supplied apartment markets in the country,\" Mr Johnson said, \"Now it is the most under-supplied.\"\n\"The severity of the last downturn means the Gold Coast has been ignored. The lessons learnt from the financial crisis are still in the forefront of banks' minds. But there is now an appetite from traditional lenders.\"\nHe said the lending criteria from banks for new Gold Coast projects was \"reasonable\" but \"prudent\".\nCheaper than Brisbane Mr Johnson, the former chairman of the Brisbane Lions AFL team, has achieved significant success in Brisbane with more than 90 per cent of the company's Hercules high-rise project at Hamilton sold before construction. But he expects the costs for his Gold Coast towers will be considerably cheaper compared with the Brisbane market where there is plenty of competition for workers and materials in the current apartment boom .\nHe also expects growth in interstate buyers for his apartments where average prices in the Markwell will be about $8000 per square metre.\n\"The median apartment price gap between Sydney and the Gold Coast has never been so big,\" he said.\n\"The Gold Coast market is offering exceptionally good value when compared with the Brisbane and southern markets and we believe the market there is changing significantly.\"\nCitimark's Chevron Island project, which will have 148 apartments, and its 775 apartment development at Surfers Paradise, are yet to be named. Architects Cottee Parker have designed both projects.\nThe company's project book has made it a clear leader in local private developers now burrowing in at the Gold Coast. The company has other land and town housing projects as well.\nOther private developers are banking on a Gold Coast comeback with Harry Triguboff's Meriton already constructing a 40-storey residential tower at the Gold Coast's Southport.\nThere has been more than $600 million in development sites sold to Asian-backed developers in the last 12 months and offshore groups such as Ho Bee are well under way with residential, high-rise projects.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/102874628957085545973", "http://www.citimark.com.au/", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-07-16T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:11:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
