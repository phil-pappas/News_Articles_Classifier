The 50-scrip Nifty had closed previous week at 8,521.55. This week, we give in the table below Friday’s (31 July 2015) daily variation in major indices in the stock market. The market has ended flat, if we consider a whole week. Within the week, the major indices have fallen and regained to nearly the same level. Hence, the same forecast of an upmove in the medium term. India Vix closed at 14.57, down 4.93%. NSE turnover was at 101.82 crore on Friday. On Monday, the market was in a bear grip with the Nifty closing at 8,361.00. The news, over the weekend, that Participatory Notes (P-Notes) should be under the black money scanner unnerved the stock markets and the indices recorded a steep dive. The special investigation team (SIT) on black money has suggested the inclusion. The market is also seeking further clarity on the recommendations made by the Justice AP Shah committee on minimum alternate tax (MAT) and the new financial code. Next day, proposed regulations on foreign funds coupled with worries over retrospective tax and the continuing slide in Chinese markets subdued investor sentiment in the Indian equity markets as well. In a volatile session on Tuesday, the 50-stock benchmark moved mostly in the green up to 1.29pm. However, after this, Nifty slid down. Its effort to revive failed and finally it closed in the red for the fourth consecutive session at 8,337.00. Bargain hunting coupled with subsiding of US rate hike fears on Wednesday propelled Indian equity markets to close in the green. Indian markets remained in the positive zone due to the consistent buying ahead of the July futures and options (F&O) expiry on Thursday. Analysts pointed out that better-than-expected corporate results from the US and hopes that US Federal Reserve will postpone interest rate hike supported markets. Nifty closed Wednesday at 8,375.05. On Thursday, the major indices in the Indian stock markets were range bound and recorded marginal gains. Nifty declined after hitting a high of 8,459. Clarity regarding P-Notes, the Indian government's push for reforms and the expiry of July derivative contracts, coupled with the US Fed's decision to keep interest rates intact, improved investor sentiments on Thursday. The 50-stock Nifty closed at 8,421.80. This further built up on Friday to lead to recovery in the market to its previous week’s levels. Capital infusion in banks, clarity on retrospective tax on capital gains and expectations of a rate cut by the apex bank cheered investor sentiments and boosted Indian equity markets on Friday, in particular. The positive cues propelled the 30-scrip Sensex to close the day up by 409 points or 1.48% at 28,114.56 points. The wider 50-scrip Nifty also made gains and closed 111 points or 1.32% up at 8,532.85 points. Overall, the week’s trading has been influenced by Indian government policies on overseas investors in India and international stock market cues. The Indian stock markets have hardly been able to work on their strengths for a serious rally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T21:49:30.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
