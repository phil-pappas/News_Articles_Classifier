Paul Jones Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell The most recent slide in the Australian dollar after months of trading in a two-cent range has wide repercussions for a number of stocks - boosting some, while weighing on others.\nOn Tuesday morning the Aussie was trading just below US74¢ cents, having fallen nearly 10 per cent from recent highs around US81.6¢ in mid-May. The currency has dropped more than 20 per cent over the past 12 months.\n\"The year has seen a number of rotations; however the one constant has been the downward pressure on the currency,\" Macquarie Wealth Management researchers said in a note to investors.\nThe increased volatility in the wake of the most recent iteration of the Greek debt crisis and the ongoing instability of Chinese share markets will also be factors influencing Australian equities.\nThe Australian dollar has weakened 8.8 per cent this year. CSL, Amcor, Sonic Healthcare and ComputerShare are all rated to outperform by Macquarie Research, which is also tipping Ramsay Health Care, Telstra, Coca-Cola Amatil and Brambles to rise during the currency depression.\nMacquarie has also flagged ten stocks its expects will fall during the currency depression, including miners such as Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals, as well as a Seek, Flight Centre Travel, and BlueScope Steel. Also likely to drop were Challenger, ALS, Worley Parsons, Transpacific Industrials, and Sims Metal Management.\nHere are ten stocks to watch as the dollar drops.\nTipped to rise: CSL Limited Telstra is up 13.71 per cent since June 2014 and analysts say its reputation as a safe stock will see it continue to rise. Paul Jones The biopharmaceutical company's shares have been increasing in value for at least a year, trading at $89.45 on Tuesday morning, up 25.7 per cent from June 2014 despite getting slammed in February on the back of poor results and forecasts.\n\"Stocks that historically performed well when the Australian dollar is falling, have low volatility and a strong Quant score include CSL Limited,\" Macquarie researchers said.\nThe stock was trading at $89.35 on Tuesday morning, up by slightly more than a quarter in the last year. The majority of analysts are recommending a 'buy' (82.4 per cent) with only three of 17 analysts recommending investors sell their CSL shares.\nTipped to rise: Ramsay Health Care Rio Tinto's shares are down almost 15 per cent in the last year, and are tipped to fall further. Louise Douvis Private health care and insurance provider Ramsay Health Care has also been enjoying a growing share price on the back of the dropping dollar. Its shares were trading at $61.58 on Tuesday morning, up 32 per cent on the previous year's price.\nThe share is well placed to benefit from an aging population, but the Macquarie research highlights its dependable growth and returns. It has a stable, above-market average growth rate of 18 per cent.\nTipped to rise: Telstra Australian equity mainstay Telstra is also tipped to enjoy a lift as the dollar drops off as its reliability and size will stand it in good stead as investors seek security.\n\"In a higher risk environment, investors reward defensive factors. Large cap stocks outperform along with those with stable earnings, strong profitability and supportive valuations,\" Macquarie researchers said.\nOn Tuesday morning it was trading at $6.23, up 13.71 per cent since June 2014.\nTipped to rise: Amcor Also already rising are shares in Amcor, which have risen by 28.72 per cent in the last year to $13.48 on Tuesday morning.\nThe packaging company reports in US dollars, which means a fall in the Aussie dollar will deliver a boost to the share price.\nEarlier this month, Morgans equity strategist Andrew Tang recommended buying the stock on the back of its defensive strengths.,\n\"Given its defensive characteristics, we think the stock should be well supported in the current volatile environment,\" Mr Tang said.\nTipped to rise: Coca-Cola Amatil Coca-Cola Amatil investors could do with some good news: the stocks were trading for $9.24 on Tuesday morning, down 22.53 per cent from last year.\nMacquarie researchers are predicting this decline to turn around and tipped the beverage producer's stocks to rise, due to the company's relatively low volatility. Shares have been trading between $10 and $15 for five years, prior to a drop to around $9 in March.\nChief executive Alison Watkins said in May the company was likely to be boosted by lower commodity prices but their major challenge would be price competitiveness amid rivals as well as profit sustainability amid warring supermarket companies.\nTipped to drop: Rio Tinto Despite its large size and considerable diversification, Macquarie Research is tipping Rio Tinto's shares to decline as the dollar drops, terms of trade deteriorate and commodities come under pressure.\nOn Tuesday morning, Rio Tinto's shares were trading at $51.53, down almost 15 per cent in the last year.\n\"The correlation between the currency and commodity prices has also normalised to high levels after a dislocation driven by the carry trade,\" Macquarie researchers said.\nTipped to drop: Seek The former digital darling has come under pressure and lost more than 12 per cent of its share price in the last month after it announced a revised profit forecast.\nWhile JP Morgan recommended buying its shares given its strong track record and the stock rising in value by 28.78 per cent in the last year, Macquarie Research is expecting a decline in value as the dollar declines.\nThe rising dollar will make its education offerings more expensive in an industry chief executive Andrew Bassat has warned is increasingly competitive.\nTipped to drop: Flight Centre Travel The declining dollar will make travel more expensive for Australians, which is likely to hit one of the leading listed travel agencies: Flight Centre Travel.\nFlight Centre has faced sustained downward pressure as the currency began its significant and continuous slide since June last year. In that period it has lost about a third of its value to trade at $33.0 on Tuesday morning.\nTipped to drop: BlueScope Steel Bluescope Steel is readying to close its Port Kembla plant amid bleak forecasts for steel prices as the world's largest steel consumer, China, begins to slow its rapid growth programs.\nThe declining dollar will also make terms of trades less favourable for the steel exporter, while the lower iron ore prices will make cheaper steel producers in China and elsewhere more attractively priced and therefore more competitive.\nBlueScope Steel was trading at $3.04 on Tuesday morning, down just 3.61 per cent since last year.\nTipped to drop: Fortescue Metals Fortescue Metals Group is one of the most precariously placed large miners given its significant exposure to fluctuations in the iron ore price.\nAfter the iron ore price lost more than a third of its price last week before a modest recovery, the stock price has been trading at around $1.72, more than 50 per cent below its trading rate in June 2014.\n\"Our economics team currently forecast future deterioration in the Australian dollar as a weak economic outlook drives possible further rate cuts and the terms of trade continue to deteriorate,\" Macquarie researchers said.\nAlso on Tuesday, equities strategist Marcus Padley shared a list of what the declining dollar will do for Australian-dollar sensitive stocks.\nThe $A has fallen 4% this month. This is a list of currency affected stocks that tend to benefit from a fall. #asx pic.twitter.com/jIyWJNR8Zf\n— Marcus Padley (@Marcus_Today) July 14, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Marcus_Today/status/620761608797577216", "http://t.co/jIyWJNR8Zf", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%24A&src=ctag", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/asx?src=hash", "https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-14T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:14:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
