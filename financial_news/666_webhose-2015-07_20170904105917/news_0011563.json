Investors believe that gold is likely to provide protection against inflation. This role of gold for household investment has been universal across various cultures, geographies and time periods. Further, gold acts as an international currency and provide insulation to investors in countries where the national currency experiences sharp erosion in value due to a macro-economic shock. \nMost households in India too have traditionally preferred to invest in gold – and typically in its physical form. This is despite the fact that being a physical commodity, owning gold not only did not give any kind of income (such as dividend or coupon), but rather involved incurring a storage cost. \nRecent experience \nIn recent times gold has gotten increasingly financialized, and there are a large number of investors that are able to participate in the “financial” gold instruments such as gold futures and gold ETFs. Further, the traditional role of gold is getting questioned due to the large volatility in its prices on a day to day basis, relative to changes in macro variables which happen over a much longer horizon. Thus investors in gold have witnessed that gold prices in the short term have moved quite independently of inflation rates. \nHowever despite these issues, when one looks at the long term picture, gold prices over the longer term have provided protection against inflation – and that is where the ultimate role of gold comes in. Returns Annualised Over 10 years (2004-2010) Gold \nSource: Bloomberg, Gold: INR price of Gold, Inflation: WPI Inflation \n\nGold in India \nIn the domestic context, Gold prices in India are a function of global gold prices (stated in Dollar terms) as well as the performance of the Indian Rupee against the US Dollar. Given the history of persistent high inflation in India relative to the rest of the world, the Indian Rupee has over the years lost value compared to the US Dollar as well as other developed market currencies. Gold has been the rare investment that has been able to protect Indian investors from this erosion as well as during shorter term episodes of extreme currency volatility. This is doubly crucial in light of the lack of global investment options available to Indian investors that provide a hedge against the Rupee. \nHow to look at gold allocation in the portfolio \nTo summarize, the key role that is expected from gold investment is to provide protection against erosion of paper currency and macro-economic shocks. Thus gold should be perceived as a risk reducing rather than a wealth generating investment. The role of wealth generation can be done by other traditional investments such as equity and debt. Therefore for investors looking at their portfolio and asset allocation the proper approach would be to look at a diversified basket that allocates between all the 3 key asset classes – equity, debt and gold. Such an approach has the added advantage of improving the risk-return of the overall portfolio on account of the low (in fact, negative) correlation that gold enjoys compared to both equity and debt.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T16:33:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
