Bloomberg by Ewin Hannan Workplace Editor Coles has been forced to lift the pay of casual workers after the intervention of the Fair Work Commission..\nThe commission on Friday approved a deal covering 77,000 Coles employees after the supermarket giant addressed concerns that young and casual workers would have been disadvantaged in comparison to the retail award. Coles said 27,765 casual employees and 18,273 workers under 21 would fall within the agreement.\nWhile the proposed agreement contained 'superior wage rates' with annual increases and improvements to public holiday and leave entitlements for adult workers, the commission said casual and younger workers would have been subject to a number of conditions that were less beneficial than the award.\nColes gave an undertaking to lift the casual loading rate from 20 to 25 per cent, while the percentage pay rate for 17 and 18 year olds would be increased to 60 per cent and 70 per cent respectively of the adult rate.\nThe deal retains Sunday penalty rates for adults that are half the rate - 50 per cent compared to 100 per cent - of the award\nCasual and junior employees would also be able to request evidence that their take home pay for any four week roster cycle was greater under the new agreement than what they would have received under the award.\n\"The undertakings provided by Coles address the commission's concerns, in particular the casual loading and percentage pay rates for junior team members are now aligned with the respective entitlements under the award,\" Commissioner Geoff Bull said in his decision on Friday.\n\"The reconciliation undertaking ensures that casuals and junior employees have the right to review their take home pay in comparison to what they would have received under the Award. Further, in the event that such employees were found to have received less take home pay under the Agreement they will be entitled to a reconciliation top up payment.\n The deal between Coles and the shop assistants union has been approved by a ballot of workers but been subject to objections by the meatworkers union.\nCommissioner Bull said \"taking into account the relatively higher rates of pay under the agreement and the undertakings provided by Coles, I am satisfied that the agreement results in employees being better off overall under the agreement.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:04:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
