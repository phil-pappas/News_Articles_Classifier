That compared with an average 0.5 percent increase predicted by analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The figure excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency fluctuations.\nThe quarter marks the second consecutive gain after three years of dwindling sales. Vodafone this week shook up its management structure, removing Europe-level executives and asking heads of individual countries to report directly to Chief Executive Officer Vittorio Colao. The company is increasingly relying on a surge in mobile data demand in Africa and new customers in India to offset weaker Europe markets such as Italy and Spain.\nTotal sales rose 3.3 percent in the quarter to 10.1 billion pounds. Service revenue in the U.K. rose 0.2 percent, while Europe as a whole grew 1.5 percent to 5.97 billion pounds. The African, Middle Eastern and Asian businesses boosted sales 6.1 percent to 2.99 billion pounds after adding 4.3 million customers.\nVodafone shares rose 2 percent to 236.55 pence at 8:15 a.m. in London, giving the company a market capitalization of 62.7 billion pounds. The stock has gained 6.1 percent this year.\nIndian IPO Vodafone is reviewing its business in India, where service revenue grew 6.9 percent as more customers started adopting mobile data plans. The company may hold an initial public offering for the business as a result, an option Vodafone’s considered for years, Chief Financial Officer Nick Read said on a call with reporters Friday.\nInvestment bank Rothschild is compiling a report about the benefits of an IPO , a person familiar with the matter said in May. The report is set to be delivered in August, the person said.\nVodafone is renewing network spending and moving into cable, television and home-phone services. The company bought Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, a German cable business, and Spain’s Grupo Corporativo Ono SA last year. The inclusion of those businesses helped push up the company’s growth rates, Vodafone said.\nGerman Challenges Service revenue in Germany, Vodafone’s biggest business by sales, fell 1.2 percent, including Kabel Deutschland. Without the acquisition, revenue would’ve fallen 3.5 percent. The business had struggled with sub-par network performance that cost Vodafone customers. The unit’s CEO Jens Schulte-Bockum resigned in May and will be replaced by Hannes Ametsreiter, previously the head of Telekom Austria AG, in October .\nLiberty Global Plc could be Vodafone’s next target for consolidation. Vodafone said in June that it’s in talks with billionaire John Malone’s cable empire about asset swaps. Malone himself has said that Vodafone would make a “great fit” for his company, comparing it to a “big banana in the jar” -- tempting, but potentially difficult to extract.\nThere hasn’t been any change in the status of talks with Liberty Global about asset swaps, Colao said on the call.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:35:11.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
