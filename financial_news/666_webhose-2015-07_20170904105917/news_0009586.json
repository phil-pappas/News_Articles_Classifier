It has also talked of \"the physical and social harm\" caused by drugs.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Saudi Execution,Saif al-Hadissane,ramadan,Eid al-Fitr,Amnesty International Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:53:12.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
