Naturally, we need to respond with speed to streamline our operations in line with the business performance,\" he wrote. \"With immediate effect all external recruitment and internal promotions are frozen. Exceptions must be authorised by the relevant business director, human resources director and chief operating officer.\" \nPemhiwa said the beverage manufacturer had also frozen the recruitment of student interns until further notice. \nHe said the volumes \"remain soft\", creating the need to rationalise operations and reduce the company headcount. \nPemhiwa said only training intervention that drove productivity would be considered, adding that interventions which did not directly impact on productivity \"must be temporarily shelved\". \nOn overtime, Pemhiwa said there would be strict monitoring of extra hours put in by staff. \n\"As a matter of discipline, all overtime must be fully justified prior and signed off at executive level. Furthermore, the business will institute other measures aimed at driving this cost down while maintaining efficiencies, for example, shift re-configurations,\" Pemhiwa wrote. \nHe also instructed that leave liability be driven downwards to an average of 30 days by September this year. \n\"Once the leave plans kick in and shifts are revised in line with declining volumes etc, there is an expectation of a corresponding reduction in canteen costs,\" he wrote to managers. \n\"HR and respective HODs, please drive these vigorously as a first step in order to avoid other more painful measures.\" \nDelta's company secretary Alex Makamure would neither confirm nor deny the letter but said its contents addressed issues that any business should deal with to survive in the current operating environment. \n\"The internal memorandum circulating in the social media addresses issues that any business should deal with to survive in the current operating environment. It, however, does not talk about retrenchments. We have on numerous occasions indicated that we have flexibility in managing headcount through the pool of fixed term contract employees,\" Makamure said. \nIn the quarter ended June 30, Delta recorded a decline in volumes across all categories. \nLager volume declined by 8%, sparkling beverages recorded a 15% decline with the Maheu and dairy mix beverages recording a 11% drop due to depressed consumer spending attributed to weak macro-economic performance.
