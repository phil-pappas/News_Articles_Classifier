Chris Pearce by Sarah Thompson Jonathan Shapiro James Eyers The Abbott government will conduct the first full-scale audit of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in 17 years, laying the groundwork for a major overhaul in how the corporate watchdog is funded and operated.\nThe \"capability review\" to be announced on Friday by Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg​ will take until the end of the year to complete and will examine how well ASIC is faring in its role of policing corporate Australia.\nThe review follows recommendations from David Murray's Financial System Inquiry report , released in late 2014, which advocated a review of the capability of all major regulators every three to five years.\nASIC, which has been subject to several parliamentary inquiries because of its failure to prevent widespread misconduct in the financial planning industry , was the logical candidate to face the first review, government sources said.\nAn ASIC spokesperson declined to comment.\nAn expert panel has been appointed to conduct the review. It will be headed by Karen Chester, a full-time commissioner with the Productivity Commission; Mark Gray, the former chief executive of the Queensland Treasury; and David Galbally​, a barrister with litigation and dispute resolution experience. The review will call on external private sector and public consultants to evaluate how effective ASIC is in using its powers.\nThe review will examine how ASIC identifies and prioritises immediate and future risks, and how it allocates resources between surveillance, education, policy, enforcement and litigation. ASIC's governance culture and the skills of its staff will also be examined.\nThe corporate watchdog receives around $300 million in annual funding and employs over 1500 staff. Since its formation as a result of the 1998 Wallis inquiry, its remit has been expanded to include regulatory supervision, consumer lender and investor protection.\n 'User-pays' option In market surveillance, it is responsible for securities exchanges, corporations, financial reporting and market infrastructure, while among investors, it oversees financial advisers, fund managers, superannuation funds, investment banks, banks and some small businesses.\nThe review will help the government decide whether to shift ASIC's funding to a \"user-pays\" system.\nASIC chairman Greg Medcraft​ has pushed for user-pays on the grounds that if the industry funded regulation, it would be a better outcome for the government. Such a model would increase costs for financial services.\nA change in funding is one of a number of major recommendations proposed by the Murray inquiry that would increase ASIC's budget and powers.\nThe inquiry backed a user-pays model that it said \"would result in greater cost accountability for ASIC and regular consultation with stakeholders to establish the funding level\".\nThe inquiry advocated tougher penalties for financial misconduct. Controversially, it called for \"product intervention\", which would allow ASIC to review and restrict certain financial products before they are marketed to investors rather than rely on increased disclosures to protect investors. The inquiry also called for changes that would allow ASIC to better compete with the private sector for talent.\nWhile these points were highlighted in the inquiry's report, the need for a review is seen as a first step before embarking on other major changes.\nThe Financial System Inquiry said a capability review \"would help to ensure ASIC has the appropriate skills and culture to adopt a flexible risk-based approach to its future role\".\n​The government's review may be regarded in some quarters as a threat to ASIC in its current form and a chance for Mr Medcraft to demonstrate why it needs more funding and greater power to pursue white-collar crime and curb the sale of unsuitable products.\nMr Medcraft, who was appointed by the Labor government in May 2011 to replace Tony D'Aloisio​, is entering the final year of his five-year term as ASIC chairman. Mr Medcraft is also the chair of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which has given him global influence.\nThe review will compare ASIC to international peers and is set to be completed by the end of the year.\nMr Frydenberg, who has commissioned the review, has outlined his ambition to restore integrity to the financial sector in the wake of financial advice-related scandals, but without a hike in compliance costs. Earlier this year, he visited the Financial Conduct Authority, Britain's corporate watchdog.\nLast week, its chief executive Martin Wheatley, who headed IOSCO's review of financial benchmarks in the wake of the \"Libor\" rate-rigging scandal, quit after he learnt his term would not be renewed by the Conservative government's chancellor, George Osborne .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:11:26.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
