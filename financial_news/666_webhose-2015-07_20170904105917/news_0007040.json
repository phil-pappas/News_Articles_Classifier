Organized by the Orange County Business Journal and Best Companies Group, this county-wide survey and awards program was designed to identify, recognize and honor the best places of employment in Orange County that benefit the county's economy, its workforce and businesses. \"At the end of the day, our firm is only as successful as its employees, and that's why we go above and beyond to recruit and train the best and brightest CPAs. Working with a team of motivated and productive individuals creates a culture to provide excellent client service,\" said Wayne Pinnell, managing partner of Haskell & White. \"Winning this award, now for the fourth time, is very special because it comes from our team.\" The program is an extensive, two-part survey and audit process. The first part consisted of an evaluation of each company's workplace policies, practices and demographics. The second part included a survey that measured each employee's experience with the organization. The combined scores determined the top companies and the final ranking. The final rankings of the winning companies will be released via a special section of the Orange County Business Journal's July 28th issue.
