Rob Gunstone by Geoff Winestock Environment Minister Greg Hunt has given final approval to Shenhua's $1 billion Watermark coal mine project in NSW despite strong protests by farmers and local MP and Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce.\nMr Hunt said the project by the Chinese state-owned firm would have to comply with strict conditions to protect the water and black soil of the surrounding Liverpool plains near Tamworth which are among Australia's best agricultural land.\nShenhua will also have to survey endangered species including the spotted tailed quoll and the large eared pied bat. But Mr Hunt said the project complied with the provisions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act and gave it a green light.\n\"The conditions I have imposed have placed the black soil plains off limits for mining. The project area is restricted to the ridge country around Mt Watermark.\n\"The conditions I have imposed include the power to stop work and stop mining if there are any impacts on agricultural water supply, and if this occurs, the mine must immediately provide an alternate water supply to farmers,\" Mr Hunt said.\nLocal farmers and green groups immediately slammed the decision and argued that it proved that the Nationals, including Mr Joyce, were incapable of defending the interests of local farmers against coal miners. Radio pundit Alan Jones has also been a vigorous critic of the project.\n\"The Liverpool Plains, with rich black soil, excellent water resources and ideal climatic conditions, is one of our most important farming regions and its productivity is 40 per cent above the national average,\" said Greens senator Larissa Waters. The community will be appalled at their local member and Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, who has grossly failed to protect the Liverpool Plains.\"\nJust last week, Mr Joyce told the Northern Daily Leader local news paper that the coal mine was \"an absurdity\" and it would likely have a deleterious effect on local aquifers.\n Mr Hunt specifically rejected this claim. \"The groundwater modelling for the project is robust and ... actual ground water impacts are likely to be smaller than previous conservative predictions.\"\nElection The project received planning approval from the NSW government in January and some have suggested that Mr Hunt delayed federal approval to avoid a backlash at the NSW state election in March. Stephen Galilee, chief executive of the NSW Mining Council, urged locals to accept the decision of the four-year approval process.\n\"There will always be some for which no amount of assessment will ever be enough until the answer is no. However this project has now been rigorously and extensively assessed over many years, including by independent experts, and has now received approval from state and federal governments.\"\nMr Hunt said his approval was the 15th of 17 steps required for mining to proceed. Shenhua will have to provide plans for water management and obtain a mining licence from the NSW government which will trigger a $200 million payment by the company to the NSW government. Given the low coal price it is not clear how fast the company wants to proceed.\nNSW made a significant concession to environmental opposition to coal mines this week when it announced it would change state planning rules to strike out a clause giving higher priority to economic considerations than environmental and social ones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:57:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
