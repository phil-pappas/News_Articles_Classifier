Leadership of the striking doctors, nonetheless, vowed to resume the strike action if the 11 months salary did not hit the accounts of the 60 doctors by 4;30pm tomorrow (Wednesday). They say it will signify a lack commitment on the part of government to uphold the agreement. \nThe Junior doctors have not been paid since they graduated from Medical school and began their 1-year Housemanship training with some government hospitals across the country. Below is the detailed guideline with which the Ministry uses for the payments of salaries of doctors who complete their Housemanship in the country; \nIntroduction: \nThe manual was developed based on the payroll procedure manual developed by the Controller and Accountant General's Department (CAGD) in line with the Financial Administration Regulation, 2004 (LI 1802). The guidelines therefore complement the Payroll Procedure Manual developed by the CAGD. \nPurpose \nThe purpose of these guidelines is to outline the procedures to follow in processing salaries of members of the Ghana Medical Association without compromising the standard payroll procedures which are applicable to other public institutions. It is expected that the entire process should not exceed 3-months. \nBasis for this Guideline \nThese guidelines have been developed following concerns raised by the Ghana Medical Association about challenges faced by its members in having their salaries processed. The CAGD in consultation with the GMA have identified some recruitment procedures for Medical officers which need to be factored in the payroll guidelines. The guidelines mainly cover the procedures for placement of house officers and Medical odfficers on the mechanized payroll by the Ghana Health Service (GHS). \nGuidelines for placement of House Officers \nHouse officers in the health sector are medical officers who complete their medical school and have tro serve their housemanship. The housemanship is, however, compulsory for medical students. These guidelines prescribe the procedure to follow in processing the salaries of house officers in the Ministry of Health (MOH). \nMedical Schools authorities in the country to submit the list of medical students who may be due for their housemanship 2 months before the completion of the medical school to the Ministry of Health. Ministry of health for financial clearance from the Ministry of Finance two days after receipt of the list of the potential house officers from medical schools. \nMinistry of Finance to process financial clearance (or provide feedback to the Ministry) for the house officers within two weeks after receipt of the request from the MOH Medical and dental council to complete posting of house officers within 2 months receipt financial clearance from MOF Heads of facilities are to submit input forms and assumptions of duty letters to the personnel processing section (PPS) of MOH within two weeks of assumption of duty by the house officers. \nMOH is to capture the data for house officers within the months of receipt of data Personnel processing section (PPS) of the MOH shall submit details of the house officers (ie staff ID) to the facilities. The CAGD should submit the payroll data to MOH (Biometric section) 1 week after data capture. \nHealth facilities shall arrange and facilitate the biometric registration of the house officers within 1 month upon receipt of the data from PPS MOH send the biometric data to CAGD within one (1) month after capture CAGD shall process the salaries of the house officers within the month of receipt pf the bio-data from MOH Heads of medical facilities to complete documentation for upgrade of house officer to the senior house officers and submit same to PPS of MOH one (1) month before completing of their first year horsemanship MOH is to process the upgrading of the house of officers using the earlier financial clearance and bio-data captured (no need for financial clearance) and notify MOF/MOH accordingly. \nGuidelines for placement of Medical Officers \nThe guideline prescribes the procedure to follow in the placement of medical officers. The MOH stops the salaries of the house officers after the completion of their housemanship from the payroll system. After the completion of the housemanship, the house officers are upgraded to medical officers after posting to health facilities. However, as a matter of policy, the financial clearance for the housemanship automatically expires. \nHeads of facilities are to submit reports on vacancies for medical officers to the Ministry of Health, two (2) clear months before the end of the housemanships. MOH is to liaise with Ghana Medical Association (GMA) and Medical and Dental Council (MDC) to establish the number of medical officers likely to be recruited in each year. On the basis of the above, MOH within two days of receipt of the estimates submit application for financial clearance to the MOF to respond to the request for financial clearance to MOH within two weeks of receipt of request. \nMedical officers should apply for recruitment into the facilities.
