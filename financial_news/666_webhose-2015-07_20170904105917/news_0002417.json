The purchase of 14.6m shares constituted around one-quarter of the total shareholding. \nThe Faisalabad-based firm has in-house yarn, fabric, processing, printing and knitted apparel facilities, and posted a 52% hike in net profit to PKR195.2m (US$1.9m) in the first quarter of this year. \nEarlier proposals by China's Shandong Ruyi Technology Group to take a majority stake in Masood Textile Mills were called off in September last year. \nChinese firms have been eyeing Pakistan as a destination for investment in the textile and garment sectors following its accession to the EU's GSP+ duty-free scheme in January 2014. \nIn addition, Pakistan’s second Textile Policy aims to double the country’s textile and clothing exports to US$26bn in the next five years. The ambitious plans for the period from 2014-19 will see authorities spend PKR65bn (US$650m) on subsidies and developing the infrastructure to attract investments of US$5bn in the sector. \nUnder the policy, Pakistan’s textile and clothing exporters will be helped by subsidies of 4% on exports of woven and knitted garments, 2% on made-ups, and 1% on dyed and printed fabrics. \nOther key initiatives under the new policy include the creation of a Technology Up-gradation Fund (TUF), low interest rate loans under the Long Term Finance Facility (LTFF), and tax-free imports of machinery for garment makers. Loans under the Export Finance Scheme (EFS) will be provided at 7.5% to garment exporters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T23:33:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
