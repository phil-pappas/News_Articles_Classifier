Cellulosic ethanol costs are expected to converge on conventional costs in 2017 and drop below them in 2018, Raizen executives said. \nThe Piracicaba plant has been operating since December but is still struggling to overcome some of the early obstacles such as excess sand in the machinery and high enzyme costs. The plant can produce 26 million liters a year and plans to expand capacity to 42 million liters/year in October. \nIt is only expected to produce 10 million liters in 2015, however, as it works through operational kinks. \nRaizen hopes eventually to build eight second-generation ethanol plants along side some of its existing conventional sugar and ethanol mills over the coming years. \n(Writing by Reese Ewing; Editing by Bernard Orr)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T23:32:20.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
