But the figure is well below the $180 million the company was aiming for. The company has now re-started operations at its three mines, after shutting them in April in response to plunging iron ore prices. The Australian Stock Exchange later on Friday issued a statement confirming the suspension of trade in Atlas shares would be lifted. They last traded at 12 cents each, well down from the 71 cents of July 2014.
