Photo: AP\nReport after report has recommended Australian investors and funds invest in global equities amid weaker commodity prices, slower local growth and diverging monetary policies. But the case may not be as clear-cut as it seems.\nWhile concerns of Greece collapsing and a hard landing for Chinese equities have calmed, those investing in global equities will grapple with diverging monetary policies.\nThe United States and the United Kingdom are readying to raise interest rates, while Europe and Japan are flooding markets with cheap money through \"quantitative easing\". Meanwhile, commodity exporting countries such as New Zealand and Canada are lowering rates, with the Reserve Bank of Australia also keeping that option open.\nGlobal equity market performance fluctuates significantly. Earlier in 2015, top performing sharemarkets were Russia (up 28 per cent) and Saudi Arabia (up 13 per cent) while increasingly attractive markets such as the United States, China and Japan lagged.\nBut moving factors, particularly falling commodity prices, have investors expecting the opposite in the coming years.\nA survey in late June of more than 700 pension plans, asset managers and sovereign wealth funds shows Australian equities are expected to be among the world's least profitable in the next three years.\nAustralia was joined by commodity-heavy Russia, Latin America, Canada and Eastern Europe in the bottom five spots, according to the research commissioned by Principal Global Investors. The most attractive markets were the United States, Japan, China and India.\nSo far in 2015 (until July 6), the fastest growing markets are Argentina (37.5 per cent), Hungary (30.8) and Jamaica (28.5 per cent), according to a separate report by Bespoke Investment Group.\nTempo Asset Management principal Joe Bracken said superannuation funds' burgeoning size and requirements would push more Australian portfolio managers towards international equity investments.\n\"A lot of the super funds are getting quite large, ending up with capacity constraints with a lot of capital to deploy. Our domestic equity market's range of large companies is quite narrow, so we're definitely beginning to see a trend of moving into more overweight overseas allocations, and increasingly into emerging markets,\" he said.\n\"There has been fantastic outperformance in a lot of ex-Australia markets. Many of those are waning, but there are still opportunities out there, they'll just be different.\"\nMr Bracken added many investors were gravitating towards larger emerging markets such as South Korea and Brazil rather than harder to access and narrower markets such as Pakistan and Peru.\nWill there be disappointments? Despite the rush to invest overseas, Fidelity Australian equities portfolio manager Kate Howitt has no concerns about the future the value and competitiveness of ASX-listed stocks.\n\"Our London-based global equities income fund manger's target is a 3.5 per cent dividend yield, without franking. You can buy most stocks in our market and get a dividend north of that.\"\nMs Howitt is not concerned about the growing chorus insisting the ASX is in for a disappointing few years because the cyclical volatility of commodities already priced into mining stocks and many of Australia's listed companies have significant overseas exposure.\n\"Australia's economy swaps between being mining-led and otherwise regularly. It's true we're at the harder part of the transition, going from relying on mining to wider economy rather than the other way round, but it's a fairly normal thing in our economy.\"\nShe added the mechanics of the Australian economy, the natural refreshing of companies in the top 200 companies in the ASX and the often underestimated power of franking meant she had no doubt the coming years would be profitable for ASX investors.\n\"If you look at our top 100 or so, about 30 to 40 per cent of their sales are done overseas, especially in the health care sector. And there are at least 10 that are among the global top three for its industry niche.\"\nMs Howitt listed companies including Amcor in packaging, Ansell in latex gloves, Brambles in palettes and logistics, CSL and Cochlear in their healthcare niches, ComputerShare, Fonterra, James Hardie in cement construction, Seek in online recruitment, Treasury Wines in vintage wine, and Westfield in high end shopping centre development.\n\"It's also really important to understand we don't just benefit from China building things, we also benefit from increased tourism, migration and housing investment.\"\nThe most interesting dynamic Invesco's global opportunity fund manager, Stephen Anness, manages a targeted fund of fewer than 40 stocks and eschews Australian equities altogether but is looking more closely at emerging markets, including China, where it is yet to make an investment in a listed company.\n\"We spent a huge amount of time assessing companies and we look world-wide for the most promising,\" Mr Anness said.\n\"As the Australian financial stocks fall towards technical corrections, it is likely some will fall into focus or our areas of interest. Although when it comes to commodities, the more interesting dynamic for us is in oil rather than the materials.\"\nInvesco's hunt for investable global equities is currently focused on US financial companies and oil companies. Mr Anness said the recent factors pressuring the performance of both were improving.\nHis fund has invested in Norway's Statoil and Netherland's based Royal Dutch Shell, both of which he believes are likely to reap the benefits of early movement to reduce costs through greater efficiency as the oil price drops.\nUS financials are attractive to Investco as they have raised capital and implemented better processes in light of new regulation launched after the global financial crisis. The fund, which invests a minimum of 120 basis points, holds shares in niche high-net-worth bank First Republic, global investment bank JPMorgan and has recently invested in credit company American Express.\n\"Also for the last 12 months, we've been finding more appealing options in emerging markets. However, given we have such a high conviction requirement for investing, there are some governance issues that are challenging for us to reach that level.\"\nWhile several holdings of this Investco fund have significant exposure to China, the fund is yet to invest in a Chinese-listed company because of governance concerns and high valuations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:37:24.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
