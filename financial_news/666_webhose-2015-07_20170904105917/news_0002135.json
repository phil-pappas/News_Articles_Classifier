Media, PA (PRWEB) July 15, 2015\nTitle Alliance Ltd. , a RESPA-compliant ESOP leader in joint ventured title insurance agencies (Title Alliance), announced today that the 39 regional title agencies under its umbrella, operating in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Maryland, Virginia and Florida, have each successfully passed an independent operational risk assessment evaluation process achieving the highest reliability rating. The risk assessment was performed by Secure Settlements Inc., a New Jersey based firm that created the first independent risk analytics process to screen title and settlement professionals to meet regulatory demands for greater consumer protections in the mortgage industry. The Title Alliance group and their closing professionals passed the rigorous 110 point background evaluation process with the coveted “Low Risk” rating and are now subject to ongoing monitoring in the SSI nationwide settlement agent database.\nBill Cotter, Chairman of Title Alliance said, “We view the successful and independent vetting of the credentials of our company and its affiliates for consumer protection as important to establish greater confidence in the mortgage closing process. We also realize that the lenders whom we service are expected to evaluate and monitor their business partners. By initiating this process on our own, without being asked to do so, we demonstrate to our clients that they’ve made a good business decision to use our agencies.”\nSSI President Andrew Liput stated, “Title Alliance gets it when it comes to transparency and consumer protection. Lenders and borrowers are demanding accountability and want to do business with trustworthy, professional firms. Regulators expect better risk management. Title Alliance clearly meets and exceeds all of those expectations.”\nTitle Alliance joins numerous regional and national title and settlement firms that have embraced independent vetting and monitoring as a professional credential through the SSI risk evaluation program. As their new entities are brought onboard; each employee and entity is required to pass the Secured Settlement Vetting in order to be affiliated with Title Alliance.\nAbout Title Alliance Ltd.\nTitle Alliance Ltd, an ESOP Company located in Media, PA, has been forming successful single and multi-state title joint ventures with lenders, realtors, and builders since 1983 with lenders, mortgage bankers, Realtors, builders and credit unions.
