President Ed Bastian said, “We continue to project flat system capacity growth for the fourth quarter of 2015—a level in line with current demand expectations which should put the business on the right trajectory to stem the erosion in unit revenues by the end of the year.”\nDelta’s second-quarter expenses decreased 9% year-over-year to $8.23 billion and operating profit for the three-month period was $2.47 billion, up 57% over operating income of $1.58 billion in the 2014 June quarter.\nThe Atlanta-based carrier’s second-quarter aircraft fuel bill (including regional operations) lowered 16% year-over-year to $2.47 billion. Without fuel hedging, Delta’s fuel costs would have decreased 40% year-over-year. CFO Paul Jacobson said that adjustments in fuel hedging mean Delta should benefit in line with rivals in terms of fuel cost savings going forward. “We have a fuel hedging policy that’s put us in a position where we’ve been less competitive for the last six months,” he conceded. “But that’s behind us now.” Delta CEO Richard Anderson said he expects “significant fuel savings in the September quarter.”\nDelta’s second-quarter consolidated traffic increased 3% year-over-year to 54.76 billion RPMs on a 3% rise in capacity to 63.94 billion ASMs, producing a load factor of 85.6%, down 0.7 point.
