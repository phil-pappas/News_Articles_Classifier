DRS is performing computer maintenance and system upgrades. \nTaxpayers who attempt to access the center during the weekend will receive a message saying the center is \"currently unavailable due to scheduled maintenance and upgrades.\" DRS chose to make the upgrades this weekend because the dates did not coincide with any filing or payment due dates. \nThink your friends should see this?
