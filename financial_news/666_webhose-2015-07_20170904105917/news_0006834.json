Advertising Print This Post \nA new agreement related to the liquidation of bankrupt brokerage, MF Global, will enable creditors to recoup nearly everything they are owed, marking the impending end of the four-year liquidation process. \nJames Giddens, the trustee, said he would sell various claims held by the brokerage to the plan administrator overseeing the parent’s Chapter 11 case. The administrator would in exchange give up claims in the brokerage’s bankruptcy, according to Reuters . \nThe agreement boosts the recovery by a sum of $186 million, allowing the trustee to pay creditors a total of 94 percent to 95 percent on their claims, including the nearly $1 billion they have already received. \n“This agreement marks a final chapter in the liquidation,” Giddens said in a statement. \nCustomers have already received payments to the tune of $6.7 billion, compensating them in full. \nPrior to its financial woes, the brokerage had been providing exchange-traded derivatives as well as over-the-counter products such as contracts for difference (CFDs), foreign exchange and spread betting. \nAfter a bad bet on European sovereign debt left the company seriously in the red, MF Global made improper transfers totalling more than $891 million from client funds to cover the loses. \nSeven more claims remain, including against auditor PwC and the banks that helped underwrite the bad bonds. Giddens said the brokerage liquidation will end once these are resolved. Got a news tip? Let Us Know FOUND A MISTAKE How do you feel about the article?
