Photo: Daniel Munoz\nThe Senate has added IOOF chairman Roger Sexton and company secretary Danielle Corcoran to the list of company representatives it wishes to examine next week in Sydney at a hearing into misconduct within the financial services industry.\nThe former head of Commonwealth Bank's financial planning unit and now Ord Minnett chief executive Tim Gunning has initially declined to attend. The Senate has sent him a letter reminding him that he can be summonsed to appear.\nSenator Sam Dastyari, chairman of the Senate economics committee, said the committee had resolved to send a formal request to Mr Gunning after he declined to attend the meeting on Tuesday. Senator Dastyari said if Mr Gunning still refused the committee would consider exercising its powers to summons him.\nSenator Dastyari said the scandal at IOOF was disturbing as it followed a string of other scandals in the financial services sector including CBA, NAB and Macquarie.\nAdvertisement \"They are no longer isolated cases,\" he said. \"If IOOF thinks it can sweep it under the carpet they are kidding themselves,\" he said.\n\"It is not just for management to come to this hearing but there are also serious questions we need to ask about the behaviour of the board,\" he said. \"If someone from the board isn't prepared to come it is time for serious action and I would not hesitate to use the powers of compulsion of the Senate.\"\nSenator Dastyari also said he would be calling on ASIC to take immediate action if there was a no-show from the board.\nThe Senate committee's decision to call Dr Sexton comes as the Adelaide-based chairman of IOOF is in the midst of a $100 million initial public offering of his private company Beston Global Foods.\nDr Sexton did not respond to Fairfax Media's request for comment. Ms Corcoran and Mr Hilton did not return calls.\nIOOF chief executive Chris Kelaher has agreed to attend a Senate hearing on Tuesday, along with IOOF head of investigations Rob Urwin.\nThe IOOF representatives will be grilled over revelations by Fairfax Media that senior staff at IOOF engaged in front-running, insider trading, the misrepresentation of fund performance figures and getting juniors to cheat on training and compliance exams on behalf of their boss.\nThe company's head of advice research, Peter Hilton, the man at the centre of many of the alleged wrongdoings, is unable to attend the hearing.\nMr Hilton has been on leave for almost two weeks. His leave coincides with Fairfax Media revealing he received a \"final warning\" in 2009 following an investigation into his alleged potential front-running of research reports on behalf of a relative and another final warning in mid-2014 for a password breach. His responsible manager status was revoked after an internal investigation found he had instructed direct reports to complete his Kaplan and compulsory e-training modules.\nFairfax Media has also revealed considerable issues with the company's reporting of breaches in its cash management unit and problems with the way the company presents its research reports .\nIt comes as pressure mounts on IOOF's executives and board, with sources saying some heads should roll over the scandal.\nIOOF executives have been hard at work over the past 10 days trying to shore up support from financial planners within their networks, while other dealer groups have been quietly calling IOOF-aligned planners to see if they will jump ship, said several industry sources.\nAt least one small financial planning outfit has left IOOF subsidiary Lonsdale Financial Services to join an independent advisory firm. The change of licensee by the small firm came after its principals became concerned about the culture of IOOF, sources said.\nFairfax Media has previously revealed that at least six advisers who have worked under the various Australian financial services licences of IOOF's subsidiaries have been banned.\nIOOF has repeatedly declined to answer questions regarding any remediation program it may have set up to deal with disgruntled clients.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:14:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
