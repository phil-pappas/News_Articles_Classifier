Vale's all-time quarterly record for the main steel-making ingredient was 85.7 million tonnes in the third quarter of 2014. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Vale rose 1.5 percent in early morning trade in Sao Paulo. \nAs the iron ore market moves from boom to bust, Vale is in a battle for market share with low-cost Australian producers Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) . \nOn top of increasing overall output, Vale reiterated it is cutting 25-30 million tonnes a year of low-quality iron ore on which the company is no longer making enough money. Vale did not give a timeframe for the reduction in low-quality ore volumes but said it would be replaced by new, higher-quality production. \nThe company also produced 67,100 tonnes of nickel and 2.01 million tonnes of coal in the quarter, the company said in a statement. \nWhen 4.02 million tonnes of iron ore purchased from third parties is included, Vale produced 89.3 million tonnes in the quarter.
