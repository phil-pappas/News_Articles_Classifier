Sale prices include a buyer's premium of 22 per cent while estimates do not.\nThere was some interest in the curios de Lockwood collected during his travels – an 18th century Indian illustration of Shaykh Ibrahim with angels made $7,930 on an estimate of $800 to $1,200 and an ancient Egyptian bronze cat made $6,710 on an estimate of $5,500 to $7,000 – but his paintings stalled.\nOnly one of the 21 in the collection sold, and it made $3,660 at the lower end of its estimate.\nThe paintings comprised around a third of the auction, and without these sales and without strong results for the furniture pieces, the collection brought in just $55,300.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:11:16.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
