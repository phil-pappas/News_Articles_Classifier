That threshold also applies to those in Greece and Malta. \nThe Bank of Cyprus is an obvious alternative choice for Britons who are affected, as the lender has a UK subsidiary that is regulated in Britain, giving it a similar reach to Barclays. \n“There are around 60,000 Brits in Cyprus, across both sides of the island,” said Bank of Cyprus UK’s acting chief executive Soteris Antoniades on Friday. \nBarclays is focussing on customers in Cyprus with more than £100,000 in the bank \n“10,000 to 12,000 of them are pensioners, who can now have their pensions paid directly into Cypriot bank accounts, something which had been suspended by the Department of Work and Pensions in the financial crisis of 2013.” \nBarclays said it was offering help to its affected customers. \n“As a global financial services provider, we evaluate the services we provide on a regular basis. In 2013 we announced that we are prioritising the need to reduce complexity and that the business will be focusing on a core set of 70 markets globally,” the bank said. \n“As a result of this decision and in line with our strategy, Barclays has introduced a new minimum threshold for its customers resident in Cyprus. We are writing to affected customers and aim to provide as much assistance and support as possible during this transition.” \nBank of Cyprus has cut back its presence in Russia and the Ukraine , but is keeping its UK subsidiary as its only major overseas unit. \nThe bank is headed by former Royal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) investment banking boss John Hourican , who took the position of chief executive in 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T18:37:22.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
