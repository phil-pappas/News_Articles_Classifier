That equipment is aboard a ship headed to Portland, Oregon, for repairs. \nThe Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in a statement that Shell could submit an amended application for deeper drilling when the capping stack can be deployed within 24 hours. \n\"Without question, activities conducted offshore Alaska must be held to the highest safety, environmental protection and emergency response standards,\" said the bureau's director, Brian Salerno. \nThe department had given a conditional OK in May to Shell's drilling plan, pending the company's ability to obtain all necessary permits from state and federal agencies. \nSome environmental groups worry the Arctic's remoteness and rugged conditions will hamper cleanup efforts in the event of a spill, risking devastation of a fragile ecosystem. \nCindy Shogan, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, called it the wrong choice. \n\"This decision puts the fate of the fragile Arctic Ocean, and our climate future, in the hands of Shell Oil,\" she said in a statement. \nProponents say drilling can be conducted safely with existing technologies and that future production decades from now will help sustain the country's energy needs and limit reliance on imports. \nShell and other companies hope to tap into one of the country's last great petroleum reserves. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the Arctic offshore reserves in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas at 26 billion barrels of recoverable oil. \nArctic offshore drilling is strongly supported by elected officials in Alaska, where upward of 90 percent of state government is funded by the oil industry. They hope to see undersea and overland pipelines from offshore wells built to move oil to the trans-Alaska pipeline. \nThe permit was expected, and both of Shell's drill rigs are on their way to the Chukchi sea. The drill sites are on the ocean floor in about 130 feet of water. Hydrocarbon zones are about 8,000 feet below the ocean bottom. \nTop-hole work consists of drilling to about 1,300 feet and setting the foundation for a well to grow in depth. The work starts with digging a mud-line cellar, an excavation that allows a blowout preventer to sit beneath the ocean floor. According to Shell, top-hole work accounts for about half the time it takes to drill a complete exploratory well. \nShell had hoped to simultaneously drill two wells. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service requires a minimum of 15 miles between drill sites to avoid significant effects on walrus. Shell's two sites are closer than that. \nThe missing safety equipment is a capping stack, a roughly 30-foot device that can be lowered onto a wellhead to stop gushing oil after a blowout or to connect to hoses to direct oil to vessels on the surface. \nShell's capping stack is carried by a leased 380-foot icebreaker, the Fennica, which was gashed July 3 as it departed Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands for the Chukchi Sea. Under the direction of a registered Alaska harbor pilot, the ship struck an uncharted object, which created a hold in the hull about 3 feet long and a half-inch wide. \nA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration mapping ship later detected a shallow shoal in the area. \n___ \nKevin Freking reported from Washington. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Related Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T01:35:06.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
