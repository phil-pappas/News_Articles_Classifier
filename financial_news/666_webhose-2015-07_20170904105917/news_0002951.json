Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Michael Smith Echo Entertainment's senior management team were on a knife-edge until the last moment. Unlike typical tender processes, there was no tip-off from the Queensland government ahead of the public announcement they had won the battle to build a new casino in Brisbane .\nWhile the odds were in their favour, not everyone was willing to bet against James Packer pulling a rabbit out of the hat at the eleventh hour and persuading the Queensland government his proposal for the city's Queen's Wharf precinct was superior.\nThat did not happen though, and a relieved Echo was celebrating a much-needed victory on Tuesday. However, the hard work is only just beginning as chief executive Matt Bekier embarks on the company's most ambitious project yet, which will see a major push into its second market of Queensland.\nEcho shares rose 2.7 per cent to a record high on Tuesday morning on the back of the Queensland government's confirmation late Monday that it had won a $2 billion bid to build the massive project on Brisbane's waterfront.\nCrown shares also edged 0.8 per cent higher in early trade, which says a lot about how its investors view the defeat. There is no doubt Echo's win is a rare defeat for Crown, which would have liked to have Brisbane to give it a casino network up Australia's east coast.\nBut some Crown executives will claim relief at not winning , enabling the fast-expanding Packer gaming empire to focus on new hotels under construction in Melbourne, Perth, Macau and Los Vegas.\nAnother theory is that Crown did not want Brisbane at all, but the strategic goal was to ensure Echo's victory did not come cheaply and will stretch it financially at a time when Crown is preparing to take on the Sydney market.\nBut Echo shareholders are not complaining, although there is not a lot of new detail on the table about the $2 billion-plus project. Echo said Tuesday it expects to be able to fund its share of the project through existing and new debt facilities and free cashflow. This implies there are no plans for a capital raising.\n Echo is contributing 50 per cent of the capital to the project, with Hong Kong-based partners Chow Tai Fook and Far East Consortium tipping in 25 per cent each.\nDespite the last minute push by Crown to get its bid across the line, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the Echo proposal won because of the greater public benefit. This includes more public space, more restaurants, and less apartments.\nShe also implied there may have been issues around Crown's partner, state-owned Greenland Group, which is believed to have also approached Echo early in the process to partner up on the project. But it is unclear exactly what those issues were.\nEcho and the Queensland government must now disclose more details about the project. The information released Tuesday was already in the public domain and Echo says it is finalising project documents.\nMichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR", "http://www.twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-07-21T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:09:15.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
