Located firmly within the four corners of the law, this judgment has nevertheless opened floodgates, with employers taking advantage of it to offload hundreds upon hundreds of employees. \nThere is a stampede to serve this grief to as many employees as possible, before the stables are closed yet again. And there is ample indication the stables will soon close. I leave lawyers to debate that whole case. My interest is on the who-is-who of the case. \nThe appellants (the sacked employees) were represented by Professor Lovemore Madhuku, also of the NCA party. The team of respondents (Zuva Petroleum) was led by Advocate Mpofu, but crucially included Chagonda and Chamisa, both associated with MDC-T. And somewhere perched on the legal haystack was one Munyaradzi Gwisai, also a lawyer, but with International Socialist Organisation (ISO). \nAn amazing configuration of legal skills if you ask me, one that redraws in a fundamental way the politics of this country as traditionally polarised or as traditionally dichotomised. \nChamisa's dreadful mistake \nSo Chamisa, an MDC-T MP, can actually stand on the side of capital in a court of law? And win, to proclaim the victory \"a landmark judgment\"? And the MDC-T still touts itself as a workers' party, what with Tsvangirai as the face of that labour factor in our politics? \nIndeed, the MDC-T, fronting its wide-mouthed spokesperson, Obert Gutu, himself another lawyer, expressed its disquiet at the judgment, ironically urging Government - not employers or itself - to \"protect the interests of workers\". \nNot to be outdone in bizarreness, Japhet Moyo of the ZCTU, itself historically an MDC-T founding ally, denounced the judgment and called on President Mugabe to use Presidential Powers to protect workers. \nFrom his lofty ISO perch, Munyaradzi Gwisai Chikweche calls for massive demonstrations against Chidyausiku, something unprecedented in politics, something completely abominable from the mouth of an officer of the court. \nBut Chikweche is not finished: he wants Chamisa punished. He has made the dreadful mistake of saying workers are \"useless\", indeed of \"wearing suits and pushing briefcases\" on the side of capital! \"He is forgetting that his party which groomed him since 2000 to become what he is today . . . \nHe is forgetting that it is the very workers who raised him to become a Member of Parliament and a minister . . .\" And Japhet Moyo of ZCTU demands that Chamisa should have recused himself from the case! \nSee what knowledge has wrought \nHere are the multiple paradoxes, all of them richly political. Chamisa's maiden high-profile case torches a political storm that makes his MP status in the dormitory workers' suburb of Kuwadzana heavily ironical. \nOf course, he will say he has an obligation to represent his clients, itself a legal argument which makes little sense in politics. He had options, all which he knows even though he remains a boy of tears in court circles. And he hailed the judgment as \"a landmark\" one, suggesting conviction, glory and delight in his legal victory against the workers' cause. \nThat recasts him as a lawyer of capital, a tag he enjoys alongside Chagonda, his soulmate politically. Madhuku, on the other hand, used to brag that Chamisa was among his NCA embeds in the MDC-T. When time came, he would ominously add, those embeds would be recalled. Last Friday he found himself on opposites with one of his embeds, in a court of law, and on a case with a huge mobilisation potential. \nBut both Madhuku and Gwisai are Chamisa's teachers in the Law School! See what the knowledge you have imparted has wrought! And we ask, who must be punished, a pupil who masters the teacher's ropes, or the teacher who dispenses the deadly knowledge? \nWorkers of the world, disunite \nThe paradoxes span wider. For a very long time the ZCTU, in cahoots with MDC-T and the civil society activists, agitated against Presidential Powers. These powers were draconian and unwelcome in a democratic society, they chafed, all in unison. \nToday the same ZCTU calls for the use of those very powers they condemned, all in defence of workers? Can a dirty power, a dirty statute, create righteousness? And when both the MDC-T and the ZCTU ask President Mugabe to defend \"workers' interests\", what should be the reason for existence of the MDC-T/ZCTU alliance, now and in future? \nMuch worse, when the Bill amending the Labour Act comes to Parliament, how will Chamisa the MP vote? Going back to 2000 raises even stiffer questions. ZCTU worked in partnership with employers to stage stayaways and demonstrations. We all wondered when Marx's postulate that interests of workers and employers are always diametrically opposed, had become redundant. \nToday those employers are eating the same workers they acted in concert with, against Mugabe's Government, against Zanu-PF. What now? Zimbabwe \nTHE seizure of MDC-T leader Mr Morgan Tsvangirai's property was yesterday halted after the party made an urgent chamber … see more » Copyright © 2015 New Zimbabwe.
