Its founders, childhood friends Josiah Humphrey and Mark McDonald, say there’s a good reason for its success.\nAppster, founded in 2011 on a shoestring budget, has grown to more than $US20 million in revenue, with 200 employees spanning offices on three continents.\nNow based in San Francisco, Mark and Josiah say they’re on track to hire another 400 by the end of this year and hit the $US100 million mark by 2018.\nAlong with their gruelling hiring process , the pair believe their unique approach to management is what’s allowed the company to scale so quickly.\nWhere most companies rely on a hierarchical management structure, Appster instead organises employees into teams, or “tribes”, containing a mix of functions across the business.\n“Instead of having a HR department, sales, design, marketing, quality assurance, we build teams with a mix of everything, almost like a mini business within the company,” Mr McDonald says.\n“Because of that the teams are self-organising and autonomous.”\nThe pair firmly believe managers get in the way of innovation and people should be empowered to self-organise and be held accountable to their own targets through complete transparency.\n“The fundamental belief we have is that managers aren’t the ones that create value in the company,” Mr McDonald says. “Their job has to be, how do we make it easier for everyone else to do their job? I think in many companies that’s the opposite of how things work.”\nThey say the traditional management style is dead or dying, and that companies like Uber or Facebook could not manage exponential growth without this “participation management” model.\nOnce a week Appster holds an all-company meeting, dubbed “Time Travel Tuesday” due to it being Monday in the US, where execs present results to the whole company.\nTeams are organised into “tribes” like mini businesses within the company.

Source: Supplied\n“We say, here’s how much the company made, here are our margins, here’s where we’re lagging. That way everyone has the same info and playbook,” Mr McDonald says.\nIt’s a similar strategy to professional network LinkedIn , which holds fortnightly and monthly “all hands” meetings, where executives update employees on the performance of all the company’s business lines.\nAnd just because teams are autonomous doesn’t mean they aren’t accountable, Mr McDonald says. “Every day they check in and say here’s what I did yesterday, here’s what I’m doing today and here’s what’s holding me back.”\nThat’s where Appster’s former managers, now “scrum masters”, come in. “Their job is more like a servant leader, to break through and remove those impediments and make your job easier,” he says.\nAppster’s reasoning is that if employees are given autonomy and all their impediments are removed and they still can’t hit their targets, they’re probably not in the right company.\nMr McDonald says some people find it hard to adapt to the constant feedback. “We track people’s results and objectives on a weekly basis through our internal management system, and some people can’t take that hyper amount of feedback,” he says.\n“Some people have gotten feedback saying you can’t do this behaviour anymore, and they’ve taken it the wrong way and said, you know what, I don’t want to work here.”\nThat kind of constant feedback has taken the place of yearly performance reviews. “If you wait a year to tell someone whether they’ve done a good job or a bad job, they’ll either be very disappointed or very happy. That model is dead.”\nTransparency and communication run both ways. The company holds monthly retrospective meetings where employees can anonymously submit feedback about what makes them “glad, mad and sad” through tools like 15Five and 7Geese . This allows private communications and provides an essential feedback loop.\nAnd ultimately, the autonomy is used to give employees a sense of ownership of the company. “Our staff are told, yes you have a day job, to deliver software, to make sales calls, but you also have a side job, which is building the company,” he says.\n“We found in the past, that was one of the main reasons people left their jobs — because they didn’t feel their individual job was contributing in a meaningful way.\n“That’s why we’ve been able to grow so quickly.”\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/how-two-aussies-made-the-next-apple/story-fnkgbb6w-1227462265747?sv=99e680c82366787458bd2bc980c40741", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/how-two-aussies-made-the-next-apple/story-fnkgbb6w-1227462265747?sv=99e680c82366787458bd2bc980c40741&title=How+Aussies+made+%26%238216%3Bnext+Apple%26%238217%3B", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/how-two-aussies-made-the-next-apple/story-fnkgbb6w-1227462265747?sv=99e680c82366787458bd2bc980c40741&h=How+Aussies+made+%26%238216%3Bnext+Apple%26%238217%3B", "http://7geese.com/", "http://www.15five.com/", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/how-two-aussies-made-the-next-apple/story-fnkgbb6w-1227462265747?sv=99e680c82366787458bd2bc980c40741&title=How+Aussies+made+%26%238216%3Bnext+Apple%26%238217%3B", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/how-two-aussies-made-the-next-apple/story-fnkgbb6w-1227462265747?sv=99e680c82366787458bd2bc980c40741", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=How+Aussies+made+%26%238216%3Bnext+Apple%26%238217%3B&c=A+FOUR-YEAR-OLD+company+founded+by+two+Aussie+teenagers+is+already+being+called+the+next+Apple.+Here%26%238217%3Bs+how+they+did+it.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/how-two-aussies-made-the-next-apple/story-fnkgbb6w-1227462265747?sv=99e680c82366787458bd2bc980c40741"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T15:22:28.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
