Stephen Ottley Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell The possibility of driverless cars in Australia has cleared a major hurdle to becoming a reality with Tuesday's announcement automated vehicles are due to hit the streets of Adelaide in November as part of the country's first-ever on-road trials.\nThe trials are the result of a collaboration between car manufacturer Volvo and technology partners Telstra and Bosch. They will be coordinated by the Australian Road Research Board and supported by the South Australian government.\nARRB managing director Gerald Waldron said the trials were to promote the emerging industry of driverless cars to attract the funding and interest required to make it happen in Australia.\n\"We want to get people excited about the possibilities, and make it easier for people and organisations to investing further,\" Mr Waldron said.\nThe driverless car interface to be tested in November. Supplied Many cars on the market already have driverless car features, such as automated parking and Mr Walton believes it will take less than three years for driverless cars to be roaming the streets in Australia, and another ten before car companies are mass producing vehicles without steering wheels.\n\"The major issue from our point of view is building credibility while we showcase the potential,\" Mr Waldron said.\nARRB will be launching a campaign for further industry and government support for driverless car technology and tests. The South Australian government has been actively engaged for months.\n\"This trial presents a fantastic opportunity for South Australia to take a lead nationally and internationally in the development of this new technology and open up new opportunities for our economy,\" South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill said.\n The trial will take place around Tonsley Innovation Park, the Southern Expressway and at Adelaide airport, using Volvo XC90s.\nThe Adelaide trials will take place November 7 and 8 as the race for a driverless car reality heats up.\nSimilar trials have already been held in the United States, The United Kingdom and Sweden.\nEarlier this week, a group of companies led by Toyota invested $10 million to develop a testing ground for driverless cars at the University of Michigan in Detroit.\nIt includes a range of road features such as intersections and underpasses as well as a range of driving surfaces such as metal bridges, brick roads and curved gravel paths.\nVolvo and Toyota are not the only car manufacturers vying for the driverless vehicle market. Audi has announced they will have a driverless A8 luxury limousine available by 2017, Nissan has announced plans to sell driverless cars by 2019 and Ford intends to sell \"fully autonomous vehicles\" by 2020.\nBut the traditional car manufacturers will also face steep competition from technology giant Google, which has been investing hundreds of millions in self-driving cars for years.\nEarlier this week, a Google spokesman announced three staff members had been involved in the company's first road accident for their driverless cars, after another human-driven car crashed into the back of the vehicle at an intersection.\nThe automated car was driving at about 24 kilometres an hour. The three Google employees were treated for whiplash at the hospital and returned to work the following day.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-21T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:12:23.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
