He attributed the success of his other sold-out Collingwood projects to the appetite among owner-occupiers for larger apartments.\n\"Our large apartment offerings have been the first to sell with many purchasers buying two apartments and customising them to suit their lifestyle – a new trend in Collingwood that only two years ago would have been unheard of,\" Mr Gurner said.\nThe report also found that Melbourne apartment sales in the CBD and inner suburbs were up 2.5 per cent over 2015 compared with 2014. Mr Rossman said this showed that \"demand is strong enough to accommodate additional apartment complex developments\".\n He said there were three main factors driving demand for apartments: these being Melbourne's desirability among property investors; skilled migration and the desire of new migrants to live near the city and downscaling.\n\"As more houses in the inner city are turned into apartment buildings, many households that value the lifestyle and convenience of the inner suburbs will make the shift and make their next purchase an apartment.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/larryschles", "https://plus.google.com/100879325589382331214/posts"], "published": "2015-07-20T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:46:32.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
