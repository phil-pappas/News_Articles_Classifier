The figure beat analyst estimates for profit of 410 million pounds. Reported underlying revenue fell to 6.3 billion pounds from 6.5 billion pounds.\nNew Chief Executive Officer Warren East has halted a share buyback to preserve dwindling cash and lowered the profit outlook just days into the new job. East succeeded John Rishton, who left the company after several profit revisions.\nEast is now grappling with sluggish marine-engine sales and a drop in demand for Airbus A330 jetliner engines that’s set to hurt earnings in 2016 and 2017. Shares of the company have lost 16 percent of their value this year so far, compared with a 2 percent gain in the FTSE 100 Index.\n“The initial phase of my ongoing operational review has and will continue to concentrate on how we drive improvements and sharpen our focus to make us a more resilient and sustainable business” East said in the statement.\nstatistics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T09:42:11.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
