Reuters by Matthew Campbell and Alex Webb Authorities in Greece have been contemplating the possibility that at some point the country might have to return to its pre-euro currency, the drachma.\nBut introducing a new currency is no small feat. Recent cases -- East Germany's adoption of the deutsche mark, the Czech-Slovak divorce of 1993, and the creation of the euro itself -- benefited from years of careful planning and broad popular support. If Greece were to abandon the euro, it would have neither.\n\"Historical precedent suggests this would be hugely challenging,\" said Richard Portes, a professor of economics at London Business School. \"The situation in Greece is perhaps even worse because it's not clear that they have the administrative capacity to move quickly to a new currency.\"\nGreece's government says it intends to keep the euro even if voters reject the terms of a proposed international bailout in this weekend's referendum . While a poll commissioned this week by Bloomberg found the vote too close to call, it showed that 81 percent of Greeks want their country to remain in the euro zone.\nWorkers in 2002 prepare to destroy a batch of 5000 Greek drachma banknotes. Now the country faces the possibility of returning to the old currency. AP Many economists, though, say that would be difficult after a \"no\" vote -- even if in the long run the country might benefit from such a shift. The Greek banking system is dependent on support from the European Central Bank, which might be withdrawn in that event. That could force Greece to create its own means of exchange -- a new drachma -- to keep its economy running.\nCountries switching currencies must grapple with two major questions: how to introduce new notes and coins, and what to do with bank accounts, debts, and financial instruments denominated in the old currency.\nThe former is relatively straightforward. The Greek central bank owns a press in the Athens suburb of Holargos that prints euro notes. That plant printed Greece's pre-euro drachma, and could make a new drachma, too.\n\"A currency is a national business card, so you want to make it right,\" said Ralf Wintergerst, head of banknote production at Giesecke & Devrient GmbH, a Munich company that has printed banknotes since the days of Germany's Reichsmark in the 1920s.\n Wintergerst says introducing a new currency typically takes at least six months, and sometimes as long as two years. Artists must draw the notes, security experts then add anti-counterfeit measures such as watermarks and special inks, and bank officials need to plan how much of each denomination is needed and get the money to banks.\nDifficult Distribution \"The most challenging thing was to establish efficient distribution and make sure the new currency was available everywhere,\" said Boris Raguz, head of the Treasury Directory at Croatia's central bank, who in 1993 oversaw the introduction of the country's currency, the kuna, after the breakup of Yugoslavia.\nGreater difficulties arise when banks start issuing that money. Because of the time required to distribute new notes and coins, the two currencies have to exist side by side for some time. While Greek banks might move card transactions to the new drachma immediately, shops could accept both -- or perhaps only euros if merchants doubted the value of the new drachma.\n\"When will the conversion happen? At what rate?\" said Antonio Fatas, a professor of economics at Insead business school near Paris. \"That's the big question.\"\nThe two currencies would likely start at a one-to-one exchange rate, which might be fixed for a period of time. The euro was created in 1999, but it existed only virtually for three years, used for electronic transactions at a rate fixed against the francs, marks, and other currencies it replaced. Then on Jan. 1, 2002, euro bills and coins were introduced, though the old currencies were also accepted for about two more months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:05:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
