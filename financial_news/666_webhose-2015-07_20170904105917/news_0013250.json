The biggest changes were new limits on income tax deductions. \nThe sales tax on soft drinks is expected to raise nearly $8 million a year. Applying the meals tax to vending machines is expected to raise about $1 million a year. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T17:35:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
