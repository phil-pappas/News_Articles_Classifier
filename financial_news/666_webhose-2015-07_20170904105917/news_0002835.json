The target for the national capital has been set at 5.32 lakh new assesses. \nThe tax department has a total of 18 regions in the country for purposes of collection of revenue under the major heads of I-T, Wealth Tax, and advance tax for large entities like corporates. \nThe Board has also communicated to the taxman that it should adopt a multi-pronged strategy to achieve this 'not-so-easy' target by holding meetings with trade associations and professional bodies and obtaining data on under-reporting assesses through technical and human intelligence. \nThe strategy in this regard was mooted and formally launched in May this year when CBDT told the tax department about the government's desire to have at least 25 lakh new assesses each month from across the country. \nPTI Other articles published on Jul 20, 2015 Please Wait while comments are loading...
