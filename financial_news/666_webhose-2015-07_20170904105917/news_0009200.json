PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Sun, Jul 26, 2015 CHRIS FAIRWEATHER/ HUW EVANS AGENCY Parents Jan and Colin still grieve for him after 25 years \nHis tiny 13lb body had been ravaged by Aids and towards the end he was so delicate he could only bear to be moved wrapped in a soft sheep fleece. \nHe was a victim of the contaminated blood scandal – injected with HIV and hepatitis C when he had gone into hospital for a routine ear operation. \nEven though Colin was born with haemophilia, a rare blood disorder that stops blood from clotting normally, his parents were assured by doctors he could lead a full and long life. \nBut at 10 months old, an operation to fit grommets at the Royal Gwent Hospital, in Newport, was to hand him a death sentence and tear his family apart. \nKnowing of his condition, the hospital took the precautionary step of injecting him with Factor VIII – a clotting treatment that would stop a bleed should he suffer one. \nYet the product that was supposed to save him was riddled with deadly viruses. \nAt the time, the NHS was routinely importing blood products from America and it later emerged much of it was “skid row” blood – sourced from high-risk groups such as drug addicts. \nThey were then administered without screening. CHRIS FAIRWEATHER/ HUW EVANS AGENCY Colin Smith was injected with contaminated blood \nColin’s parents are re-telling their son’s sad story 25 years after he died as they give their backing to the Sunday Express crusade to win justice for the families of the 7,500 people touched by one of the worst treatment scandals in NHS history. \nHis mum Jan, 60, told the Sunday Express: “The devastating thing is that he didn’t even need Factor VIII. They were not very experienced in the treatment of haemophiliacs and were pumping him full of it as a precaution in case he suffered a bleed. It was also a product that was never supposed to have been given to children under a certain age, so he should never have been given it in the first place.” \nIt was not until more than a year later, when he was two years old, that he was diagnosed with HIV. \nYet it took nearly two more decades for the family to finally discover the truth about how he was infected. \nThe blood that killed him had come from prisoners in Arkansas We were told in a very matter of fact way that he had HIV but nobody really explained to us what it meant, other than saying that the fifth year of his infection would be a critical time for him Jan is still grieving her son \nJan said: “We were told in a very matter of fact way that he had HIV but nobody really explained to us what it meant, other than saying that the fifth year of his infection would be a critical time for him.” \nIn fact it was exactly five years later, on January 13, 1990, that Colin died. \nHis 63-year-old dad, also called Colin, said: “It was when he was five years old that they told us he had developed fullblown Aids. \n“I remember they told us in the corridor of the hospital where he had been receiving treatment. \n“They must have seen the look of shock and despair on our faces because they eventually moved us into a side room and got a consultant to sit down and talk to us.” \nBut many of their questions remained unanswered and nobody informed them of the risk to their three older sons Darren, now 40, Patrick, now 38, and Daniel, now 33. \n“I remember at one point Colin had a very heavy nose bleed and we called the hospital,” Jan said. \n“They asked whether any of the blood had got on to Daniel and told us that we must burn the mattress, so they knew the risks but nobody ever told us. CHRIS FAIRWEATHER/ HUW EVANS AGENCY Colin Smith in hospital after he was injected with contaminated blood \nBy December 1989, the family realised the doctors were losing their battle to keep him alive and Colin spent his last Christmas at home. \nHis father said: “Although we knew he was dying, there were some happy times. Little Colin loved water and so we blew up a paddling pool and put it in the living room and kept it topped up with warm water. \n“I can still remember his little voice saying, ‘This is lovely, this is so lovely’ as he let the water wash over him.” \nTowards the very end of his short life, there was little comfort. \nWeighing just 13lb, he could barely hold up his body and had to be picked up by his parents in a sheepskin to avoid hurting him. \nAfter his death the family even had to battle to get the burial they wanted for their son. \n“We wanted somewhere to go to remember him,” Jan said. \n“The hospital was adamant he must be cremated but we stood our ground and finally found a sympathetic vicar to perform the service.” \nThe cemetery close to their home in Newport is where Colin now rests. \nThe epitaph on his gravestone, which the family still visit every week, reads: “Keep smiling, freckle face. Miss you always, sweetheart. Daddy, Mummy, Darren, Patrick and Daniel.” \n“His death affected the entire family,” Jan said. \n“The Aids story was just breaking when he died and the stigma was terrible. We became known as the Aids family and had Aids scratched on our door and daubed on the side of our house. The other children were at school and some of the parents even threatened to boycott the school that Colin and the others attended. \n“I recall one day some boys came to the door and said I must go to Patrick who was at the cemetery. He was sitting next to Colin’s grave and thumping the ground and shouting ‘Why? Why? Why?’ Over and over again.” Related articles £3.5bn pay-out for patients given killer blood \nYet there was more bad news to come. \nThree years after Colin’s death, the family were sent cards requesting them to go for blood tests to find out if they had Hepatitis C. \nWe didn’t even know Colin had been infected with Hepatitis C. \n\"They had kept us in the dark for all that time,” Jan said. \n“And if that wasn’t bad enough there was now the very real prospect that our other sons were infected.” \nThe results came back negative but the experience left the parents with many unanswered questions about their son’s death. \nIt wasn’t until nearly 20 years later when they requested his medical notes that they finally discovered he was one of the 7,500 patients infected by the NHS with viruses that included HIV and Hepatitis C during the 1970s and 1980s. \nJan,who now has four grandchildren, said: “There isn’t a day that goes by I don’t think about Colin. He should be here now and I often feel like there should have been more grandchildren. \n“No parent should ever have to bury their child and no one understands this better than Prime Minister David Cameron. I wrote to him recently to tell him about little Colin and to tell him that my heart went out to him when Ivan died and that I understand his pain. But my son died unnecessarily and should still be here, and that is something we live with every day.” \nGiving her backing to the Sunday Express crusade, she added: “We’ve lived with this pain for more than 20 years and continue to fight for justice for those like Colin who lost their lives through no fault of their own. \n“It is time a full and final settlement was made to the victims and their families whose lives have been torn apart by this scandal.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T10:04:28.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
