( MGI ) (“MoneyGram” or “the Company”) concerning the Company’s and its officers’ possible violations of federal securities laws. \nThe investigation concerns whether the Company violated federal securities laws by misleading investors regarding its critical partner’s, Wal-Mart Stores, decision to introduce a competing money transfer and financial services provider in all of its current wire transfer locations across the United States. On April 17, 2014, shortly after completing a secondary offering of MoneyGram shares, MoneyGram disclosed for the first time the decision by Wal-Mart to introduce competing products across the U.S., causing the value of MoneyGram shares to decline in one day by almost 30% to close on April 17, 2014 at $12.58 per share. \nIf you purchased MoneyGram shares prior to April 17, 2014, have information or would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Lesley Portnoy of Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP, 1925 Century Park East, Suite 2100, Los Angeles, California 90067 at 310-201-9150, Toll-Free at 888-773-9224, by email to shareholders@glancylaw.com , or visit our website at http://www.glancylaw.com .
