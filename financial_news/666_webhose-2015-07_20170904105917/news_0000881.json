Disruption of water or energy services for instance would definitely affect many including the transgressors. \nPrecariously, some individuals have had the nerve to remove bolts or connecting links from railway lines or bridges without giving a thread of consideration to serious massive losses likely to be incurred. \nIn recognition of the important role of the community, the Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (DAWASA) organised a 24-man expedition for local water stakeholders in Dar es Salaam recently. It facilitated their visit to Upper Ruvu Water Intake and Treatment Plant near Mlandizi area in Kibaha District, Coast Region. \nThe aim was to help them to learn about the costly and complicated processes involved in the production and supply of water before reaching consumers in Dar es Salaam. \nIn this way the attitude with regard to protection of public utilities would change after knowing that water was not flowing freely without cost. \nThe strategic mission on community awareness for the protection of public property sets premises for others to borrow a leaf. \nGood enough, the strategy yields positive results as all members of delegation pledged to become water ambassadors of good-will. \nInformation gathered from DAWASCO indicated that the utility incurred loss at the tune of 4bn/- monthly through non- revenue water. \nThe huge amount was enough to build at least 150 secondary school laboratories every month but the amount ends in private pockets. \nIt is time the spirit of collective responsibility is revived and maintained such that every one becomes a defender of national assets and installations. \nDeforestation for instance is reaching alarming rate and the consequences are far reaching. Participatory approach is the best option to contain the situation. \nWe support the initiatives focused on inculcating the sense of care and protection of public utilities and awareness for the nation to register responsible citizens.
