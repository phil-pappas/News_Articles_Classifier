The council is due to hold a conference call at 6 p.m. Frankfurt time on Monday, said the people, asking not to be named as the matter isn’t public. An ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nThe ECB may consider evidence of how political discussions are progressing, including a call of euro-region officials taking place before governors are due to talk, one of the people said. The ECB’s bank-supervision arm is scheduled to hold a telephone conference after the Governing Council call, another person said.\nFollowing Greek voters’ landslide vote on Sunday against bailout terms offered by European Union-led creditors, concern among ECB governors that the country will ultimately default and leave the euro is rising. At the same time, they have so far been unwilling to preempt any political talks.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet French President Francois Hollande in Paris on Monday evening. Euro-area finance ministers will convene on Tuesday to prepare for the summit that will take place the same day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:19:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
