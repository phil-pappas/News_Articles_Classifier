Whatever the reason, we couldn't be more excited that you are here right now. \nWe are totally amped to tell you our story, show you what we are making, and ask for your help - to inspire and entertain millions of kids and adults. Dreaming big? Yes, we are! That's our vision, and we intend to see it to completion by the end of the year. You can get a digital download of the comic book, Juicebox shades, T shirts, CD's, VIP passes to the premier, action figures, be featured in a show as your own character, and executive producer credits. It's all about kids learning, laughing and having fun. No one wants to put their children in front of the television all day, but sometimes parents need a break. One way is to do this is by letting your child watch a few cartoons. The trick is to make sure that what they are watching provides educational value. There are a lot of great perks you get when you support this project, check them all out at the link below. \nSupport the project here https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1757714173/the-juicebox-crew-making-an-80s-saturday-morning-c", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T15:16:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
