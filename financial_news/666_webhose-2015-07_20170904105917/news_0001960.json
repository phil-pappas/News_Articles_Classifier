And, for a lot of people, for the last 25 years property has not done a lot of them wrong.”\nThe trend, she says, poses questions about investor expectations from the property market.\n“How diversified is their portfolio if they are putting a lot of cash into property?\n“What are the yields they are expecting on this over the long run?”\nMs Allen says the research more broadly shows the factors that influence investors are incredibly varied and constantly evolving.\nAmong them, she notes widespread expectations the US Federal Reserve will soon increase interest rates, potentially this year. “They haven’t hiked interest rates since the iPhone was released,” she says.\n“That’s a good stat — to me that blows your mind a little bit. The world has changed for investors.”\njeff.whalley@news.com.au\nHAVE YOUR INVESTMENT PREFERENCES CHANGED SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS? IS PROPERTY R EALLY A BETTER BET THAN SHARES?
