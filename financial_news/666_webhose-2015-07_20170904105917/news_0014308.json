Noting that the domestic mutual fund distributors get the highest upfront fees in the world, SEBI chairman UK Sinha asked the industry to keep such fees within ‘manageable limits’ and behave in a self-disciplined manner lest they attract regulatory action. Stating that SEBI does not like to get into capping distributors’ commission, he said that SEBI expects AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds of India) to introduce self-regulation, failing which there would be corrective action. To buttress his point, Mr Sinha reeled out numbers and said that the revenue from MF distribution doubled from Rs2,500 crore in 2013-14 and crossed Rs5,000 crore in 2014-15, while the industry growth has been not so robust.
