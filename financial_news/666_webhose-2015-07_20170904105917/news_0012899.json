This is a return to Deutsche's fair value model, which rests at about 15-times.\nThe tough environment envisaged for investors in 2015 is unfolding.\nSimon Doyle, Schroder The fair value was being driven by earnings per share which were below the long-term trend, a better earnings revision ratio, a neutral effect from the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange, which had been a drag on the fair value ratio in the past four years, as had the real bond yields at their present levels, analyst Tim Baker said.\nConfession season doesn't look much worse than the past two years.

Photo: Deutsche Bank\n\"To say that June was a poor month for the ASX is a massive understatement,\" Mr Caton wrote in a note.\n\"And the reason is clear: the ongoing Greek situation. For the month, the ASX 200 fell by 5.5 per cent its worst month since May 2012,\" he said.\nBut there was little reason to fear a fallout from whatever outcome Greece and its debtors face, he said.\n\"Given its economic size and the very limited exposure of the private sector to its debt ... many would see this as a buying opportunity,\" he said.\nMr Baker said the market's fall – which hit fresh lows of around 5930 in late June – was more likely a reflection of normal market volatility than anything else, and noted that the confessions season, while full of headline acts including Woolworths, SEEK and Nine Entertainment, was not bad on an historical level.\n\"The proportion of downgrades is a little higher, but the size of the downgrades is small versus history,\" Mr Baker said.\nThe worst could be over for the market's post-April slide, Mr Baker said.\n\"The market has spent 45 days in this dip, versus the average 25 days, so could have run its course.\"\nIn a pause BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese said the global equity market was in a pause, and reflected a technical need for consolidating the strong gains from mid-2014 to April.\n\"Helping provide the fundamental basis for this inevitable pause has stretched price-to-earnings valuations (i.e. prices ran ahead of earnings), and simmering fears about when the US Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates,\" Mr Bassanese said.\nA softer equity market was still looking more attractive than bonds, which were set for volatility when the US did lift interest rates, he said.\nSchroder Investment Management head of fixed income Simon Doyle was more bearish, and said \"the tough environment envisaged for investors in 2015 is unfolding\".\n\"With one or two notable exceptions, we expect low returns over our forecast (three-year horizon),\" he said.\nBut he added: \"Just as June highlighted – especially the last week of June – market prices can change quickly.\" The last week of June saw a 2.7 per cent fall on the ASX 200 from a bank-led recovery in June to about 5700.\nDeutsche Bank's Mr Baker has identified a list of stocks that present opportunities in the softer market, with these criteria: having underperformed the broader market by at least 3 per cent since April, had their P/E ratios de-rated and downgraded earnings per share by less than 3 per cent.\nThose include Fairfax Media, Ansell, Westpac, ResMed, FlexiGroup, Treasury Wine Estates, Perpetual, IOOF, Coca-Cola Amatil, Orora and Mirvac.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:13:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
