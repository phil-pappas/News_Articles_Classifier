More Budget grants new powers to Revenue \nAccording to figures published by the tax authority, 10,000 of these demands — which cannot be appealed — were issued last year, relating to unpaid tax worth £1.7bn. \n“HMRC appear extremely well placed to meet their revenue targets, based on these figures,” said Richard Morley, a partner at accountants BDO. He added, however, that the figures indicated roughly £1bn of tax demanded had yet to be paid, in many cases following legal representation. \nInvestors in a handful of the largest tax schemes have mounted legal challenges to the use of accelerated payment notices. Where applications for judicial review have been successful, as in the case of three film partnerships promoted by Ingenious Media, investors’ payment notices have been suspended pending their outcome. \nPaul Noble, a tax director at law firm Pinsent Masons, said the fact that recipients have 90 days to stump up the tax authority’s demands means thousands sent out before April will have been paid in the current tax year. \nThe Revenue, which aims to raise almost £8bn through accelerated payment notices from 64,000 or so taxpayers and businesses, has noticeably scaled up production, said Mr Noble. “We saw these things coming out pretty slowly to begin with . . . then accelerate in the new year.” \nDepending on the size of a taxpayer’s investment in a given scheme, and any leverage involved, the amount that HMRC contests is due often runs in hundreds of thousands. The authority itself has indicated that some individuals face bills of more than £10m, payable before tax tribunals have ruled on their schemes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T03:27:25.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
