A daily close below channel floor support at 0.6647 exposes the 38.2% level at 0.6568. Alternatively, a move above the 14.6% Fib at 0.6787 clears the way for a test of the June 25 high at 0.6923. Risk/reward considerations argue against entering short with prices in close proximity to support. On the other hand, the absence of a defined bullish reversal signal suggests taking up the long side is premature. We will remain flat for now, waiting for an actionable opportunity to present itself.
