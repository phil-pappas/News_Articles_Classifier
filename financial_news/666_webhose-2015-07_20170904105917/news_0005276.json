The evolution of China’s property market and financial sector are likely to be more important, he said.\nIn terms of Australia, “a period of somewhat disappointing, even if hardly disastrous, economic growth outcomes, and inflation that has been well contained, has seen interest rates decline to very low levels,” Stevens said. “The question of whether they might be reduced further remains, as I have said before, on the table.”\nThe RBA reduced borrowing costs twice this year to a record-low 2 percent as it sought to accelerate a transition toward service industries and manufacturing as a decade-long mining boom winds down. But the easy policy is fueling a housing bubble in parts of Sydney and Melbourne and the central bank would prefer a weaker currency to boost the competitiveness of local industries.\nThe local dollar’s “adjustment seems to be occurring, with relatively little disruption, and is having an expansionary effect,” Stevens said. “Growth in services trade for example is picking up. The ‘net export contribution’ of services trade over the past year, of around half a percentage point of gross domestic product, is about the same as the contribution from iron ore exports over that period.”\nPrudent on Debt Australian households taking advantage of low rates to make faster repayments on mortgages suggests they are more prudent about debt, the governor said. As a result, the pace of lending to households remains moderate, he said.\n“This may mean that the effect of easy monetary policy is to be somewhat lessened, at least for a time,” he said. “Taking a medium-term perspective, though, the general strengthening of the balance sheet among many formerly more-indebted households has to be seen as a good thing.”\nStevens said the central bank board’s overriding aim is sustainable growth, as it has outlined at the end of recent policy statements, and to ensure financial sustainability.\n“Monetary policy works partly by prompting risk-taking behavior,” he said. “In some ways that is good: in some respects, there has not been enough risk-taking behavior. But the risk-taking behavior most responsive to monetary policy is of the financial type,” he said, adding that beyond a certain point “it can be dangerous.”", "external_links": ["http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2015/sp-gov-2015-07-22.html\\"], "published": "2015-07-22T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T06:30:08.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
