Members of the National Union of Mineworkers stopped working at the mine in the northern Limpopo province after being served notices of possible dismissals by Capital Development Services, which is developing the operation, the NUM said in an e-mailed statement Friday. Capital Development Services employs 524 staff, the union said.\nThe majority of the affected “employees do not even have retirement and pension funds,” the NUM said. “The company must consider voluntary severance packages as an alternative.” Gert Schoeman and Mpumi Sithole, spokespeople for Johannesburg-based Amplats , as the company is known, didn’t immediately answer calls seeking comment.\nAmplats is developing the Twickenham mine as it seeks to discard four aging operations in favor of spending capital on more mechanized facilities. The margins of the world’s largest platinum producers in South Africa, which has more than 70 percent of known global reserves, are under pressure as metal prices have declined more than 40 percent since August 2011.\nAmplats plans to cut as many as 420 managerial and supervisory positions at its Rustenburg Platinum Mines unit, the company said June 23.\n©2015 Bloomberg News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:37:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
