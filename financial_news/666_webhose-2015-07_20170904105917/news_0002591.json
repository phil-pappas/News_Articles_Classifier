(PRWEB) July 20, 2015\nLOS ANGELES, CA – July 17, 2015 – The Woodbridge Structured Funding Foundation, a philanthropic organization dedicated to benefiting disadvantaged children, women, and veterans in the United States, donated $10,000 in support of national nonprofit Little Kids Rock on July 13, 2015 . The donation will help to bring “Modern Band” music classes and new instruments to underserved schoolchildren across the country.\n“We are so thrilled to partner with Little Kids Rock in bringing music to the many children who would otherwise never have access to these wonderful resources,” says Robert Shapiro, President & CEO of Woodbridge Structured Funding. “We feel very proud and fortunate to be among their enthusiastic advocates.”\nIn addition to supporting Little Kids Rock, the Woodbridge Structured Funding Foundation has also sponsored St. Baldrick’s Foundation, Red Cross, and Make A Wish, among many other charitable initiatives.\n\"We are very excited that the Woodbridge Structured Funding Foundation is supporting kids’ access to music education with this donation to Little Kids Rock,” says Cindy Cowan, Little Kids Rock’s Los Angeles Area Advisory Board Chair. “It is with the help of generous people such as these that we can continually open more educational programs that are free of charge to underprivileged children, not just in LA, but all over the country.”\nAbout Little Kids Rock:\nLittle Kids Rock is a national nonprofit dedicated to unlocking children’s inner music makers by revitalizing music education in public schools. The organization partners with public school districts to train teachers to run its innovative Modern Band curriculum, and donates all the accompanying instruments and resources necessary to teach popular music in a way that empowers students to experience instant achievement. Little Kids Rock started as a schoolteacher’s vision to give his students access to music education, although diminishing budgets for the arts made that increasingly difficult to do. What began as a single after-school guitar class has since exploded into a national movement that brings free, weekly music lessons to nearly 200,000 public school children through the efforts of more than 1,500 teachers in 29 cities nationwide. To date, Little Kids Rock has served more than 400,000 students.\nAbout Woodbridge Structured Funding Foundation:\nThe Woodbridge Structured Funding Foundation serves as the philanthropic arm of Woodbridge Structured Funding. Since 1993, Woodbridge Structured Funding and its predecessor companies have earned a high reputation for trust and reliability. Philanthropy has always played a key role in the company’s goals and values.
