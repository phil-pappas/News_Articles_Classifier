Anthem Inc. agreed to buy Cigna Corp. for more than $48 billion in a transaction that, along with a previously proposed combination of rivals, could reshape the U.S. health industry.\nUnder the deal’s terms, Indianapolis-based Anthem ANTM, +0.07% would pay $188 a share for Cigna, of Bloomfield, Conn., based on Anthem’s closing price on May 28. Cigna CI, +2.18% shareholders will receive $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 Anthem shares for each share held.\nIncluding debt, the deal is valued at $54.2 billion.\nThe deal and its price was first reported by The Wall Street Journal earlier this week after months of speculation and contentious talks.\nThe combined company is expected to have $115 billion in pro forma annual revenue based on the companies’ 2015 outlooks. Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish will remain chairman and CEO, while Cigna CEO David Cordani will become president and operations chief.\nAnthem estimates that the deal will grow its per-share earnings by 10% in the first year after closing, with accretion more than doubling by the second year.\nThe tie-up of Anthem and Cigna would accelerate the rapid-fire reconfiguration at the top of the U.S. managed-care industry. The biggest companies are seeking more cost efficiency and scale as the health-care landscape changes because of the Affordable Care Act and other factors.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-agrees-to-buy-cigna-for-48-billion-1437732331"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T15:07:32.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
