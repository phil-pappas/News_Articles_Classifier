Lines shed 2.3 percent while Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha declined 2.6 percent.\nExporters were lower as the dollar fell as low as 123.010 yen in the previous session before it traded flat on the day at 123.260 yen.\nTraders said investors were risk averse amid worries about China and ahead of a two-day U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting beginning later in the day.\nToyota Motor Corp shed 1.5 percent and Honda Motor Co fell 1.8 percent.\nOutperforming the market was ANA Holdings, which rose as high as 2 percent earlier after the Nikkei business daily reported that its April-June operating profit likely rose to the highest in seven years.\nThe broader Topix dropped 1.1 percent to 1,619.76 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 shed 1.2 percent to 14,610.10.
