In the three months since Jonathan Jaglom stepped into the CEO role at Makerbot — the company's fourth leader in the past two years — he's been a busy guy, according to an interesting rundown offered by Technical.ly . Of the milestones attributed to Jaglom, the former general manager of Stratasys’ Asia Pacific and Japan division, three stand out as part of a strategy that appears to be aimed at turning Brooklyn’s 3D-printing sweetheart into a global brand before the competition elbows them out: Jaglom set up Makerbot APJ (Asia Pacific and Japan) at parent-company Stratasys (Nasdaq: SSYS) Asia Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. Jaglom’s predecessor, Jenny Lawton , now at littleBits , had hoped to manage the expansion directly from Brooklyn, according to the report. To ease concerns over the tumultuous changes in leadership, Jaglom established a “creative council” of about 50 employees from across the company to help define corporate values. Jaglom is embarked on a 22 state “listening tour” to engage in a dialogue with customers, partners, and schools.
