It's got over 27,000 (US) locations now. The unit economics are very tough. Competitors have really come in and provided some alternatives to consumers that have caused Subway to suffer some sales losses.\"' \nSubway has 44,000 restaurants worldwide, more than McDonald's. Executives say the company eventually plans to reach 100,000 locations. \nSubway's US sales last year fell by 3%, the biggest fall for any of the top 25 fast-food chains, Drew Harwell reports at The Washington Post. \nSubway also fell two spots to become the third-most-popular fast-food restaurant for the first time in seven years. \nThe expansion plan is backfiring, according to The Post. \nMatt Sayles/Invision for SUBWAY Restaurants/AP Images Subway dropped Jared Fogle as the restaurant chain's spokesman amid an FBI investigation. \n\"More people have money to spend, and they're choosing to spend a little bit more on better concepts where they get a better product,\" Darren Tristano at Technomic told The Post. \"Subway's strategy has only been to open more stores, and ultimately those stores just cannibalize each other.\" \nIn other words, Subway is so ubiquitous that customers leave one restaurant to go to a closer one. \nTristano also told Bloomberg that \"if your goal is to have the most versus the best, you'll eventually run into trouble.\" \nSubway should focus on innovating its menu instead, Maze said. \nWith its vegetables and lower calorie counts, Subway arguably invented the idea of \"fresh\" fast food two decades ago. \nTim Boyle/Getty Images \nBut while Subway stayed the same, better competitors got into the space. \nChipotle offers food that is raised without fillers or antibiotics and is prepared fresh in stores. Firehouse Subs and Potbelly offer elevated ingredients and side dishes such as gourmet kettle chips and potato salad. \nAmericans who once praised Subway's low-fat offerings are now concerned the chain's lunch meats and sauces are overly processed with fillers and additives. \n\"What Americans see as healthy has evolved,\" Harwell writes. \"Subway hasn't.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T17:45:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
