Louie Douvis Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Smith Nathan Parkin will be testing a theory this earnings season.\nThe deputy head of Australian equities at investing giant Perpetual has a theory that the Australian share market has reached a turning point.\nThe outcome of the next couple of weeks will lead to a new set of rules and assumptions, he believes, about how investors reward listed companies and therefore, how those stocks perform in the market from now on and into the foreseeable future.\nTo test this theory, Parkin has anchored Perpetual's Australian equities portfolio to companies with a few, very simple definable characteristics.\nAbility to grow earnings is good, Parkin says. But companies that pay out earnings in dividends without showing the potential to grow earnings and therefore, grow dividends in the future? Not so good, he says.\n\"Companies within this group [able to grow earnings] are rare at the moment,\" Parkin says, but points to Bunnings and Coles owner Wesfarmers and Orora, the packaging business that spun out of Amcor in 2013, as a couple of examples.\nTo put his theory into play Parkin has actively avoided market darling, Telstra, along with all of the listed infrastructure businesses and listed property companies.\nThe difference between this reporting season and past reporting seasons mostly has to do with the amount of time that's passed since the United States Federal Reserve stopped buying bonds under its Quantitative Easing program, Parkin says. Also what makes this moment pivotal is where we are situated in relation to an interest rate raising cycle, he says.\nRelated Quote: s 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating...

Now we've reached that turning point we have to be much more careful with what we own.\"\nIn October last year the Fed officially ended its quantitative easing bond-buying program but not before it had pumped an estimated $US3.5 trillion ($4.7 trillion) into the world's largest economy over a six-year span. The post financial crisis measure was designed to prop up and recapitalise equity markets, and its effect has been measurable all around the world.\nBut there is evidence to suggest the stimulatory effects of the Fed's unprecedented QE program has run its course, Parkin says.\nThe sell off in big four banks shares two months ago was one indication, he says.\n\"We all knew [the banks] were over valued and the new [APRA] regulations on capital requirements were going to impact them â€¦ Everyone decided now was the time they needed to worry about it and the sell off happened,\" Parkin says.\nFollowing a more than three-year unabated run, about 15 per cent was wiped off the value of the big four banks after reaching a peak following a sell off in March.\nThe recent sell off in commodities is further evidence for Parkin's thesis that bad news is news again, he said.\nChina's further slowing of growth is one of the factors that has resulted in the recent plummeting of commodity prices, in particular iron ore, which has seen its price appear to find a natural level below $US55 a tonne, around its lowest price in more than 10 years.\nIncreased volatility in equities and bond markets also suggest the market has reached a point when excess liquidity will play less of a role in how companies' shares perform, Parkin says.\nRates rise next year The US Federal Reserve is likely to start raising interest rates this year after keeping its benchmark rate close to zero since December 2008; the expectation is that the Reserve Bank of Australia has the same direction for rates in mind.\nBetting on interest rate sensitive stocks that benefited from the stimulatory tail winds during the interest rate cutting cycle was a no brainer for investors, now that the free kick has been taken away.\n\"When the central banks are not there, markets will go where they should go. At the end of the day the market will set the price,\" he says.\nParkin admits that a more discerning market for companies with earnings and dividend growth could suit stock pickers such as himself. He adds that, if his theory is correct, index-focused strategies and exchange traded funds that are less discerning could be vulnerable.\nWhile Parkin acknowledges that holding cash would be a more comfortable way to watch how this reporting season will play out, the mandate he has within Perpetual's Australian equities fund means he has to be fully invested. He can only hold a maximum of 10 per cent cash at any time, so he is strapped in for the ride.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-csl-bursts-towards-100-20150731-gioevv", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/106575007500984611252/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Matt_JS"], "published": "2015-07-31T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T10:03:51.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
