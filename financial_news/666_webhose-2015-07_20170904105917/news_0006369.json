It claimed that \"these problems are not occurring in large numbers across the whole sector and that generally retailers are taking compliance seriously to avoid such problems occurring\". \nNisha Arora, CMA senior director, consumer, said: “We have found that, whilst supermarkets want to comply with the law and shoppers enjoy a wide range of choices, with an estimated 40pc of grocery spending being on items on promotion, there are still areas of poor practice that could confuse or mislead shoppers. \n“So we are recommending further action to improve compliance and ensure that shoppers have clear, accurate information.” \nBritain's \"big four\" supermarkets account for almost three-quarters of grocery spending \nNonetheless, Which? claimed the findings were a victory for consumers. \nIn response, Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: “The CMA’s report confirms what our research over many years has repeatedly highlighted: there are hundreds of misleading offers on the shelves every day that do not comply with the rules. This puts supermarkets on notice to clean up their pricing practices or face legal action. \n“Given the findings, we now expect to see urgent enforcement action from the CMA. The Government must also quickly strengthen the rules so that retailers have no more excuses. \n\"As a result of our super-complaint, if all the changes are implemented widely, this will be good for consumers, competition and, ultimately, the economy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:59:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
