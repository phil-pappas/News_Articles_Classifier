Mays and Aaron kept going. He let himself down. Imagine if he had five more years of 30 homers.” Mantle would have finished with close to 700 homeruns, within striking distance of Babe Ruth’s hallowed 714.\nA Mickey Mantle souvenir photo from late in his career. Note the cleats with his number 7. No one thought to save old shoes when Mantle was playing. According to Josh Evans of Lelands, the cleats would be worth about $50,000 today.\n“One day I was at his locker with a stack of mail that I ‘urgently needed to discuss with him.’ (I would make this up in order to get quality time with my boyhood hero),” Appel later wrote about a game towards the end of the season .“I found him opening a box of new baseball spikes. He twisted and bent them prior to putting them on. They felt right. He then picked up his old, worn pair, and tossed it six feet into the nearby garbage receptacle.’\n“This’ll be my last pair of these,” Mantle said. All Appel would have had to do was a bit of dumpster diving to make a small mint 40 years later, probably about $50,000. But this was an era long before the sports memorabilia boom when the Mick’s worn-out shoes weren’t worth any more than yours or mine. In Pinstripe Pride , Appel noted that in 1973, after the final game at the original Yankee Stadium, “people didn’t think of ‘how much this is worth,’ but a lot of [them] yanked their seats out of the concrete [using big wrenches they brought with them to the ballpark, I recall. Try getting those past security today.] Many of the remaining seats were sold by a department store for $5.75 each plus five cigarette proof-of-purchase coupons.” Last fall, Robert Edward Auctions sold one of these seats for $2040.\nDuring the original Yankee Stadium’s renovation Korvettes department store sold Yankee Stadium seats for $5.50 plus five cigarette coupons.

Goldin Auctions sold Babe Ruth’s first Yankees contract, in 1922, for $300,000.\nFor his part, Appel was ahead of his time, as well. At the start of the 1968 season he asked the Yankees batboy to get him a cracked Mantle bat as a souvenir. In late September Appel tried again at Boston’s Fenway Park. In the first inning Mantle popped out to Rico Petrocelli in short left field, breaking his bat, which the bat boy retried and set aside for Appel. “But he didn’t go to first base in the last of the first,” Appel wrote in a column for the Boston Globe in 2014 about Derek Jeter’s final game , also at Fenway. “Andy Kosco did. Mick was already getting dressed and preparing to go to Logan Airport. He was done. There would be no Sunday game for him, no season finale, no good byes. The tank was empty. His career was over, finishing 0 for 20. The last of his biweekly paychecks, from his $100,000 salary, was paid. He had no idea what his future held, and he wasn’t exactly rolling in dough. This was not a happy time.”\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1481416022", "http://www.appelpr.com/ARTICLES/A-Great%20Moments.htm", "http://goldinauctions.com/1922_babe_ruth_new_york_yankees_contract___his_fir-lot12291.aspx", "http://www.robertedwardauctions.com/auction/2015_spring/1059.html", "http://appelpr.com/", "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/09/28/derek-jeter-farewell-boston-evokes-memories-mickey-mantle/KW6X0B0ewQlRKPpKnYYzON/story.html"], "published": "2015-07-08T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T20:30:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
