Those films include “Limitless” with Bradley Cooper and Robert DeNiro, and “Mirror, Mirror” starring Julia Roberts.\nIn May, the company held up its Sundance Film Festival acquisition “The Bronze” until October. “Masterminds,” a comedy with Kristen Wiig, Owen Wilson and Zach Galifianakis, was also moved from the summer to the autumn and slated for October release. Those moves helped the Beverly Hills-based company put off associated marketing costs.\nRelativity announced 75 full-time job cuts yesterday, about one-fifth of its staff.\nThe company and dozens of affiliates began filing court documents in Manhattan Thursday, the initial case coming under the name Relativity Fashion. Subsequent filings listed liabilities of as much as $1 billion.\nStalking Horse Its senior lenders will act as the initial bidders in a court-supervised auction. Creditors typically use such a position, known as a stalking-horse bidder, to swap their debt for ownership.\nThe bankruptcy “will protect our valuable franchise and allow us to emerge as a stronger, more focused company,” Kavanaugh, Relativity’s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.\nThe company said it expects to conclude the auction process and close a sale in early October. It arranged to borrow $45 million from some of its lenders to fund operations while it reorganizes, according to a statement.\nOne short-term lender, RKA Films Financing LLC, sued Kavanaugh this month, calling him a “con man” and accusing him of misusing cash from a restricted $75 million loan to pay salaries, bonuses and other debts instead of its original purpose: advertising and marketing.\nRelativity responded with its own lawsuit against RKA disputing the accusations.\nThe studio’s future was at the center of a spat with Jason Colodne and Jason Beckman, partners in Colbeck Capital who invested in Relativity. The pair, who left the board in May, were part of a group that led $350 million in financing three years ago.\nKavanaugh, who arranged financing for Sony Pictures and Universal Pictures before making movies on his own, attracted a circle of well-heeled investors to his company OneWest Bank Chairman Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Paul Singer, founder of Elliott Management Corp.\nMnuchin is non-executive co-chairman of Relativity, as well as an investor, and has financed films including “Avatar” and “Gravity.”\nThe case is Relativity Fashion LLC, 15-11989, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T23:13:20.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
