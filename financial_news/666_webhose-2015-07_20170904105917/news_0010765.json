The website for the Wall Street Journal newspaper was also suffering intermittent glitches. \nAt 1615 GMT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 17,562.42, down 214.49 points (1.21 percent). \nThe broad-based S&P 500 fell 27.56 (1.32 percent) to 2,053.78, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index lost 73.49 (1.47 percent) to 4,923.97.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:35:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
