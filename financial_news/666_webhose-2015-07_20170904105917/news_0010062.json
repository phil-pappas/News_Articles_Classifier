While repeating that further depreciation in the New Zealand dollar is necessary given the weakness in export commodity prices he also noted several factors supporting the economy. They included easing monetary conditions, continued high levels of migration and labour force participation, ongoing growth in construction, and continued strength in the services sector. \"Some local commentators have predicted large declines in interest rates over coming months that could only be consistent with the economy moving into recession,\" Mr Wheeler said. The kiwi dollar climbed as high as 67.38 US cents after the speech was released and was recently at 67.06 cents, up from 66.84 cents immediately beforehand. The trade-weighted index rose to 71.30 from 71.04. Mr Wheeler said the exchange rate remained above the level consistent with current economic conditions and that there was potential for further downward pressure on prices of dairy products, the nation's biggest export. But a decline in the currency may be assisted by factors outside his control, including that the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are likely to begin the process of normalising their interest rates, \"which could assist our currency lower,\" Mr Wheeler said. Mr Wheeler cut the official cash rate a quarter-point to 3.00 per cent last week and flagged further declines. Bank economists have predicted he will cut the rate to 2.5 per cent this year. \"The RBNZ speech reinforced that further easing is likely, but also explicitly dampened the more exuberant OCR cut expectations,\" said Nick Tuffley, chief economist at ASB Bank. \"We remain comfortable with our view the RBNZ will cut the OCR by 25 basis points in both September and October, to 2.5 per cent.\" New Zealand's annual inflation is just 0.3 per cent - below the bank's 1.00 to 3.00 per cent target band. Mr Wheeler said inflation is expected to be close to the midpoint of the band by the first half of 2016.
