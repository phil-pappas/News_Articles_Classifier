It can cost between $10,000 and over $100,000, with waiting lists to buy it famously stretching into the years. \nPETA said it takes three crocodile belly skins to make one handbag. In their expose, at the Lone Star Alligator Farms in Winnie, Texas, PETA shows abattoir employees referring to live crocodiles and alligators as \"watch straps.\" \nContacted by The Associated Press, Hermes said it \"respects and shares (Birkin's) emotions\" and was \"shocked by the images recently broadcast.\" An investigation, it says, is underway. \nWhile the fashion powerhouse acknowledges that the Texas farm supplies it with crocodile skins, Hermes says they aren't used specifically for the Birkin bag. Hermes also uses croc for watchstraps and other bags. \n___ \nThomas Adamson can be followed at www.Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T15:57:10.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
