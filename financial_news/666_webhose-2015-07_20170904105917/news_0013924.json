Photo: Reuters\nIt is barely two weeks since Greece was on the brink of crashing out of the euro, yet some investment banks are now encouraging investors to return to its bond market.\nA last-gasp deal on July 13 saw Athens accept a new round of austerity measures in return for talks on a third international bailout deal, which are about to get under way.\nAlthough questions remain over whether Greece will be able to stick to the terms of a new deal or will be back at the ballot box within the year, markets have breathed a collective sigh of relief.\nGreek flags are displayed for sale for one Euro at a shop in central in Athens, Greece July 26, 2015.Greek banks are set to keep broad cash controls in place for months, until fresh money arrives from Europe and with it a sweeping restructuring, officials believe. REUTERS/Yiannis Kourtoglou Photo: Reuters\nGreece's two-year borrowing costs have more than halved from peaks of over 58 per cent hit this month even though they still yield more than longer equivalents -- a signal that investors fear a default could be on the cards.\nSome banks now see an opportunity for their clients.\nRBS recommends buying five-year Greek bonds in the expectation that the European Central Bank will buy up Greek bonds under its quantitative easing programme, which is conditional on Athens signing up to a new bailout deal.\n\"Greek sovereign debt inclusion in QE would be a major boost for the market and likely lead to aggressive tightening, at least in the short-term,\" said RBS strategist Michael Michaelides.\nWhile the bank acknowledges ECB purchases of Greek debt may only last for two months because of its own limits, it said the price could rally to 80 euro cents from 68 euro cents due to the impact of ECB purchases in a market that has seen hardly any trading of late.\nRBS calculates that ECB purchases of €1.2 billion ($1.8 billion) a month would markedly trump average monthly trading volumes of €800 million seen last year.\nPointing to policymakers' resolve to hold the euro zone together, Credit Suisse also said investors should consider buying Greek bonds if prices fall again.\n\"If the price falls significantly, then we would buy Greek bonds because ultimately when the stress is really high every player is then incentivised again to produce a solution that prevents the worst possible outcome,\" Credit Suisse strategist Christian Schwarz said.\nBut for many others, fear that another chapter in the Greek crisis may be just around the corner is reason enough to steer clear.\n\"Regardless of what happens with QE, it's still going to be extremely political, so we are staying away from giving any explicit trade recommendations on Greece,\" said Abhishek Singhania, European interest rate strategist at Deutsche Bank\nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T08:11:29.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
