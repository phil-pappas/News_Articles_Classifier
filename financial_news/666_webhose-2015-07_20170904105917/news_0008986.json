Sam Cole by John Kehoe Washington futurist and defence expert Peter Singer has an ominous warning: World War III between the United States and China may be just around the corner. If battle does erupt, 21st century combat will look very different to conventional conflicts.\nFighting will not just take place at sea, on land and in the air. Cutting-edge technologies already in existence will see the fight for global dominance occur in outer space and cyberspace.\nTo illustrate how a once unthinkable event may play out, Singer, along with co-author and former Wall Street Journal defence reporter August Cole, has penned a new book, Ghost Fleet: A Novel of the Next World War .\nAustralia will be forced to choose between the US and China, ultimately siding with the US after becoming a victim of a mass Chinese hacking campaign via a cyber war.\nDespite being fiction, the book is gaining the attention of officials at the Pentagon, where Singer has given several briefings and speeches.\nAt a time when China is testing the patience of the US and Asian neighbours in the South China Sea, the text exploring war in the Pacific in the future is not being dismissed as pie in the sky.\nAs well as winning plaudits from the Game of Thrones author and the producer of the Hunger Games , the head of the US Navy is endorsing it.\n\"It's a page-turner. Thoughtful, strategic and relevant,\" says US Navy admiral Jonathan Greenert.\n Internet co-founder and Google doyen Vint Cerf labels it a \"clarion call to get our act together before fiction becomes fact\".\nIf the US and China do come to blows in their modern day Pearl Harbour battle across the Pacific, Silicon Valley technology and business nous will feature prominently.\nUnmanned aircraft, robots and technology are becoming part of modern-day warfare.\nSinger, who once worked at the Pentagon, says in an interview a great power war is not inevitable but is certainly possible.\n\"The fear of a great power war was something we thought we had put in the historic rear view mirror, but unfortunately it has caught back up to us in the 21st century,\" Singer tells AFR Weekend .\n\"You have the US and China competing in what is an arms race.\"\nBased on a potentially true story The international cast of characters battle via stealthy drones, while Silicon Valley technology billionaires rally for cyber war against Chinese rivals.\nAfter discovering energy resources in the Pacific, China draws on new technologies to wipe out US aircraft carriers and submarines, even launching an attack on Hawaii with the help of Russia.\nOne of the opening scenes is from the vantage point of a US joint strike fighter (F-35) pilot. Ominously for Australia, the F-35s are corrupted via Chinese-made computer chips that comprise 80 per cent of the jet's weapons system. The Abbott government last year pledged up to $US24 billion to jointly develop the F-35 with the US.\nChinese cyber attackers hack into US intelligence operation, while superhuman capability is enabled via high-tech drugs.\nEven if the self-proclaimed Tom Clancy-style techno-thriller seems sci-fi, Singer says it is combined with real-world research.\nSinger, 40, says the political and economic trends borne out in the book are based on reality and all the technology used already exists today. It's documented in 400 end-notes at the back of the manuscript.\nHe researched and wrote the 400-page book over 3Â½ years by analysing US defence contract reports, World Bank documents, leaked Chinese photos of military equipment and meeting fighter pilots, Chinese generals and private military contractors.\nThe authors spoke with fighter pilots to test how they would handle an in-air dog fight between a Lockheed Martin F-35 against a Falcon Hawk built by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation.\nThe book depicts a Chinese officer musing to himself about how, before the war, Australia thought it had the upper hand in the bilateral relationship because China was so dependent on natural resources. The tables are turned.\nThe book, recently published in the US and due to be released in Australia in August, also features a flamboyant Australian technology billionaire who is forced to choose between business ties in Silicon Valley and geographical links to Asia.\nSinger, named as one of Foreign Policy magazine's top 1000 global thinkers, has already published books about the rise of private military contractors, cyber security and robotics in conflict in the 21st century.\nOnce a guest speaker to political advisers at Parliament House in Canberra, he says he hopes the latest text will be \"useful fiction\" to people in government and military, while being entertaining for everyday readers.\n\"It is playing with 'what ifs' that are on people's minds right now.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:06:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
