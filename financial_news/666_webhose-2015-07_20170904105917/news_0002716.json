OPEC is assuming that demand will pick up in the second half of the year,\" he added. \nThe US Department of Energy on Wednesday said the country's commercial crude stockpiles rose 2.5 million barrels last week, while supplies at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma, hub were up 800,000 barrels. \nThe report also showed US production staying at near-record levels of about 9.6 million barrels per day, bad news for a market already awash with crude from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). \n\"US inventories expanded more than expected... which exacerbated the oversupply problem, especially when Saudi is pumping at record production levels,\" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore. \n\"OPEC produced 32.1 million barrels per day in June, with the largest increase coming from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This was 2.1 million more than what the organisation said it will maintain,\" Aw added. \nA strong US currency is putting further downward pressure on oil. With the commodity priced in dollars, it becomes more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, denting demand. \nExpectations that the US central bank is on track to raise interest rates this year have boosted the dollar as investors flock to the currency in the hope of getting better returns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T20:00:38.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
