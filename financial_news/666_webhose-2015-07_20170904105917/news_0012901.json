(but) if it comes to it, we will go all the way to Interpol,\" he added.\nSabit did not specify why Afghanistan might approach the international police organisation, but did say tough measures including travel bans for executives could be imposed on companies that did not agree to pay.\nOne of the finance ministry's main targets, Supreme Group, is pulling out after its existing contracts end this year, although it did not give a reason.\nThe size of the Afghan market for foreign contractors has shrunk significantly in recent years after the U.S.-led NATO force went from more than 100,000 at its peak to 9,800 soldiers now who train local forces and carry out limited operations.\nBut supporting the mission is still a sizeable business, and other firms want to continue if the tax row is resolved. Over $20 billion is estimated to have been spent on U.S. Department of Defense contracts in Afghanistan from 2002 to 2014.\n\"TOUGH TO SWITCH\"\nFor Kabul, the dispute presents tough choices.\nOn the one hand, with revenue badly needed to run the country, significant tax payments would be welcome. Afghanistan has also sought to reassert control over areas of the economy dominated by foreign companies and aid groups.\nOn the other, it relies heavily on U.S. Department of Defense contractors, of which there are around 30,000.\nIt is difficult to switch contractors, because \"the U.S. military has strict contracting procedures,\" said Sabit. \"My problem has always been with contractors; they do not behave.\"\nThe companies involved say the U.S. government is leading negotiations.\n\"This is a policy dispute regarding tax exemptions between the U.S. and Afghan governments. We are aware that both governments are working toward a final resolution,\" said a spokeswoman for DynCorp.\nA U.S. official in Kabul said liabilities varied by firm, and Washington was working to ensure the law was applied fairly.\n\"We insist that the government carefully apply relevant exemptions as provided by relevant bilateral agreements between the U.S. and Afghanistan,\" the official said.\nSLOW GOING\nProgress towards a solution has been slow, according to the International Stability Operations Association (ISOA), which represents a global network of companies including DynCorp.\n\"We don't know what will happen,\" ISOA president Ado Machida said, adding that he feared more such cases in the future as a new Afghan-U.S. security pact did not clarify the position of contractors working for some sections of the U.S. government.\nMachida also said some contractors were being unfairly targeted by Afghan government officials.\n\"Mid-level bureaucrats are coming out of the woodwork ... and bringing up all of the issues that in the past were resolved, and re-opening cases,\" he told Reuters.\nAccording to the finance ministry's Sabit, most of the money is owed by three big companies and a special commission has been appointed to deal with them.\nSabit declined to name them, but company officials said privately that intense efforts surrounded Supreme Group, DynCorp and Raytheon.\n\"Supreme Group has not applied for any future business licence to operate in Afghanistan after the earlier licences ended in March 2015,\" a company spokeswoman said.\nSupreme Group was once the primary supplier of food and water to U.S. troops, but lost its $8.8 billion contract after pleading guilty to criminal fraud.\nDynCorp said it supported several U.S. government contracts and had active licences. Raytheon did not respond to requests for comment.
