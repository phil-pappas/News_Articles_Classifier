(TheStreet) -- Wells Fargo is fond of pointing out that buying a home is the biggest investment most Americans will make in their lifetimes. \nThat may be one of the reasons that home mortgages are among Americans' biggest gripes, a fact highlighted in a report released this week by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group Education Fund. In an analysis of four years worth of complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government watchdog agency created after the financial crisis, researchers found that mortgage complaints accounted for 40% of the almost 363,000 claims, or about 138,000. \nThe remaining 60% of the total complaints were dispersed between student loans, credit cards, consumer loans, debt collection, and other financial products. The bureau , authorized by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and the Consumer Protection Act in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, has secured over $2.9 billion in refunds and relief by taking enforcement actions against more than 40 companies, according to the Public Interest group's research.

That included difficulties with loan modifications, collections, foreclosures, loan servicing, payments, and escrow accounts. \nBorrowers who complained to the federal agency were able to resolve them by getting an explanation about 86% of the time; they received monetary relief in about 4% of cases, according to the analysis of its complaints database . Just last month, the bureau started allowing consumers to post their personal stories in the database, sharing both their aggravation and their confusion. \nCompanies topping the grievance list, with the highest number of complaints, are Bank of America and Wells Fargo , according to the report. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., generated the most claims in 45 states and the District of Columbia, a trend due in part to its 2008 acquisition of subprime lender Countrywide Financial. That company specialized in loans to borrowers with credit scores too low to qualify for traditional mortgages, and buying it made Bank of America, which didn't offer such loans, a leading mortgage provider. \n\"The report reflects when we held the dominate mortgage servicing market share at the peak of the economic downturn,\" Bank of America said in a statement. \"We have since helped more than 2 million customers avoid foreclosure and reduced the number of seriously delinquent mortgage loans to less than 10 percent of peak levels.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T22:31:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
