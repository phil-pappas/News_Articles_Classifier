It hit a record low of 230 to the dollar on Wednesday while the bank rate was 196.95. Investors questioned how long the bank can hold the peg given the parallel market weakness.\n\"The CBN does not panic and will not take desperate measures to satisfy few misguided interests in the market,\" Muazu said.\n\"Like other oil-exporting countries, Nigeria is grappling with its share of the aftermath of the oil price decline. Despite this, our economic fundamentals remain strong,\" he said.\n\"As we transition into a new administration in Nigeria, we must continue to ensure policy stability at all times.\" (Reporting by Camillus Eboh; additional reporting by Chijioke Ohuocha in Lagos; editing by David Clarke )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T20:17:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
