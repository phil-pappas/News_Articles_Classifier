It will affect both existing and new customers with interest-only loans and lines of credit.\nBanks have said they are raising interest rates to comply with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA) requirement that housing investor credit growth slow to less than 10 per cent.\nNAB said interest-only loans were the \"predominant structure for investors,\" and it had been working closely with APRA, which is trying to limit risks in the housing market.\nThe bank said that while all home loans had grown by 27 per cent in the last three years, housing investment loans had jumped 34 per cent and interest-only loans were up 44 per cent.\nGroup executive for personal banking, Gavin Slater, argued the approach would support responsible lending practices.\n\"In an environment of record low interest rates, NAB believes it is important to encourage our customers to pay down their home loan,\" Mr Slater said.\n With interest-only home loans, the monthly payments do not include any principal. They are popular with investors because they allow borrowers, who can deduct interest from their taxable income, but regulators have also raised concerns about an increase in interest-only borrowing by owner-occupiers.\nJust over a third of NAB's outstanding home loans were interest-only in the latest March half.\nUnlike the changes from ANZ and CBA last week, this change will affect owner-occupier customers who have interest-only loans.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cba-joins-anz-in-raising-investor-interest-rates-by-027-percentage-points-20150724-gijihx.html"], "published": "2015-07-27T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T10:10:31.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
