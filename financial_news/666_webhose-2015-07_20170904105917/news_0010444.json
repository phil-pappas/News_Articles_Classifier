Photo: Sasha Wooley\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission has seen a rise in the reporting of suspicious trading activity under its market integrity rules.\nParticipants of the Australian Securities Exchange and Chi-X must notify the regulator if they have \"reasonable grounds\" to suspect an order or transaction has been placed while an individual in possession of inside information.\nIn addition, they may report activity which has the effect of creating or maintaining an artificial price or a false or misleading appearance in the market or price for trading in financial products.\nThe suspicious activity reporting (SAR) rule came into effect in January 2013, with ASIC receiving 214 such reports from 34 market participants since.\nAdvertisement Of those reports, one market participant was responsible for almost 11 per cent of the total.\nSo far in 2015, some 55 suspicious trading incidents have been reported, suggesting another annual rise in the reports to ASIC.\nThe year-to-date figure compares to 84 reports to ASIC for calendar 2014 and 75 in 2013.\n\"The importance of SAR to ASIC is reflected in the number of reported matters being referred to ASIC's Enforcement team for further investigation,\" the regulator said in a supervisory update.\n\"Approximately 15 per cent of SARs received to date have been referred to enforcement for further investigation.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:06:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
