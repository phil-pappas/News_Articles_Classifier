Four people were injured in the shooting, but no one has been arrested. \nMakhura condemned the attack and said such behavior would not be tolerated. Police would be in the area until stability had returned. \n\"We are in conversation with law enforcement agencies to bring Operation Fiela to the area. If the police require the assistance of the SA National Defence Force, they know which direction to follow and it will be provided.\" \nTransport MEC Ismail Vadi said the problems in Mamelodi were as a result of the taxi owners not understanding the process of applying for operating permits. He said because the route was already in operation, a new service could be appointed without the need to gazette or put to tender. \nPutco cancelled its contract in Gauteng for eight routes, citing financial loss. Mamelodi was one of the routes. Autopax was appointed to fill the void, much to the dismay of taxi owners in the area, who questioned how Autopax was able to get permits while they have to wait a long time. \n\"A permit is not guaranteed. You apply for a permit and it can either be approved or declined, based on many factors. The municipalities also decide if they have capacity or if they need new taxis and if they say no then the permits are not issued,\" Vadi said. \nThere has been an increase in taxi violence in the province with Mamelodi recording the highest number of incidents. \n\"We have made taxi violence a priority in the province. We have to address the issue,\" he said. \nCommunity Safety MEC Sizakele Molabane-Nkosi said in recent months, a group of four men from KwaZulu-Natal, were allegedly paid to \"take out\" taxi bosses in the area. She said two were arrested while two managed to flee. \n\"We also recovered a lot of arms when we arrested them.\" \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T18:51:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
