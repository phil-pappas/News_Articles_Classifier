Karanja, who is the CEO of Frescho Seeds Kenya Limited, was announced the winner during the Making Markets Matter executive training programme for the agribusiness sector held in South Africa. \n\"As the winner of the African Agribusiness Entrepreneur of the Year Award, I am glad to be recognised among the many African entrepreneurs who contribute significantly to empowering smallholder farmers through access to quality and affordable seeds that have been processed through modern technologies,\" Karanja said in a press statement.

The progress of many seed companies in Kenya is deterred by a range of retrogressive policies and regulatory processes that make it difficult for entrepreneurs to establish and efficiently run businesses. Governments should institute reforms to attract a larger number of entrepreneurs into the sector,\" he said. \nThe Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, Programme for Africa's Seed System (PASS) director, Dr Joe DeVries, said he hoped that the award would send a positive message to other seed entrepreneurs in the region and will encourage them to increase investments in the sector. \"An African agriculture transformation can only be achieved if farmers have access to the right seeds, fertiliser and other inputs and if they understand the right agronomic practices to increase their yields,\" he said. \nThe award recognises entrepreneurs who have demonstrated outstanding achievements in value-added agricultural innovations in Africa. It is administered by Market Matters Inc., a non-profit organisation providing business development services in emerging markets in Africa.
