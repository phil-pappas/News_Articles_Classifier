Not Much By Ralph Jennings | 07/02/15 - 09:56 AM EDT Reprint \nTAIPEI, Taiwan ( TheStreet ) -- China's Communist government -- known for its tight control over the economy -- is largely taking a hands-off approach to the plunging stock market. And that's making foreign investors even more nervous. \nChinese authorities appear to be taking short-term steps, such as delaying IPOs, to ease the free-fall in stocks since mid-June. But over the long term, they're expected to let the free market take an organic course, creating risks to overseas investors. \n\"I don't see China taking any specific measures to prop up the stock market,\" said Jack Perkowski, managing partner of merchant bank JPF Holdings in Beijing. \n\"For example, I don't see the country implementing any massive buying program,\" he said. \"In fact, China is taking measures that are good for the long-term development of the market and China, but which have put downward pressure on the market.\" \nMust Read: 4 Ways to Make Money in Emerging Markets With Little Risk \nChinese stocks have plunged over 20% in just a few weeks, pushing the market into bear territory. Shanghai shares closed Thursday at the lowest level since April 3. \nRelatively little government support for China's plummeting \"A\" shares would challenge offshore investors, many of whom have launched funds or increased their government-awarded trading quotas in view of the past year's gains. Some have priced in the likelihood of volatility but many expected the authoritarian government -- traditionally known for economic intervention -- to keep the market in check. \nIndividual foreign investors are barred from buying \"A\" shares but can park money in the funds of overseas institutions that have government-issued quotas to trade. Experienced institutions that may be able to steer around muted government support for the markets include U.S. fund managers BlackRock ( BLK - Get Report ) and Invesco ( IVC - Get Report ) as well as Swiss bank UBS ( UBS ) . \nRiskier bets would be CSOP Asset Management of Hong Kong's CSOP FTSE China A50 Exchange-Traded Fund ( AFTY ) , which follows a smaller index known for high valuations, and the Matthews China Dividend Investor ( MCDFX ) fund run by American asset manager Matthews Asia to pick firms likely to pay dividends. \nRegulators have delayed IPOs -- 23 companies were due to go public in June alone -- and let pension funds invest directly in equities to add capital, analysts say. They have already cut loan-to-deposit ratios and interest rates to increase liquidity. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T18:11:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
