The stock has lost more than 60 percent of its value in the past year. \n(Reporting by Shubhankar Chakravorty and Anannya Pramanick in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Ted Kerr)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T22:02:42.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
