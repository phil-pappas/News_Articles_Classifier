It traded at 27.25 pence at 8:19 a.m. in London, valuing about 568 million pounds ($892 million).\nA special planning committee voted 8-7 in favor of the mine Tuesday, ending a protracted approval process that has dragged on for years. Sirius says the project will create more than 1,000 jobs and add 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) a year to the British economy.\n“This is really just the beginning for the company,” Chris Fraser, the chief executive officer of Sirius, said in a statement. “We have made a major step forward and now have a pathway to reaching production and unlocking ever more value for our shareholders.”\nThe proposed mine has proved highly contentious and the park’s own planning officers’ final report before Tuesday’s meeting said the economic benefit of mining didn’t outweigh the harm it would cause. The greater public interest is in protecting the park for future generations, the report said, while making no formal recommendation.\n“We have long maintained that this project is completely incompatible with National Park purposes,” the Campaign for National Parks said in a statement after the ruling. “The promised economic benefits could never justify the huge damage that it would do to the area’s landscape and wildlife and to the local tourism economy.”\nTo develop the York potash mine, Sirius plans to dig underground shafts within the 554-square-mile (1,430-square-kilometer) park before boring out the mineral from deposits under the land and the North Sea. The polyhalite would be crushed and processed down the mine before being fed to an underground pipe and taken as slurry to a port 28 miles away.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:47:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
