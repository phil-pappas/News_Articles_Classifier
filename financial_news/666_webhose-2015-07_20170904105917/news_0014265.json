American Airlines Group, Delta Air Lines and United Continental Holdings hold the numbers one, two and three places respectively in terms of revenue, and are the world’s largest three carriers in terms of passengers carried and RPKs.\nAmerican, out of Chapter 11 restructuring and newly reinvented after its merger with US Airways, marks the most remarkable turnaround, going from a $1.2 billion net loss in 2013 to a $2.9 billion net profit for 2014. Indeed, chairman and CEO Doug Parker’s operation tops each one of the key passenger airline rankings—revenue, operating profit, net profit, RPKs, passengers carried and size of operating fleet (see page 26).\nLufthansa Group and Air France-KLM continue to hold their status as mega-operations, fourth and fifth respectively in terms of RPKs; fifth and fourth respectively in revenue. But their traffic growth is stagnant and their profitability scorched by fierce competition and labor action. Lufthansa eked out a $67 million profit, while Air France-KLM was $230 million in the red. Of the European majors, only British Airways owner IAG made it into the top ten most profitable airlines, delivering a respectable $1 billion to place it in sixth place. But Europe’s two low-cost carrier (LCC) giants, Ryanair and easyJet, both came close to the billion-dollar profit mark, earning them seventh and ninth places respectively in the world’s most profitable airline rankings—a remarkable achievement by these all-narrowbody operators.\nOther noteworthy airlines in the top 25 most profitable companies include Southwest Airlines—fourth at a $1.1 billion net profit—US independents Alaska Air Group (12th), JetBlue Airways (16th) and Spirit Airlines (22nd), while Panama’s Copa Holdings was 17th, Canadian LCC WestJet was 21st and fast-growing Budapest-based LCC Wizz Air was 24th.\nFinancially, 2014 was a tough year for most Asia-Pacific carriers, although Japan Airlines—restructured with government support—was the world’s third most profitable carrier with a net profit of $1.2 billion. Chinese carriers, boosted by drops in fuel costs, were the region’s most successful, with China Eastern Airlines, Hainan Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Southern Airlines and Xiamen Airlines all making it in the top 25 rankings. Taiwan’s Air China placed 11th.\nIn terms of passenger growth, Chinese carriers and LCCs were the biggest climbers along with the Gulf carriers and Turkish Airlines.\nIATA, meanwhile, has boosted its forecast 2015 collective net profit for the world’s airlines to $29.3 billion, up 47.2% over a net profit of $19.9 billion projected by the organization in December 2014.\n“For the first time in our history, the airline industry as a whole will earn its cost of capital,” IATA DG and CEO Tony Tyler said at the IATA AGM in Miami in June. “The strongest driver of improved profitability is efficiency,” he said. But Tyler cautioned that the global airline industry is still operating at a “hard-earned 4% average net profit margin” and profitability is “far from uniform” around the world.\nNorth American airlines are expected to account for more than half of the global industry’s 2015 net profit, earning $15.7 billion while making $18.12 per passenger, according to IATA. “The US is our industry’s most impressive turnaround story,” Tyler said. “Airlines [in the US] are investing more than $1 billion per month in their product and adding service to meet rising demand for connectivity.”\nData for the 2015 ATW World Airline Report was\ncompiled by ATW Managing Editor Kathryn M.
