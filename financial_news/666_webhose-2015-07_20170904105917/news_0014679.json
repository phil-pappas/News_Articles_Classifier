The SPX had fallen about 70 points in five days. Some of those oversold conditions have resulted in buy signals. As far as the chart of SPX goes, though, it remains in a trading range between the support area at or just above 2040 and the top of the range (2135). This chart will remain as a neutral indicator until that range is broken decisively, with concurrence from the technical indicators. \nThe standard equity-only put-call ratio raced upward as prices fell, and was as high as it was last October (which is a very oversold state). Now a buy signal has occurred (as of the close on July 28) in the standard ratio. The weighted ratio is only about halfway up its chart, and it gave a somewhat premature buy signal last week. Even though it has pushed higher this week, the computer analysis continues to rank it as a “buy,” hence the (B) on its chart means just that. \nThe Total put-call ratio made a new relative high as well, closing at 0.938. It is on the verge of a powerful buy signal also; in this case, a buy signal occurs if the 21-day moving average of the Total put-call ratios makes a peak that lasts for 10 days. However, we do not have to wait for the entire 10 days in order to declare a buy, and that is what we are declaring now — a buy signal for the Total put-call ratio.
