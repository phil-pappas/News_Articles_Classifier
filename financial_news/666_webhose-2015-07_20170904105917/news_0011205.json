Louise Kennerley by Sally Rose The federal government is less likely to impose an outright ban on the $550 billion self-managed super fund industry borrowing to buy investment property, according to industry groups.\nThey said options being considered by Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg include restricting borrowing to commercial property, limiting personal guarantees and capping debt levels.\n\"There are positive signals emanating from Canberra to suggest a compromise can be found on this issue,\" SMSF Association executive Graeme Colley said.\nThe financial system inquiry, headed by former Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive David Murray, urged the government to stop self-managed super funds using limited recourse loans .\nAssistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is considering proposals to tighten the rules. Sean Davey Mr Murray's report found the amount of these loans has increased almost 18 times in the five years 2014 to hit $8.7 billion, which would exacerbate the impact of any downturn in the property market, now booming in Sydney and Melbourne. The government's formal response to the report is expected in August.\nHow it works Under the rules now, a person can set up a self-managed super fund for the purpose of getting a loan to buy an investment property that will be held in a separate trust.\nThe trustee receives any investment returns earned from the property, but if the loan defaults the bank's rights are limited to the value of the trust's assets.\n This structure is designed to protect people from losing all their super. But the borrower, in most cases, has to provide a personal guarantee in case the investment goes bad, usually against the family home.\n\"In the main, limited recourse borrowing is not problematic so we strongly oppose an outright ban,\" Mr Colley said.\n\"However there are concerns about property spruikers encouraging people to set up SMSFs to make inappropriate investments using the arrangement and for this reason we have discussed a number of options with the treasurer's office that could serve to limit that sort of unwanted behaviour.\"\n\"Imposing a limit on the use of personal guarantees and tightening related party earnings is one of the possible compromises the SMSF Association has put forward.\"\nLimiting guarantees Mr Frydenberg's office declined to comment but he indicated in February that the government was considering suggestions to ban self-managed super fund trustees from giving lenders a personal guarantee.\n\"If personal guarantees are taken out of the picture, most lenders will be reluctant to lend and this will diminish the problem,\" SMSF Owners' Alliance executive director Duncan Fairweather said.\nThe SMSF Owners' Alliance preferred compromise would be for the government to cap the proportion of a fund's total assets it can borrow against at 50 per cent, he said.\nAnother alternative would be to restrict limited recourse borrowing to commercial property.\n\"Most limited recourse borrowing happens within the SMSFs of small business owners who use it as a sensible tool to buy their commercial premises,\" Mr Fairweather said.\nOther options Other alternatives to banning limited recourse borrowing the government has been asked to consider include: licensing of advice on limited recourse loans, greater resourcing of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to crack down on spruikers, and establishing industry best practice guidelines.\nMr Murray argued for a ban on limited recourse borrowing in response to fears a rising level of debt in the small super fund industry is increasing systemic risks.\nOnly about 2 per cent of all do-it-yourself funds borrow to invest in property, with roughly 3 per cent of the total $554 billion asset pool allocated in this way.\nASIC and various state consumer watchdog groups have all said they are concerned about property spruikers encouraging people to set up a self-managed super fund so they can borrow to invest in off-the plan developments.\nThe lobby groups who support maintaining limited recourse borrowing argue increased leverage in super is not yet approaching a level where it poses a threat to the system.\nIn May, National Australia Bank said it would stop limited recourse borrowing arrangements on residential properties and limit it to commercial property investments.\nANZ does not underwrite any limited recourse borrowing arrangements. Commonwealth Bank and Westpac still have products that provide property investment loans to self-managed funds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:12:14.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
