The plan will face its first hurdle in the Greek Parliament on Friday. Broad support in Greece for the plan would give the reforms more credibility, according to Dijsselbloem.\n“But also then we have to see whether the proposals are good, if it gets Greece really out of the crisis,” Dijsselbloem said.\nDeutsche Bank AG strategist George Saravelos said in a note to clients that a first reading of the proposals found them to be constructive and indicative of government willingness to reach an agreement. European leaders will deliberate on the plan over the weekend.\n“It’s a far reaching decision we’ll have to take,” Dijsselbloem said. “So let’s do it thoroughly.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T12:55:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
