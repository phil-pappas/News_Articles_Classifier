It has failed to do so,\" said Jan Lynn Owen, commissioner of the California agency, in a separate statement. \n\"This new agreement holds Banamex appropriately accountable for its continued violations.\" \nThe move affects 300 workers in California and Texas. Banamex USA has assets just over $500 million and deposits of about $460 million, Citigroup said. \nCitigroup said it was focused on working with affected employees to locate jobs \"both inside and outside of Citi.\" \nCitigroup has faced a number of probes over Banamex after it announced a charge of about $235 million in February 2014 due to uncovering \"significant\" fraud on the books of oil contractor Oceanografia after having lent it $585 million through a Banamex unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T02:06:43.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
