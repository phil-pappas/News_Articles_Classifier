Kimberly-Clark Corp. (NYSE: KMB) managed to beat analyst expectations despite an $823 million dip in income. In a Thursday morning earnings release, the Irving-based personal products company reported earnings per share of $1.41 per share, exceeding predictions of $1.36 EPS. Revenues of $4.64 billion also surpassed estimates of $4.625 million. “Kimberly-Clark’s cost saving measures, regular innovations, growth initiatives and a strong international presence are strong pillars of the company and have been driving earnings for the past many quarters,” reported Zacks Investment Research. “However, much like the rest of the consumer staple companies, Kimberly-Clark remains exposed to currency headwinds and input cost inflation.” Headwinds pose the biggest threat to KC’s balance sheet and were responsible for a 10 percent slump in sales during Q2, the company reported. In a Thursday earnings call, senior vice president and CFO Maria Henry added that KC expects currency headwinds to negatively impact earnings by 20 percent for the year. That hit reflected in net income numbers, which nosedived from $530 million last year to a $293 million loss in Q2. Income for the first six months of 2015 also slumped 82 percent to $193 million from $1.08 billion in the first half of 2014. Despite those numbers, KC said it will bump up its 2015 guidance from between $5.60 to $5.80 to $5.65 to $5.80. “This reflects our strong performance in the first half of the year, additional cost savings and more investments behind our brands and growth initiatives than we previously planned,” CEO Tom Falk said. “We continue to be optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive returns to shareholders.\" But investors initially didn't share Falk's optimistic view. At 8:50 a.m., KMB stock had fallen to $110.61 per share after closing at $112.20 on Wednesday. Prices spiked back to $112.47 by 9:30 a.m. \nWant Dallas Retailing & Restaurants news in your inbox?
