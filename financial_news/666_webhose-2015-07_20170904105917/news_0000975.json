The report is citing two sources with knowledge of the matter. \nAccording to the LinkedIn profile of Mr Cross he has been working at the Bank of England since August 2000, when he resumed his career at the institution as a Senior Manager of International Economics Analysis. The first position Mr Cross took at the Bank of England dates to 1990 when he worked in clearing and settlement. \nMr Cross has been mostly committed to the public sector throughout his career serving at the International Monetary Fund between 1997 and 2000 in a brief interruption to his Bank of England stature. \nThe position of Mr Cross has been paramount in the operations of the Bank of England. While being responsible for the FX desk, he was managing six traders and the chief dealer. The Bank of England’s foreign exchange desk is responsible for a number of dealings, namely FX hedging operations on behalf of the U.K. government. \nIn addition other central banks which are holding foreign or domestic currency to the Bank of England are in close contact with the desk. \nThe other major responsibility of Mr Cross has been to manage the reserves of the UK’s central bank. While most of the Bank of England’s holdings are parked in government bonds of the most powerful economies in the world, the $6 billion chest stands ready to be used fur currency markets intervention. \nSince the collapse of the British pound in 1992, when it bent to market pressure and was suspended from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in place at the time, the central bank has been only intervening on the currency markets in coordinated efforts with other central banks. \nMr Cross was the direct supervisor of the chief foreign exchange dealer of the Bank of England, Martin Mallett, who left his position in the aftermath of the revelations around the foreign exchange fixing dealings. Mallet allegedly failed to escalate some fixing-related issues. The departure of Mr Cross is not necessarily related to the foreign exchange fixing scandal. Got a news tip?
