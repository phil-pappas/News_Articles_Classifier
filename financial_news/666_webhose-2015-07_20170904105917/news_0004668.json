Its shares were up 2.3 percent at 1440 GMT.\n“I am extremely proud of teaming up with the Financial Times, one of the most prestigious news organisations in the world,” said Tsuneo Kita, cairman and group CEO of Nikkei. “We share the same journalistic values.”\n 23, 2015 6:45 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T00:19:51.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
