It's understood two banks will be appointed.\nTegel is an integrated producer, processor, marketer and distributor of chicken and turkey products. It is majority-owned by Affinity with management holding less than 10 per cent.\nAffinity bought the company from Pacific Equity Partners in 2011 for $NZ605 million, trumping bids from US fund Paine & Partners and Thailand's largest private company, The Charoen Pokphand Group. Macquarie Capital advised on this deal.\nAffinity has made a few changes in the past three years. It divested Tegel's property assets in 2014 via a sale and leaseback and repaid a significant portion of the debt.\nIt's understood the pitch to new investors will be centred around the raft of international sales initiatives which have commenced under Affinity's ownership.\nA sale would cap a busy period for the Asia-based Affinity, which has closed $3 billion of Australian deals in the past 12-months, including two proprietary transactions.\nAffinity sold Primo Smallgoods to Brazilian meat processing giant JBS for a blockbuster $1.45 billion in November 2014. The deal with JBS, which is Australia's biggest meat packer, marketer and exporter and the world's largest processor of protein, valued Primo at eight times earnings and showed there was strong interest in local food producers, particularly from Asian and South American buyers.\n Potential buyers for Tegel include the usual global private equity suspects as well as Shuanghui Group, Shandong Minhe Animal Husbandry Co. Ltd., Charoen Pokphand and Brasil Foods.\nSources told Street Talk JBS would also take a look at Tegel given the strong relationship forged between Affinity and JBS during the Primo transaction, while Costa Group's recent raising showed there is demand for food-based industrial companies among listed equities investors.\nAffinity bought a 35 per cent stake in Virgin Australia Holding's Velocity frequent flyer division for $336 million in October 2014, followed by the purchase of Nine Entertainment Co's Live division in April for about $640 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:09:28.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
