David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd Investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist Graham Tuckwell is the latest wealthy Australian to urge his fellow BRW Rich List members to give back to the country that helped make them wealthy.\nTuckwell, who lives in Jersey and has an estimated wealth of $450 million, is visiting Australia as part of the final 2016 student selection for those seeking to win the 25 scholarships offered each year by the Graham and Louise Tuckwell Foundation .\nThe couple have made a $50 million endowment to the Australian National University in Canberra out of the earnings from the ETF Securities Group, which manages about $US17 billion ($23.5 billion) in exchange traded funds.\nTuckwell says when he was growing up in Australia the wealthiest people such as Alan Bond and Christopher Skase were not role models.\n\"Most of these people made money through government licences or various oligopolies. But do I look to them as role models? Absolutely not,\" Tuckwell says.\n\"All I am getting at is that as I looked at the rich people in Australia, were they big philanthropists? No.\n\"But go to the US and the rich people like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett are good role models. They are philanthropists who are good role models. In the US there has always been a culture of if you have earned it you have a duty to give back.\n\"I am hoping that people in Australia who have made money will view themselves as having an obligation to give back.\n \"They have only been able to make it in Australia because of the opportunities that they have been given. Instead of sitting on all these millions, I would like to see some of the people at the top of the tree doing huge programs in areas where it is not easy for governments to step in.\"\nHe says these rich Australians should become philanthropic entrepreneurs.\n\"As Carnegie said, 'he who dies rich dies disgraced'.\"\nTuckwell says it was \"terrific\" to see Fortescue Metals Group chairman Andrew Forrest make a $65 million donation to West Australian universities .\nOther prominent recent examples of philanthropy by Australian businessmen were Worley Parsons founder John Grill's $20 million gift to the University of Sydney , the Packer family's $200 million philanthropic fund , a $50 million donation to charity by Alex Waislitz and a $3 billion donation to charity by the late founder of Ramsay Healthcare Paul Ramsay.\nTuckwell says his own foundation is not just about providing scholarships to talented young people to help them realise their potential, it is about trying to transform the tertiary education sector.\nHe says the narrow selection criteria for university entry including the primacy of the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) score is flawed.\nHe claims the ATAR system does not match the talents of young people to the appropriate degrees.\nHighly selective scholarships Tuckwell's scholarships are highly selective. Only about 3 per cent of applicants are successful. Also the selection process is quite gruelling. The ATAR has little bearing on whether you are successful. Applicants have to give fulsome information about themselves including their interests outside of study including music, sport and cultural interests.\nFor 2016, the selection process involves winnowing down the 800 applications to 250 based on the applications and then 75 are interviewed for the final 25 positions. The successful applicants were notified this week.\nA critical aspect of the Tuckwell Foundation's scholarship is that it is for residential students.\nIn fact, Tuckwell is planning to extend the investment portfolio for the endowment to include investments in student accommodation. That will help ameliorate the single largest component of costs in the scholarship.\nTuckwell, who worked in Prime Minister and Cabinet under Mike Keating, is highly critical of Australia's taxation policies including the tax-free status for the family home.\nHe also thinks that Australian superannuation savers are being ripped off by the super system because of high fees.\nThis criticism was made by David Murray's financial system inquiry. Tuckwell talks his own book when he says the way to cut costs is to introduce ETFs across all portfolios.\nHe says the fundamental flaw in the foundation of the super system was to outsource all funds management to private managers. What should have happened, he says, was the creation of one big fund that would efficiently manage all super savings.\nTuckwell says he carved out a career in funds management because of his willingness to take risks.\n\"I was willing to go broke trying to pursue my dreams,\" he says.\n\"I enjoy international finance.\" Tuckwell says he was lucky to have the skill set to cover the broad range of issues need in ETFs including law, mathematics, structuring and compliance.\nBalance sheet shuffle Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt has abandoned a range of conservative accounting policies to deal with the state's intractable debt problem.\nHe slashed the state's headline debt number by $17 billion by loading the two electricity network companies with debt, ending the asset and liability matching of public service pension liabilities and suspending contributions to defined benefit pension plans for five years while fully funding current liabilities.\nThe moves did not fool ratings agency Standard & Poor's. It said the government's non-financial public sector debt would remain in excess of 120 per cent of revenue.\nQueensland will now run its electricity network companies in a similar manner to other states which have had the good sense to privatise them. Ergon Energy and Energex will have gearing ratios of 70 to 75 per cent and 100 per cent dividend payout ratios.\nIt is questionable whether Ergon Energy can handle the burden of the balance sheet leverage and dividend payout policies of a privately owned network operator.\nThat doubt stems from the fact that the Australian Energy Regulator found that its costs are above what a prudent and efficient operator would incur in delivering services to customers.\nMeanwhile, as expected, S&P changed Western Australia's AA+ credit rating outlook to negative.\nIts semi government bonds and those issued by Queensland now trade at a 40-basis-point premium to the AAA-rated bonds issued by NSW.\nVale John Buchanan Plenty of New Zealanders have made a big mark on the world but few have scaled the heights of international business as smoothly as BHP Billiton director John Buchanan. He died on Monday at age 72.\nBHP Billiton chairman Jac Nasser said: \"He made an invaluable contribution as a director because of his long-standing relationships in the investor community, his strategic approach and his financial and business acumen. His many years of experience gave him great insight and perspective when addressing key governance issues.\"\nDescribed as courteous and gentlemanly, Buchanan was executive director and group chief financial officer of BP from 1996 to 2002 and from 2003 served on a number of boards including BHP, Vodafone, AstraZeneca, Smith & Nephew and ARM Holdings.\nBuchanan, who was knighted in 2012 for services to business, served as chairman of the UK Trustees of the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal.\nChanticleer lunch Westpac Banking Corp chairman Lindsay Maxsted, CSL director Christine O'Reilly and Lion chairman Rod Eddington will be the guest panellists at the next JPMorgan Chanticleer lunch in Melbourne .\nBe prepared for a robust discussion about the policy challenges facing Australia. The guests have fiduciary obligations at a broad range of Australian and international companies.\nThrough their various portfolios of directorships they cover banking and finance, media, resources, energy generation and distribution, healthcare, science, infrastructure, food and beverages and not-for-profit groups.\nThe lunch will be held at the Mural Hall on Tuesday, September 1.\nTony Boyd\nTwitter: @TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@TonyBoydAFR", "https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR", "http://chanticleermelbourne.floktu.com/"], "published": "2015-07-14T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:04:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
