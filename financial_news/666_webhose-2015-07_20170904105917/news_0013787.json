Photo courtesy of Infosys.com.\nAlthough this is small change in comparison to the $250 million the company set aside in January as part of an ‘ Innovate India Fund ’ intended to support home-grown startups, it is a move that indicates a new strategy for capital allocation.\nBangalore-based Infosys, which falls under the same IT services category as other domestic giants, Wipro and TCS, has struggled over the past couple of years with leadership changes, staff attrition rates, and a weak rupee .\nDue to a silent period pre quarterly reporting results on 21 July, Infosys were unable to comment further on why Ireland, why now, and what specific types of Irish startups they will be looking to invest in. However, a press release says the company ‘will provide application development and management, and transformation and innovation services’.\nThe release also cites Infosys Executive Vice President and Global Head of Financial Services, Mohit Joshi, as saying “our investment in the Irish start-up community reflects our belief that Ireland is a strong and vibrant nation, home to entrepreneurs who share our vision of technology as a way to drive growth.”\nIreland isn’t an altogether redundant ‘pin-on-the-map’ target for business. The debt-stricken nation is not only home to a highly educated population, still struggling to find desk jobs after the post-2008 recession on the back of the international financial crisis, but it also boasts one of the lowest corporate tax rates in Europe, as well as a pro-business government , which allows start-ups to claim back taxes, even if they are loss makers.\nThe Infosys space in Dublin will host 200 employees, a combination of transferees from AIB and those working on other Ireland-won contracts.\nThe Global Innovation Fund is the brainchild of Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka , a Stanford University PhD graduate, founder of two start-ups and former head of Advanced Tech at Germany’s SAP, who took the helm after 27-years in the U.S.\nInfosys CEO Vishal Sikka. Photo courtesy of Infosys.com.\nHis very different experience has brought an entirely different way of thought to Infosys’ strategy : by utilizing the disruptive technologies brought on board by the startups they invest in, Sikka hopes to grow the company’s fortunes.\nThe company has said it plans to raise revenue to $20 billion by 2020 , up from a current $8.7 billion.\n“The traditional model of IT services is dying but yet businesses continue to look for partners who can help them grow and innovate – we see an increasing role that automation and innovation will play in our existing portfolio,” Reuters reported Sikka as saying during the company’s 4Q 2015 release.\nThough that traditional business of theirs isn’t entirely out of the window – Infosys yesterday announced signing a multi-million Euro, multi-year deal with Deutsche Bank to provide technological support and business impact across several categories within the Bank.", "external_links": ["http://www.infosys.com/investors/reports-filings/quarterly-results/2014-2015/q4/Documents/IFRS-USD-press-release.pdf", "http://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/Pages/strategic-technology-services-partner.aspx", "http://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/Pages/innovate-india-fund.aspx", "http://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/Pages/financial-application-management-innovation.aspx", "http://www.firstpost.com/business/corporate-business/desperation-and-hope-among-infosys-staff-as-company-struggles-to-revive-fortunes-1970711.html", "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/24/us-infosys-results-idUSKBN0NF1QZ20150424%20", "http://www.livemint.com/Companies/vmS15UwutPvpK9y0Oo2VzM/Vishal-Sikka-hires-former-SAP-executive-to-run-500-mn-innov.html"], "published": "2015-07-10T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T07:05:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
