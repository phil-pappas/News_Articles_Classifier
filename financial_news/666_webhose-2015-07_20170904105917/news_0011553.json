The system allows users to authenticate certain requests, such as setting up standing orders, by logging into the Lloyds mobile app to verify their identity. \nLloyds claimed that this cuts out the need for automated verification calls and enables the customer to carry out an authentication process in under 20 seconds. \nThis could help blind or hard of hearing customers to benefit from the faster authentication process, Lloyds said. \nThe company is pursuing several contactless and mobile payments technologies, and will support Apple Pay when the service launches in the UK on 14 July .
