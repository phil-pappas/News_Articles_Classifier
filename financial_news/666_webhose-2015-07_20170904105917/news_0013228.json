Ron D'Raine by Trevor Hoey Nickel takes the prize for being the most volatile base metal, and while it is hovering around the low point of where it has traded since 2004, when the mining boom started to gain traction, it does seem to have found a base in the vicinity of $US5.70 a pound.\nAnalysts at UBS noted last week London Metals Exchange's (LME) nickel inventory stood at about 460,000 tonnes and that over the past two weeks stocks had eased a total of 12,000 tonnes in 11 straight days of declines.\nThe broker also said cancelled warrants could potentially be a lead indicator of physical metal demand. A substantial increase in April imports from China strengthens nickel's macroeconomic case.\nUBS is forecasting a significant increase in price in 2016 and sees the current sub-$US6 a pound price as representing good value. The broker expects demand from China to drive the metal to $US8 a pound in 2016, representing an increase of 40 per cent on current levels.\nAFR Smart Investor identifies three stocks that stand to benefit from a rebound, including two that tend to fly under the radar.\nWestern Areas is the largest ASX-listed pure nickel play, with a market capitalisation of about $800 million. Independence Group, while diversified, is a large producer and should its merger with Sirius Resources go ahead its long-term production profile will be enhanced significantly.\nHowever, for investors seeking substantial leverage to a nickel rebound, combined with near to long-term earnings visibility, Western Areas is arguably the pick of the three stocks. In mid-June the group strengthened its position with the cash acquisition of the Cosmos Nickel Complex (CNC) in Western Australia.\nAffordable The project was acquired from Xstrata Nickel Australasia for $24.5 million in a transaction analysts from Bell Potter described as an affordable, low-risk growth option. In particular, the broker pointed to the fact that 65 per cent of the resource was in the \"higher confidence\" measured and indicated category, which can potentially be converted into reserves.\nIt made an interesting comparison with Independence Group's acquisition of Sirius' Nova deposit, with the enterprise value to resource base purchase price for CNC of 6¢ a pound, compared with the $2.50 a pound paid by Independence Group.\nBell Potter analyst David Coates said: \"CNC looks well suited to Western Areas' proven skill sets in exploration, resource growth and mine operation, with good prospects of developing it into a second strategic production hub.\"\nHe has a buy recommendation on the stock, with a 12-month price target of $4.90, just less than the $5.10 target of Deutsche Bank, which also noted Western Areas had \"bought cheap exposure to higher nickel prices\".\nWestern Areas' two producing assets are Flying Fox and Spotted Quoll, which are expected to generate combined annual nickel in concentrate production of about 25,000 tonnes in 2014-15 and sustain production of more than 23,000 tonnes a year until 2020.\nThe group had net cash of $70 million at March 2015, leaving it well placed to continue developing its producing assets while embarking on an aggressive exploration campaign at the CNC project.\nThe share price of Mincor Resources spiked 10 per cent last week after the company announced promising drilling results, increased the resource at its Upper Durkin project by 46 per cent and released a maiden mineral resource estimate for its Voyce discovery.\nHigh grade While the latter is a relatively small resource of 64,000 tonnes, it is the high grade of 5.2 per cent nickel that has excited management. Mincor said the resource was present in four separate pods that lie less than 150 metres below the surface and it had confirmed deeper mineralisation.\nDuncan Hughes, from GMP Securities, noted the bulk of the reported resources were in the indicated category and were of encouragingly good grades. However, these developments are most relevant in terms of driving growth and mine lifes when nickel prices are back above $8.\nAt current Australia/US dollar exchange rates the spot nickel price is about $7.50. Should UBS's estimate of a 2016 $US8 nickel price come to fruition that would imply an Australian dollar price of about $10 based on current exchange rates.\nHowever, as Hughes highlighted, most commentators are expecting a significant nickel price rise in late 2015 and there are few nickel companies better leveraged than Mincor.\nPanoramic Resources is the other player that flies under the radar. However, this has more to do with the fact that the mine lives of its established Lanfranchi and Savannah projects in Western Australia are limited.\nImpressive drill results from the high-grade Lower Schmitz discovery at Lanfranchi suggest there could be a material mine life extension at that project. After examining the latest round of drilling results in May, analysts at Patersons indicated this could add about two years of mine life.\nFollowing exchange rate adjustments in May, analysts at Bell Potter upgraded Panoramic's fiscal 2016 profit forecast from $36 million to $47 million and increased its 12-month share price target from 64¢ to 69¢.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:02:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
