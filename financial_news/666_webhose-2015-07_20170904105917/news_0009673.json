The company also did not forecast a rebound in oil prices. \nHalliburton CEO Dave Lesar said the company will continue to \"manage costs through the downturn\" so that the company will be well positioned for growth \"when the industry recovers,\" a moment that now appears to have been pushed back as energy companies, and energy markets, are now fastening their seatbelts again. \nIn a note to clients on Monday, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid also noted that the oil crash seems to be playing out the same way it did late last year (emphasis and link added): \" It looks like we are starting to see signs of similar Oil-related headlines to the ones which dominated markets seven to eight months ago. The FT is running with a story suggesting that the world’s biggest energy companies have delayed $200bn worth of spending on new projects following the latest selloff. Meanwhile the WSJ is suggesting that US energy companies are planning more layoffs with ConocoPhillips in particular looking to potentially cut headcount by ‘thousands’ in addition to the 1500 jobs cut so far.\" \nAnd in the coming weeks, results from the energy sector are expected to be ugly, with earnings estimated to decline 54.4% year-over-year — the largest ever. Excluding energy, the S&P 500 would post a 4.1% gain in earnings instead of the 2.2% drop currently estimated, according to FactSet's John Butters. \nThis week, Exxon Mobil and Chevron report their earnings results, and could provide more color on what the industry expects now that oil prices are heading for the year-to-date lows again. \nOn Monday morning, WTI fell more than 1% to as low as $47.23, the weakest level in four months. \nHere's a look at WTI over the past 12 months: \n(Finviz)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T16:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T16:41:14.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
