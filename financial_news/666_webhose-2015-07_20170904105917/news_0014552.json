They carried on with the contract despite our warnings,\" said a senior Transnet engineer. \nAnother Transnet engineer said Transnet initially didn't want Prasa to move the locomotives even on the short track distance between the Cape Town docks and the nearby Salt River train depot. \nThe engineers say the locomotives could damage the overhead electrical cables on the country's rail lines. \nTender regulations flouted \nThe auditor general last year announced Prasa had flouted its own tender regulations when it awarded the contract to Swifambo Rail Leasing. \nThe South African Institute of Electrical Engineers (SAIEE) confirmed it was aware of the height issue and that it was working on finding \"technical solutions\". \nTransnet and Prasa \"engage on a frequent basis on any matter that affects us in whatsoever way through the designated channels and forums established between the two companies,\" said Transnet Freight Rail spokesperson Sandile Simelane. \n\"Transnet Freight Rail is therefore not at liberty to engage Prasa through the media,\" he added. \nMoffet Mofokeng, Prasa's spokesperson, did not respond to the newspaper's queries beyond stating in an e-mail that \"you are at liberty to write what you want\". \nSource: Netwerk24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T17:52:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
