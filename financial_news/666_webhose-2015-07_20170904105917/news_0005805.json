Photo: Kerrie Leishman\nOPINION\nI want to die peacefully in my sleep like my father, and unlike his terrified passengers … Yes, dear reader it's joke time! Humour gets a bad rap at work. Too often humour at work is referred to in censorious tones. Apparently it is not at all funny to stick a fire cracker under the toilet cubicle door of your station sergeant. We are all used to the tedious injunctions that humour can be offensive to others, and therefore we should avoid levity lest we end up on our third warning for asking chickens impertinent questions about their motives for exercising their rights as pedestrians.\nAll this blue-nosed talk about humour at work masks the fact that if it were not for laughter, corporate homicide would reach levels only seen in the reign of the Borgias, Rudd and Gillard. Humour provides a release like harmony in music, it provides a freedom from tension. The way in which humour operates underlines its important role in maintaining organisational harmony.\nThe most obvious use of humour is to provide a levelling influence, a reality check that our organisational masters are not our superiors. Subverting authority is a common theme in many comedies, comic films and novels. Whether it is Shakespeare's Falstaff, Charlie Chaplin's Dictator or Ricky Gervais' David Brent, characterising leaders as vain, incompetent or deluded has a long tradition. Ultimately satire is reflective. If our leaders are such fools, what does that say about the rest of us who voted for them, or follow them? Satire provides only temporary, if hilarious relief.\nAdvertisement The opening joke is not in the least satirical. Rather it works because the first part of the joke sets us on a path of understanding – we think we are listening to a heartfelt and intimate confidence, and we are encouraged to picture a peaceful passing. The second part of the joke, presents a jarringly different consequence of sleep before death. It is this sudden shift of context that makes us laugh.\nThis is the power of humour to radically and rapidly shift our thinking from one perspective to another. This ability should not be underestimated. A common presenting symptom of stressed, angry or warring people is that they are locked into a singular, narrow and unyielding perspective. Events are interpreted through an unremittingly negative and unchanging viewpoint. Such people have lost their sense of humour. They become preoccupied and monocular.\nJokes help us to appreciate that no matter how much we feel there is only one natural interpretation of events, there is always a different and sometimes radically different interpretation of the same situation. A sense of humour helps us to practise seeing the world from many different perspectives and in doing so increases the chances that we will appreciate that whatever view we form about our work, others may well see things differently. I was reminded of this recently when I was sitting there, minding my own business, naked, smeared with salad dressing and lowing like an ox ... when I was asked to get off the bus. Thanks to comedian Stewart Lee for bringing us that last gem.\nJim Bright is professor of career education and development at Australian Catholic University and owns Bright and Associates.
