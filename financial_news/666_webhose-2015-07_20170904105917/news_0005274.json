Nic Walker Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow And we thought things were rough at the newly minted billionaire Lloyd Blankfein 's Goldman Sachs.\nIt turns out that's just life in integrated investment banking, and we haven't been paying attention.\nTo our readers, we apologise.\nTo Australia's integrated investment banks please forgive us. Consider this a mea culpa . From now on, when staff depart we promise to give it the appropriate attention.\nRod Clement\nNow, we knew that long-time JP Morgan equities strategist and senior telecommunications sector analyst Paul Brunker (now at Optar Pty) had left the bank in February.\nBut we haven't properly acknowledged former JP Morgan executive director Stuart Jackson . He left in April.\nFellow JP Morgan executive director Andrew Skinner has also left the bank – recently.\nIn fact, all up we hear that three managing directors and 17 executive directors have left JP Morgan's Australian operation in the first six months of this year. Even for someone who works in the media that's a few people!\n The common link is …\nAs we understand it, there's something of a common link to Goldman Sachs Australia's Simon Rothery in all this.\nGoldies, you might remember, had The Assassin from Hong Kong – a somewhat apocryphal, Samurai sword-wielding character who, from time to time, flies into Australia only to leave, hours later, in circumstances similar to the restaurant scene in Quentin Tarantino 's Kill Bill .\nAnyway, in JP Morgan, that person goes by the name: The Toe Cutter .\nAnd from what we have heard, when she flies into the country, JP Morgan's Down Under staff better not be in their thongs.\nJust as at the seemingly emasculated Rothery's Goldman Sachs Australia, it seems JP Morgan's Australian boss Rob Priestly is not entirely in charge of all these staffing decisions – at least in some people's interpretation.\nJP Morgan's official line is that everyone who has left, has departed on their own terms to pursue exciting new opportunities outside the bank.\nHonestly, aside from the exorbitant pay packages, the benders in NYC, the long lunches, the weekenders on super yachts, the holidays at Aspen, the Savile Row suits, the almost complete absence of critical media reporting, the naked ladies (or naked men) draped on each arm, the best tickets to every grand final, to every State of Origin, to every Summer Olympics (and if you're the weird sort who goes for the Winter Olympics, that too) – honestly, aside from all that, who would want to be a Master of the Universe?\nAside from us, of course.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-07-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:08:20.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
