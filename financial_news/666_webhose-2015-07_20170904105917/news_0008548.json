That's a slight upgrade in the last forecast made in January, when economists made their second straight downgrade.\nThe governor and the legislature spent much of the last legislative session patching a $100 million hole in the budget. A variety of spending cuts and tax increases did the job. But the trajectory of growth in state programs was expected to outpace new revenues again in 2016, what officials describe as a structural budget deficit.\nOf specific concern is the continued weakness of personal income tax collections, meaning Vermonters are not earning more money. And declines in sales tax collections as Vermont retailers lose business to online sellers and competitors in sales-tax-free New Hampshire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T21:27:51.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
