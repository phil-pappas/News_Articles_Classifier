While U.S. crude inventories declined last week, supplies remain almost 100 million barrels above the five-year average.\nOil’s rebound from a six-year low has faltered amid economic uncertainty in China and Greece and speculation that a global glut will persist. The full impact of higher Iranian exports won’t be felt until 2016 as the nuclear deal is implemented, banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predict.\n“The rising dollar is a real concern,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $3.4 billion. “Iran is a headwind. We still have plenty of oil in the U.S.”\nWest Texas Intermediate for August delivery fell 14 cents to $51.27 a barrel at 10:12 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract slid $1.63 to $51.41 on Wednesday, the lowest close since April 9.\nU.S. Supplies Brent for August settlement, which expires Thursday, was 79 cents higher at $57.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark crude was at a premium of $6.57 to WTI. The more-active September contract rose 36 cents to $57.48.\nTotal U.S. inventories declined by 4.3 million barrels to 461.4 million last week, the first drop in three weeks, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday. Supplies at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. benchmark oil, rose by 438,000 barrels to 57.1 million for a third weekly gain, according to the EIA.\nU.S. refineries used 16.8 million barrels a day of crude last week, up 229,000 barrels from the previous period and the most in data going back to 1982.\n“Refining activity in the U.S. is at its peak, but demand will inevitably slow down as the summer season ends,” Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG, said Thursday by phone from Zurich. “There are signs of increasing investment activity among producers, which could weigh on oil prices.”\nIran Production Iran, the fourth-biggest member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, won’t achieve a crude-export boost of more than 500,000 barrels a day, or about 50 percent, until next year as the Islamic Republic’s compliance with curbs on its nuclear program is verified, according to banks including Goldman, Citigroup Inc. and Commerzbank AG.\n“The oil price may have bottomed out for now,” Eugen Weinberg, head of commodities research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said by phone. “The Iranian agreement still has many hurdles to overcome, and even then it will take time before the crude hits the market.”\nThe Buzzard field in the North Sea halted production Thursday, according to two people with knowledge of the operations. The field, which feeds crude into the Forties pipeline system, produced around 180,000 barrels a day last year, according to data from the U.K. Department of Energy and Climate Change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T17:38:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
