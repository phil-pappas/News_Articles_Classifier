Companies involved in the talks have not been named. \nThe 1,735 km (1,084 mile) pipeline, with a proposed annual capacity of 33 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas, will run more than 700 km across Afghanistan on its way to Pakistan and India, raising questions about the stability of shipments via the chronically unstable country. \nYet the pipeline, to be built in three years, is crucial for Turkmenistan, which is currently dependent on gas exports to China, which buys annually 30 bcm of the fuel. Berdymukhamedov said the pipeline would attract $1 billion in investments to Afghanistan and create 12,000 jobs. \nRussia, which imported more than 40 bcm of Turkmen gas in 2008, will buy no more than 4 bcm this year. Moscow says its development of gas fields elsewhere has made purchases of Turkmen gas unprofitable. \nTurkmenistan's relations with Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom worsened this week after Ashgabat accused it of not paying for gas supplied this year. Gazprom declined comment. \nNeighbouring Iran also buys small volumes of Turkmen gas. \n(Reporting by Marat Gurt; Writing by Dmitry Solovyov; Editing by David Holmes)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T16:18:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
