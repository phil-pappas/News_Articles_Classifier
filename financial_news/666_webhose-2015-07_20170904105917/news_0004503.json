The organization said it is seeking clarification from the Japanese organizing committee and will consider the options of the impact of Friday’s announcement. \nThe leading candidate for an alternate main venue is the 72,000-seat International Stadium in Yokohama, just south of Tokyo. The stadium, which hosted the 2002 soccer World Cup final, was one of 11 other venues selected for the 2019 tournament. \nFor weeks, the public line of Abe and other government officials has been that they would stick with the stadium designed by award-winning architect Zaha Hadid. \nHis abrupt decision Friday was seen as damage control as the costly stadium was another headache for Abe’s government, whose support rating has already fallen over unpopular defense legislation and gaffes by his party members. \nHadid’s office blamed soaring construction costs in Tokyo and a tight deadline. \n“It is not the case that the recently reported cost increases are due to the design, which uses standard materials and techniques well within the capability of Japanese contractors, and meets the budget set by the Japan Sports Council,” Jim Heverin, project director of Zaha Hadid Architects, said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \nJapan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said the contract with Hadid would be canceled, and a new international competition would be completed within six months. A new project and its estimated cost will then be announced. \nConstruction was scheduled to start in October on Hadid’s design, chosen in 2012 in an international competition. Some people likened the design to a bicycle helmet. Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T20:06:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
