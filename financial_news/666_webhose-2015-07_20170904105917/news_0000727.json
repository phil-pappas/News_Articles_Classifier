Chris Hyde Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The Queensland government will establish a framework for receiving unsolicited proposals from the private sector to help clear an infrastructure backlog and to take the pressure off the state's precarious finances.\nTreasurer Curtis Pitt said the decision, to be announced in Tuesday's budget, will allow companies to make submissions to the government as part of its promise to introduce innovative ways to deliver major projects.\n\"We want to send a very clear message to developers and investors that Queensland is open for business,\" Mr Pitt said.\n\"Our government is focused on infrastructure delivery which is why we want to harness the knowledge and experience of the private sector.\"\nA new online portal for companies to make market-led proposals will go live this week. The assessment process for the private bids will also be fast-tracked.\n\"This portal will make it easier for industry proponents to submit a proposal, especially complex proposals with interest from multiple government departments,\" Mr Pitt said.\n\"We're going to require government agencies to consider private-sector collaboration to bring projects on line as a priority.\"\nThe new framework for unsolicited proposals comes after months of lobby from industry and property groups for Queensland to match similar schemes in NSW, Victoria and Western Australia.\n It comes as Mr Pitt defended the reform agenda of the Labor government which has abandoned the former Liberal National Party government's $37 billion privatisation plans.\nThe first-time Treasurer raised eye-brows last month when he said the Palaszczuk wanted to emulate the reform agenda of the former Hawke and Keating governments of the 1980s and early 1990s which included an overhaul of the financial system and a floating of the Australian dollar.\nBusiness courted \"We've tried to engage with business to let them know we really are a government that is open to business ideas and new investment,\" Mr Pitt said in an interview with The Australian Financial Review .\n\"We have got a revenue challenge, but we have promised no new taxes or charges in this budget. But we can say we will provide a stable business environment over the next three years.\"\nWith house prices spiralling in Sydney and Melbourne, Mr Pitt said he wanted to boost net interstate migration to Queensland and to challenge perceptions that the state's economy is in a \"holding pattern\" after the end of the mining boom.\n\"We know by comparison, we have very affordable housing options in Queensland, particularly when you go into regional Queensland. We want people to see Queensland as an option,\" he said.\nMr Pitt last week said the Labor government would be relying on economic growth to bring the budget back to surplus at some stage over the four-year forward estimates.\nThe government has already been hit by a $3 billion shortfall in mining royalties which should be partly offset by a rise in property taxes, courtesy of a commercial and residential surge in south-east Queensland.\nWith pressure mounting to reduce debt, the Palaszczuk government said it would allow its state-owned energy companies to boost their borrowings so they can use $4 billion to pay down general government debt – a move which critics derided as an accounting sleight-of-hand.\nThe Palaszcuk government announced on Sunday it would invest another $212.3 million over four years to boost nursing numbers in the health system. It has already committed $750 million for extra training and apprenticeships.\nOpposition Leader Lawrence Springborg on Sunday promised an LNP government would not let car registration rise above inflation – a pre-emptive hit at the Labor government ahead of Tuesday's budget in which car registration is expected to rise.\n\"Queenslanders should not be used as cash-cows and forced to pay for the failings of an inexperienced Labor government unable to balance the books,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-07-12T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:57:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
