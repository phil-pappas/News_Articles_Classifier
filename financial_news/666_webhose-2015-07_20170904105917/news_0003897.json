It comes after Elliott Advisors which represents shareholders with 3.3% of Dragon joined the list of activist investors that claim ENOC's takeover is priced too low. Along with Baillie Gifford and Setanta Asset Management the group of dissenting shareholders now amounts to around 13% of the company. They say ENOC's offer does not give enough value to Dragon's future growth potential. The Emirate group has today said its valuation is based on the information provided by Dragon Oil's technical team. 'They (Dragon Oil's technical team) know more about the assets and their potential than those citing unsubstantiated speculation' a spokesperson for ENOC said. 'The technical team of Dragon Oil has clearly stated that production will plateau for the next 5 years. 'We are surprised that a few financial investors claim to know more about the assets than the people that operate them on a daily basis.' Elsewhere on Friday shares in Tomco Energy (LON:TOM) soared as much as 40% after receiving all necessary permits to take Holliday Block into production and development. Tomco has however previously taken a strategic decision to wait for a nearby project to prove key extraction technology at a separate shale oil project. There was also hotly anticipated news from Falcon Oil & Gas (LON:FOG) which finally saw the start of  drilling at its Australian shale project. The Kalala S-1 well is the first of three wells of this initial programme. Falcon's 30% share of the drilling costs will be paid by partners Origin Resources and Sasol (each owning 35%) following a farm-out deal agreed in 2014. Mexico's oil and gas privatisation programme began on a disappointing note with only two of the fourteen available blocks taken up. London listed Premier Oil (LON:PMO) was however part of the consortium for both assets. Sierra Oil & Gas a new vehicle backed by the Riverstone private equity group led the winning consortium which secured blocks 2 and 7 ahead of rival bids from Norway's Statoil and a group led by Italy's ENI. Notably American 'big oil' groups like ExxonMobil and Chevron stayed away. Africa focussed Tower Resources (LON:TRP) landed 5.2mln in a share placing to fund its new project offshore Cameroon in the Niger Delta. M&G Investments is a cornerstone participant in the placing subscribing for 2.3mln of new shares and acquiring 18% of the group's enlarged share capital. Directors and other Tower staff members have also participated in the placing. Tethys Petroleum (LON:TPL CVE:TPL) was the big story at the start of the week as it received a premium priced approach from larger Kazakhstan peer Nostrum Oil & Gas (LON:NOG). Dual listed Tethys did however already have a major US47mln recapitalisation on table via an agreement with Kazakh investor AGR Energy - to which it was also bound by exclusivity - and as a result it declined talks over Nostrum's approach.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T09:48:09.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
