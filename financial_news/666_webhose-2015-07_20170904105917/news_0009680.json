\nThe issue has become a particularly hot topic in Australia, which was sued by tobacco giant Philip Morris after it became the first country to introduce plain packaging laws for cigarettes in 2012. \nCanberra refused to reveal its legal bill for defending the claim from Philip Morris, which argued the legislation breached a bilateral investment treaty. \nThe case, and broader concerns about ISDS processes, saw Australia's top judge Chief Justice Robert French warn last year that claims tribunals could undermine domestic legal jurisdictions. \nPhilip Morris' suing of Uruguay after the country ordered that the health warnings be larger on cigarette packets helped prompt billionaires Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg to launch a fund to support developing states in their legal battles with tobacco giants. \nOn a global scale, the number of cases brought by companies against governments has been on the rise in recent years, according to figures from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). \nOut of 608 known cases brought between 1987 and 2014, more than a quarter of them were over the past three years, UNCTAD said, adding that confidentiality agreements meant there were likely more. \nOf particular concern to ISDS opponents, less developed economies have faced a larger proportion of such suits, although the relative share of cases against developed countries is on the rise. \nMeanwhile, most litigation was started by investors from developed countries -- particularly from the US, Canada and several European Union nations -- accounting for more than 80 percent of all claims. \n- 'Blunt instrument' - \nTim Harcourt, former chief economist at Australia's trade promotion body Austrade, said the ISDS was a \"blunt instrument\" to protect companies' interests. \n\"Giving international companies the right to sue countries left, right and centre is probably not the way to build those (free trade) institutions,\" he told AFP. \n\"The way to protect investors is by building local institutions so they're transparent, and ultimately countries that don't have transparent institutions like Venezuela, people won't invest there.\" \nConcerns have also been raised in the United States, including by influential Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren. \n\"ISDS would allow foreign companies to challenge US laws -- and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers -- without ever stepping foot in a US court,\" she said. \nBut Alan Oxley, the first Australian to chair the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the World Trade Organization's predecessor, said fears that the ISDS favours international business over governments were overblown. \nHe said an international arbitration tribunal would be an effective way to settle claims as it gave foreign investors an automatic right to appeal without government approval. \nAustralia's foreign affairs department has released a \"myth versus realities\" TPP document that stresses an ISDS tribunal \"could not overturn domestic court decisions nor force Australia to change its laws\". \n\"If you talk to anybody in business, they'll say that's a good idea, whereas the opposition is coming from quite a small fringe group,\" Oxley, who heads up the Australian APEC Study Centre at RMIT University, told AFP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T05:41:18.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
