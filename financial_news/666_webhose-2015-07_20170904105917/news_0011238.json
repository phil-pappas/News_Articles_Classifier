Simon Bosch by David Oon Many people with self-managed superannuation funds want the trustee of their fund to borrow to acquire real estate. The arrangements that facilitate SMSF borrowing are usually referred to as bare trust arrangements, and the rules are complex.\nMistakes can give rise to extra costs, scrutiny by the Australian Tax Office, problems with stamp duty or problems with obtaining finance. Many of these issues can be avoided by ensuring things are handled correctly.\nOnly a single asset can be acquired for each bare trust arrangement; any additional asset that the SMSF borrows for requires a separate loan and bare trust. The asset must be legally held on trust for the SMSF by another entity (often referred to as the bare trustee), and the bare trustee must be a different entity to the SMSF trustee.\nThe SMSF trustee gains a beneficial interest in the single asset and has the right to obtain legal ownership of the asset by making one or more payments. The lender's rights against the SMSF are limited to the asset being acquired.\nFinance isn't always free-flowing to self-managed super funds. The requirements of a lender before they formally approve an SMSF loan can involve updating an SMSF deed, changing to a corporate SMSF trustee, ensuring that the bare trustee does not serve any other function, ensuring the fund's prior deeds do not have flaws and ensuring that any deposit money was paid from the SMSF.\nLenders typically only formally agree to lend once they are satisfied that the arrangement complies with superannuation law. The full extent of a lender's requirements may not be known until a late stage in the process (for example, once the matter has been sent to a legal team for review).\nOne asset per trust Only a single acquirable asset can be acquired under each arrangement. This means that, generally, acquiring a property that consists of two titles is not possible with only one bare trust arrangement.\n A common circumstance that can cause issues is where an SMSF signs a contract to buy an apartment and a car park that are on separate titles.\nAnother common circumstance is where a contract is signed under which goods are acquired, in addition to the real estate. It is not permissible to use one loan to buy land as well as goods that do not form part of the land.\nIf the parties want the SMSF to borrow to acquire two assets (for example, land with two titles), a separate loan and separate bare trust is needed for each title. Ideally, the purchaser should also enter into separate contracts.\nIn certain special circumstances, multiple titles can be considered a single asset for SMSF borrowing purposes.\nThe timing of signing the bare trust deed and the method for describing the purchaser under a contract varies according to the state or territory that the property is located in. In certain jurisdictions the bare trust should be signed before the contract of sale. In other jurisdictions the bare trust should be signed at the same time as the contract or some time before settlement.\nOf course, signing the contract or the bare trust in the correct way usually requires that the company that acts as bare trustee has already come into existence. In most jurisdictions it is practically necessary that the bare trustee company exists before the contract is signed.\nThere are some exceptions to this, such as in Victoria, where it is usually possible to nominate the bare trustee after the contract has been signed.\nExpert advice should be obtained in the relevant jurisdiction before executing any documents. A mistake in this area can lead to adverse stamp duty consequences either at the outset or possibly later, when the borrowing has been paid off and the parties want to transfer the asset to the SMSF trustee.\nIf an SMSF is borrowing to buy property, any deposit money must be paid from a bank account in the name of the SMSF. A failure to do this can cause problems with obtaining finance, superannuation compliance issues at the outset and stamp duty problems down the track.\nThe considerations above are not exhaustive. Other superannuation and tax law requirements are also at play. Trustees of self-managed funds should be careful to seek advice before signing any contract or paying any money in relation to planned SMSF borrowing arrangements.\nDavid Oon is a senior associate at DBA Lawyers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:06:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
