Alex Ellinghausen by Marianna Papadakis Joe Hockey wants Fairfax Media to pay the full legal costs of his defamation case but the publisher says the case was a \"disaster\" for the treasurer and he should pay at least 60 per cent of its costs.\nMr Hockey and Fairfax are arguing over who should pick up the bill for his defamation case, which resulted in a partial victory for the Treasurer and a $200,000 damages payout.\nFederal Court Judge Richard White ruled in June that Mr Hockey was defamed in a Sydney Morning Herald poster and in two tweets by The Age which labelled him as a \"Treasurer for Sale\" â€“ but dismissed his claims about the articles themselves.\nAsked on Tuesday if he would comment on the case, Mr Hockey said: \"The first matter is still before the court as we speak, so I'm not going to comment until it's all over and I'll have something to say and that'll be the end of it. Well, the end of it for the moment, we'll see.\"\nThe Treasurer's barrister, Bruce McClintock, SC, asked the Federal Court on Tuesday for a permanent injunction to restrain Fairfax from republishing the imputations that were found to be conveyed by the poster and the tweets.\nThis included that Mr Hockey was \"corrupt in that he was prepared to accept payments to influence his decisions as Treasurer\".\nMr McClintock said if a permanent injunction was not granted Mr Hockey could have an unfair burden of having to seek the leave of the court to commence proceedings in the event they were republished.\nBut Fairfax Media's barrister Sandy Dawson said Mr Hockey's legal team informed him there were two additional tweets on The Age 's Twitter feed that were not subject of the suit but that would also be removed.\n Mr Dawson said this was an indication of good faith and preparedness of Fairfax Media to accept the court's findings without the imposition of a permanent injunction.\nMr Dawson said a permanent injunction would be an \"incredible restriction on the freedom of the respondents\" and the freedom of the press.\nAn order that Fairfax Media pay the entirety of Mr Hockey's costs on an indemnity basis would be a \"manifestly unfair result\" given 12 out of the total 15 allegations he sued upon failed, Mr Dawson said.\nThere was nothing unreasonable about Fairfax Media not offering to settle the case given the court's ruling that the articles dealt with matters of considerable public interest, Mr Dawson said.\nThe two offending tweets had been removed and the sole purpose of the Herald 's poster was to promote the articles and it too would obviously not be republished, he said.\nJustice White reserved his decision.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:04:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
