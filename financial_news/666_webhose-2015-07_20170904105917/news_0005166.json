Global brands have educated Australian consumers to expect internationally competitive pricing, an endless aisle and greater shopping convenience.”\nMs Milesi said when consumers researched online before, during and after shopping trips, it boosted average sales conversion rates by 25 per cent.\nOrder sizes were also boosted by 21 per cent.\nAustralia ranks sixth as the most concentrated smartphone market in the world, and ties with the US as the developed country with the highest social media influence.\nMs Milesi said social media provided a golden opportunity for retailers to connect with shoppers in the real world.\nShe said those influenced by social media were 26 per cent more likely to purchase a product than non-social media users.\n“Social media users are further along their purchase journey, having used it for inspiration and validation,” she said. “And digitally influenced shoppers are tagging locations and sharing images, videos and information about their shopping journey with their family and friends.”\nThe Navigating the New Digital Divide report said consumer engagement with a retailer started well ahead of the in-store visit. Some 72 per cent of shoppers said they were already aware of the product they wanted to purchase in-store through their own research.\nElectronics, automotive, books and music, furniture and baby goods are the categories most influenced by digital browsing, the report found.\nAnd consumers’ home research paid off for retailers, with 21 per cent of shoppers believing digital use increased their order size through personalised offers or additional product suggestions.\nOriginally published as Don’t be lost to shoppers’ own devices", "external_links": ["http://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/dont-be-lost-to-shoppers-own-devices-retailers-told/story-fni0dcne-1227446426092"], "published": "2015-07-18T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T11:26:18.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
