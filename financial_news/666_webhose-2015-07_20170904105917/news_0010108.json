I don't feel good for our customers who are having to deal with the fallout.\" \nThe White House said earlier it was monitoring the situation, along with the Treasury Department. \nJosh Earnest, White House press secretary, said: \"There is no indication that there are malicious actors involved.\" \nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, the US financial markets regulator, was also keeping an eye on the NYSE halt. \nThe Wall Street Journal's website also suffered \"technical difficulties\". \nBut the FBI said that issue was probably caused by a surge in readers looking for information about the NYSE breakdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:30:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
