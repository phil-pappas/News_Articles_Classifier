Photo: Fiona Bianchinotti\nThe key to success for young adults struggling to build wealth may come down to a familiar bit of advice: mind your elders.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis published a report chronicling the link between age and net worth. While the report focuses on US households, its lessons are just as relevant for young Australians.\nAuthors William Emmons and Bryan Noeth found that although young households are likely to have more education, they're not on track to acquire as much wealth as their elders.\nOne principle that could help younger people build nest eggs faster, Emmons and Noeth wrote, is to manage their balance sheets more like older people.\nAdvertisement Because young adults often face high financial hurdles, that can \"be difficult, and it may be unpleasant, but if your goal is to accumulate more wealth, we know how to do that,\" Emmons said in an interview.\nHere are some pointers they give to help:\nKeep an emergency fund The average young family (where the head of the household is less than 40 years old) had just $US14,021 ($19,000) in safe and liquid assets, according to Emmons and Noeth. Those include cheque and saving accounts, certificates of deposits and bonds - money that can be used quickly or inexpensively.\nThat compares to liquid assets of $US82,766 held among older families (headed by someone who's at least 62 year old) and $US46,324 for middle-aged families (led by someone between 40 and 61 years old), the researchers found.\nSetting up and maintaining a quickly accessible rainy-day fund helps young adults mitigate financial shocks, such as losing a job, unexpected hospital trips or car repairs. During times where income and spending is volatile, emergency funds act as a kind of cushion for consumption.\nAbout 47 per cent of respondents to a separate Federal Reserve household survey, taken last October and November, wouldn't be able to cover an emergency $US400 expense without selling something or borrowing money, the central bank said in a report in May.\nPay down debt Borrowing is expensive, and having lots of debt on a household balance sheet can exacerbate financial shocks, Emmons and Noeth wrote. When a shock affects the value of your assets, those liabilities can raise the risk of insolvency or default.\n\"Having a lot of debt automatically raises the risk that something bad could happen to you,\" Emmons said in the interview.\nPut extra money in high-return investments Investing in high-yield assets, such as stocks or a small business, \"can lead to greater wealth on average over time due to lower volatility for any given level of expected return,\" the researchers wrote.\nHigh-return assets reduce the likelihood of financial distress and will provide greater yield than a portfolio of tangible assets, such as a house, car or other durable goods.\nWait to buy a home until you can afford it \"If a young family is willing to delay the purchase of a home, with its attendant debt burden, until they could afford a house with a significant down payment and still have enough money to invest in stocks and other assets with potentially high returns, it's likely they would enjoy greater wealth later,\" Emmons said in the paper's accompanying press release.\nThat may be advice many young adults are heeding. The US home ownership rate was 63.7 per cent in the first quarter, the lowest level in more than two decades. For those under the age of 35, it was 34.6 per cent, the lowest since at least 1994.\nTake a cue from older households Not only do older households have more liquid assets, they also have a greater share of their money tied up in financial and business holdings that provide higher average returns compared to a portfolio of mostly tangible assets. The median older family also had little to no debt from the 1989 to 2013 period the report analysed.\nWhile there seems to be a correlation between better balance-sheet management and wealth, Emmons and Noeth caution they can't identify which comes first.\n\"We suspect there are elements of two-way causation, that is, stronger balance sheets probably do contribute to greater wealth accumulation, but it may also be the case that the passage of time - as described by the life cycle - makes it easier to diversify and pay off debt when greater wealth is available,\" they wrote.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:59:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
