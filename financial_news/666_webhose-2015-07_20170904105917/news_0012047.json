Share on twitter by Karen Maley Are digital currencies usurping gold's traditional role as the ultimate haven?\nCertainly that's the view of some investors, after gold barely budged during the latest Greek crisis, while the bitcoin price has rallied by more than 10 per cent since the beginning of June, when Greece's problems began to dominate the headlines.\nWhat's more, retail investors have been showing a much stronger interest in the digital currency. Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange, said on Twitter at the end of June that it had noticed about a three-fold increase in bitcoin buying across Europe in the past few weeks. In contrast, interest in gold exchange-traded funds had been basically flat.\n\"We're seeing about a 300 per cent increase in bitcoin buys across all Europe in the past few weeks (not much from Greece though, they aren't able to)\", the Coinbase tweet said.\nAlong with concerns over Greece, interest in the virtual currency has also been spurred by growing unease over the aggressive monetary stimulus policies adopted by the world's main central banks. Investors are attracted to bitcoins because they are generated by a computer program at a predetermined rate – with 25 new ones created every 10 minutes.\nCuriously, however, neither nervousness about Greece nor worries about overly aggressive monetary stimulus has translated into a surge of support for gold, although Britain's Royal Mint did report this week that in June it had had \"twice the expected demand for sovereign bullion coins from our customers based in Greece\".\nDampened investor enthusiasm There are several factors that have dampened investor enthusiasm for gold, and which have locked the precious metal in a narrow trading range of between $US1160 ($1517) and $US1230 since mid-March. This represents a drop of about 40 per cent from gold's most recent peak of $1889 an ounce in August 2011.\n Investors have been paring back gold holdings for months on worries that short-term US interest rates are headed higher. The combination of a stronger jobs market and a falling unemployment rate appears to be clearing the way for the US Federal Reserve to raise rates later in 2015. This puts pressure on the gold price because the precious metal does not pay interest or dividends and finds it harder to compete with bonds as interest rates rise.\nIn addition, the prospect of higher short-term interest rates has been providing some support for the US dollar, which weighs on the gold price. Because gold is priced in US dollars, a rising greenback makes the precious metal more expensive for foreign investors who use other currencies to fund their purchases.\nInvestor sentiment towards gold has also been dented by India's plans to stem the flow of physical gold imports into the country by issuing gold-linked sovereign bonds.\nIndia consumes nearly 1000 tonnes of gold every year, the bulk of which is imported, and gold is the second-biggest expense on the import bill after oil. The plan is to reduce the demand for physical gold by allowing Indian investors to put money into gold without having to buy the physical commodity.\nGold's supporters argue that digital currencies such as bitcoin are still far from being able to replace gold as a store of value.\nLess secure In the first place, they argue, digital currencies are less secure than gold and they point to the shutdown of the Tokyo-based exchange Mt Gox as evidence. Mt Gox, which was once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, stopped trading abruptly in February 2014 after it said that it had lost 850,000 units of Bitcoin, at the time worth about $US500 million, as a result of persistent cyber attacks.\nAlthough bitcoin survived this shutdown, the price of bitcoins has plummeted, falling from a peak of about $US1200 in December 2013 to just more than $US250 now.\nGold supporters also argue that aggressive monetary stimulus by the world's main central banks have been pushing prices of financial assets – particularly bonds and sharemarkets – relentlessly higher in recent years. For example, they point out that nearly four-fifths of the world's sharemarket capitalisation is supported by zero interest rate policies, and more than half of all global government bonds yield less than 1 per cent.\nBut they argue that valuations cannot continue to move higher indefinitely, and that when investors start becoming worried about the lofty levels of global equity and bond markets gold is likely to regain its luster.\nFinally, they note that the longer-term outlook for gold is positive, especially as rising wages and purchasing power across Asia improves the demand for the precious metal, particularly in those economies where financial systems remain under-developed and gold plays a key role as a store of wealth.\nGold also boasts the advantage of being a much deeper and more liquid market than bitcoin, with the investable market estimated at more than $US2 trillion, compared with bitcoin which has a total market capitalisation of less than $US4 billion.\nGold bulls also note that, although the sceptics may scoff, many of the world's top investors – including Ray Dalio, who heads the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater – retain a belief that gold still has a crucial role as a portfolio hedge.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KarenMaley"], "published": "2015-07-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:08:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
