But with six of those approvals coming since January, officials say things are getting off the ground. \n\"We're in July and we have approved almost one company per month,\" Ana Teresa Igarza, director of the Special Development Zone at Mariel, said in an interview this week, when The Associated Press received access to the site. \"The pace is what we expected from the beginning.\" \n\"The first ones are the trickiest,\" she added. \"After they begin to invest, it's simpler for others to do so. But there's an exploratory phase.\" \nIgarza declined to say which companies were coming to Mariel, except that the foreign firms include two from Mexico, two from Belgium and one from Spain. They cover sectors including food, chemicals and logistics, represent total investment of around $US50 million ($A67.08 million) and are expected to launch operations in the first half of 2016. \nWith Mariel, Cuba is also looking ahead to when the US embargo may be lifted as part of a rapprochement begun by presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro in December. Washington and Havana plan to officially restore diplomatic relations on Monday. \nIgarza said visiting US businesspeople also have expressed interest. \nTractor assembly company Cleber LLC of Alabama has already applied for a US Treasury licence with an eye toward building a plant at Mariel. \n\"We see this as attractive and necessary for our economy, and we told them to go ahead with preparing the documentation,\" Igarza said. \nLocated about 50 kilometres from Havana, the first part of the port and planned development zone are to occupy some 4,500 hectares of bay shore and low hills. \nMariel bay is being dredged to a target depth of 17.9 metres to accommodate deeper-draft ships than those that can use the port of Havana, which cannot be expanded because of a car tunnel that traverses its mouth. \nContainer shipping has already been transferred from Havana to Mariel, though the capital still receives fuel tankers and grain shipments. \nA new rail line will transport cargo and workers from Havana. Not counting the construction, there are currently just 328 people working at Mariel, though officials project the development zone could ultimately create some 70,000 jobs, including manufacturing, biotech and other areas. \nIn selling Mariel to investors, Cuba touts its well-educated populace, low labour costs and strategic location in the Caribbean. Officials also talk of the port eventually becoming a centre for trans-shipment activity. \n\"Without haste, but without pause,\" said Igarza, echoing the oft-repeated mantra of Castro and other officials about the pace with which Cuba intends to implement broader economic reforms that in recent years have allowed a smidgen of free-market activity in the communist-run country. \nSome observers say that speed is too slow to attract much foreign investment to Mariel. \n\"The timetables from those who are promoting reform along the lines of the slogan 'without haste, but without pause,' I think they're inadequate,\" said Arturo Lopez-Levy, a Cuban economist who teaches at New York University. \nSome potential investors are skittish because of how Cuba nationalised properties following the 1959 revolution, and more recent cases of missed payments and assets seized from foreign companies accused of corruption. Several foreign businessmen were even imprisoned. \nMany also may be happy to let others test development zone rules that offer tax breaks and other incentives and, Cuba says, guarantee assets and access to arbitration if disputes arise. Others are wary about entrenched bureaucracy or disapprove of the requirement that Cuban workers be hired and paid through a government-run employment agency. \nBut Lopez-Levy said that, at least in principle, the rules at Mariel should do much to ease concerns, such as lessening bureaucratic bottlenecks. \nMariel has the potential to be \"an exporting platform at a time in which the stars seem to be aligning in a favourable way for the Cuban economy in terms of improving (relations) with the United States and the European Union,\" he said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T03:22:39.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
