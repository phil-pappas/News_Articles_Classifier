Wynn Macau Ltd. also surged as much as 13 percent, while Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. rose 12 percent, MGM China Holdings Ltd. 11 percent and SJM Holdings Ltd. 9.4 percent. The benchmark Hang Seng Index was little changed.\nGross gaming revenue in Macau fell 36.2 percent to 17.4 billion patacas ($2.2 billion) in June, beating the median estimate of a 38.3 percent drop from six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The slump has been easing for four straight months, giving hopes that the world’s largest gambling hub is due for recovery following 13 consecutive months of declines.\nJune casino revenue “ended better than how it started; this bodes well for potential demand stabilization into summer holiday season,” DS Kim, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a note Wednesday. “Along with visa relaxation, this news should help improve the sentiment on the sector.”\nThe Macau government announced on Tuesday a reversal of the transit visa policy exactly a year after the entry rules were tightened. Starting July 1, mainland China passport holders transiting through Macau are allowed to stay in the city longer and visit more frequently.\nFollowing this rule change, the government is expected to issue more supportive policies in the second half for Macau’s economy while keeping gaming revenue regulated, according to Chris Kwai and Haofei Chen, analysts at China International Capital Corp.\nLas Vegas Sands Corp. and Wynn Resorts Ltd., which rely on their Macau units for at least 60 percent of their revenue, rose 3.1 percent and 4.5 percent higher respectively by the close of trading in New York, extending gains from a day earlier.
