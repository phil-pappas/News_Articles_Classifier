Stu Coleman, a senior managing director at the Boston-based recruiting firm Winter Wyman, says the way you make an entrance into a job interview can lead you to lose a job offer - even before you sit down. \"I believe in getting jacked up for an interview,\" Coleman notes. \"But, walking in with a sweaty iced coffee, steamy hot coffee, energy drink or anything with foam on it is just disrespectful.\" To avoid failing the interview before it starts, don't bring anything into the interview at all in a bottle or cup, he says. \"The company will probably offer you some water, and that's O.K. to accept,\" he said. \"But, a word of advice, don't take their coffee. This is not your living room or the corner café; it's an interview.\" Another potential faux pas -- emphasizing your personal fashion style over a reasonable outfit at a job interview. \"Play it safe, and err on the conservative side,\" Coleman adds. \"While creative industries may be more open to a fashion statement, I've seen first-hand both men and women lose interviews at investment firms, because they decided to wear a bow tie with their suit that day.\" Checking your cell phone during an interview is another burgeoning, and job killing, interview no-no. \"Nothing says 'I would rather be somewhere else' more than casually glancing at your cell phone in the middle of a conversation with someone,\" says Matthew Randall, executive director of the Center for Professional Excellence at York College of Pennsylvania. \"Yes, many of us check our phones so many times during the day that it becomes habitual and we start to do it subconsciously. But instead of opening yourself up to the possibility of this interview killer, leave your cell phone in the car. This will eliminate a potential distraction and allow you to give your full attention to the interviewer.\" 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T04:03:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
