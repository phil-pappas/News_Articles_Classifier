Glenn Hunt Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Queensland tech entrepreneurs have cautiously welcomed a $76 million injection into the state's start-up sector in Tuesday's budget, which is aimed at helping create global giants in the Sunshine State.\nThe measures, aimed at nurturing high-growth, technology-based businesses, included $24 million for the creation of the Startup Queensland program and $52 million to improve the access to finance and management support for startups and small businesses.\nOf the $52 million, $12 million will create a Queensland Commercialisation Program to support proof-of-concept projects and $40 million will be dedicated to a business development fund.\nThe Startup Queensland program will support successful incubators and accelerator programs to scale up and provide innovation advisory and skills development services for start-ups.\nVinimofo's Andre Eikmeier said he was particularly pleased by the pledge to introduce coding in Queensland schools. Veteran tech entrepreneur and managing director of Brisbane start-up co-working space River City Labs, Steve Baxter, said the government had \"come out with some exceptional words,\" but needed to fill in the gaps with important details.\n\"There's a lot of detail in there to be worked out in the coming weeks and months,\" he said.\n\"But they've taken quite a systematic approach to it … they've taken a life-cycle approach and it's a good start.\"\nAvoiding academia Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the government was intent on \"delivering a new era of opportunities to Queenslanders\" by focusing on innovation. Paul Harris Mr Baxter, who is also on Channel 10's TV program Shark Tank , said he was pleased the initiatives were not targeted at supporting university start-up programs\n\"It's high time we developed a plan to build more global companies in Queensland led by entrepreneurs and not the insistence that this must come from the academic sector,\" he said.\nAll the measures are part of the $180 million Advance Queensland scheme, which also includes a review into how coding, computer science and robotics is taught in schools.\nThe focus on STEM skills was praised by Vinomofo co-founder Andre Eikmeier​ and Invoice2Go founder Chris Strode.\n\"The $24 million funding for start-ups in the Queensland budget was good news. The commitment to introducing coding in schools – that was amazing news,\" Mr Eikmeier said.\n\"Crazy isn't it that this was even up for discussion. That it's not already on the national curriculum is... sadly very Australian these days.\"\nMany entrepreneurs, including Queensland-based MOVUS founder Brad Parsons also welcomed the state government's distinction between small business and start-ups.\n\"Start-ups were actually called out as a specific component. We're no longer just coupled with SMEs,\" he said. \"In previous years we were fitted under someone else's banner, but we have our own requirements.\"\nQueensland state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in a speech on Monday the government was intent on \"delivering a new era of opportunities to Queenslanders\" by focusing on innovation.\n\"My government knows that we must look beyond our traditional strengths, as important as they are, and help create the new industries that in turn create new jobs,\" she said.\n\"I don't want Queensland to merely be a part of the pack, I want us to lead it.\"\nFounder of Cairns-based start-up Dynamic Conversations, Carole Hautot​, said she hoped some of the money would be dedicated to new businesses in regional areas.\n\"I've already been advantaged because of getting state funding through the ilab Germinate accelerator program and it's made every difference to me,\" she said.\n\"In Cairns the start–up movement is very much grassroots. I really hope the regional cities get some funding because it can make the most difference in these cities.\"\nilab director Bernie Woodcroft said the budget measures put start–ups at the forefront of investment by the Queensland government.\n\"The $24 million looks very promising as a way of building the ecosystem more generally and as a way of building interest in the community,\" he said.\n\"The timing of how fast some of this money works is not clear. This is about getting the right number of people seeing this as a valid approach to their careers…That can take a long time for a state that's been focused on resources, tourism and agriculture.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-07-15T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:04:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
