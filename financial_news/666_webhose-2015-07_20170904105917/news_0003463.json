In a “coming of age”, young British brand Bremont has been named Official Timing Partner for the Cup and defending title-holder Oracle Team USA. Trials have begun off Portsmouth in Britain with play-offs to culminate in Bermuda in 2017.\nBremont is no Hublot or Tag Heuer, previous spinnaker queens. Its first watches appeared only eight years ago and it makes only seven or eight thousand timepieces a year at its custom-built headquarters at Henley-on-Thames in South Oxfordshire. But the brand has caught on with aficionados with unprecedented speed. Named after a French airfield, it was founded by the decidedly British brothers Nick and Giles English, whose own story is fascinating.\nFervent flyers, Nick was practising for an air show in 1995 with their father Euan, when the 1942 WWII Harvard aircraft they were flying was involved in an accident. Euan was killed, Nick had life-threatening injuries. Giles learned of this while waiting to take off in his own plane. Nick recovered and the brothers decided to pursue “what we enjoyed most”, which led to mechanical timepieces and, a bit later, a seemingly fanatical following for their chronometer-certified wrist-wear.\nWe asked Giles, “how so fast?” Giles: “We saw that the watch market had no English brand and saw that as an opportunity to do something without the confines of the past. It meant manufacturing in the UK – very challenging – and managing our own distribution and controlling it so we can do everything right. We’ve been lucky to have 20 per cent of our business just making for the military – air forces, special forces, mine clearance people and divers. We spend little on traditional marketing but have credibility in that space; we know and relate to a lot of military pilots. It’s true to our soul and something we’re very good at.”\nBremont watches from far left: Oracle Team USA automatic chronometer; America's Cup chronograph; Oracle team USA GMT. Word spreads, and those relationships led last year to a tie-up with Boeing that produced a special collection of watches. Giles: “Boeing was a natural for us – they saw what we were doing and a couple of their board members had one of our limited editions. But it’s more than just having a logo on the dial – one of their testing plants was in Sheffield and they introduced us to new CNC [computer numerical control] manufacturing techniques, and the co-operation is ongoing.”\nAnd now the big one, the America’s Cup, where it seems, again, it’s connections that do the trick. Giles: “We were talking to the British team and were approached by Russell Coutts [CEO of the event]. We knew Larry Ellison [past winner and 2017 contender with his Oracle squad], who is a very keen aviator – he has his own MiG-29 and corporate jet. We lived on a boat when we were young and I trained as a naval architect so the Cup positions us in a market which I personally love. We want global awareness while staying true to who we are, and these guys – Coutts, James Spithill [Oracle’s Australian skipper] – are unbelievable; their determination means this cup will be on a different level. We will be working closely on a technical level and learning from them.\n“It’s a massive call for us and you have to believe it’s going to work, so fingers crossed. We’re creating history by being the first British timing partner since things began in 1851.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.bremont.com/briefing-room/americas-cup"], "published": "2015-07-27T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:37:18.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
