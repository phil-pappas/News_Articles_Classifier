Bruce Rauner on a property tax freeze. \nLawmakers aligned with Sen. John Cullerton said Wednesday that the Chicago Democrat's plan also would set an ending date for the current way schools are funded to force lawmakers to reach a consensus on a fairer approach. \nRauner says a property tax freeze is one of the reforms necessary for him to negotiate a state budget deal. There's no agreement on a plan even though the new fiscal year began July 1. \nThe Senate also plans to consider a one-month temporary budget to keep state government operating. \nSenate Democrats say they hope they'll get a chance Wednesday afternoon to vote on overriding the veto of that $36 billion package. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:06:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
