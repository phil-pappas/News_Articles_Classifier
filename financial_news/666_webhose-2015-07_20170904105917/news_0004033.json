Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Appliances retailer The Good Guys is dropping its \"pay cash and we'll slash the prices\" promise from its catchy television ads, underlining the impact of e-commerce and new payments technology on the $20 billion household appliances and consumer electronics market.\n\"Pay less pay cash is in the noose now,\" The Good Guys chief executive Michael Ford said.\n\"It played a very significant role in building the brand but we now have to move on to recognise we're in a fully digitalised world and the customer has all the power in their hands.\"\nMore than 57 per cent of The Good Guys customers research products online before they come into stores and offering discounts for cash no longer guarantees a sale, particularly in an increasingly cashless society, Mr Ford said.\nAccording to the Australian Payments Clearing Association, cash use has declined from almost 70 per cent of transactions to 47 per cent since 2007, while debit, credit and charge card payments have risen from 26 per cent to 43 per cent.\n\"Customers have so many other ways to pay and our online prices are the same as [prices] in store,\" he said. \"The power has shifted from the retailer to the consumer and the consumer has become digitally empowered.\"\nThe 99-store Good Guys chain, which checks its prices five times a day to beat rivals Harvey Norman, JB Hi-Fi and Dick Smith, plans to retain its 18-year-old Good Vibrations jingle but will drop the reference to cash discounts and come up with another tagline.\nThe shift away from cash discounts is emblematic of the major changes that have occurred in the sector and at The Good Guys since the founding Muir family considered selling the business during a period of double-digit deflation in consumer electronics in 2011.\n Wesfarmers and private equity investors took a close look at the company but baulked at chairman Andrew Muir's $1 billion asking price.\nMr Ford, who has been chief executive for 11 years, said the process was a massive wake-up call for the company, which opened its first electrical goods store in Melbourne in 1952.\nIt triggered a multimillion-dollar investment by the Muir family in tier one e-commerce, merchandise planning and inventory systems and changes to the company's operating model, from the way it ordered stock to the way it dealt with franchisees and customers.\nThe Good Guys centralised ordering, replacing 92 order books for company-owned and franchised stores with a single buying function. The shift secured better deals from suppliers, reducing working capital, improving stock turns and availability, and unifying the product range across the group.\n\"The benefits are in the mega millions – that's been critical to us,\" said Mr Ford. \"We had 92 different merchandise directors cutting different deals – the suppliers loved it because they got to keep their margin while we lost our margin.\"\nThe Good Guys has also developed longer-term relationships with customers, maintaining contact post-purchase through its concierge program and offering services and solutions such as protection against subsequent price reductions and no-fuss replacements.\n\"We're not just selling boxes any more – we have to sell solutions,\" Mr Ford said. \"We try to engage with customers beyond the fact they've just bought a television or a fridge and gain a larger share of their wallet in the future.\"\nThe investments have paid off in spades. While competition remains intense and consumer sentiment is \"brittle\", Mr Ford says same-store sales have been growing \"in the low single digits\" to more than $2 billion, and earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation have grown \"significantly\" faster.\n\"We moved our margins up by one percentage point – that's significant in a $2 billion business,\" Mr Ford said. \"Our average invoice has probably risen 2 to 3 per cent on an annual basis despite deflation.\"\nThe Good Guys plans to open its 100th store, in North Lakes in Queensland, later this year but is increasingly selective about new sites and would move into only shopping centres with the right rental ratios.\n\"Now we have the luxury of ecommerce ... we can be more selective and judicious about where our stores are – we have enough to satisfy the demand of our customers,\" Mr Ford said.\nThe Good Guys is now one of Australia's 10 largest private companies and is worth much more than it was in 2011, but is not for sale \"at the moment\" and there are no plans for an initial public offer.\n\"The [Muir] family is focused on building this business, not selling it,\" Mr Ford said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/suemitchellafr"], "published": "2015-07-16T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:09:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
