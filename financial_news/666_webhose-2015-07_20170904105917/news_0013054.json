If you have suffered a bad harvest in this case dumsor, which is impacting on your production then I’m saying your system is producing less goods than the capacity you’ve otherwise installed”, he said. \nThis in his view influences the importation of goods making the demand for foreign exchange high “because people are not producing enough”. \nIf the central bank cannot supply to cushion the increase demand of foreign exchange, there will continue to be a fall in the value of the cedi, Dr Abbey said. \nBut Head of Research at Group Ndoum, Kofi Ampah fears if the Bank of Ghana’s intent is to stabilize the cedi through the pumping of dollars into the economy then he fears it might be short-lived. \n“For me I don’t think it is sustainable in the sense that if the Central Bank does not achieve the inflow from the foreigners in terms of investing in our short-term bonds then it can’t be sustained. \n“But if the Central Bank should have a lot more of these inflows coming support its reserves, then from now then the cedi will be more stable in the third quarter to the last quarter of 2015”, he said. \nMeanwhile some of Commercial Banks Joy Business spoke to attribute the appreciation to the release of more dollars onto the market. \nJoy Business has also gathered that the development has been influenced by a sudden drop in demand for dollars by some corporate institutions. \nSources say some of the banks are even selling their “reserved” dollars to the Bank of Ghana. \nThis should mean there is more supply of dollars of some sought on the market which is fuelling this marginal appreciation. \nSome of the commercial banks have even told Joy Business the bank of Ghana is giving them much more than they actually need. \nThe trend if continued could help reduce rate at which the general price levels of goods and services has been going up .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:32:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
