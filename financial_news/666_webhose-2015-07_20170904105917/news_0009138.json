The chances of monetary tightening are remote, inflation gauges show.\nFive-year inflation swaps slipped below 1 percent this week for the first time since early April, indicating no pressure on the European Central Bank to curb its bond-buying program. The drop, owing partly to China’s market rout and lower oil prices, is good news for holders of the region’s bonds, which are outperforming their U.S. peers. Even with China’s market turmoil hurting higher-yielding investments, Spanish and Italian bonds are outperforming Treasuries.\n“Inflation is not directly a problem in Europe -- to the contrary” it’s diminishing, said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “With lower oil prices, that is a headwind for higher yields. For the moment for Europe, the upside is protected by this low inflation.”\nYields on Germany’s 10-year bonds on Wednesday remained below their average close last week. They increased three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 0.72 percent as of 11:40 a.m. London time. The 1 percent security due in August 2025 fell 0.305 or 3.05 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,107) face amount, to 102.7.\nThe yield reached 0.67 percent on Monday, the lowest since July 8, as the Shanghai Composite Index tumbled the most since 2007.\nFive-year inflation swap rates, a market gauge of price-growth expectations over that period, slipped to 0.971 percent on Tuesday, the least since April 1, and returned to 1 percent Wednesday. Even lower is Germany’s five-year break-even rate, which also anticipates consumer-price growth in that time frame. It’s at about at 0.56 percent. The ECB’s inflation target is just below 2 percent.\nGerman bunds returned 0.6 percent in the past week through Tuesday, compared with gains of 0.7 percent for Italian securities and 0.6 percent for Spanish debt, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. They all beat Treasuries, which made 0.5 percent.\nThe yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose three basis points to 1.94 percent, still lower than the average close of 1.96 percent last week. Yields on similar-maturity Italian bonds rose one basis point to 1.89 percent.\n(An earlier version of this story was corrected for a percentage-point expression in fourth paragraph.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:13:50.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
