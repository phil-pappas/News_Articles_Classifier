The Australian dollar traded little changed at around US74.73c after the announcement.\nReserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens said a further depreciation in the currency seems \"both likely and necessary\" given the significant fall decline in key commodity prices.\n\"The board today judged that leaving the cash rate unchanged was appropriate at this meeting,\" Mr Stevens said.\n\"Information on economic and financial conditions to be received over the period ahead will inform the board's assessment of the outlook and hence whether the current stance of policy will most effectively foster sustainable growth and inflation consistent with the target.\"\nMr Stevens indicated last week that the fallout from Greece's debt troubles was likely to be limited in Australia, where direct exposure to the crisis-torn European member state is \"minuscule\".\nHowever since then, Greek voters have voted no to more austerity demands by European lenders, raising the risk of an eventual exit from the euro.\n China's stock market has also erupted violently , with trading halted on Tuesday in more than 25 per cent of Chinese listed shares in an apparent attempt by the government to shore up the country's plunging equities markets.\nThe Reserve Bank board has signalled that it wants to continue gauging whether this year's two official interest rate cuts are spurring economic demand amid tentative signs that some sectors are starting to recovery thanks to the lower dollar.\nThe currency dipped below US75Â¢ for the first time since 2009 this week , providing a welcome relief to companies that compete globally, such as education and tourism operators.\nHowever, there are countervailing forces that suggest a near-term rebound in economic growth may be some time in coming, including depressed sentiment, weak wages growth and a fresh bout of falls in commodity prices, particularly for iron ore.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-07T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:05:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
