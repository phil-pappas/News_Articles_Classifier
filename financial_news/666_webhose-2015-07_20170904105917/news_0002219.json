Consumer confidence fell last week to its lowest point since the budget-induced sulk in May and June last year, according to the ANZ-Roy Morgan survey on Tuesday. At the same time, the NAB survey of businesses showed confidence in June was almost as high as it was as businesses clinked champagne flutes to toast the change of government six months before the May 2014 budget knocked consumer confidence flat on its back. When Mr Swan adopted the term \"patchwork economy\" to hose down unrealistic expectations for the economy, the mining investment boom was the brightest patch while just about all the other bits and pieces of the economy were, at best, glowing only faintly. The tables are turned now, at least as far as mining is concerned - investment in the sector has plummeted and will certainly plummet further and, even though mineral production is rising strongly, employment is down. It takes more people to dig a mine than it does to cart the minerals away. Some of the other patches have brightened, notably housing construction. But the term \"patchy\" is still apt. One of the softer patches has been consumer spending, where growth in real terms over the past four years has averaged less than two per cent annually. That's little more than half what might be thought of as normal. A sustained pace so slow has not been seen before in the past half century, aside from a few intervals spanning times of deep crisis - the recessions of the early 1980s and 1990s, the export price collapse of the mid-1980s and, more recently, the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The relapse in confidence, combined with signs of a slowing trend in jobs growth after a six-month burst that stopped unemployment from rising, warns that an acceleration in consumer spending is still some way off. \"Despite the stabilisation in the unemployment rate, ongoing weakness in consumer confidence would present a risk to the outlook for household spending,\" ANZ chief economist Warren Hogan said. On the other hand, the business confidence figures are encouraging, because confidence is a prerequisite for investment and the employment that typically follows it. But it isn't always enough. Demand - the willingness of consumers, businesses, governments and foreign buyers of exports to buy - is also essential. And none of these boxes have a firm tick in them. Consumers are still being uncharacteristically frugal, non-mining businesses are yet to translate their more upbeat mood into actual investment, governments are fearful of the political fallout from borrowing to fund investment and, while minerals exports are rising strongly, Australia is struggling to compete in other exports, and import-competing niches, including tourism.
