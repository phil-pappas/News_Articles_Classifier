Caixin Media and Markit Economics said their flash manufacturing index for China fell to the lowest in 15 months. China is Australia’s major trading partner.\nChina’s numbers “were very weak,” said Roy Teo, a currency strategist at ABN Amro Bank NV in Singapore. “Everything looks bearish at the moment.”\nAustralia’s currency tumbled 0.9 percent to 72.90 U.S. cents as of 1:05 p.m. in Tokyo after sliding to 72.69, the lowest since May 2009. The New Zealand dollar dropped 0.4 percent to 65.81 cents.\nABN Amro lowered its end-December forecast for the Aussie to 70 cents from 72, and its estimate for the end of 2016 to 64 cents from 66 cents. The currency will weaken to 72 cents by Dec. 31, according the median estimate of 71 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.\nPolicy makers in both Australia and New Zealand are likely to cut interest rates in September to bolster flagging growth as slowing Chinese growth weighs on commodity prices, Teo said.\nS&P in a statement Friday affirmed its AAA ranking on Australia but said parliamentary gridlock on the budget or an external shock may lead it to lower its rating.\nRate Outlook Swaps traders see 24 basis points in rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia over the next 12 months, and 40 basis points by its New Zealand counterpart, Credit Suisse Group AG indexes show.\nThe preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index from Caixin Media and Markit Economics slid to 48.2 for July from 49.4 the previous month. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase to 49.7. Numbers below 50 indicate contraction.\n“Anything that suggests we aren’t really seeing signs of a recovery in China adds a bit of weight on Aussie,” said Robert Rennie, the global head of currency and commodity strategy at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. Risks of a drop for the Australian dollar toward 70 U.S. cents are building, he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T07:36:25.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
