The dollar fell to 120.60 yen, USDJPY, +0.05% from ¥123.70 to the dollar on July 2.\nGreece’s creditors have until Sunday to determine if they will grant the debt-burdened country a third bailout, or allow it to default on a payment to the European Central Bank and possibly leave the euro.\nOvernight, China’s Shanghai Composite fell another 6% despite the People’s Bank of China’s effort to quell the selloff. It has shed 30% of its value over the past month.\nCurrency traders consider the yen a haven currency, but it has outperformed the dollar, another haven currency, over the past week, which is surprising. Japan’s central bank continues with its program of asset purchases, and will likely not move to raise interest rates and tighten fiscal policy for the foreseeable future. The U.S. Federal Reserve, on the other hand, concluded its program of asset purchases last year and has been preparing to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. This should make the dollar the more attractive currency.\nMatt Weller, senior technical analyst at Forex.com, says there are two reasons why the yen benefits during periods of elevated global risk.\nThe yen has been the currency market’s safe haven of choice for decades. So it’s still the first currency traders buy when global market risk rises. Safe haven currencies typically rise during times of uncertainty, like the present.\nDuring times of turmoil, investors would be expected to bet on the currency with the clearest path toward appreciation. But under these circumstances, Japan’s loose fiscal policy and low interest rates are a positive for the yen.\nLow interest rates make the yen a suitable funding currency for carry trades, a common trading strategy employed by currency speculators.\nIn a carry trade, a speculator borrows in a currency with low interest rates, like the yen, then trades it for a currency with higher rates. He or she can then let their money collect interest at the higher rate, then collect the spread when they close out the trade and pay back their borrowed currency.\nBut shifting exchange rates can easily upend the trade, or even put investors in the hole. Investors commonly borrow money to amplify their profits. So if exchange rates move against them, the lender could demand money back, and the speculator would need to close out of the position and accept a loss.\nThe repercussions of a Greek exit from the eurozone are unknown. And no one can say if the recent tumult in the Chinese stock market is a temporary glitch or the beginning of a much larger decline. This makes the carry trade too risky. So investors are buying back their yen, paying back their brokers, and waiting until things settle down.\nThat is likely one of the reasons it has done so well Wednesday.\nHere’s a chart of the dollar’s performance vs. the yen over the past week:\nFactSet\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T02:37:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
