Shares in the media company slid 18.8% to 115.30p by 13:28 BST after the company said it would not meet expectations. \nJohnston Press said it expected first half profits to be marginally below last year, impacted by a slowdown in general trading and specific weakness in the run up to and after the election. \nThe newspaper firm said in the 26 weeks to 4 July 2015 revenue was expected to fall by 5% year on year, and circulation revenues were expected to fall by 5.5% during the same period. \nJohnson Press said management took action to mitigate most of the revenue reduction in the period which limited the impact on profits on the period. \nChief executive Ashley Highfields said trading conditions in the first half of the year were challenging. \n\"Whilst we expect this will have an impact on profit both at the half year and the full year, there are positive indicators coming through with digital growth and continued strong cash flow,\" Highfields said in a statement. \nNumis moved its rating for the company from \"hold\" to under review\" after the company warned on profit in a trading update. \nIn a note Numis said the trading update was \"disappointing\" and adjusted its 2015 operating profit expectation from £55.9m to less than £51m, and expected earnings per share fall from 27p to 23p. \nPanmure retained a 'buy' rating on the stock and cut its target price from 260p to 230p. \nAnalyst Jonathan Helliwell said the update was not a total surprise, and noted the digital side of the company was progressing well. \n\"This update highlights one of the key risks in the stock, namely the continuing structural pressure and low visibility on print advertising - even in a sound UK economy,\" he said in a note.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:46:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
