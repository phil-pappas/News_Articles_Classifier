Germany's DAX was expected to open up by 22-23 points, or 0.2 percent higher, while France's CAC 40 was seen up by 11-13 points, or 0.3 percent higher.\nAsian shares were mostly higher on expectations that China could stem the rout in its markets without damage to its economy, while the Fed ends a two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday with markets divided on whether it will take a hawkish or dovish stance, while some suspect it might chose to do neither. No move on rates is expected this week.\nIn recent congressional testimony, Fed Chair Janet Yellen neither ruled out a September hike nor guided the market towards thinking it was a done deal.\nEuropean shares had rebounded on Tuesday, with a key equity index ending a five-day losing streak, after some strong company results and corporate takeover activity lifted the region's stock markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T08:20:30.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
