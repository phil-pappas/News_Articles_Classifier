Fox has reason to cheer since the U.S. quarterfinal match against China attracted 5.7 million viewers, making it the most-watched non-final women's soccer match ever. The broadcaster has enjoyed a 23% ratings boost since the tournament began on June 12, according to an analysis by Bloomberg . Fox, which has cornered the broadcasting rights for FIFA World Cups through 2026, is hoping that's a sign of more viewers to come. \nBut the Murdochs have paid a hearty fee for that privilege. As U.S. audiences for the World Cup have mushroomed, so have the bids to broadcast them. While ESPN scored the 2010 and 2014 World Cups for $100 million, Fox agreed to a $425 million deal for this year's contest as well as upcoming men's World Cups in 2018 and 2022. FIFA later awarded Fox the women's tournament in 2023 and the men's in 2026 without a bidding process. \nMust Read: Greece Crisis Has Yet to Create Buying Opportunity in U.S. Stocks \nRegardless of ratings, getting the rights to the World Cup affords Fox an opportunity to appear to viewers who may not be rabid fans, said Mark Friederich, chief operating officer at sports sponsorship consultants Navigate Research, which has worked with ESPN and Major League Soccer. \n\"The short-time finances might not work out, but it accomplishes other things Fox,\" said Friederich. A big sports tournament like World Cup can help the company in \"establishing itself as a leader in the sports industry\" and attracting viewers to FoxSports.com for other content. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:26:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
