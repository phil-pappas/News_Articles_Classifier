The ALJ held that these mortgage reinsurance premiums were considered kickbacks—which are a violation of RESPA. \nAll parties appealed the decision from the ALJ, but the decision that PHH violated RESPA was upheld. However, the violations were on different grounds. On this appeal, PHH’s violations were found to warrant injunctive relief and disgorgement of over $109 million. Bureau Director Richard Cordray (“Cordray”) affirmed the recommended decision in part, and denied it in part. Factual and Procedural Background \nPHH Mortgage Corp. and PHH Home Loans LLC are owned by PHH Corp. (collectively, “PHH”). PHH is an originator of home mortgage loans. At the time, PHH was one of the nation’s largest home mortgage lenders. Besides originating loans, PHH purchased loans that other lenders originated, and sold them into the secondary market. \nPHH also established Atrium Insurance Corp., where the employees from PHH were responsible for doing the work. In addition, PHH established Atrium Reinsurance Corp. (“Atrium”), which took over all of the functions of Atrium Insurance Corp. \nFive other mortgage insurance companies that received referrals of borrowers from PHH are also involved in this case. United Guaranty Residential Mortgage Co. (UGI), Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corp. (Genworth), Radian Guaranty Inc. (Radian), Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Co., and Republic Mortgage Insurance Co. were interested in protecting their rights with respect to confidential investigative information the companies provided to the Bureau. \nAtrium provided a way for PHH to capture a portion of the profits that mortgage insurers were reaping. Atrium was a mortgage reinsurance company that assumed the risk that would otherwise be borne by a mortgage insurer. In return, Atrium would garner a portion of the premiums that borrowers paid to the mortgage insurer. Furthermore, Atrium was a captive reinsurer. Atrium only provided reinsurance for mortgage insurers that insured mortgages generally through PHH—and only for mortgages that PHH received from its own lenders. \nIn addition, Atrium’s reinsurance covered a block of loans—the book year. Although for some book years Atrium paid out more claims than it received in premiums, Atrium still managed to receive more than $150 million in \nThe Bureau investigated this matter, and subsequently filed a notice of charges with the Bureau’s administrative adjudication. The ALJ conducted a hearing and determined the following: \nPHH orchestrated agreements to refer borrowers to mortgage insurers in return for the reinsurance premiums that the mortgage insurers paid to Atrium. \nPHH entered into captive reinsurance agreements that violated Section 8(a), and that UGI, Genworth, and other agreements continued beyond July 21, 2008. \nPHH had shown adequate risk transfer as to only one of the four book years which remained open on or after July 21, 2008. \nPHH had not shown price commensurability as to any book year. \nPHH was enjoined from violating Section 8 of RESPA and from entering into captive reinsurance agreements for the next 15 years. \nPHH was required to disclose all services provided to PHH by any mortgage insurance company since 2004. \nPHH and the Bureau’s Enforcement Division (“Enforcement’) appealed the decision. Cordray issued the ruling in which he affirmed the ALJ’s decision in part, and denied in part as discussed below. Cordray’s Analysis \nStatute of Limitations \nAs a preliminary matter, Cordray noted that no statute of limitations applies when the Bureau challenges a RESPA violation in an administrative proceeding. There is a presumption against the retroactive application of statutes, and statutes should not be applied retroactively unless that was Congress’ intent. \nCordray also noted that the Bureau cannot retroactively revive claims that HUD would have been time-barred from bringing. The Bureau may seek civil money penalties only for violations that occurred on or after July 21, 2011. \nPHH violated Section 8(a) of RESPA by accepting reinsurance premiums on or after July 21, 2008 \nOn appeal, PHH challenged the finding that it referred business to the mortgage insurers. In determining whether a Section 8(a) violation occurred, Cordray considered whether the elements of a RESPA violation were present: 1) A payment or transfer of a thing of value; 2) The payment or transfer was made pursuant to an agreement to refer real estate settlement services business; 3) A referral actually occurs; and 4) The real estate settlement service involves a “federally related mortgage loan.” \nFor the first element, Cordray determined that UGI’s, Genworth’s, Radian’s, and CMG’s paid reinsurance premiums to PHH constituted a thing of value. \nAs to the second element, Cordray found the payments were made pursuant to an agreement to refer real estate settlement services business because there was an agreement made between PHH and the four mortgage insurers. \nFor the challenged third element, that PHH did not refer business to the mortgage insurers, it was found that PHH referred mortgage insurance business to UGI, Genworth, Radian, and CMG. PHH used its dialer to refer business. PHH also made referrals by imposing a surcharge to its corresponding lenders when the lenders would choose mortgage insurers that were not on the preferred list. \nAlthough PHH argued that it advised borrowers to shop for other mortgage insurers, Cordray disagreed. Indeed, he found that the “Affiliated Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement” provided by PHH to borrowers did not sufficiently provided borrowers with a choice. Cordray reasoned that the borrowers were provided with an illusory choice because PHH would not approve a loan if the borrower selected a mortgage insurer that was not a party to a captive reinsurance agreement. \nLastly, Cordray determined that the loans originated and received by PHH were federally related mortgage loans because they were intended to be sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae, or were funded by a lender that is regulated by an agency of the federal government. \noncluded that PHH violated Section 8(a) of RESPA when it accepted reinsurance premiums on or after July 21, 2008. Section 8(b) was not discussed. Further, Cordray found that PHH violated RESPA every time it accepted a reinsurance payment from a mortgage insurer because RESPA clearly states that the acceptance of a fee or kickback triggers the violation. Therefore, every acceptance of a payment on or after July 21, 2008, was a violation of RESPA. \nSection 8(c)(2) and the HUD letter do not excuse PHH’s violation of Section 8(a) \nCordray relied heavily on Section 8(c)(2) and HUD’s 1997 letter in this case. Using Section 8(c)(2), the ALJ relied on the HUD letter to support the notion that Section 8 provided PHH with a defense against the Section 8(a) and 8(b) violations. \nThe HUD letter addressed captive reinsurance agreements, as this case deals with. The ALJ found that even if the captive reinsurance agreement violated Section 8(a), the parties to the agreement could escape liability “if the payments to the reinsurer are for reinsurance services actually furnished or for services performed, and are bona fide compensation that does not exceed the value of such services.” Doc. 152 at 6. Interpreting the ALJ in this way was important because PHH was required to prove that Atrium actually furnished reinsurance services to mortgage insurers, and that the price of that reinsurance exceeded the value of the services. \nEnforcement argued that making a referral to a real estate settlement service provider in exchange for the purchase of goods or services is a violation that cannot be saved by 8(c)(2). PHH argues that 8(c)(2) exempts reinsurance agreements from 8(a) even if the agreements were entered into in exchange for a referral. PHH also argues that Enforcement’s interpretation conflicts with other parts of 8(c)(2), and because this violation can lead to criminal liability, any ambiguity in RESPA should be interpreted in PHH’s favor. \n—to read 8(c) as an exemption undermines the protections of 8(a) to try and eliminate kickbacks or referral fees that increase the cost of settlement services. \n“bona fide salary or compensation or other payment for goods or facilities actually furnished or for services actually performed.” 12 U.S.C. § 2607(c)(2). \n’s reinsurance affiliate actually performs reinsurance services and compensation from the primary insurer is bona fide and does not exceed the value of the reinsurance, then such payments would be permissible under Section 8(c)(2). \n“solely” for reinsurance, as required by the letter. \n—but Cordray disagrees. \n’s contention that Section 8(c)(2) creates a substantive exemption for conduct that violates 8(a). \nmaining two books. Therefore, even under PHH’s own interpretation of Section 8(c)(2), Cordray found that PHH still violated RESPA for not making the required showings. \n“enjoined to disclose” to the Bureau all services provided to them by any mortgage insurer since 2004. \n’s particular misconduct. \n’s second injunctive relief to be appropriate. Cordray added an order prohibiting PHH from referring borrowers to any provider of a settlement service, if that provider agreed to purchase a service from PHH, and if payment of that service was triggered by referrals. \n’s third injunctive provision to make it easier for the Bureau to detect any violations of Section 8. Cordray confirmed the ALJ’s order to the operative dates—on or after July 21, 2008—and for 15 years from the date the order becomes effective. \n’s disgorgement obligation could be offset by payments made to mortgage insurers—Cordray disagreed with this notion. PHH made the payments to mortgage insurers, not the borrowers that RESPA seeks to protect. Cordray found it inappropriate to credit PHH for the payments it made to the mortgage insurers that were the very same people involved in the RESPA violations. \n—any funds remaining in escrow shall be released to the Respondents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T17:19:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
