But here’s a different story, one that involves an endangered feline and, yes, an enterprising vodka brand.\nSnow Leopard Vodka is the brainchild of Stephen Sparrow, a former sports and spirits industry executive who learned of the plight of the leopard — just up to 6,000 are left roaming the planet, according to the World Wildlife Fund — on a visit to Nepal several years ago. He wanted to help protect the species, so he set up a trust and then came up with the idea of creating a vodka as a means to raise money (he was already thinking about starting a vineyard anyhow). As he said in 2010 around the time of the vodka’s launch: “I thought Snow Leopard would make a great name for a super-premium vodka. It’s cold, rare, exotic, powerful.” (And indeed, the leopard, which is native to South and Central Asia, roams some chilly parts of the world.)\nJump ahead five years and Snow Leopard Vodka is now owned by Edrington (it acquired the brand in 2013), the same private spirits conglomerate behind The Macallan and Highland Park Scotches. Snow Leopard is also finally being rolled out in the U.S. in a big way. So far, the brand, which donates 15% of its proceeds to helping the leopard, has raised $200,000 for the cause. But it’s aiming to raise $1 million annually, which equates to 150,000 cases.\nA vodka that benefits snow leopards (2:36) There are just 5,000 snow leopards left in the wild — but help is coming to them from an unlikely place: a vodka brand. Snow Leopard Vodka donates 15% of its profits to help the endangered snow leopard. Weekend Sip columnist Charles Passy discusses.\nWhat we think about it: We’re all for saving cats (and this leopard, with its signature long tail, looks like one cool cat). But what about the vodka itself? Snow Leopard aims to be distinctive from other vodkas on the market in that it’s the rare vodka made from the spelt grain (winter wheat and rye are more typically used in vodka). The brand says spelt’s tough husk “protects the grain from external pollutants while retaining nutrients, resulting in a freshness not found in any other grain.” That might sound a bit hyperbolic, but we will say the vodka is a clean-tasting one with pleasant notes of vanilla and pepper — in other words, a vodka that’s arguably worth the slightly higher price tag, especially if you’re sipping it in stand-alone fashion.\nHow to enjoy it: Certainly, you can have this vodka neat — or better yet, served slightly chilled from the fridge, as the brand suggests. But you can think cocktails, too, although the brand recommends ones that strongly emphasize the base spirit, not the mixers, so you can fully appreciate the leopard, so to speak. For a simple, aromatic martini, try mixing the vodka with a bar spoon’s worth of dry vermouth and using a sprig of rosemary as a garnish.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://edrington.com/our-brands/snow-leopard", "http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/endangered_species/snow_leopard/"], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T04:10:29.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
