This helps in qualifying the youth for working in these factories, in a number of different jobs.\n\nFarahat believes that providing the vocational training videos will be the website's first step towards presenting tutorials for the industrial and commercial education curricula.\n\nHe mentioned that the number of people contributing to the education process through Nafham amounted to around 500, and include students, teachers, and parents, while the target is to double the number in 2016.\n\nNafham is a company that sprang out of the business incubator, Flat6Labs, in 2013.
