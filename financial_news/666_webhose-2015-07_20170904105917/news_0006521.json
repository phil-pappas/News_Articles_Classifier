The move led traders to favor the euro as well as the safe-haven Japanese yen and Swiss franc. \n\"Dollar weakness against the euro and the yen is a risk-aversion story reflecting China stocks,\" said Richard Franulovich, senior currency strategist at Westpac in New York. \nHe said traders who suffered losses in stock markets probably compensated by closing out short bets against the euro, which in turn helped that currency gain against the greenback. The euro was last up 1.06 percent against the dollar at $1.10980 , near a two-week high of $1.11130. \nThe dollar also hit a nearly two-week low against the yen of 123.010 yen. The dollar was last down 0.52 percent against the yen at 123.150 yen. \nStrong economic data also boosted the euro early on Monday. \nThe Munich-based Ifo Institute's business climate index rose to 108.0 from a revised 107.5 in June. That beat the Reuters consensus for a drop to 107.2 and was at levels consistent with a positive pace of growth. \nData on Monday showed non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, rose in June, but shipments of core capital goods slipped 0.1 percent. Those shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. \n\"It certainly didn't help (the U.S. dollar),\" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. \nThe market will watch the July 28-29 Fed meeting to see if policymakers provide clues for the timing of a rate \"lift-off.\" Rising expectations that the Fed could begin hiking rates as early as September have been a major factor behind the dollar's gains over the past month. \nThe greenback was down 0.43 percent against the Swiss franc at 0.95830 franc. \nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was last down 0.80 percent at 96.461. That was near its session trough of 96.358, which was its lowest since July 14.
