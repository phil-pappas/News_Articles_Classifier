Time will tell if they are still celebrating in a few weeks. Dimitris Michalakis However, any deal still requires a degree of trust between governments that no longer exists. It would also require a radical change of tone from European political leaders, if only to explain to their own taxpayers why further and very public concessions to Greece are suddenly the best alternative.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel has already had problems persuading her own cabinet, as well as voters, that any more compromise is possible or desirable. Her urgent meetings with France's President Francois Hollande and then a special summit of European leaders on Tuesday demonstrate the urgency of co-ordinating a new approach to a new phase of the crisis. How they manage this is as dangerous for them as it is for Alexis Tsipras.\nMoney tends to runs even faster than any political timetable. The European Central Bank must immediately decide whether to unfreeze the emergency funding for Greek banks and lend yet more to add to the almost €100 billion ($148 billion) already extended. Without that, the closed banks will have no money left – even to dole out via ATMs in tens of euros at a time. Greece is already supposed to repay the ECB €3.5 billion on July 20, which it also won't have if there's no deal.\nDelight and defiance The scenes of delight and defiance in the streets of Athens reflect the belief that it is indeed possible to stay in the eurozone but with the \"dignity\" demanded by Tsipras. That optimism would be quickly and brutally tested if money does run out within days. No matter what happens, of course, the Greek economy is in terrible shape, still deteriorating fast thanks to the stand-off over the last several months. It will not recover for years, at best. The uncertainty is more about how to get through the next few days and weeks, including the chaotic option of a \"Grexit\" that Tsipras insists will not occur.\nYet the decisive nature of the vote means that it will be harder for the Greek government, even if so inclined, to offer concessions the other 18 European leaders could at least pretend were substantial enough to justify another bailout package. The Spanish, for example, are facing an election this year and the biggest threat to the Rajoy government is coming from Podemos, a Spanish version of Greece's left-wing Syriza party. How does conceding to the Greek parade of democracy square with Spain's willingness to have endured several years of tough reforms and austerity as the price of a sustainable economic future?\nThe Greeks are citing the economic disaster created by the austerity program the International Monetary Fund insisted on in 2010 and 2012 in order for Greece to qualify for a total of €240 billion worth of assistance so far. This is, at last, the chance to get out of the vicious cycle of austerity. Tsipras is also demanding debt relief – writing off a large chunk of it – given the impossibility of the government paying back debt that equals 180 per cent of GDP and will be rapidly escalating. \"We all believe there are no easy solutions, but there are fair solutions and sustainable solutions as long as both sides are on the same page,\" he declared after the vote.\nSo he is arguing that the vote was never about being in or out of the eurozone, and that the Greek people have responded to the right question despite the attempts at creating fear. It was really about the type of Europe that people want, he says, and the Greek people have changed the nature of the dialogue.\nThat, at least, is certainly true. Changed in what way is not at all clear.\nBut it does mean the grand political dream of an ever-more-unified Europe has now been punctured by a much sharper economic reality and very nationally based pride.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_drama_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-06T10:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:12:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
