It’s what young drinkers stacked into beeramids, punctured with keys for shotgunning or purchased in suitcase-sized packs for relatively low sums of money. Yes, it’s what generations earlier took on fishing trips or to the beach, but a few too many cans of uninspired light lager left it prone to ridicule and derision.\nToday, it’s a pillar of the craft beer industry. According to CraftCans.com, more than 520 of the nation’s nearly 3,700 craft breweries can at least one of their beers. Altogether, more than 2,000 craft beer brands are sold in cans. Where the can was once considered cheap and metallic, it is now a big part of the success of breweries including Portland, Ore.-based Hopworks Urban Brewery.\nFounder Christian Ettinger was a business student at the University of Oregon when he first began brewing beer in the early 1990s and remembers when craft or specialty beer consisted of the Killian’s Irish Red, Coors Winterfest and Henry Weinhard’s Dark, Red or Ale. As one of the first Oregon students to earn college credits brewing beer, during a paid internship with Eugene City Brewery, Ettinger turned a college semester in Cologne, Germany (birthplace of Kölsch), and a brewing course at the University of California-Davis into a brewmaster’s position at Portland’s Laurelwood Brewery.\nWhen he opened Hopworks in 2008, Ettinger and 43 employees were producing a scant 3,000 barrels of beer in kegs and 22-ounce bottles. About three years ago, however, he began canning beers and watching production increase. His brewery has since grown to 132 employees producing 16,000 barrels of beer, with half of that being sold in cans alone. The beer he ships in cans is roughly 30% lighter in weight than a similar amount of beer packaged in bottles, which makes it less costly while keeping the beer’s light and oxygen exposure to a bare minimum.\nThat’s allowed Hopworks to expand its distribution footprint from Oregon to Washington, Idaho, British Columbia and Utah (where the brewery’s 2.6% alcohol-by-volume Totally Radler and 3.9% ABV Nonstop Hef Hop wheat beer is just below the state’s 4% ABV threshold for beers sold in grocery stores). It’s also light enough to allow Hopworks cans to hitch a ride in pinot noir containers bound for Alaska and Hawaii, and to export them to Japan with shipments from Oregon brewers including Deschutes and Rogue.\nWhile Hopworks is one of seven breweries in the world certified as a B Corporation for its use of organic ingredients and environmentally sustainable practices — and collaborates with another, New Belgium Brewing Co., on its B-Side series of beers — Ettinger notes that its cans’ environmental benefits aren’t always as clearly defined as its economic efficiencies.\nMarketWatch writer Jason Notte helps Hopworks founder Christian Ettinger at the company’s Portland brewery. We met up with Ettinger at his Southeast Portland pub to talk about beer cans, the arguments for and against and the benefits, and challenges they bring to a growing brewery. We’ll note that the cans also served as fantastic pedestals for our camera and recorder during the interview:\nHow has canning worked out for Hopworks so far?\nEttinger: Our canning program has been far more successful than we envisioned. We started canning almost three years ago, and we went from 80% draft and 20% 22-ounce bottle with no single-serve option to, now, 50% can, 30% draft and 20% bottle. It’s really changed the landscape.\nConsidering your efforts toward making organic beer and running sustainable facilities at both your main brewery and your Bike Bar in Portland, how does the can fit into that strategy?\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T20:44:41.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
