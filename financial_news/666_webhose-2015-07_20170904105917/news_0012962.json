The company will transform the existing three-storey property into one of the largest and most highly-specified new office developments in the Thames Valley region. \nDelivered by ISG’s Reading-based project team, the scheme involves major structural alterations to reconfigure, modernise and extend the 1980s era building, creating circa 137,000 sq ft of Grade A, BREEAM Excellent rated office accommodation. In addition to improving the aesthetics, thermal performance and efficiency of the building, ISG will significantly extend the original footprint through the construction of two new wings, adding 20,000 sq ft of accommodation to the original property, providing the largest single office floor-plate in the Thames Valley. \nThe scheme builds on the experience of ISG’s Reading office in delivering challenging refurbishment schemes with significant structural elements; a key trend in the Thames Valley office market where demand for high-quality space continues to rise and much of the existing asset base is outdated with an inefficient layout. \nDue for completion in autumn 2016, the programme involves removal of two internal stair cores and construction of five external staircases as part of extensive changes to the internal layout. The existing atrium will be demolished to be replaced by a new spacious and contemporary atrium with a feature staircase and high-specification reception area. ISG will also reinforce existing columns and introduce additional structural beams to create spacious open floor plates. \nThe existing façade will be removed and piled foundations installed to support the new three-storey steel frame extensions to the front of the building. The façade will be re-instated and features extensive areas of glazing and high performance cladding - updating the building’s appearance and contributing to the office’s impressive environmental credentials. \nAs part of the project, ISG will comprehensively upgrade and modernise the office’s mechanical and electrical infrastructure, installing new highly-efficient building services and roof-mounted photovoltaic cells to generate emission-free electricity. \nGraeme White, ISG’s divisional director, commented: “There has been a surge in demand for property in the Thames Valley from both occupiers and investors over the past year and high-quality office accommodation remains in short supply. \n“As greater numbers of tenants continue to take administrative functions outside of central London, that demand is set to grow. Meanwhile, the Thames Valley has caught the eye of new entrants to the investment market, demonstrating a truly global appeal, which has been boosted still further by proposed infrastructure investment. \n\"The result is a surge of activity aimed at both upgrading existing office space and delivering structural refurbishments that can increase the volume of lettable accommodation. We are ideally placed to take an increasing share of this burgeoning market with our unrivalled insight into the Thames Valley office market, strong regional supply chain partnerships and credentials as the UK’s largest fit out contractor.” \nISG Plc is an international construction services company delivering Fit Out, Construction, Engineering Services and Specialist Solutions, operating in 28 countries worldwide. The company works with owners, developers and occupiers in the public and private sector for an extensive range of industries. ISG Plc was established in 1989 and has been quoted on AIM since 1998. Today the company has a turnover of around £1.5 billion. \nFor further information about ISG please visit our website www.isgplc.com \nThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.com View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150705005031/en/ Contact", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T01:54:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
