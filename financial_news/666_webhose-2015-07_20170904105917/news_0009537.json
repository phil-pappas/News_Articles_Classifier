The index is a measure of the dollar against a basket of major currencies. \nGold and the dollar typically move in opposite directions, which means if the dollar goes up, gold futures will fall as gold, measured by the dollar, becomes more expensive for investors. \nAnalysts note that traders' stop-loss orders put additional pressure on the precious metal and say that gold remains under pressure due to technical reasons. \nThe market is continuing to price in the expectations for an increase in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate according to analysts. \nAn increase in the Fed's interest rate drives investors away from gold and towards assets with a return, as the precious metal bears no interest. \nAnalysts originally expected interest rates to rise in June, but due to weaker-than-expected employment data, expectations were pushed back to September. \nIANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T14:55:27.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
