Broken down, Fredericks earned a R4.2m guaranteed package, R3.2m as a short term incentive and R1.1m in fringe and other benefits. \nInterestingly, Telkom's former CFO Jacque Schindehütte - who was suspended in October 2013 and then stepped down in August 2014 - earned R18.7m for the period ending 2015, more than that of CEO Maseko. \nIn a note on the report, Telkom said that Schindehütte received a short term incentive payment of R1.2m for the 2014 financial year while his long term incentive payments for both 2014 and 2015 amounted to R10.3m. Schindehütte also earned payment for 25 accrued leave days of R656 181. \nIn addition, another eight non-executive directors at Telkom took home more pay during the 2015 financial year when compared to 2014. Telkom chairman Jabulane Mabuza, earned total remuneration of R1.5m, higher than the R1.4m he received in 2014. \nOverall, total remuneration to non-executive Telkom directors increased from R8.6m to R8.7m. \nStronger revenues \nThe increase in Telkom executives' pay has come amid stronger revenues at the company. \nAccording to Telkom's financial results for the period ending March 2015, the company's net revenue increased 3.1% during the period to R26bn. The company further added that its group operating revenue increased 1.2% to R31.6bn, up from R31.2bn for the year ending March 2014. \nTelkom also reinstated its dividend while the company's share price has surged past the R50 mark in the last two years. \nCost-cutting \nHowever, Telkom has also been engaging in cost-cutting measures amid its core fixed line voice revenues having decreased 13.5% during the 2015 financial year to R6.8bn from R7.9bn in March 2014. \n\"We have taken out quite a lot of inefficiency, which is reflected in the 5.2% reduction in real terms in our operating costs,\" said Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko in the integrated report. \nTelkom's big plan to reduce costs further lies in its intention to axe over 4 000 jobs and outsource over 3 000 employees as part of an enterprise development plan. \nThe planned job cuts, though, were dealt a blow earlier this month when the Johannesburg Labour Court ordered Telkom to halt its Section 189 process which deals with planned retrenchments at the company. The judgment was handed down after trade union Solidarity brought the matter to court. \nThe court ordered that Telkom needs to consult further with unions, such as Solidarity, before going ahead with the move. \nSubsequently, on July 13 Telkom said that in the meantime it is looking for alternatives ways to reduce labour costs, some of which include offering all non-union workers voluntary severance packages or early retirement. \nThe company is also said to be considering implementing a wage freeze, a shorter working week and outsourcing more functions, according to a Reuters report. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:55:30.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
