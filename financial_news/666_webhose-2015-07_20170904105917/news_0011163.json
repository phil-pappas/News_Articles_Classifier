The poor also have the lowest physical access to health care.' \nMr Boamah spoke of interest buy-downs and risk transfer mechanisms, in order to facilitate provision of more affordable services, to organisations that are willing to engage in the sector, but are reluctant due to high interest rate they have to pay to build their facilities. \nHe said AfDB takes technology seriously and would be piloting an M-Health project in Zambia to provide sustainable, scalable and cost-effective solutions to reduce exposure of vulnerable groups to key non-communicable disease risk factors. \nHe observed that increasingly, the power of technology is being harnessed to bring timely and more affordable solutions to the underserved. \n'Eight out of 10 Africans have access to a cell phone, and mobile technology has been used to train health and social workers in pregnancy programmes and also HIV and AIDS programmes. \n'We can and should leverage on the delivery capacity of mobile service providers, companies that have demonstrated an ability to reach rural populations,' he said. \nOn efforts being made in Ethiopia where 34,000 health extension workers have been trained and deployed to provide maternal and child health services in communities, he pointed out that the sustainability of the health agenda is dependent on strong local ownership, which is why they must be part and parcel of the discourse on innovative solutions. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:46:27.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
