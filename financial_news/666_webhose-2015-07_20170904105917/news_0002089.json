Peter Braig by Geoff Winestock State hospitals would be paid based on a cost-control system that sets an efficient price for every medical procedure under an agreement between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the premiers that revives one of the Rudd government's signature policies.\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott and state and territory political leaders agreed on Thursday to work towards a system where the Medicare system is used to cover treatments in hospitals based on efficient pricing.\nExperts said the plan sounds like \"activity-based funding\", a system Kevin Rudd wrote into the federal-state hospital funding agreement in 2010. Hospitals were funded according to the specific procedures they provided such as hip replacements or heart bypasses. The price per procedure was set by an independent regulator who analysed all similar hospitals. That plan was scrapped in last year's budget. The amount of federal hospital funding was reduced and linked to each state's population.\nThe funding change will cost the states about $1.7 billion by 2017-18 and NSW Premier Mike Baird released an analysis this week suggesting the gap between the growth in hospital expenses and the Abbott system would rise to $20 billion by 2030. But if costs can be controlled there could be less need for a tax rise in GST, Medicare levy or anything else to help states meet the shortfall.\nMost health economists argue that activity-based funding can send a price signal to hospital administrators that forces them to control costs. The Grattan Institute in a paper last year said the cost of a gall bladder operation varies from as low as $3500 to $8000 between hospitals in NSW for no apparent reason. It identified $1 billion a year in unnecessary costs that could be removed by forcing hospitals to meet an efficient price.\nActivity-based funding theoretically gives the federal government an incentive not to shift the burden of healthcare from GPs to state hospitals, since the federal budget will share some of the extra costs. Having GPs treat people outside hospital is usually considered more efficient.\nSharing the pain Peter Breadon, a fellow at the Grattan Institute, said controlling costs could help defuse the stand-off between the states and Canberra over health funding. \"They could go to an agreement where the federal government will share a meaningful part of the pain but the states would agree that they would move to more efficient prices,\" he said.\n Mr Abbott appeared to back this approach at a press conference on Thursday after a meeting of Council of Australian Governments in Sydney. \"Plainly if the Commonwealth's contribution to public hospitals looks like it's aligned to the delivery of good services at the best price, rather than simply a block grant handed over to a bureaucracy, that would be a big step in the right direction,\" he said.\nSouth Australia Premier Jay Weatherill said the idea was to end the incentive \"for one side that's running the primary health system, another side that's running the public hospital system to actually cost shift to each other\".\nA spokesman for Queensland Health Minister Cameron Dick said, \"The Abbott government's proposal to fund the health system on population growth plus CPI has always been just a cloak for long-term funding cuts and cost-shifting from the federal to state budgets. Activity-based funding together with an independently determined efficient price are the best way to manage both hospital funding growth and improve efficiency across all hospitals.\"\nWhile the Abbott government last year scrapped activity-based funding, it has not disbanded the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority which set prices under Rudd's scheme. Many states have increasingly linked their own portion of hospital funding to measures of efficient pricing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:02:36.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
