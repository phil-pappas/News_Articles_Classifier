The goal was to ensure the money gets taxed and is not transferred to an uncooperative offshore financial centre before the automatic data exchange starts up.\nIt said Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis had personally taken part in talks on settling the issue, which has dragged on for years.\nShould the Greek parliament approve, a final round of talks with Switzerland would nail down technical details, including how banks can encourage Greek clients to reveal their wealth, it said.
