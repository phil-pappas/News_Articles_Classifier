Sam Bennett Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Rose Australian savers recorded an average return of 9.8 per cent on their superannuation in the past financial year, clocking six consecutive years of gains and the third straight year of above-target growth. The big question now is will the party kick-on in 2016?\nIt might turn out to be another year of strong returns, but many super funds are updating product disclosure statements to reflect their lowest long-term investment return expectations since Australia's compulsory superannuation savings system was introduced in 1992.\nThe worry is that with economic growth tipped to be tepid and interest rates forecast to remain low everywhere except the United States , global financial markets are about to get a hangover from the unprecedented levels of central bank stimulus they have been drinking up to fuel a recovery since the crisis of 2008-2009. Excess liquidity has pushed up asset prices ahead of expectations of stronger growth that is proving slow to come through.\n\"It will be a much more difficult environment in which to generate strong returns in the next few years than those we've just experienced,\" says MTAA Super's executive manager of investments, Philip Brown.\nThe $8.5 billion industry fund for workers in the automotive sector – which ranked second on Chant West's league tables for top-performing balanced funds in the financial year to June 30 with a total return of 11.7 per cent – has just lowered its target return to CPI inflation plus 3 per cent, the lowest level since the fund's inception in 1995.\nMTAA Super is by no means the only manager in the difficult predicament of having to tell members to lower their expectations. It is a looming issue for the entire $2 trillion retirement savings sector, regardless of whether individuals have their money in industry, retail or self-managed super funds.\n\"We are working with a large number of super funds reviewing forecasts for what level of returns in excess of inflation they can deliver in the coming years, and we expect many of these reviews will result in funds lowering their CPI+return targets,\" says Rice Warner senior consultant Alun Stevens.\nSavers should lower expectations June quarter inflation data released on Wednesday shows the estimated underlying inflation rate remains in the bottom half of the Reserve Bank's target range, at 2.3 per cent , meaning savers need to lower their expectations for average total returns to around 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent before fees and taxes over the coming years.\nQSuper Balanced was the top-performing balanced fund for the past financial year with a return of 12.3 per cent. Like MTAA Super, the $29.5 billion fund for Queensland public service employees has just pulled off a hat-trick of three consecutive years of double-digit returns.\n\"Members absolutely need to lower their expectations. The past few years of extremely strong results have been possible because financial markets have been pulling forward returns from future years,\" says QSuper chief investment officer Brad Holzberger.\nThe issue was a key talking point at an Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees lunch in Sydney this week, which hosted a panel of fund managers who run money for big super funds.\n\"It has been a very flattering 12 months for super funds; the dual challenge now facing the industry is not just how to allocate members' money in this difficult environment, but how to manage their expectations,\" says Aberdeen Asset Management's head of fixed income, Nick Bishop.\nChances of a stronger-than-average year Chant West data shows the median return from balanced growth funds, the category in which most working Australians are invested, was 9.8 per cent in the 2015 financial year.\nThe balanced fund MySuper options of Statewide Super, AMP Future Directions, VicSuper, UniSuper and HOSTPLUS all delivered 11 per cent or more. Rounding out the top 10 were Intrust Super, MLC Horizon 4 and AustralianSuper – all with an annual return of 10.9 per cent.\nEven the worst-performing of the balanced funds delivered total returns of more than 6 per cent.\n\"It is still possible super funds could post another stronger-than-average year in 2016, but it is getting structurally harder,\" says Brett Lewthwaite, head of fixed income at Macquarie Asset Management.\nThe chief economist at Colonial First State Asset Management, Stephen Halmarick, says super funds have an important obligation to educate their clients about what a lower-return outlook might mean for them.\n\"Given the lower-growth outlook is accompanied by a low-inflation environment, the relative value from lower total returns shouldn't be that bad, actually, but people need to understand what it means for them.\"\nQSuper's Holzberger says it is more important than ever for savers to consider whether their super is invested in a strategy tailored to the appropriate risk tolerance for their age and personal situation.\nNow read how you can limit (or even eliminate) tax on your super .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/sallymrose", "https://plus.google.com/115164720240377561218/about?hl=en"], "published": "2015-07-24T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:11:44.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
