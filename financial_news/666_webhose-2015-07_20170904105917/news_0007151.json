Photo: Louise Kennerley\nBriscoe Group managing director Rod Duke says he would not have snapped up a 19.9 per cent blocking stake in Kathmandu unless he was confident his $324 million takeover offer would succeed.\n \"You don't do things on the basis that you think it's going to fail,\" Mr Duke told Fairfax Media ahead of the release next week of Briscoe's bidder's statement for the scrip and cash offer.\nIf I can get Kathmandu, Rebel and Briscoe's and put these three together – wow!\nRod Duke The 65-year-old Adelaide-born New Zealand Rich Lister believes Kathmandu would be a \"great fit\" for his $500 million homewares and sporting goods empire and is confident that both Kathmandu and Briscoe shareholders will see the merits of a merger.\n \"We are encouraged with the people we have spoken to,\" he said, dismissing feedback that the bid offers no control premium and that investors in Kathmandu are reluctant or restricted from taking Briscoe scrip.\nAdvertisement \"We are very confident it will be seen for what it is – all you have to do is backtrack and see where the share price was five days before the offer,\" he said.\n\"We have put our money where our mouth is and when the instos and the media and the mum and dad shareholders of Kathmandu have a look at our bona fides … our track record is pretty good.\"\nMr Duke made his $400 million fortune buying the loss-making Briscoe Group for a song from its Dutch owner Hagemeyer in 1990 – two years after he was recruited to prepare the business for sale. He established Rebel Sport five years later and has subsequently turned the group into one of New Zealand's largest and most profitable retailers .\nA long time friend of Harvey Norman chairman Gerry Harvey and former Myer boss Bernie Brookes, Mr Duke is confident he can turn around Kathmandu, whose shares have fallen to five year lows after the company posted a string of poor sales results, lost its chief executive and reported its first loss since listing in the January-half.\nMr Duke stops short of describing Kathmandu's business model as broken.\n\"I think I'd like to get in there and understand all of it. You only see what's on the outside, the fluff and bubble, it's hard to see what really is the plan,\" he said.\nHowever, he says it's obvious that inventories are too high, stock turns are too low (less than half that at Briscoe), store leases are too expensive and the company is locked in a cycle of discounting.\nA successful bid would create a $1 billion retailer with three separate but complementary businesses and would generate significant synergies from greater purchasing power, cutting head office and corporate costs and sharing retail expertise.\nIt would be listed on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges and Mr Duke, who currently owns 78 per cent of Briscoe, would emerge with 55 per cent of the merged group.\n \"If I can get Kathmandu, Rebel and Briscoe's and put these three together – wow!\" said Mr Duke.\n \"(It will have) a billion dollars in revenues, it will be one of the most substantial listed retailers in this part of the world, it will give everyone, not just the shareholders, but people who work in those businesses, a real buzz to be part of what will be a really substantial business.\"\nMr Duke first looked at buying Kathmandu in 2006 after getting a call from its co-founder, Jan Cameron.\n\"We had a look back then … but Jan's price aspirations were somewhat different from mine at that point in time and I didn't follow it up,\" he said.\nMs Cameron subsequently sold 51 per cent of Kathmandu for $170 million to Goldman Sachs JB Were and Quadrant Private Equity, valuing the business at $340 million.\nMr Duke and Ms Cameron, a Briscoe shareholder, have both rejected speculation that she put him up to making the offer.\n\"She comes to New Zealand from time to time and we have a cup of coffee – that's the only involvement I've had with Jan,' he said.\nHe also considered bringing the Briscoe brand to Australia four years ago but was \"scared off\" by Mr Harvey and Mr Brookes, who said the market was too tough.\nMr Duke is now keen to build a sizeable business in Australia using Kathmandu as his bridge across the Tasman.\nHe outlaid $65 million last month to secure a 19.9 per cent stake before launching his offer, which values Kathmandu at around $1.60 a share.\n\"Now we have plenty of money in the bank and once again we have extended expertise inhouse, we've had a good dose of success in retailing and at the end of the day we've proved to ourselves that selling cups and sauces and irons and toasters is not a lot different than selling sporting apparel and sporting shoes.\"\n \"We see it as an interesting third arm to our business … and we think it plays to our core competencies.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:34:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
