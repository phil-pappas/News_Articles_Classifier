During the market’s recent rebound, trading interest waned, with daily price moves of less than 1 percent for the benchmark index, volatility falling to one-month lows and trading volumes slumping 18 percent from the 30-day average.\n“Volatility has certainly fallen off in a big way and we are seeing sustained signs of stability,” said Bernard Aw, a Singapore-based strategist at IG Asia Pte. “The upshot is that this sideways grind is going to stay for a while longer as onshore markets slowly resume normalcy, with the government carefully scaling back the support measures.”\nThe Shanghai index has risen 15 percent since July 8, rebounding from a month-long rout that wiped out almost $4 trillion, after officials allowed more than 1,400 companies to halt trading, banned major shareholders from selling stakes, suspended initial public offerings and gave a government agency access to more than $480 billion of borrowed funds to help finance equity purchases.\nChina should exit from some contingency measures to stabilize financial market at an “appropriate time,” the People’s Daily said in an article on Thursday. The government should also normalize some measures that are consistent with reforms, the newspaper said.\nFinancials Gain Hong Kong’s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 0.3 percent on Thursday, while the Hang Seng Index advanced 0.3 percent. The CSI 300 Index added 0.6 percent.\nBrokerages paced gains among financial shares, with Citic Securities Co. and Haitong Securities Co. both advancing 2 percent. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. jumped 3.1 percent after the second-largest Chinese insurer said it expects first-half net profits to have risen 62 percent.\nMargin traders increased holdings of shares purchased with borrowed money for a fourth day on Wednesday, with the outstanding balance of margin debt on the Shanghai Stock Exchange rising to 928.9 billion yuan ($150 billion).\nMaterial producers advanced before Friday’s manufacturing data. A preliminary index of manufacturing, known as the flash PMI, probably rose to 49.7 in July from 49.4 a month earlier, according to the median estimate of a Bloomberg survey. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.\nYunnan Tin Co. surged by the 10 percent daily limit, while Anhui Conch Cement Co. rose 3.5 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T06:31:45.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
