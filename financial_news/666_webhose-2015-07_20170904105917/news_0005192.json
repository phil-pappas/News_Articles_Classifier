A litre of petrol at Goil goes for 3.46 cedis whilst diesel is selling at 3.07 cedis a litre. \nTotal Ghana and Shell, two of the biggest foreign players have rates slightly higher than those displayed by the local oil marketing companies. \nAt Total, Super is sold for 3.538 cedis a litre, diesel goes for 3.144 cedis a litre whilst at Shell, a litre of Super and Diesel is selling at 3.51 and 3.12 cedis respectively. \nThe price difference is precisely what was anticipated when the NPA embarked on a journey to deregulate the petroleum sector. \nPricing of petroleum products and petrol politics had remained an albatross on the neck of government. \nPrevious governments as well as this one, had always played politics with the price of the commodity. \nFor years, successive governments, especially in election years, had kept the prices of petroleum products artificially low, raking up debt for the state. \nThis year, however, government decided to bite the bullet and take its hands off the pricing of the product. \nIt has been argued that allowing market forces to determine the prices could be in the interest of the consumer as competition could force down prices. \nThe current price differences appear to validate this argument. \nChief Operating Officer of Glory Oil, Edzordzi Dzikunu, will not say much except to emphasise that his company was able to set the lowest price because “we were able to negotiate well with our BDC.” \nHe said the local oil marketing firms deem it a national duty to contribute to the building of the nation by setting their price at the lowest level possible. \nMeanwhile, the Africa Centre for Energy Policy (ACEP) believes the prices could have down further. \nAt a press conference Friday, ACEP’s Executive Director, Dr. Mohammed Amin Adam presented computations that explained that the price reductions could have gone further down \nFuel prices have gone down at the pump between 10-15 percent following significant appreciation of the Ghana cedi against the dollar. \nWith Ghana sticking with an enhanced price deregulation policy, OMCs are now free to set its individual prices within a formula provided by the Bulk Oil Distribution companies. \nPer the new prices, petrol is now being sold between ¢15.00 to ¢16.00 down from the 18.00 cedis it was sold at prior to the reduction. \nBut ACEP argues it is not enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:44:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
