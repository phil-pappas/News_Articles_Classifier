Other topics will include the risks and benefits of shareholder activism and the role of executive compensation.\nAt the center is Clinton’s proposal to change capital-gains tax rates, the details of which are being finalized. The Democratic presidential candidate’s plan would create a sliding scale with at least three new rates that change depending on how long an investment is held, the official said.\nInvestments held for less than a year would continue to be taxed at regular income-tax rates, which can top out at 39.6% or more for the highest earners. For those held just a little longer—likely two or three years—the current capital-gains tax rate of 23.8% for top earners would rise. The Clinton rate, which hasn’t been finalized, would be higher than the 28% President Barack Obama proposed earlier this year for the highest earners. The Clinton campaign hasn’t ruled out taxing such investments at the regular income-tax rate.\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com .\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-to-push-revamp-of-capital-gains-tax-rates-1437365173?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-07-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T15:32:54.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
