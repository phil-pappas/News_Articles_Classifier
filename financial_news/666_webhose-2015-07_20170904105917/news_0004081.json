Operating income is forecast to range from $405-408m, representing growth of 14-15% over 2014, and above its earlier expectations of $400-408m. \nConlumino analyst Neil Saunders said the ongoing interest in fitness and athleisure products across the US continues to provide a \"useful tailwind\", which he believes is speeding Under Armourâ€™s growth. \"With strong numbers also being reported from companies like Nike this trend shows no immediate signs of slowing down.\" \nSaunders believes Under Armour will use its Connected Fitness business, which is now one of the largest global digital fitness communities, to help launch a new range of wearable technology later in the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T03:23:53.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
