Christopher Pearce Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow Wine producing , three-wheel car driving Luminis executive co-chairman Don Mordant was in his preferred Sydney lunch spot at Azuma on Thursday with Apparel Group director Andrew Michael.\nAlso in the house was Credit Suisse Emerging Companies Australia head of investment banking Dan Janes , lately in the business pages for his work on the telecommunications union of Vocus-Amcom .\nWe were going to mention his rotten employer in yesterday's column, but we thought it best to sleep on our gripe. Don't want to be petty, look precious, etc.\nBut we woke up with our rage still burning – so we'll cough up.\nJanes, the wretch, was along with Vocus chairman David Spence at a champagne dinner this week in Sydney. We won't mention the brand of the bubbly or the lousy restaurant because we are so furious at not being invited.\nCredit Suisse's dreadful chief executive John Knox was there too. That lousy chef Peter Doyle cooked.\nWestfield spin-off Scentre's chief executive Peter Allen (who we will try our best to forgive for keeping such bad banking company) won the door prize – a 2000 vintage of we-won't-tell-you-what. All agree it was a ghastly night.\nYes, to say we are a touch upset about this episode would be like suggesting our Prime Minister has of late been only slightly annoyed by Tony Jones 's Q and A . We are ropeable.\n As far as we're concerned Credit Suisse is Australia's worst investment bank – by miles. Whatever difficulties we've had in the past with UBS , or anyone else , all is forgiven. The House of Knox is now in our crosshairs.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow"], "published": "2015-07-16T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:08:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
