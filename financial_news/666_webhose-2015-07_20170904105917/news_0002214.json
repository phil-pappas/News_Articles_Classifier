AP by Jeremy Chunn Let's keep this simple. China is risky: the charts show it. The past year has been a wild ride, but over the past 10 years the Shanghai Shenzhen Composite 300 sharemarket index has whipped up and down like a cartoon rabbit in the back row of a boring three-hour opera.\n(And I can use that analogy because I was that rabbit last Wednesday night. Thanks a lot, Vivaldi!)\nBut back to the point. Two fundamental variables of investment are risk and return. The return part is the bit everyone pays most attention to because it's usually the annualised percentage rate the asset has grown by, or shrunk by, for a determined period.\nSo that's pretty easy to understand, and a regular investor will look at returns and nothing else when assessing an asset, hoping it will be a fair indicator of what's to come. There are no guarantees, of course.\nBut risk is just as important – so important. What is it? It's the volatility in those returns. It's the jagged ups and downs, the rocket launch and the ice abyss. Risk is the standard deviation of returns, which is the variance from average.\nIf the mathematical terminology turns you off, that's too bad. It gets worse.\nThe table here shows risk and return data for the Shanghai Shenzhen Composite 300, the MSCI World Index and our dear friend the S&P/ASX 200. The risk number is the expected variation above or below the average monthly return for the past 10 years. In the lingo, it's the standard deviation.\nTriple 3 Partners executive director Simon Ho watches the global risk barometer every day in his role providing a wholesale product linked to the Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index, or VIX.\n \"There is no VIX index in China, yet,\" Ho says. \"The only thing available [to assess risk] is a historical measure of volatility.\"\nThe VIX reflects demand for options bought in anticipation of a sharp market downturn, so it soars when the market dives, by which time it's too late to get most benefit from holding it. The idea is to hold a little bit of VIX as insurance. It must be a hard sell.\n\"People find it very hard to contextualise – what does volatility mean?\" Ho says. \"Standard deviation, or volatility, is just a measure of the spread of returns.\"\nNo one should ever be surprised by risk, and it's impossible to determine which markets will be shaken next, but Ho has some thoughts on it.\n\"A focal point has to be US interest rates, and China, for the rest of the world but particularly Australia, and then I think with rising interest rates and a stronger dollar you really have to be mindful of other developing markets,\" he says, singling out Brazil and Turkey.\n\"The debt these emerging market economies have assumed over the last two years has risen dramatically, so a rise in interest rates and a decline in their currencies makes servicing US-dollar debt much more expensive.\"\nSummarising risk as a statistic is kind of meaningless because of the assumption that the normal distribution applies. That's the statistical distribution applied to many natural measures, such as a person's height. It says 68 per cent of results will be one standard deviation either side of the average; 95 per cent will be within two standard deviations; and 99 per cent within three standard deviations.\nUsually only one standard deviation is Quote: d, but extra rows are included in the table here to show the expected range of returns for three standard deviations, or 99 per cent of outcomes.\nThe risk level in Chinese shares is more than twice that of Australian shares. This is reflected in the line chart, where the index is leaping up and down when compared with developed markets, which appear almost somnolent.\nRemember: the normal distribution is being fitted here for convenience. Future returns do not have to obey any academic assumptions; the global financial crisis proved that. A \"fat tail\" event is so called because the normal distribution would not have predicted it.\nAnything could happen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T07:04:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
