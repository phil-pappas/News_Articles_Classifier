Glenn Campbell by John Kerin and Timothy Binsted Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has defended the government's plans to boost farm incomes and drought assistance after criticisms that the agricultural competitiveness paper doesn't go far enough.\nMr Joyce was speaking after the release of the $1.2 billion assistance package on Saturday, which was slammed by the opposition and the Greens for failing to deliver a strategic vision.\nThe package also included a commitment to boost drought assistance loans by $250 million a year over 11 years.\nBut Labor's agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the paper had failed to deliver a strategic vision for agriculture, though he welcomed a boost to the farm management deposit scheme and the appointment of extra trade commissioners.\nMr Fitzgibbon said the white paper did little to reverse a decline in agricultural productivity and did not focus enough on building skills and training, and had a comparatively small investment in rural research and development that was outweighed by recent cuts to the sector.\nThe farm management deposit scheme enables farmers to better average their incomes by setting aside pre-tax income in good years that they can draw on in lean years.\nIt will be extended to smaller farms and for the first time used as an offset against farm loans. The concession is estimated to reduce interest costs to producers by up to $150 million a year.\nThe maximum allowable deposit limit will be lifted from $400,000 to $800,000 from July 1, 2016.\n Senator Joyce said on Sunday the package had a \"real plan\" to lift the prospects of the farm sector. \"This gives us a real plan for people to basically go out and put a crop in knowing that if it fails, they have an insurance premium that covers costs ... which I think is way beyond anything that's been put before,\" he told the ABC.\nSenator Joyce also said the setting up of a special Australian Competition and Consumer Commission agriculture commissioner could look at disputes between farmers and supermarkets.\n\"We need someone who intrinsically understands the nuances of how people can be exploited in the agriculture sector because more and more we have major buyers of product and lots of small family farms,\" he said.\nThe package included a $200 million boost to R&D programs, $200 million to boosting biosecurity surveillance and $30 million to breaking down technical barriers to trade.\nElders chief executive Mark Allison said after years of flatlining productivity on the farm, the white paper was hitting the right themes.\n\"Everything I saw in terms of productivity incentives, infrastructure incentives and R&D incentives are positive,\" he said.\nBut east coast grains giant GrainCorp was less effusive. A spokesman said that for GrainCorp, after years of asking for government support to improve delapidated country rail networks, it was \"very disappointing\" rail was left out.\n\"For us the poor performance of rail is really one of the biggest areas affecting our sector. Industry has shown a willingness to invest and we need government co-investment.\"\nHe said in contrast, the Baird government in NSW had committed $21 million to fix grain rail sidings and another $400 million for its fixing country rail project.\nBusiness Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott welcomed the package.\n\"These initiatives will have a positive impact on the competitiveness of a sector which has the potential to succeed on a global scale,\" she said. \"Research undertaken for the BCA last year found agriculture had the greatest comparative advantage of any sector in the Australian economy. [But] we need to shift from a mindset which focuses on the farm gate to one that focuses on high-value-add manufacturing and food production.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:52:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
