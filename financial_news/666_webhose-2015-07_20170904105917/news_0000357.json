Still, further policy easing is widely expected to support the slowing economy.\n\"The lending and money supply figures are higher than market expectations, indicating recent government measures have gained traction to lift loan demands in the real economy,\" said Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.\n\"They also mean China's economy may stabilise in the coming months. Still we believe the monetary easing will continue.\"\nBanks made a total of 6.56 trillion yuan in new loans in the first six months of 2015, said the People's Bank of China, which did not release loan data for June alone.\nThe central bank said the broad M2 money supply (M2) grew at 11.8 percent, beating forecasts.\nOutstanding yuan loans grew at 13.4 percent by month-end, the bank said.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected new local-currency loans of 1.05 trillion yuan in June, compared with 900.8 billion yuan in May, a rise of 14 percent, and predicted money supply would rise by 11 percent.\nANOTHER DECLINE IN RESERVES\nTotal social financing (TSF), a broader measure of overall liquidity in the economy, was 1.86 trillion yuan in June, compared with 1.22 trillion yuan in May.\nMeanwhile, China's foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest, fell by $40 billion in the second quarter to $3.69 trillion - the fourth consecutive quarter of decline, PBOC data showed.\nThe PBOC faces an uphill battle to channel money into the real economy even as the banking system is flush with cash, which has pushed down money market rates and stoked concerns about stock market bubbles.\nThe rapid decline of China's previously-booming stock market, which by the end of last week had fallen around 30 percent from a mid-June peak, has been a major headache for China's top leaders, who were already struggling to avert a sharper economic slowdown.\nIn response to the plunge, China orchestrated a halt to new share issues, with dozens of firms scrapping IPO plans in separate but similarly worded statements over the weekend, a tactic authorities have used before to support markets.\nSeparately, the State Council, China's cabinet, decided to scrap the country's longstanding loan-to-deposit ratio requirement in late June, the latest measure to reform the country's commercial banking sector and get more lending into a slowing economy.\nOn Wednesday, China will report economic growth for the second quarter, which is expected to be below 7.0 percent.\n($1 = 6.2080 Chinese yuan) (Additional reporting by Xiaoyi Shao and Pete Sweeney in SHANGHAI; Editing by Richard Borsuk)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T06:36:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
