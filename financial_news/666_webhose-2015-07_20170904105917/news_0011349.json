It shows financial discipline,\" Ukranian news agencies quoted Shevalev as saying. \n\"But after paying the body of the bond, it will be very hard to talk to the other creditors -- why we decide to pay someone in September and not someone else later on.\" \nUkraine's biggest worry is a $3 billion Eurobond that Russia purchased from the deposed government in the wake of its 2013 decision to bow to Kremlin pressure and reject an EU association pact. \nMoscow has refused to join the debt negotiations and demands the full amount back by the December 20 deadline. \nA person close to the creditors said Western investment houses were taking a far more compromising stand than Moscow. \n\"As long-term investors in Ukraine, the committee has led efforts to ensure a rapid, mutually acceptable and sustainable debt restructuring, while also retaining the country's vital access to capital markets,\" the source told The Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T23:13:34.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
