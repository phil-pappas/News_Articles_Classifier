It helps in preventing fraudulent transactions at branches.\n\nRBI said banks should immediately review their present concurrent audit system, incorporate necessary changes necessary changes and place before audit committee of the board. They should review the effectiveness of the system once in a year and correct the lacunae in the implementation.\n\nThe concurrent audit at branches should cover at least 50% of the advances and 50% of deposits of a bank. The risk profile of branches should be taken into account while selecting them for concurrent Audit. The branches with high risk are to be subjected to concurrent audit irrespective of their business size.\n\nThe new areas posing risk may be brought under the purview of concurrent audit. The branches with high risk should be subjected to concurrent audit irrespective of their business size, RBI said.\n\nFurther, specialized branches like agriculture, SME, treasury, foreign exchange and corporate, Retail Assets, Portfolio Management, Treasury, foreign exchange within ambit of audit.\n\nAudit should focus on whether transaction or decisions are within the policy parameters and regulatory norms. A concurrent auditor may not sit in judgement over the decisions taken by a branch manager or an authorised official. This is beyond the scope of concurrent audit.\n\nRBI has left it to banks to decide whether appoint internal staff or external auditors including retired staff of its own bank for doing concurrent audit.\n\nInitially, the external audit firm may be appointed for a year. Later, external auditors’ term could be extended upto three years. After this tenure an auditor could be shifted to another branch subject to satisfactory performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T18:24:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
