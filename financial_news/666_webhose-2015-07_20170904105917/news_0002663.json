I do know we did something we felt we had no choice over.\" \nTsipras's government suffered its first resignations over its U-turn acceding to creditors' demands, with a junior finance minister and a senior economy ministry official walking out in protest. \nAn IMF official said the fund would only participate in a third bailout if EU creditors produce a clear plan. The current deal \"is by no means a comprehensive, detailed agreement,\" the official said. \nFrench MPs however overwhelmingly backed the agreement on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls saying it was the only way out of the crisis. \nEU powerhouse Germany's Bundestag is set to vote on the plan on Friday. \nUnder the deal, eurozone governments will contribute between 40 and 50 billion euros, the IMF will contribute another chunk and the rest will come from selling off state assets and from financial markets, a European official said. \nTsipras has admitted he \"cannot say with certainty\" that it will be enough to prevent a so-called \"Grexit\" until the final bailout agreement is signed. \nPolls published late Tuesday by Kapa Research found 72 percent of Greeks surveyed thought the deal was necessary, if tough, but many nevertheless saw it as a humiliating climbdown for a country still reeling from years of painful austerity. \nDespite the turmoil, 68 percent of people said that if the political fallout from the vote should result in a new coalition, it should be led by Tsipras. \n- More payments due - \nUnder the deal, Greek assets for privatisation will be parked in a special fund worth up to 50 billion euros, with some 25 billion euros of the money earmarked to recapitalise Greece's banks. \nThe European Central Bank has been keeping Greek banks afloat with emergency liquidity, but it could be forced to cut off that aid if Greece misses a huge debt repayment due on Monday. \nEuropean governments are meanwhile divided over options to help Greece meet its short-term cash needs while it waits for the eurozone bailout deal to be finalised, which will likely take at least four weeks. \nThe European Commission on Wednesday formally backed a controversial proposal to use an EU-wide crisis fund to cover Greece's short-term cash needs, officials said, setting up a clash with Britain and Germany. \nIn a sign of the concern about the fallout of the crisis, US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew will travel to Germany and France on Wednesday and Thursday for talks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T23:56:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
