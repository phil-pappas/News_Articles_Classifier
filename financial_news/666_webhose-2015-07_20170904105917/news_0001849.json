The cap will be reduced to 23,000 pounds for those living in London, in line with pre-election promises, but he did not set out the lower ceiling that would apply elsewhere. \nHe also said those on high incomes in subsidised local authority housing would have to start paying closer to the market rental rates. \nThe Sunday Times reported that Osborne plans to launch a 650 million-pound raid on the BBC to help cover the country's benefits bill, forcing the corporation to meet the cost of free television licences for the over-75.
