As of 14:30 BST, the FTSE 100 was trading 0.5% lower at 6,595, led by Vodafone after a negative note on the telecoms giant by Merrill Lynch , which told clients it felt the stock's recovery remained \"fragile\". Analysts cast doubts on the company's ability to compete with converged network operators and were sceptical about capex levels. \nRoyal Bank of Scotland (LSE: RBS.L - news ) was in the red on reports that it faces a $13bn claim over allegations regarding its actions before the 2008 crisis .

Anglo was also falling on rumours that the miner could cut up to 20% of its workforce at head offices worldwide. \nSmiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) gained after JPMorgan Cazenove reiterated its 'overweight' stance on the stock, pointing to close to 13% upside to its unchanged 1,280p price target. \nReal estate stocks were performing well, with British Land (LSE: BLND.L - news ) , Intu Properties (LSE: INTU.L - news ) and Land Securities (LSE: LAND.L - news ) all among the risers. \nDefence group BAE Systems (LSE: BA.L - news ) was making gains after UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'neutral' but cut the price target to 510p from 540p. \nRisers Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 1,080.00p +1.98% Land Securities Group (LAND) 1,250.00p +1.46% Hammerson (HMSO) 634.00p +1.20% St James's Place (STJ) 927.00p +1.09% Pearson (PSON) 1,228.00p +1.07% British Land Company (BLND) 809.50p +1.06% Randgold Resources Ltd.
