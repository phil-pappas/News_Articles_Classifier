As paclitaxel rapidly becomes popular in the clinic over the next 20 years at present it is utilized in the treatment of advanced breast carcinoma prostatic cancer Kaposi's sarcoma head and neck cancer cutaneous carcinoma and some other common malignant tumors. Ever since it came into the market in 1992 paclitaxel the best-selling phytogenic anticarcinogen has brought in an accumulated sales value of over USD 20 billion. Before 2000 90% of the global paclitaxel market was dominated by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. After the patent of paclitaxel expired over 100 companies around the world are engaged in the production of the APIs and preparations of paclitaxel.\nChina is one of the leading countries with diagnoses of cancer. In China 5 million to 6 million new cases of cancer are identified each year. However the overwhelmingly high price of paclitaxel injection (CNY 1600 for one dose of paclitaxel injection in the past) has constrained its sale in the Chinese market. Therefore the sale of paclitaxel in China has been poor in the past ten years. However ever since Jiangsu Heng Rui Medicine Co. Ltd started to produce the APIs and preparations of Docetaxel the situation of China lagging behind developed countries in the consumption of paclitaxel has changed. Since domestic paclitaxel injection is much cheaper than its imported counterpart the formerly high-end medicine has truly become affordable to ordinary people. At present the market price for each dose of domestic paclitaxel injection (30mg/5ml) ranges from CNY 285 to CNY 550. Annual sales value of paclitaxel in China has risen from less than CNY 400 million in 2005 to CNY 1388 million in 2014 and its CAGR during the period of 2005-2014 was 17.3%.
