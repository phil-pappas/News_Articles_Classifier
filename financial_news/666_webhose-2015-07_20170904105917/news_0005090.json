Reuters Share on twitter by David Ramli One of iiNet's biggest shareholders has called for the rejection of TPG Telecom's $1.56 billion takeover offer on July 27 and demanded a trading update before any vote on the deal.\nMerlon Capital Partners portfolio manager Hamish Carlisle, who is one of iiNet's major shareholders with around 3 per cent of the company, told Fairfax Media that he is likely to vote against TPG's cash offer based on the information currently available to the market.\nIf shareholders representing a further 12 per cent of iiNet back Mr Carlisle's call then TPG's bid could be rejected â€“ a move that iiNet chairman Michael Smith has warned would likely result in the share price plummeting .\n\"It's highly unlikely that you'd see a dramatic fall in the iiNet share price if this deal didn't get up,\" Mr Carlisle told Fairfax Media. \"In all likelihood the stock will continue to trade at levels where it is trading at the moment on a standalone basis.\"\nOne of iiNet's biggest shareholders wants to vote against TPG Telecom's $1.56 billion buyout offer. TPG is seeking to buy iiNet and become Australia's second-largest provider of broadband services behind Telstra and ahead of Singtel-Optus. iiNet shareholders are set to vote on TPG's offer on July 27.\nBut Mr Carlisle pointed to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's recent draft decision to slash Telstra's wholesale prices for access to its copper phone network and said some brokers had estimated this could cut iiNet's costs by up to $25 million.\nHe also said that iiNet deserved to trade at nine times EBITDA, in line with some of its peers in the sector.\n\"For a business with $200 million-odd of earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) it's meaningful and I think if you're trying to form a view on standalone value you need to have a view around maintainable earnings,\" he said. \"So I think the company should comment in relation to the validity or otherwise of those numbers that, rightly or wrongly, are out in the market.\n \"My understanding is the business has been travelling very well over the last six months and you've got a potential further tailwind thanks to better wholesale arrangements with Telstra.\"\n\"They've held multiple meetings with institutional investors over the course of the last few months to talk about the deal and talk about different aspects and those discussions from my understanding have included discussions around company performance that need to be put out in the public domain,\" he said.\n\"There's a fine line between what ASIC would define as selective briefing or otherwise and it comes down to the materiality of the comments made but again I think any comments made in a private setting need to be put out into the public domain.\"\nBut Mr Carlisle's comments are in sharp contrast to those of iiNet's Mr Smith, who last said the company's share price to fall to lows not seen since early March before TPG made its offer.\n\"Anyone contemplating voting 'no' faces a significant risk that the price they're certain of if they vote 'yes' is not going to be available ... and there'd be considerable downside risks to this not proceeding,\" Mr Smith said at the time.\nLonergan Edwards & Associates, which provided an independent expert's report into the process, also found TPG's bid to be \"in the best interests of iiNet shareholders in the absence of a superior proposal\" in June.\niNet was trading at around $8 per share until December 2014, after which increased investments by the internet service provider saw its share price fall to around $6 per share.\nThe telecommunications provider's share price soon bounded up to between $9 and $10 per share to reflect takeover offers from TPG and M2 Group.\nWhile a substantial block of iiNet shareholders were originally opposed to TPG's takeover of iiNet, this largely melted away its bid was raised from $1.4 billion in cash to $1.56 billion in cash with an option of shares.\nSenior industry sources have also said it is unlikely M2 will come back with a new offer after its initial share-based offer was rejected as being inferior to TPG's smaller cash bid.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Davidramli"], "published": "2015-07-14T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:03:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
