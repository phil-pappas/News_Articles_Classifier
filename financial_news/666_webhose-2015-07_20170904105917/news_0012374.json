They have also maintained neutral ratings on Bendigo Bank and Bank of Queensland.\nWe now believe the era of high returns from Australian household lending insulating bank profitability is coming to an end.\nGoldman Sachs \"Our preference across the banks sector remains ANZ,\" said Goldmans. \"The bank's Asian growth strategy provides it a growth lever outside the domestic economy, which we expect to be more adversely impacted by...demographic headwinds.\"\nBanks will try to maintain profitability in the face of these headwinds by lifting mortgage rates.\nOn the other hand, \"our least preferred bank across the sector remains Commonwealth Bank. The bank is the largest Australian mortgage lender and has around 60 per cent of its loan book...derived from domestic housing.\n\"As a result, we believe Commonwealth Bank is exposed to...demographic headwinds. Further, Commonwealth Bank's valuation remains un-compelling.\"\nGoldman Sachs also slashed the target prices for ANZ by 6.5 per cent to $36.98 (currently trading around $32) Commonwealth Bank by 4.3 per cent to $81.13 (currently trading around at $86), and Westpac by 5.8 per cent to $35.28 (currently trading around $32.)\nGoldman Sachs warned of declining sector profitability in the years ahead due to demographic headwinds. \"Australian household lending - mortgages, credit cards and other personal loans - has been the key contributor to Australian bank profits over the past decade.\n\"However, we now believe the era of high returns from Australian household lending insulating bank profitability is coming to an end, driven by shifting regulation and an ageing and fully geared population.\"\nThe headwinds mentioned by the bank are:\n1. Regulatory changes, which will cut mortgage profitability by one-third and drag return on tangible equity (ROTE) by 2 per cent to 3 per cent.\n\"We believe Australia will be no exception to the global regulatory push for higher capital requirements,\" said Goldman Sachs. \"We believe the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority could increase domestic advanced bank mortgage risk weights to a floor of 25 per cent from 17 per cent, increase capital requirements for banks by 1 per cent and remove the double gearing benefits the banks currently enjoy within bank wealth subsidiaries.\"\nThis will mean the banks will need to raise an extra $27 billion in additional capital, endure cuts in mortgage profitability by one-third, and lose 2 to 3 per cent from their ROTE.\n2. The impact of ageing baby-boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964) who are paying down debt and saving more through deposits and superannuation - a major headwind to household debt growth.\nThis impact is compounded, said Goldman Sachs, \"by households whose debt-to-income ratio is already the highest in the developed world and whose debt burden will become uncomfortably high as rates rise.\"\nBanks will try to maintain profitability in the face of these headwinds by lifting mortgage rates on top of any changes to the Reserve Bank's cash rate, said Goldman Sachs. This will keep household debt growth to between 3 and 5 per cent over the next 15 years. \"We now forecast about 4 per cent mortgage credit growth versus 5 per cent previously over the medium term.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:00:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
