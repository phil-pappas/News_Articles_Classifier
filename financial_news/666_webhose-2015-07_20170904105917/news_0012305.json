Jim Rice Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Patten The potential impact on superannuation fund returns from ultra-low interest rates is a topic currently doing the rounds of scheme boards.\nAdmittedly it is not an easy topic, given that it involves long-term market forecasting and the challenge of passing on unsettling news to members. Are interest rates likely to remain low for the next five to seven years, or is this likely to be a 20 to 30-year phenomenon? When might economic growth start to pick up? If a fund has a 50 to 60 per cent chance of meeting its return objective, should trustees warn members? Or reduce the target?\nCertainly, it would seem prudent to inform members if there is a decent chance their super will not rise by as much as expected over the next five to 10 years. Members in their 50s and 60s need to be warned if there is a risk of a shortfall in their retirement savings to give them time to save more or consider working for longer. Incidentally, as Ian Patrick, executive director at JANA Investment Advisers notes, it is equally a problem for charities and foundations, which sadly may need to reign in their activities if returns are lower than expected.\nThe signs are not great for funds – or the charity sector.\nRob Hogg of Frontier Advisors notes that the global economy is characterised by low growth, high levels of debt (mainly held by governments), ageing populations, and low investment levels. Other experts in the field point out that asset prices have risen considerably over the past few years, a trend that can't last forever.\nReturn objectives in doubt It is little wonder than that asset consultant Towers Watson predicts that over the next five to 10 years the annual gain generated by a typical balanced fund is likely to be about 2 percentage points lower than long-term return objectives. Actuarial firm Rice Warner said on Sunday that it was forecasting that the majority of retirement funds had less than a 50 per cent chance of meeting their return objectives over the next decade due to a combination of low interest rates, recent price rises and subdued global economic growth.\n\"You can't expect high capital growth because asset prices are already at historical highs,\" says Rice Warner chief executive Michael Rice.\n Some consultants, it must be said, take a different view. Graeme Mather, market leader for Mercer Investment Consulting Pacific, argues that for many super funds the probably of hitting their long-term objectives may have fallen, \"but it is still pretty high.\"\nMather predicts that the returns generated by most asset classes will fall by 0.25 percentage points a year over the medium term, but he says that other investment strategies, such as absolute return funds and strategies designed to take advantage of market volatility, should be able to help take up some of the slack. JANA is also looking to so-called alternative strategies, such as absolute return funds, hedge funds and diversified credit, to help drive returns.\nPerformance side will suffer Still, there is little doubt that life is going to get tougher on the performance side for the foreseeable future. This is likely to be (yet) another potential driver of consolidation in Australia's $2 trillion retirement savings sector.\nStrong returns can mask underlying weaknesses in funds, such as low inflows or indeed net outflows. If total assets under management stagnate, the amount of money coming in the door from administration and investment management fees will go the same way. Poor performance is also likely to encourage fund members to switch schemes, placing pressure on funds who are falling behind in the league tables.\n\"You get more switching by corporate plans and at the individual level,\" notes Sunsuper chief executive Scott Hartley.\nSuper funds, of course, also face significant costs related to the development of retirement income products, overall pressure on fees and rising insurance premiums, all of which should, at least in theory, prompt trustees to consider their positions – and perhaps potential partners.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/106598404524016074873/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/sallympatten"], "published": "2015-07-05T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:04:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
