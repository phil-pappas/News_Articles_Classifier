If the bar were raised, she said, the Fed should retain power to designate smaller banks based on risk.\nSenator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who leads the Banking Committee, has introduced legislation that would raise the bar for systemic designation to as high as $500 billion in assets. Democrats including Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have led opposition to the Shelby bill, saying it would exempt banks that could threaten the financial system and lead to taxpayer bailouts.\nThe possibility of lifting the Dodd-Frank mark was first raised by Daniel Tarullo, the Fed governor responsible for bank regulation, who suggested that a $100 billion threshold might work better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T00:45:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
