It'll all be right',\" he said.\nHowever, as shown in the Grattan research report – Fiscal Challenges for Australia – Treasurer Joe Hockey has shifted the lion's share of his anticipated budget repair over the next four years onto the burden of fiscal drag, or the process by which wage hikes push workers into higher tax brackets.\nAlso known as bracket creep, the process means the Federal government will extract an extra $25 billion from payrolls by 2018-19, equivalent to more than half of total budget repair job.\nSpending moderation, by comparison, will deliver just $12 billion in improvements to the bottom line, which is currently around $41 billion in deficit, the institute said.\nThe report, co-authored by Grattan fellow Danielle Wood, estimates that for every year that the government delivers a deficit of $40 billion – it essentially borrows from future generations to the tune of $10,000 via extra taxes.\nThe current run of budget deficits began in 2008-09 and is expected by Treasury to remain in place until no sooner than 2019-20, with the expected improvement heavily reliant on economic growth rebounding to 3.5 per cent in 2017-18 and 2018-19 – a forecast that has been heavily questioned in recent days by the International Monetary Fund , and former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson .\n\"Based on the government's numbers, a decade of accumulated deficits means we are effectively saying to households aged 25 to 34 today that they will pay an extra $80,000 in tax over their lifetimes,\" Mr Daley said.\n\"If the government is wrong, and we think they are, it'll be more like $100,000.\n\"And that's for a generation not getting much in the way of free kicks out of the housing market or assets that they own.\"\nThe Grattan research exposes the degree to which succussive governments have consistently over-estimated the budget position over the past five years, with only the 2009 budget – prepared in the midst of the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression – coming close to being on target four years later.\n\"Our most gloomy budget prediction in 2009 was about right,\" Mr Daley said.\n\"The scale of these errors – larger than the ultimate deficit in most years – calls into question a do-nothing budget strategy that justifies deficits on the basis of a projected surplus or near surplus at the end of the forward estimates period.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-01T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T18:03:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
