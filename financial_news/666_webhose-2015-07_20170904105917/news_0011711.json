We would like the Government to consider reform of the bank levy,” the BBA’s chief executive Anthony Browne wrote in his letter to the Chancellor.” \nThe British Bankers' Association's chief Anthony Browne is becoming increasingly vocal on the bank levy \nThe banking industry also wants the Chancellor to intervene in the latest proposals on bank capital from the international Basel Committee, which it says threaten to drive up the cost of mortgages for first-time buyers. \n“New (KOSDAQ: 160550.KQ - news ) mortgages are likely to become much more costly as banks are forced to hold more capital and cannot even re-evaluate risk exposure over the lifetime of a loan, by taking account of changing house prices, narrowing loan to value margins or improved affordability,” the BBA said. \nMeanwhile, the IoD has said that easy-to-understand tax breaks would encourage more people to buy shares in entrepreneurial businesses. \n“The IoD is calling on George Osborne to create an 'equity economy’, by making sure the tax system promotes investment and is easy for both individuals and businesses to understand”, said Simon Walker, director general of the IOD. \nThe lobbying body has also said that there should be a consultation on merging inheritance and capital gains tax to remove the possibility of a double levy on capital. \nBritain’s manufacturers have separately said the Government must continue to maintain the pipeline of infrastructure projects and protect research and development tax credits to encourage investment. \n“The challenge for this government is to take the economy from recovery to sustainable growth”, said Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers organisation EEF. “That requires stable policy with an eye to building the skills, infrastructure and technological innovation which will allow internationally competitive, high productivity companies to succeed in the UK”, he added. \nSmall house builders have become an early beneficiary of this week’s Budget after the Department for Communities and Local Government announced a £100m fund, alongside Lloyds Banking Group, to help smaller builders recruit workers and increase housing supply.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T03:41:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
