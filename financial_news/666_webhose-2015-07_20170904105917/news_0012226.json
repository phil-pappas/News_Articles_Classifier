Autopax has refused to transfer employment contracts to their tender,\" said Mahlangu. \nHe accused the department of failing to apply the law. Meanwhile, Putco took to the Labour Court to request assistance in ensuring that Autopax absorbs all workers who had been affected by their cancelled contract. \nOn Thursday, the court heard that there was a good chance the Putco employees who had not been transferred to other parts of the business would be retrenched if Autopax did not incorporate them into their own business. \nSubmissions by Putco and Autopax's legal representatives differed on whether the latter could be obliged to employ all affected Putco employees, since it did not involve a take-over, but rather Putco giving up certain routes. \nJudgment reserved \nThe court heard 235 drivers had been affected by Putco's decision to cancel the three contracts. \nOnly 141 of them had been transferred to other Putco operations. The Passenger Rail Agency of SA's subsidiary Autopax stepped in to replace Putco on the affected routes and has hired 58 of the affected Putco drivers. \nThe future of the outstanding 94 depended on the court's judgment on whether or not Autopax was legally obligated to employ them. \nJudgment on the matter was reserved. \nSource: News24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:30:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
