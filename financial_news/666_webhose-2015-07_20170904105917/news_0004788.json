AP Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Vanessa Desloires The Australian sharemarket soared on Tuesday, adding more than $30 billion in a broad-based rally as investors cheered a bailout deal struck between Greece and its creditors .\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 closed up 1.95 per cent or 104 points to 5577.4, its second largest rise this year, while the All Ordinaries finished up 1.9 per cent to 5561.9.\nThe local rally followed strong rises on global markets, after news broke just after the Australian share market closed on Monday that marathon discussions between Greece and its creditors had ended with a bailout agreement.\n\"It's just a relief rally, because the markets got too concerned with what was going on with Greece,\" Auscap Asset Management portfolio manager Tim Carleton said.\n\"Greece may have played a role in increasing volatility domestically, but ultimately its not going to have any impact on earings of the companies involved,\" he said.\nBut Morgans private client adviser Alistair McCorquodale said today's rally was all about \"certainty\".\n\"The market's been trading for a number of weeks now with ongoing uncertainty with what the outcome in Greece will be,\" he said.\n\"The agreement last night between Greece and its creditors provides certainty, that in my view is what the market is trading on. There's not going to be any ongoing further volatility as far as negotiations as concerned.\"\n The broad-based rally was led by the miners. BHP Billiton added 2.6 per cent to $27.1, while Rio Tinto gained 3 per cent to $53. Beleaguered iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group also rallied, up 3.8 per cent to $1.79.\n\"Typically when the market rallies, people assume that means they should add to risk, the biggest risk-on trade is commodities stocks, as they have typically been associated with a rising market,\" Mr Carleton said.\n\"The Chinese market has bounced , the commodities stocks to some extent are following that move higher,\" he said.\nMr McCorquodale noted even traditionally defensive stocks such as healthcare had rallied with the market.\nCSL gained 3.1 per cent to $92.20, while Ramsay Healthcare rose 3.4 per cent to $63.04.\nThe banks all recorded gains for the day. Commonwealth Bank rose 1.3 per cent, Westpac added 2 per cent, ANZ Banking Group rose 0.9 per cent, while National Australia Bank gained 1.8 per cent.\n\"The banks have risen strongly, even with the speculation they may need to raise capital, it shows the market is broadly comfortable with their capital levels,\" he said.\nAll of the sectors were in the black for the day, with the materials sector the strongest, up 2.6 per cent, and industrials the weakest of all but still up 1.4 per cent.\nThere were some falls, with Bradken Group falling again on Tuesday, down 4 per cent, and Evolution Mining down 3 per cent.\nMr Carleton said the market wasn't out of the woods yet.\n\"I suspect the bigger issue for Australia is what's going on with China. The bigger question is whether there are any flow on effects from what is happening in the Chinese stock market to its economy,\" he said.\n\"A number of the issues that led to the magnitude of the correction have yet to be resolved,\" he said.\nMr McCorquodale said poor data from China and instability in its markets could impact on certainty, but he saw an upside from here on.\n\"Back when we almost hit 6000 in April, we started to see uncertainty from Europe come back again. I can see no reason then why it wouldn't head straight back up from here,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets-live/markets-live-asx-in-30b-relief-rally-20150714-gibl2g", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/VDesloires", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/110505490532745073834/posts"], "published": "2015-07-14T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:03:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
