Tamara Voninski Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Communications minister Malcolm Turnbull is yet to confirm his appearance on the ABC's Q&A program next week in the wake of Barnaby Joyce's abrupt withdrawal from Monday's show, citing a decree from Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\nThe Deputy Nationals leader told Fairfax Media through a spokesman that Mr Abbott did not want any frontbencher to appear on the program hours after saying he would appear.\nFormer SBS Managing Director, Shaun Brown and journalist, Ray Martin, were appointed to do an independent review of Q&A after former terror suspect Zaky Mallah was allowed to ask a question despite offensive tweets he had published about two female journalists.\nOn Monday, a spokesman for Mr Abbott confirmed Mr Joyce's withdrawal, saying the move was because of the new review.\n\"Given the ABC is undertaking an inquiry into Q&A, it isn't appropriate for Minister Joyce to appear tonight,\" he said.\nThe situation pushes Mr Turnbull into a tight corner. Despite accusing the program of \"undergraduate, tabloid journalism\", his previous statements indicate he does not support a boycott of the show.\n\"In due course I have no doubt that all of us will be appearing on ABC programs including Q&A in the future,\" he said in late June.\n'This is not Soviet Russia' The opposition seized on the pull out, saying Mr Abbott was creating a state of affairs reminiscent of 'Soviet Russia'.\n\"The leader of one political party told the deputy leader of another political party which TV programs he can appear on.\n\"This is an extraordinary situation. This is not soviet Russia or even modern day Korea this is a democracy,\" Shadow Minister for Agriculture Joel Fitzgibbon said.\nDefence Minister Kevin Andrews and parliamentary secretary Alan Tudge have also withdrawn from potential appearances.\nSocial Services Minister Scott Morrison said: \"I have no plans to go on Q&A. I haven't had since we've come to government\".\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott and Immigration Minister Peter Dutton have both called for \"heads to roll\" at the ABC following the broadcast.\nA Department of Communications inquiry into Mr Mallah's appearance was released on Friday.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-06T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:56:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
