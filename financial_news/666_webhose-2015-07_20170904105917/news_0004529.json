It offers excellent performance and reliability.\" \nA separate contract, also announced on Monday, saw Rolls chosen by aircraft leasing company International AirFinance Corporation to provide $930m worth of Trent700 engines for 20 A330 planes. \nEric Schulz, Rolls-Royce, president - Civil Large Engines, said: \"We welcome our customer's continued confidence in the Trent 700 as the best solution for fuel burn, emissions and noise performance as well as delivering unrivalled reliability for Middle East operations.\" \nNew Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East has faced tough challenges at the blue-chip engineering company since he started the job two weeks ago. \nIn his first week he told investors the company was downgrading profit guidance, driving share values down. \nFollow the Telegraph on LinkedIn.
