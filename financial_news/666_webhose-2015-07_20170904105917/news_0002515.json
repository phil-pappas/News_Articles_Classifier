It. On,” he is expected to say.\nMr Shorten wants to use the conference, his first as party leader, to reinforce his authority within the ALP and to present policies he hopes will impress the broader electorate.\nOn Saturday, he will see how the conference deals with his announcement that a Shorten government would use the Coalition tactic of turn-backs to keep asylum seekers out of Australian waters. The Opposition Leader wants to ensure the party platform is not changed in a way that would prevent him using the tactic.\nHe is certain to be attacked by Labor’s left but party sources believe he will survive by arguing his approach was a necessary acknowledgment of the flood of refugees globally. It would prevent a resurgence of the people-smuggling business likely if a Labor government stuck to present policies and would allow for a greater humanitarian intake.\nHis speech today will target climate change policy and the leadership on the issue of Mr Abbott.\n“If the world’s biggest capitalist nation and the world’s biggest planned economy can agree climate change is a priority, it’s time Australia did too,” he is expected to say, referring to the United States and China.\n“Mr Abbott’s society of flat-earthers talk a lot of nonsense about Labor policies — but they’re right about one thing. There is, absolutely, a clear-cut choice between Labor and the Liberals on renewable energy.\nLabor will attempt to portray Prime Minister Tony Abbott as out of touch. Picture: AAP Image/Dean Lewins Source: AAP\n“This Coalition government has done everything in their power to try and destroy Australia’s share in one of the world’s fastest growing industries.”\nMr Shorten wants Australians educated to get a slice of the renewable energy industry, which he believes will be worth $2.5 trillion in the Asia-Pacific by 2030, while people currently working in fossil fuel industries could be retrained.\nHe will repeat his aim to introduce a market-based scheme to add a cost to carbon pollution, but without a fixed price.\n“A Shorten Labor government will build an emissions trading scheme for Australia. And we will not be intimidated by ridiculous scare campaigns,” he is expected to say.\n“Let me say this to our opponents, in words of one syllable: An E-T-S is not a tax.”\nThe next election is not expected until its scheduled date late next year but Mr Shorten will urge his party to start campaigning for it now.\nHe will recognise there has not been a one-term federal government for 80 years, but will refer to Victorian and Queensland elections, where Coalition administrations were denied second terms, to call for the ditching of the Abbott Government.\n“Australia can’t afford another round of cuts and chaos,” he will say.\n“We can’t afford the destination the Liberals have in mind: We can’t afford more cuts to the pension, more attacks on Medicare, more cuts to schools, hospitals, veterans, carers, universities and TAFE.\n“Australia can’t afford the lesser future they want for us. Our country is bigger, better and braver than this.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Labor%26%238217%3Bs+big+threat+to+Tony+Abbott&c=BILL+Shorten+will+use+a+landmark+speech+today+taking+on+the+PM+over+one+key+issue%3A+%26%238220%3BI%26%238217%3Bve+got+a+three-word+slogan+for+him.+Bring.+It.+On.%26%238221%3B&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bill-shorten-to-paint-tony-abbott-as-out-of-touch-at-alp-national-conference/story-fn5tas5k-1227454716092?sv=61edbbcd75b27b47593e22753d64c081", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bill-shorten-to-paint-tony-abbott-as-out-of-touch-at-alp-national-conference/story-fn5tas5k-1227454716092?sv=61edbbcd75b27b47593e22753d64c081&title=Labor%26%238217%3Bs+big+threat+to+Tony+Abbott", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bill-shorten-to-paint-tony-abbott-as-out-of-touch-at-alp-national-conference/story-fn5tas5k-1227454716092?sv=61edbbcd75b27b47593e22753d64c081&h=Labor%26%238217%3Bs+big+threat+to+Tony+Abbott", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bill-shorten-to-paint-tony-abbott-as-out-of-touch-at-alp-national-conference/story-fn5tas5k-1227454716092?sv=61edbbcd75b27b47593e22753d64c081&title=Labor%26%238217%3Bs+big+threat+to+Tony+Abbott", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bill-shorten-to-paint-tony-abbott-as-out-of-touch-at-alp-national-conference/story-fn5tas5k-1227454716092?sv=61edbbcd75b27b47593e22753d64c081", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/bill-shorten-to-paint-tony-abbott-as-out-of-touch-at-alp-national-conference/story-fn5tas5k-1227454716092?sv=61edbbcd75b27b47593e22753d64c081"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:41:54.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
