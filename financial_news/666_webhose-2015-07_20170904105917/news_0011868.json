Single parents who work 16 hours a week will also qualify, but parents receiving tax credits will not. \nParents who currently receive employer-supported vouchers will be able to choose the existing system over the new one, as long as their employer continues to offer them, but cannot claim both. \nThe Pre-school Learning Alliance, which represents childcare providers, called for the government to use the period before the delayed rollout of tax-free childcare to address insufficient funding for the childcare sector. \n“Evidence has shown that it is supply-side funding that is vital not only for lowering costs for parents, but also for supporting providers to deliver high-quality early years provision,” said chief executive Neil Leitch. “[This is] a vital aspect of childcare policy that has been largely overlooked in the face of the government’s ‘back to work’ agenda.” \nResearch published last week by the Family and Childcare Trust (FCT) found that the majority (57 per cent) of local authorities in England — effectively the provider of last resort — have insufficient capacity to deliver childcare for working parents. \nFree childcare pledge needs full funding, experts warn \nGiving working parents more free childcare was a key Conservative manifesto pledge, reflecting Downing Street’s assessment that doubling free childcare provision to 30 hours a week for three- and four-year-olds is a policy that has both voter appeal and a solid economic rationale. \nContinue reading \nMost childcare is delivered by private and non-profit providers, but provision is patchy. According to the FCT, there are shortages of free places for three- and four-year-olds in 21 local authorities, despite a universal entitlement to 15 hours of free childcare a week at this age. \nIn areas where supply is tight, there is potential for the introduction of tax-free childcare simply to translate into higher prices, warned Jill Rutter, head of research and policy at the FCT. \n“Funding will be seen as extra money in parents’ pockets, [and] hard-pressed providers might see it as an opportunity to put up prices.” \nMs Rutter highlighted the example of Australia, where childcare costs more than doubled between 1997 and 2007 despite the government increasing demand-side subsidies from A$500m to A$3.3bn. \nWhen its childcare rebate for parents was extended from 30 per cent to over 50 per cent of costs in 2008, prices rose by more than 10 per cent that year, she added. \nGillian Paull, a senior associate at Frontier Economics, said it is always possible for the introduction of subsidies in any market to have the effect of pushing up prices. \n“If a market is perfectly competitive, competition would keep prices at their current levels, but if not those subsidies could lead to higher prices.” \nMs Paull added, however, “good evidence” of supply constraints in the UK childcare sector was limited. Anecdotal evidence of price rises could instead reflect improvements in the quality of supply, she added. Many nurseries are recruiting more qualified staff, for example. \nThere are industry concerns that the government’s pledge to double universal free childcare to 30 hours a week for three- and four-year-olds will lead to financial difficulties for providers. \nMost providers barely cover their costs in delivering the statutory 15 hours a week, but additional hours taken out by parents can compensate, according to Ms Rutter. Without policy changes, “the prospect of free 30 hours will reduce opportunities for cross-subsidisation,” she said.
