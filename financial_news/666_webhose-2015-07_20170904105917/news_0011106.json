They came just three weeks after he and the bank’s board unceremoniously dispensed with the services of chief executive Antony Jenkins . But the canny Scotsman knew what we was saying. The company numbers for the three months to the end of June, showing a pre-tax profit of £3.1bn , were entirely of Jenkins’ making, and McFarlane was not about to take credit for them. \nThere has already been much analysis of the events that led up to the departure of Jenkins from the bank, but none of it has painted McFarlane as callous or a man who takes credits for other achievements. And rightly so. \nThe former Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) chairman, who has taken on one of the toughest jobs in British banking is, deep down, a gentleman. Ruthless? Yes. Energetic beyond his 68 years? Certainly. A keen eye for detail? Clearly. But, at his core, he is a decent yet ambitious man who wants to transform Barclays into the best bank that it can possibly be. \nPrior to the events that led to Jenkins’s defenestration earlier this month, McFarlane is understood to have spoken to each of the bank’s non-executive directors. Not one of the 11 non-executives who sit around Barclays’ board table could tell McFarlane that Jenkins was the right chief executive for the task in hand. With that resounding message, Jenkins’s fate was sealed. \nJohn McFarlane \nWhile perfectly adequate, what the second-quarter results did show reflected in a relatively muted share price increase on Wednesday - was a bank treading water, which is far from where it should be. \nPutting aside the regulatory missteps and personnel changes that have got Barclays to where it is today, the speed of Jenkins’s attempts to revive the bank were just too slow. While he focused on the four core elements of Barclays retail and commercial, Barclaycard, investment banking, and Absa in South Africa as stand-alone businesses, what he should have been doing was maximising them together. \nUnder new management, that core is starting to shift slightly. McFarlane believes that the UK and South Africa are the bank’s two strongest weapons. But even in the UK, he feels there is more to be done whether it is keener mortgage pricing, or a greater focus on “customers”, a word he feels his 132,000 colleagues do not use almost nearly often enough. In both the UK and South Africa, he will attempt to inject what he calls a sense of “accelerated business as usual”. \nWhen it comes to the future shape of Barclays, although McFarlane did raise the question of whether the bank suffers from a “conglomerate discount” when speaking with investors on Wednesday, if anything, his aim is to bring the bank closer together. \nBarclaycard is a good example of how he might do this. While already a dominant force in the UK, McFarlane feels that it could do more in terms of cross-selling to Barclays’ personal and corporate customers. There are also geographic parts of its card empire where Barclays could improve significantly. \nAntony Jenkins \nIn the US the bank has a decent affinity card business, which some internally are believed to think could form the basis for a retail bank. While McFarlane is thought to be a little dismissive of such a major step, he is understood to want to grow that affinity business, and make much more of it. The same is true on the continent, where the bank’s card business in Portugal, which has a dominant position, could be used to leverage its relatively weak position in Spain. \nThe corporate bank provides another example. Barclays remains one of, if not, the dominant corporate banks in the UK. Given its interactions with major companies, it should be able to nurture an investment bank which is equally strong. Barclays’ investment bank is currently focused on the former Lehmans equities business in the US, and strong markets businesses in the US and London. In all other areas, it underachieves. \nThe trick for McFarlane and whoever he chooses as his chief executive a decision on which is expected by the turn of the year at the latest is to revive the investment bank to such a level that it generates strong returns, without overly expanding it. McFarlane is said to be under no illusion that Barclays can't compete with the Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) and JP Morgans of the world when it comes to investment banking, but he does think more can be made of it. \nDirection is key to what McFarlane wants to achieve and while much of what occurs will be an extension of the current strategy he will accelerate plans already in place for cost-cutting and weeding out duplication. But he, and his future chief executive, must also deliver a strong sense of what Barclays wants to be and how it wants to achieve it. Does it want to be a strong bank in two countries, with smaller offshoots elsewhere? Or does it want to be a strong international conglomerate, the sort of bank which many have tried in the past to deliver, and few have succeeded? \nMcFarlane’s aim in all this is to deliver a high-performing business by 2017 believed to be some two years ahead of what previous internal estimates had been projecting. If he can deliver, questions around the way in which Jenkins was dispensed with will be forgotten for good. If not, and Barclays is a beast which has tamed many a strong hunter in the past, then his assertive management style and quick-fire decision making may yet be called into question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T21:45:43.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
