But most investors can take a few steps in a few minutes and come away comfortable that they’re set for the rest of the year, no matter what the market dishes up.\nIn reality, the questions amount to a form of personalized “smart beta” investing, which is all the rage in the fund world right now. Smart-beta investment strategies emphasize the use of alternative index constructions and rules-based strategies to better manage risk and diversification. They’re about portfolios that rebalance automatically to target allocations, or that keep weightings in check so that no single market event blows up a portfolio.\nPutting that kind of thinking into play in your own portfolio involves following some of the same disciplines, so a mid-year check-up is precisely what the strategy calls for.\nUnless you expect to do better by making a switch, don’t let a short-term loss scare you out of a fund and off your asset allocation. For most people, five easy-to-answer questions are sufficiently smart for a mid-year review, so look at your investment portfolio and answer the following to ease your mind until the new year:\nDid anything lose too much?\nLosses make investors nervous, and for good reason, but a diversified portfolio always covers market sectors that aren’t going gangbusters.\nThe key here is to define how much downside you can bear, and for how long.\nLuckily this year, few asset classes are in negative territory. Morningstar, for example, tracks nine categories of U.S. equity funds and, through July 2, only the large-value fund is down this year, with an average loss of 0.54%. Among 15 categories of international stock funds, only Latin America funds have fallen (although the loss is more than 8%).\nLook beyond raw performance to examine relative results.\nResults may make you uneasy at times, but that’s OK, provided your fund isn’t lagging its peer group. The size of any downturn is not outside of your range of expectations.\nPrev Page 1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T02:13:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
