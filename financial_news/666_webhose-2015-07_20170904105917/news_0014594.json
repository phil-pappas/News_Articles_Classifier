It made an operating profit of 78.72 billion yen in the same period a year ago.\nDemand has grown so rapidly in the United States that Fuji Heavy has struggled to meet it. Fuji Heavy, the smallest of Japan's eight car makers, said U.S. sales rose 28 percent to 140,400 vehicles in the quarter, helped by demand for the Legacy sedan and Outback sport utility vehicle models.\nFuji Heavy has also benefited from a cheaper yen, which makes its exports more competitive and boosts the value of repatriated earnings. The company ships about 80 percent of its Japan-made vehicles overseas.\nCurrency gains added 50 billion yen to operating profit during the quarter, the firm said.\nFuji Heavy left its financial forecasts for the year ending March 2016 unchanged, expecting operating profit of 503 billion yen, up 19 percent.\n($1 = 123.9200 yen) (Reporting by Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T08:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T07:49:33.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
