M&S has 28 stores in Greece. M&S factlet: sales at Greek stores have been c60-70% of normal despite economic turmoil. 'That's quite remarkable,' said Bolland. — George MacDonald (@GeorgeMacD) July 7, 2015 \nWell, Greeks have still got to by underwear and Percy Pigs... 10.14 Pesky voters getting in the way of real politics \nMatthew Holehouse, our man on the front line of European bureaucracy, writes: \nParliament president Martin Schulz is asked by a journalist: \"Aren't you afraid that by accepting the Greek narrative of the referendum, it means that more and more populist politicians will use referendums as a political weapon in budgetary issues.\" \nSchulz replies that other MEPs have \"raised exactly that problem\". \n\"What will happen if there is a referendum in another country, putting in doubt a possible compromise with Greece? What will then happen? Therefore I think we are in a difficult situation.\" \nPesky voters, eh? Schulz: \"Grexit cannot be our aim\" \nMore on Schulz, president of the European Parliament, who is giving a press conference. \nHe said: \"I am in favour of Greece remaining in the euro zone,\" despite the fact that last Thursday he said that if there was a 'no' vote Greece cannot use the euro. (See previous post.) \n\"Those people who want to split up the euro zone I think are wrong,\" he said. \"My personal opinion is that Grexit cannot be our aim.\" \nIn response to a question from a reporter, Schulz said that he had never called for Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's resignation. \n\"I never called for the resignation of Mr Tsipras or the Greek government.\" \nHe also said that both sides need to move in negotiations. 09.56 Oops... Schulz caught in a flip flop over Grexit \nMatthew Holehouse, our man in Brussels, writes: \nMr Juncker tells the European Parliament he has been texting Tsipras from the chamber floor. He reels against \"demagogues and populists\". \nMartin Schulz, the European Parliament president, is asked if he regrets saying that Greeks cannot use the Euro if they vote no. \"I didn't say that,\" he snaps at a press conference. \nOh really? Because according to Reuters , he said: \n\"Is Greece still in the euro after this referendum? That is certainly the case, but if they say ‘no’ they will have to introduce another currency after the referendum because the euro is not available as a means of payment,\" Schulz told Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio in an interview broadcast on Sunday and taped on Thursday. 09.50 And what of Varoufakis? \nHe's been spotted hanging out in Athens, drinking and chilling out - while his former colleagues sweat it out to come up with a deal. \nThe Daily Mash also reports* that he has \"unveiled plans to ride around on his motorbike having martial arts battles with local villains\". \n*This is a joke. 09.32 Capital controls taking their toll \nRestrictions on payments abroad mean that there is difficulty importing goods to Greece - including pharmaceuticals. One pharmacist has listed all the medicines they are missing as a result of not being able to import them. #Athens pharmacist shows me list of medicine she's run out of due to capital controls #Greece #greferendum pic.twitter.com/N6D0yQfEd3 — Ilya Gridneff (@IlyaGridneff) July 7, 2015 Last pharmacist who wrote me a list of medicines he was short of was in Aleppo. https://t.co/4rXlxNucJm — Richard Spencer (@RichardJSpencer) July 7, 2015 \nLast week, Constantine Michalos, president of Athens Chamber of Commerce, said there could be “shortages on the shelves” by early next week and tourists could be left without “basics” including food and medicine. \nMeanwhile, Reuters reports that at least three large companies in Greece including its biggest electronic appliances chain have paid staff in cash. \nOne of these stores includes Kotsovolos, a unit of Britain's Dixons Carphone. \nA spokeswoman from Dixons said Kotsovolos paid staff in cash last week and was waiting to see what happens this week. \nTwo other big companies operating in Greece have also paid part or their wages in cash, while a third was considering offering its employees such an option for the next scheduled payment at the end of the month, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 09.23 Yo, Alexis: Juncker is texting Tsipras \nAfter being heckled in the European Parliament by MEPs, Juncker revealed that he was in text contact with Tsipras. \n\"Stop all this chatter about me looking at my telephone all the time. I am texting, as they say in Franglais, with the Greek prime minister,\" said a clearly irritated Juncker. \n\"I don't know if you will have the chance to do the same but I have to do that today. I am doing my work, so stop this stupid banter, for which there is no cause.\" \nI've just got hold of an exclusive screenshot of Juncker's message to Tsipras. 09.17 Greece is cutting itself off from the internet \nHere's a great piece from Mic on how methods of online payment in Greece are drying up. First PayPal, then the Apple App Store, iCloud and Dropbox. \nGreeks can't activate new iPhones because it relies on money going out of the country - via the internet. \nOne developer has created Zero Fund with money from tech investor Marc Andreessen. It is a proxy for transactions , for those Greek companies blocked by capital controls. 08.48 Christine Lagarde is staying at home - and there will be no debt relief on the table \nAlready signs are pointing to a rather unsuccessful Eurogroup meeting today. \nMehreen tweeted yesterday that head of the IMF Christine Lagarde will not be attending today's Eurogroup. Debt relief will not be on the table today. Lagarde is not attending Eurogroup — Mehreen (@MehreenKhn) July 7, 2015 \nThe FT's Lex column argues today that \"If debt relief had come earlier, the eurozone would not be facing this moment of truth at all\". \nIt is also one of the points on the statement of unity created by the Greek political parties yesterday - and a sticking point for both Greece and the IMF, which in last week's debt sustainability report stressed the importance of it in any new package. 08.37 Kathimerini: 16 of 18 eurozone countries want Grexit \nAccording to Greek newspaper Kathimerini , Grexit is beginning to sound like a good option for most of the eurozone. They write: \n\"According to sources in Brussels, 16 of the other 18 countries in the eurozone are in favor of letting Greece leave the eurozone and they will have to weigh up the cost of any agreement to keep Athens in the single currency.\" 08.34 Check-in with the markets \nAhead of today's Eurogroup meeting, the European markets have opened quite cautiously - Frankfurt's DAX gained 0.36 pc, and the CAC in Paris edged up 0.15 pc. London's FTSE 100 index rose 0.1 pc, but is now down slightly. 08.29 The mantle of the Pickelhaube \nOur economics reporter Szu Ping Chan has spotted a bizarre theme in all this: the Pickelhaube. #Greece Merkel wearing Pickelhaube in Bild with call for an \"Iron Chancellor\". They presented Draghi with one in 2012 pic.twitter.com/uJqZrepgTk — Szu Ping Chan (@szupingc) July 7, 2015 \nThe metal hat, used as armour by the Prussians and others, is now considered a sign of German imperialism. Just for fun, here's a picture of my favourite ever German Otto von Bismarck wearing one. What a moustache. \nSpeaking of Bild - the German daily has a solution to this Greek thing. It's a tad radical, however.
