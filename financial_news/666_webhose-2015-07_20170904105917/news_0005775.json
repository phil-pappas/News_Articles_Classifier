Near-term support is in the 1.0968-1.10 area (horizontal pivot, 23.6% Fibonacci expansion), with a break below that on a daily closing basis exposing the May 27 low at 1.0818. Alternatively, move back above the trend line, now at 1.1067, opens the door for a challenge of the June 29 high at 1. 1277. The available trading range is too narrow to justify entering a trade in line with our long-term Euro outlook from a risk/reward perspective. With that in mind, we will remain flat for now, waiting for price action to offer a more compelling opportunity down the road.
