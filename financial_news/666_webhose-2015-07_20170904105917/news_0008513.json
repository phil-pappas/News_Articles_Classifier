Still, American warned that a key revenue figure will decline in the third quarter, and the stock fell 7 per cent. Investors worry that cheaper fuel is tempting the airlines to grow too fast, leading to lower prices after five straight years in which air fares rose faster than inflation. American doesn't disclose average fares, but a key figure shows that passengers paid less per kilometre in the second quarter than they did before, and a top American executive said that trend could continue into the second half of next year. American's message to investors Friday was, don't be fixated on revenue per seat. \"Our largest cost has fallen 50 per cent\" since last year, said CEO Doug Parker. \"The revenues haven't fallen nearly as much as the costs have fallen, and as a result earnings are growing.\" American's fuel bill dropped by more than $US1 billion - a 37 per cent savings - compared with the same quarter last year. That helped American Airlines Group Inc. report net income of $US2.41 per share. Adjusted profit, which excludes one-time costs, was $US2.62 per share, topping the $US2.58-per-share forecast from nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue fell 5 per cent to $10.83 billion, a sharper drop than Wall Street expected. Seven analysts surveyed by Zacks had forecast $US10.93 billion. Shares of the Fort Worth-based company fell $US2.98, or 7 per cent, to close at $39.63. They began the day down 21 per cent in 2015 after more than doubling in 2014.
