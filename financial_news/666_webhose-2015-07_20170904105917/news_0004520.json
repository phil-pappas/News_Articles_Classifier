Mr Bandekar’s counsel told the Forum that the applicant’s car was stolen while he was returning from Shirdi. A man impersonating as a traffic police personnel intercepted him to check documents but decamped with his car, in January 2011. The insurance company rejected the claim saying that the claimant had orchestrated the theft in order to pocket the insurance sum. Mr Banderkar lodged a case with the police but the case was closed. Later, Mr Bandekar approached the Forum which observed that the insurance company had failed in providing services to the customer. The Forum also directed ICICI Lombard to pay an additional Rs10,000 towards legal expenses.
