Both Canaccord Genuity and Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) slashed the target price of the stock citing a disappointing performance by the AHL fund - which is down about 15pc since April. “The heightened volatility and directionless markets given the Greece crisis have produced conditions that are not conducive to AHL performance”, said Arun Melmane, of Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) . \nThe broker cut the FTSE 250 company’s price target to 143p, down from 180p, as analysts continued to see strong correlation between the performance of Man Group and its AHL fund. Citigroup had similar views, like Canaccord Genuity, it noted the group’s performance had pulled back sharply. \nHowever, on Wednesday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch encouraged investors to buy the stock, predicting “decent” half-year results. Philip Middleton, of BAML, said while Man’s near-term performance is “inevitably somewhat hostage to AHL’s fortunes”, in the longer-term, “the company is a well designed EPS machine”. \nIn May, chief executive Manny Roman issued a cautious outlook for half-year results , citing the potential negative outlook the uncertain macro environment could have on the demand for their products. The group, which is due to publish its half-year results on July 29, advanced 8.3p, or 5.9pc, to 148.1p. \nMeanwhile, in the broader markets, investors remained hopeful the Greek government would present meaningful proposals allowing it to reach a deal with its creditors. Andy McLevey, of Interactive Investor, was sceptical of such premature optimism. “We have been here before, and it remains to be seen if the stay of execution is merely delaying the inevitable 'Grexit’ or indeed agreement can be reached,” Mr McLevey warned. The FTSE 100 made gains of 1.4pc, or 90.93 points, to close at 6,581.63. * The price the Greeks are willing to pay to stay in the euro In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index rebounded, climbing by more than 5pc, after Chinese regulators stepped in to stop large shareholders selling stock . “For China, the immediate concerns are the stabilisation of the equity market. There seems to be little contagion into rates, though commodities have been caught in the crossfire,” Nick Lawson, of Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) , said. As China, the world’s biggest consumer of commodities, recovered, mining stocks rallied. Rio Tinto rose 1.8pc to £25.29 and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) inched 1.6pc higher to 859.2p. * The really worrying financial crisis is happening in China, not Greece In London, as investors fully digested the emergency summer budget overnight, housebuilders shot from laggard to leader in 24 hours. Housebuilders fell by an average of 5pc on Wednesday, after the Chancellor announced a reduction in the amount buy-to-let investors may be able to claim under mortgage interest deductibility rules . Gregor Kuglitsch, of UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) , argued “the share price reaction to the buy-to-let policy changes were overdone”. Indeed it appeared they were; as Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) bounced back finishing up 8.7p, or 4.9pc, to 184.9p, and Persimmon , which has little London exposure, edged 4.2pc higher to £19.54. \nMeanwhile, Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) , which sells 12pc of total volumes to buy-to-let investors, also recovered from Wednesday’s sharp fall, thanks to expectations of a higher rise in profit this year than previously forecast. The housebuilder said pre-tax profit should come in at around the £565m mark, well above the market consensus of £556m. Clyde Lewis, of Peel Hunt, warned that although there is still some build cost pressures, “it is being offset by house price inflation”. The stock was changing hands at 620.5p - up 4.4pc on the previous day. * Buy-to-let: How today's Budget will affect landlords Debenhams (Other OTC: DBHSF - news ) felt both the wrath of the Chancellor and UBS, plunging 4.2pc to 84.25p. The government’s decision to introduce a new national minimum wage for over-25s of £7.20, which will be introduced from April 2016 and increase to £9 by 2020, left retailers fearing paying out more in wages . Meanwhile, a bearish note from UBS saw the bank downgrade the stock from 'buy’ to 'neutral’. Adam Cochrane, of UBS, said the new minimum wage may see a £10m additional increase in costs for the retailer. * George Osborne's £9 per hour National Living Wage 'will attract more migrants to Britain' The decision of discount fashion retailer Primark to venture into the Italian market next year helped Associated British Foods (LSE: ABF.L - news ) add 149p, or 5.1pc, to its share price, closing at £30.80. In a trading statement, the FTSE 100 company said its earnings expectations for the year were unchanged. Primark is also due to open its first store in the United States in September. Darren Shirley, of Shore Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) , said he expects the stock to trade flat after yesterday’s update, but sees “scope for outperformance over the forthcoming couple of months as market excitement around the US store debut feeds into the share price”. \nSimilarly, Supergroup (Other OTC: SEPGY - news ) announced it was bringing its Superdry fashion brand to China in an attempt to expand its global presence, sending shares to the top of the FTSE 250 leaderboard - up 96p, or 7.7pc, to £13.37. \nMeanwhile, Drax Group (LSE: DRX.L - news ) finished in second place, recovering from Wednesday’s 28pc fall after the budget revealed clean power will no longer be exempt from a climate-change tax . The stock rose 7.3pc to 273.3p. Elsewhere, a couple of stocks were hit by trading ex-dividend. Next (Other OTC: NXGPF - news ) slipped 65p to £73.55 and Vedanta Resources (Other OTC: VDNRF - news ) was 15.5p, or 3.3pc, off at 455p. \nFinally, Aim-listed Market Tech , the owners of Camden Markets, was marginally lower at 245p after it announced it was placing up to 90m shares in an accelerated bookbuild as it prepares to progress to the London Stock Exchange’s main market.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T23:51:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
