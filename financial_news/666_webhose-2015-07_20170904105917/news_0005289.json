There was some risk aversion overnight.\"\nThe dollar index that gauges the greenback against a basket of currencies was up 0.3 percent at 97.595. It fell 0.71 percent on Tuesday, its biggest single-day fall since June 17, partly on poor U.S. company earnings results.\nNews home resales rose to a 8-1/2 year peak and propelled the greenback to session highs.\nWeaker commodity prices also supported a mild rebound in the dollar. Brent crude prices ended down 1.6 percent, while spot gold slid to a five-year low.\nThe British pound rose 0.25 percent to $1.5599. Against the euro, it gained 0.6 percent to 69.91 pence\nAccording to records from the Bank of England's July 8 meeting, several policymakers are moving towards voting for the first rate increase following BOE Governor Mark Carney's recent comments that a hike might happen around the end of year.\nThe notion of less monetary stimulus also bolstered the yen. On Tuesday, BoJ Governor Kuroda suggested no more quantitative easing would be needed given his view on inflation rising due to a tight labor market.\nThe yen slipped 0.2 percent versus the dollar at 124.07 yen , while the euro fell 0.2 percent at 135.28 yen.\nCommodity currencies, including the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollar, which have been hit by the dollar's rally in the past month, were still on the back foot.\nThe kiwi fell 0.7 percent to $0.6585, a shade above six-year lows set last week, with focus turning to a Thursday meeting of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand that is expected to cut interest rates at least a quarter point.
