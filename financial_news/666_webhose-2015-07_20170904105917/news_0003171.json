NZICA effectively held a statutory monopoly in New Zealand until 2012 when the newly established Financial Markets Authority accredited CPA Australia for auditing work under incoming legislation, which put it on a more equal footing with NZICA. \"NZICA was faced with a new environment and it had to respond to something it hadn't had to respond to before, and its response was a bit clumsy,\" Mr Gray said. \"This was an early days response to a new environment.\" CPA Australia claims NZICA defamed it in speeches at industry events and breached the Fair Trading Act in statements in flyers and advertisements, which included comparisons and allegedly misrepresented issues such as potential earnings, numbers of accountants, global reach and educational standards. CPA is seeking a declaration of defamation, but not a damages award, along with $NZ50,000 ($A45,189) for the Fair Trading Act breaches. Mr Gray said the context of Ms Patterson's speech needed to be kept in mind as it was more about NZICA needing to respond to new competition against a rival with more resources. Ms Patterson claimed that CPA Australia used iPad giveaways to lure members and that its advertising during prime time programming wasn't a good use of members' money. She also said the education pathways to gain a CPA designation weren't as difficult as NZICA's, and that is why it wasn't a member of the Global Accounting Alliance, like NZICA. CPA Australia has denied that, saying GAA only accepts one body per country, and NZICA's Australian counterpart had already taken that membership spot. Justice Robert Dobson said there had been no evidence of CPA Australia's own aggressive marketing, and while NZICA may have been clumsy, it sounded like the incumbent thought CPA Australia shouldn't be there. Responding to the defamation claim, Mr Gray said the speech was Ms Patterson's honest opinion based largely on true facts and was given in qualified privilege, meaning those listening had an interest in hearing from NZICA, but could also make their own minds up.
