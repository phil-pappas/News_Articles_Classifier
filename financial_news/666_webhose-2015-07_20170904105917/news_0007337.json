That’s more than 2 million a day less than the group’s 12 members pumped last month.\nOPEC raised its forecast for oil demand growth in 2015 to 1.28 million barrels a day and projected that global oil consumption would grow at higher rate next year, led by growth in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries.\nThe group, which pumps about a third of the world’s crude, said its total production rose in June by 283,000 barrels a day compared with May, to 31.38 million barrels, driven mainly by higher output from Iraq, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia.\nSaudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, told the cartel it produced 10.564 million barrels a day last month, up from 10.333 million barrels a day in May.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T15:16:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
