The company currently enables security in more than 150 million products a year and Sansa Security technology is deployed across a range of smart connected devices and enterprise systems. The deal complements the ARM security portfolio , including ARM ® TrustZone ® technology and SecurCore ® processor IP. Terms have not been disclosed. \n“Any connected device could be a target for a malicious attack so we must embed security at every potential attack point,” said Mike Muller, CTO, ARM. “Protection against hackers works best when it is multi-layered, so we are extending our security technology capability into hardware subsystems and trusted software. This means our partners will be able to license a comprehensive security suite from a single source.” \nSansa Security technology makes it easier for manufacturers to build secure products by offering a complete hardware subsystem that adds additional isolation of security operations from the main application processor. This is complemented by software components operating on top of trusted execution environments to perform security-sensitive operations. The acquisition builds upon ARM’s embedded TrustZone technology, creating extra protection against malware and malicious software. It is a system-wide approach that underpins security-related chipset and trusted software needs. This enables the protection of any connected device and management of sensitive data and content. \n“Our technology is already being used to protect data gathered and transmitted by a multitude of IoT and mobile devices,” said Coby Sella, CEO, Sansa Security. “Joining ARM will enable us to scale the business by helping ARM’s global technology partners to address their most pressing security needs. Aligning what we do with the world’s leading IP company, allows us to develop our products and capability to new levels.” Ends \nNotes to Editors \nSecurity forms one of the main pillars of ARM’s business. The company offers the world’s most comprehensive IP security portfolio for smart connected devices. The acquisition of Sansa Security is the latest in a series of acquisitions and product launches aimed at simplifying the development and deployment of secure connected devices. Other activity in the development of ARM’s IoT business during the last 12 months includes: June 1, 2015: Launched a IoT sub-system IP package to de-risk the design cycle for IoT chips April 16, 2015: Launched ARM Cordio ® , the IT industry’s first sub-one-volt self-contained radio block and related firmware to simplify radio deployment in IoT devices Feb. 24, 2015: Launch the ARM mbed ™ IoT starter kit to simplify the process of adding IoT capabilities and secure cloud connectivity for device manufacturers Feb. 9, 2015: Announced the acquisition of Offspark to integrate the world’s most pervasive embedded Transport Layer Security (TLS) solution in to the ARM mbed portfolio Oct. 1, 2014: Launched ARM mbed , a new software platform and free operating system to simplify and speed up the creation and deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) products. \nSansa Security is a world-leading provider of system-wide security operating from the silicon chipset level to provisioning security in the enterprise cloud. Its technology enables the creation of secure devices through hardware security IP that complements ARM TrustZone. The company’s trusted software security IP, running in TrustZone-based Trusted Execution Environments, also protects code and data assets. Sansa Security’s IP will be integrated in to ARM’s TrustZone and IoT portfolios. \nAbout ARM \nARM is at the heart of the world's most advanced digital products.
