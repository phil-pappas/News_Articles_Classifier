But victims could have been alerted had they checked an official database \nAn former trader who ran a five-year, £1m wine investment scam was jailed for eight years yesterday after promising investors huge returns on crates of non-existent fine bordeaux. \nSpyros Constantinos, 44, plundered the life savings of his unsuspecting victims, who included a vicar and a doctor, promising returns varying from 8.9pc to as much as 50pc. \nBut rather than investing in French vintages, the conman spent the money at Harrods, Selfridges and Hotel Chocolat and used it to pay private school fees and for family holidays to San Francisco. \n• Bankers, doctors and dentists most likely to fall for investment scams \n• Wine investing: will you end up with profits or plonk? \nThe scam was discovered as part of a clampdown on rogue wine traders, with several other investment companies having faced court in recent years. \nOne of his victims, Dr Norman Dearden, reported Constantinos to the police after he lost nearly £500,000 in the scam. Another investor was duped out of £250,000. \nDetectives found Dr Dearden's money had been used to fund the conman's lifestyle instead of buying any wine. \nBritish investors lose £1.2bn a year in investment scams, with wine investments, share sales, \"land banking\" and carbon credits proving popular among conmen, according to Action Fraud, the national body run by the police. \n= How the scam worked = \nConstantinos reeled in his victims with glossy brochures and set up a string of companies under different names in order to cover his tracks, the court heard. \nBut similar investment scams can be spotted by checking the company's official records and accounts via an official database. You can check if a company director has been disqualified or that the firm has genuine registration and VAT numbers at Companies House. \nConstantinos was disqualified from running a company for 10 years in 2008, after he was found guilty of running a fraudulent wine investment scheme. A search of the disqualified directors register would have warned investors of the ban. \nBut Constantinos managed to escape detection for so long by setting up a bank account in Spain to continue selling up investments. \n• The best investment of the 20th century? Red wine \n• Investing in wine: seven things you need to know \nThe father of two, from Earl's Court in west London, argued in court that he was running a legitimate investment service only to be let down by his supplier, but was found guilty at the Old Bailey of 10 offences relating to the fraud. \nWhile some of his victims apparently had no knowledge of fine wine, \"others were very seasoned\", according to Judge Paul Worsley, who heard the case. \n\"But such were your attractive allurements to them that all became entangled in your net,\" he said. \nConstantinos had been banned from running a company, but still managed to lure investors \nThe fine wine investment industry is notorious for attracting fraudsters as it is virtually unregulated and clients will not expect returns on their investments for years to come. \nMany wine funds are operated as so-called \"unregulated collective investment schemes\" or Ucis, a type of investment that, unlike normal funds, lack official rules designed to protect savers if a firm goes bust or is acting illegally. \nInvestors who buy into these schemes are unable to use the City regulator's compensation scheme or seek redress through the financial ombudsman. Around 75pc of investors end up losing money, according to figures from the Financial Conduct Authority, with money typically invested in property or commodities, including wine. \n>> Read more: Couple win back £190,000 after being mis-sold high-risk investments \nkate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:37:49.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
