Those who wait too long will see any gains eroded. \n= Buying opportunity = \nThe shares have drifted to a 12-month low after the possible takeover from US rival Pfizer (NYSE: PFE - news ) has gone away. \nThey are now trading on 15 times forecast earnings and offer a 4.4pc prospective dividend yield. \nAnalysts from Berenberg calculate that, once the market wakes up to the value of the new cancer drugs, the shares will be worth £52 each, which means gains of £11 per share. \nQuestor also likes getting paid £1.80 in dividends every year to wait.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T01:32:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
