Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters that the five-month package would cost $8 billion. He says it would be paid for with provisions that both Republicans and Democrats could support, though he declined to identify them. \n“I think we’ll be able to put together a package that is fairly innocuous, kind of boring stuff,” said Ryan, who chairs the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. \nCongressional Democrats have criticized Republicans for their inability to come up with a long-term solution for highway funding, something Democrats also struggled with when they had majorities in Congress. \n“We’ve had 33 extensions of the highway bill. It would be laughable if they offered another short-term extension,” Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said in an interview. “Let’s see what happens. Unless we have some pathway for a long-term highway bill I don’t see it happening.” Share this:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T08:49:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
