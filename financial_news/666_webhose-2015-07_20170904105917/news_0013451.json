Pat Scala Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Patrick Hatch Not everyone would pay $200 for a second-hand pair of sunglasses. But in the competitive bidding environment of Penny Lane Selling, a pair of shades from Melbourne label POMS is snapped up within an hour of being advertised.\nDozens of fashion items are bought and sold every day through the 4000-member Facebook group, with limited-edition pieces from local and independent designers often selling within minutes.\nIt's a rapidly proliferating new model of peer-to-peer e-commerce that is driven by small communities and is challenging established digital behemoths like eBay.\nPenny Lane's eponymous founder, a veterinary medicine student who dabbles in styling and modelling, started the group about 12 months ago as a fun way to trade clothes with her friends.\nIt is inevitable that Facebook will look to monetise trading groups, experts say. Michele Mossop From there it has only grown and would be even bigger, but Ms Lane, 26, has capped numbers and restricted new entrants to friends of existing members.\nMs Lane says that even though sellers could access millions of buyers on eBay, it was quicker and easier for them to sell to an exclusive group of trusted and like-minded buyers.\n\"When someone posts an item on the group, it can be a really highly sought-after item, and it can be within a couple of seconds that someone will buy it,\" she said.\n\"You've already got that market of people there just waiting, so for a seller it's quick, easy money.\n \"There's none of that selling it on eBay, having to wait for someone to pay, having to wait for an auction to end, and, there's no fees.\"\nMeanwhile, buyers in the group, mostly 20-something Melburnians, are attracted to the steady stream of pre-loved boutique clothes being offered at a fraction of the retail price, and feel the sense of community protects them from dishonest dealings.\nMs Lane isn't alone in carving out a highly specific and often hyper-local peer-to-peer marketplace, with thousands popping up all over the world.\nAnother Melbourne group for pot plants and garden clipping does a steady trade (succulents in pots, $10), while a Frankston-based page has seen $400,000 worth of used cars advertised in just the past week.\nThe popularity of these community-run groups stands in contrast to Facebook's Marketplace portal, a failed attempt to compete with eBay and Craigslist that it offloaded in 2009.\nThe social media giant, which 10 million Australians use daily, has taken notice of the new trend and in February rolled out features to improve the groups, including templates for posting items and categories to make browsing easier.\nSellers can now also request a \"recommendation\" from buyers, similar to the ratings system on eBay.\neBay is the biggest e-commerce player in Australia, controlling 20 per cent of the market and with turnover of $3 billion a year .\nOnline consumer behaviour expert Brent Coker says Facebook's moves to improve trading groups were a precursor to its inevitable monetisation of them.\n\"What they will likely do is offer the classic 'freemium' model for which they are well known: 'you can have this for free, but we've got some extra tools here to make it easier for you',\" Dr Coker, from the University of Melbourne's business school, said.\n\"Facebook have been full-on with their monetisation strategy since they IPO'd, so the days of building your communities for free and getting your follower to see your stuff for free are slowly disappearing.\"\nHe said the strategy would likely include a peer-to-peer payment system like eBay's PayPal, which escrows money to minimise risk for buyers and sellers.\nFacebook started giving some US users the ability to send friends money through its Messenger service in March, but there are no signs of a PayPal-style system for secure transactions between strangers.\nPenny Lane meanwhile predicted online trading groups would continue to grow in popularity, but offered a word of caution to Facebook.\n\"I think eventually Facebook is going to maybe take a percentage, and it's just going to be more and more regulated,\" she said.\n\"I wouldn't bother doing it anymore [if that happened], because it's not fairâ€¦ Facebook wasn't able to get these groups together; it was the communities.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/105822336186422025680", "https://twitter.com/pwhatch"], "published": "2015-07-02T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:16:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
