Edwina Pickles Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Rose Powell A high-profile group buying start-up that endured a rapid and spectacular collapse has been resurrected after buying its assets out of administration and launching a new company.\nAlphatise went into administration, managed by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, in March, just seven months after launching its group buying platform to the world and a few weeks after announcing plans to list on the Australian Securities Exchange.\nIt had raised $4.5 million from more than 100 private equity investors at the time, organised in trusts. Emails obtained by Fairfax Media reveal the relationship between the company's co-founder and chief executive Paul Pearson and a group of the investors became acrimonious.\nNow head of the freshly reminted Alphatise, Mr Pearson told Fairfax Media he had spent the months since March wracked with frustration about what happened to the start-up.\n\"I got into some really dark places in the last few months but we've learned a lot. We just want to put all that behind us now and get back to work,\" he said.\nAlphatise is an ecommerce site where groups of customers set the price they were willing to pay for items. Retailers then bid to fulfil the order. The founding team had been developing the platform for two years before it launched.\nDespite its short public life-span, Alphatise had become widely known among the start-up community and private equity investors after a concerted public relations campaign to build a core of customers, as well as investors.\n\"We had about 150 investors at one point, and I guess that's part of why it fell apart,\" Mr Pearson said.\n \"We went with private equity investors because the valuation they were willing to give was so much better than Australia's venture capital groups.\"\nAlphatise had a relatively high cash \"burn rate\" for a young company, which Mr Pearson defended as being in line with its valuation of more than $15 million.\nWhile Mr Pearson had always planned to list the company and said he had $6 million already committed to the float, he believed announcing the intention so early caused a cash-flow crunch, as private investors decided to wait for the IPO rather than be involved in a new round.\nWith so many stakeholders pursuing different agendas, Mr Pearson took the advice of one of his investors to put the company into administration to sort out the mess.\nBy offering some capital, along with the company's research and development tax return of almost $1 million, Mr Pearson was able to outbid other options to buy the assets and relaunch the business.\n\"The team is strong,\" he said. \"We've kept about 50 of our investors in the new company and the core product is built, so we've got so much time now to make it work, which is a great position to be in.\"\nA final creditor's report was released on Monday. The company intends to continue to build its Australian customer base and offering, while developing white-label services for larger markets, particularly the United States and China.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/110623698861133556711", "https://twitter.com/rosepowell"], "published": "2015-07-13T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:08:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
