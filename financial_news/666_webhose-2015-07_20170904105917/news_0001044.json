About 1.216 million credit requests were made to finance purchases of new vehicles, with the remainder for used vehicles, added Cetip, the nation's top seller of car loan liens and registrations.\nSales of new vehicles in Brazil fell 18.5 percent in the first half of the year from the same period in 2014, according to national automakers' association Anfavea, which expects the industry to face its worst downturn since 1998.\nBrazil's largest banks have reduced available lending for car buyers after a credit boom early in the decade led to soaring defaults and repossessions. Outstanding auto loans in Brazil's banking system fell to 176 billion reais ($56 billion) in May from about 195 billion at the end of 2013, according to central bank data.
