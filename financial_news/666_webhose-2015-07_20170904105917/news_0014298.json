The unit contributed 38 percent to SunOpta's total revenue in 2014.\nSunrise, with annual revenue of about $300 million, has retail and food service facilities in California, Kansas and Mexico.\nThe deal comes four months after SunOpta said it would buy a private organic and conventional orange juice supplier for $13.3 million.\nSunOpta, which has a market value of about C$915 million ($702 million), in May reported a 9 percent rise in first- quarter revenue, helped mainly by stronger demand in the United States and Europe.\nThe Sunrise deal is expected to add 10 cents to SunOpta's adjusted earnings per share in fiscal 2016.\nSunrise Chief Executive Ed Haft will lead SunOpta's frozen fruit operations after the closing of the deal, expected in the fall of 2015. All of Sunrise's existing employees will join SunOpta.\nCiti served as SunOpta's financial adviser. Faegre Baker Daniels LLP and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP were the company's legal advisers.\nBrampton, Ontario-based SunOpta's shares were up about 1.3 percent at C$13.62 at midday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The U.S. stock was up 1.4 percent at $10.45.\nUp to Thursday's close, SunOpta's Toronto stock had fallen 2 percent this year, while the Nasdaq-traded stock had risen nearly 13 percent.
