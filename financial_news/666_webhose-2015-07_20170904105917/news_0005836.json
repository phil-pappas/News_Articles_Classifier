This story originally appeared on LearnVest .\nThe year was 2013, and by all outward appearances, my husband, William, and I were living the good life in St. Louis.\nHe was finishing up his MBA and had an internship at a well-known consumer-products company that was sure to put him on the corporate fast track—all while running his own successful tutoring and test-prep business on the side.\nI was juggling getting my Ph.D. in reproductive epidemiology while also being a mom to our pride and joy, Desmond, then 2.\nBut during William’s last semester in the MBA program, our family took a life-altering trip to Spain as part of his study abroad offering. What was just supposed to be a three-month trip overseas turned into two years … and counting.\nSince then, we’ve lived and worked in five different countries, from Hungary to Peru—and have even added to our brood along the way.\nOur nomadic lifestyle may seem a bit unorthodox to some—family and friends were shocked when we told them we were selling all of our belongings to pack up and ship out—but we wouldn’t have it any other way.\nThe best part? It’s done wonders for our finances.\nPage 1 / 7 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.learnvest.com/2015/07/living-a-nomadic-life/"], "published": "2015-07-17T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:28:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
