In addition we have deployed security to these hotspots,\" Uber said.\nTaxi associations on Friday protested outside Uber's Johannesburg offices saying the personalised car service was ruining the economy with cut prices and mistreatment of its drivers.\nThe protests are the latest challenge for Uber, which has suffered strong opposition in Europe.\nUber, whose backers include investment bank Goldman Sachs and technology giant Google, suspended its UberPOP ride-hailing service in France last week after it faced sometimes violent protests.\nAn Italian court in May banned unlicensed car-sharing services, two months after a German court issued a similar ban and imposed stiff fines for violations of local transport laws.\nBorn out of the frustration of two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs trying to catch a cab in Paris, Uber's services have mushroomed since being launched in 2010 and are offered in nearly 270 cities worldwide. It is valued in excess of $40 billion.
