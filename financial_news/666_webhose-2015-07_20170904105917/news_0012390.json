Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! NEW DELHI: The department of financial services (DFS) is likely to back Kotak Mahindra Bank's proposal asking for a higher limit for foreign institutional investment (FII), a decision which could end the uncertainty over foreign investment in insurance. Earlier, guidelines regarding foreign investment issued by the insurance regulator, IRDA, after Parliament passed a law raising the limit in the sector to 49% from 26%, had created uncertainty as these rules seemed to suggest that the Indian partner could not be majority owned by overseas investors. Kotak Mahindra Bank has proposed raising the FII limit to 55% from around 49%. The proposal will be considered by the foreign investment promotion board on Friday. \"The methodology of determining direct and indirect foreign investment (in the parent company) therefore does not apply to the insurance sector which will continue to be governed by the relevant regulation,\" a senior finance ministry official told ET. He said consideration of Kotak's proposal had been deferred in the last meeting because of its possible implications for Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance Ltd , in which Kotak has a 74% stake. Under India's FDI policy, any downstream investment by a company majority owned or controlled by foreign investors is considered foreign investment. By that logic, once FII investment in Kotak Bank crosses 51% any downstream investment by it would be deemed to be foreign. Thus its entire 74% investment in the insurance venture could be considered foreign investment, which would violate the 49% limit. But the official said in the case of insurance this rule does not apply as the sector is governed by its own regulations. \"From our side we have no issue with the proposal as far as insurance venture is concerned. If other objections are raised then I cannot say,\" the official said, adding that FDI policy rules will not apply. \"That (applying the general FDI policy definition of foreign owned) will defeat the whole purpose of allowing foreign investment in insurance sector,\" the official said. He added that insurers such as HDFC Standard Life will also be allowed to raise foreign participation up to 49%. HDFC currently owns 74% in HDFC Standard Life and Standard Life is said to be looking to increase its stake in the firm from 26% to 35%. But the total foreign holding in HDFC is 79.84% leading to the problem described earlier. Kotak had sought an increase in FII limit after the RBI barred overseas investments in the bank as foreign shareholding in it hit the limit following the merger of Kotak and ING Vysya Bank . Investments from FIIs, FPIs and foreign banks came to 48.55% in the merged entity. Many insurance ventures were looking to raise foreign stakes to permissible 49%, but the latest guidelines issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) had created some doubts. The regulator had said insurance companies seeking higher foreign ownership should comply with norms that restrict such increase to only companies owned and controlled by Indians at the parent level. This would have made it difficult for most private bank promoted insurance ventures to raise foreign capital. \"Every insurer being an Indian insurance company and who have already been granted certificate of registration for carrying on insurance business in India shall ensure the compliance of Indian owned and controlled as specified in Section 2(7A) of the Act within six months from the date of notification of these regulations,\" Irda said in a circular.
