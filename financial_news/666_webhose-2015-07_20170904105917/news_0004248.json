Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Friday took a shot at Scott Brown, the Republican she defeated to win her Senate seat in 2012. \nWarren told those gathered for the Netroots Nation convention that there has been incredible change in the country over the last five years. \n“So much change. So much progress,” she said. “Comprehensive healthcare reform. Confederate flags taken down everywhere. Oh, and here's one. The guy who was senator from Massachusetts five years ago now sends around shirtless pictures of himself and sells diet pills. Seriously, look it up.” \nWarren was alluding to a Daily Beast report earlier this month that Brown was helping to promote the weight-loss pills AdvoCare. \nAdvoCare had sent a mass email with a shirtless picture of Brown to promote the pills. \n“I am not a paid spokesman for Advocare, and I have not received any payment from Advocare,\" Brown wrote in a Facebook post responding to the reports. \"My only intent was, and continues to be, letting folks know what I've been up to. I don't want to sell anything. I'm excited at what the product has done for ME. That's all.” \nWarren also jabbed at Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate. \nPalin had posted an online video rebutting Warren's keynote speech at the conference last year. \n“Last year, I came to Netroots to talk about what we believe in. Immigration reform was high on the list, along with equal pay for equal work, raising the minimum wage, Social Security, climate, marriage equality, Wall Street reform,” Warren said. \n“OK, it was a long list. But if you weren’t with us in Detroit — don’t worry — Sarah Palin did a fascinating line-by-line analysis of the whole thing on YouTube. Deep.” Tags: Past: 1 day Wanna bet? Trump makes wager after...
