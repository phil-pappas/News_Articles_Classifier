Peter Rae by Adele Ferguson and Sarah Danckert Litany of wrongdoing at IOOF IOOF chief executive Chris Kelaher has told a senate hearing into misconduct in the financial services sector the company never reported a senior staff member suspected of repeated front running over a six year period nor an insider trader to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\nMr Kelaher confirmed IOOF investigated its head of advice research Peter Hilton in 2009 and again in December 2014 for front running through a relative's account and another staff member, Edward Youds, for insider trading but determined neither man had broken the law.\n\"It's a breach of Chinese Walls,\" Mr Kelaher said referring to Mr Youds' allegedly suspicious trade and Mr Hilton's alleged front running.\nHe repeatedly said a company had no obligation to report a suspicion of front running or insider trading.\nASIC regulatory guide 238 states a company must report a suspicion of either front running or insider trading.\nMr Kelaher said IOOF told ASIC of the allegations only days after they were revealed by Fairfax Media.\n\"This kind of behaviour is actually alien to our company,\" Mr Kelaher said.\n Wilting under heavy questioning from Senator Sam Dastyari, Senator John Williams and Senator Sean Edwards, Mr Kelaher had trouble recalling when he first became aware of a complaint filed by a staff member in December 2014, first saying he learned of the complaint in the past week before correcting his recollection.\n'Whitewash' Mr Kelaher was also unsure of whether his compliance staff had made him aware the company had brought in PwC to conduct the review of the December 2014 front running allegation: \"I'd have to check my recollection.\"\nIOOF has called in PwC to review allegations of misconduct in the firm on three occasions in the last 18 months, including in the past few weeks.\nSenator Dastyari put PwC on notice that the senate economics committee would consider calling the partner in charge of the reviews.\n\"It reeks of a whitewash,\" Mr Dastyari said.\nMr Kelaher also refused to be drawn by Senator Dastyari on whether IOOF was in crisis mode.\n\"Let's not pussy-foot around this, a 16 per cent share price drop in the shares of your company surely must be a concern to you,\" Senator Dastyari asked .\n\"The market goes up and the market goes down,\" Mr Kelaher responded.\nHis comments at the hearing follow revelations by Fairfax Media that senior staff at IOOF engaged in serious misconduct including insider trading, claims of front-running, misrepresentation of performance figures, and junior staff asked to cheat on training and compliance modules on behalf of their boss.\nMr Hilton is at the centre of allegations getting staff to cheat on compliance and training modules on his behalf and an internal investigation into possible front running on behalf of a relative.\nInternal documents seen by Fairfax Media show Mr Hilton received a final warning in 2009 and then another final warning in mid 2014 for a password breach. His responsible manager status was revoked after an internal investigation found he had instructed direct reports to complete his Kaplan and compulsory e-training modules. An action plan also revealed IOOF misrepresented performance figures.\nResponding to questions from Senator Williams, Mr Kelaher admitted Mr Hilton had received two final warnings. \"How many final warnings can you get before you are terminated?\" Mr Williams asked incredulously.\nMr Kelaher was also asked about his relationship with a fund manager who published a glowing report on IOOF attacking the reporting in Fairfax Media this week by Senator Edwards.\n\"He's an acquaintance,\" Mr Kelaher said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:06:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
