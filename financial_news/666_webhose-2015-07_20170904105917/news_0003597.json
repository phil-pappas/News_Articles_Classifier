In contrast, energy prices stabilized, lowering the oil sector’s volatility, according to a report released today by Axioma, Inc. This Smart News Release features multimedia.

As stock prices rose, and then fell precipitously, China’s volatility forecasts jumped. Factor returns in China also reflected the volatility in the overall market, and correlations between factors changed dramatically, posing special challenges for managers using risk models, over and above those created from the startling drop in stock prices. \n“The turmoil in China quickly spilled over to Asia and Emerging Markets, though Japan was relatively unruffled,” said Brown. \nUS stocks were more stable, with NASDAQ hitting a record close toward the end of the quarter. While investors had expected the Fed to increase rates and valuations edged higher, positive economic news and more stable oil prices kept volatility down. \nWhile asset-asset correlations between European stocks and Asian stocks rose, reflecting the common themes driving them, correlations in the US fell, meaning that stocks were likely to have moved more on their own merit rather than based on an overarching economic theme. As an indication of the relative calm: volatility for small-cap US stocks fell below that of their larger-cap counterparts. \n“Despite the agreement reached between Greece and its creditors after the end of the quarter, uncertainties about that market and others remain,” said Brown. “So we expect volatility in Europe and Asia to remain at these levels for the time being, rather than retreat back down to recent low levels.” \nThe Axioma Quarterly Risk Report provides topline measures of risk for each of nine markets, as well as an analysis of the underlying components and drivers of risk in those markets. The report covers Asia Pacific Ex-Japan, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Emerging Markets, Europe, Global Developed and US.
