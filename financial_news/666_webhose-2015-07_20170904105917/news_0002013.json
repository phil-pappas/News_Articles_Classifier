He will join Metcash on August 1 and will have responsibility for IGA's efforts to regain market share and lift profitability in the face of intense competition from Coles, Woolworths and Aldi. \"I look forward to working with the supermarkets team, suppliers and independent retailers to provide a more compelling customer offer in what is an increasingly competitive environment,\" he said in a statement. Mr Hewlett previously worked for Aldi and Lidl in the UK before joining Woolworths to lead the development of its convenience business. He will start work with Metcash on August 12 in the role of executive general manager, new channels. \"I am really looking forward to joining Metcash and supporting successful independents,\" he said in a statement. \"The business has great distribution capability on which to build new models.\" ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/former-coles-executive-joins-metcash/story-e6frfkur-1227445324991?sv=4c758ce63d702f81c14ba101a73887e4", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/former-coles-executive-joins-metcash/story-e6frfkur-1227445324991?sv=4c758ce63d702f81c14ba101a73887e4", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/former-coles-executive-joins-metcash/story-e6frfkur-1227445324991?sv=4c758ce63d702f81c14ba101a73887e4&title=Metcash+hires+former+Coles%2C+Woolies+execs", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Metcash+hires+former+Coles%2C+Woolies+execs&c=THE+owner+of+the+IGA+brand%2C+Metcash%2C+has+appointed+former+Coles+and+Woolworths+executives+to+senior+roles.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/former-coles-executive-joins-metcash/story-e6frfkur-1227445324991?sv=4c758ce63d702f81c14ba101a73887e4", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/former-coles-executive-joins-metcash/story-e6frfkur-1227445324991?sv=4c758ce63d702f81c14ba101a73887e4&h=Metcash+hires+former+Coles%2C+Woolies+execs", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/former-coles-executive-joins-metcash/story-e6frfkur-1227445324991?sv=4c758ce63d702f81c14ba101a73887e4&title=Metcash+hires+former+Coles%2C+Woolies+execs"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T16:21:07.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
