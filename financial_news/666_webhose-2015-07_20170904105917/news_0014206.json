By Nicole Blackmore | Telegraph – 2 hours 6 minutes ago Print \nAsk an expert: We help a widow calculate his tax-free allowance under the new inheritance tax rules \nThe total inheritance tax (IHT) threshold for those who own a family home will increase from April 2017 until it reaches £500,000 in 2020. This means that married couples and civil partners will be able to pass on assets worth up to £1m, including a family home, without paying any IHT. \nBudget 2015: How inheritance tax changes affect you \nBut the mechanics of the new rules are complicated and Telegraph Money has been inundated with questions from readers about how they will apply in practice. \nHere, tax experts from accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg provide answers. \n--- \nI have a house worth £750,000 and other property worth £750,000. I currently have a £650,000 IHT allowance available to me and I intend to leave the house to my daughter. In 2020 I will be entitled to the full family home allowance. Your calculations suggest I may expect a tax bill of £200,000. Is this correct? \nAnother paper has suggested otherwise. It stated that my family home allowance would be restricted to the difference between £650,000 and the value of the property. ie £100,000. I’m confused. Can you please help? BC, via email \nThe draft legislation states that the family home allowance is in addition to the regular nil rate band, so provided the value of the main residence in the estate is sufficient to make use of the available family home allowance (and the total estate value does not exceed £2m), the relief should not be restricted. This is how the £1m nil rate band is eventually made a reality, from 2020. \nYour calculation is therefore correct on the basis that you have already been widowed. Were you to pass away from the tax year 2020-21 when the available family home allowance is £175,000 this, plus 100pc transferable from your wife, could be offset against the value of your house. Your regular nil rate band of £325,000 (plus 100pc transferable from your spouse) could be offset against the balance of your estate, leaving chargeable assets of £500,000 and potentially generating an IHT bill of £200,000. \nGot a question for our experts?
