In fact, the saving rate was over 7% in 1995 and a stunning 17% in May 1975. How can we pump it back up?\nMore specifically, what can be done to encourage more low- and middle-income people to save? I don’t mean just for retirement, either. I mean emergency savings for urgent, steep, unforeseen expenses, too: 25% of Americans have no emergency savings and 67% have a rainy day fund equal to less than six months’ expenses, according to Bankrate.com.\nOne answer may be: Offer prizes.\nThat may sound a bit nutty, but some sharp savings analysts don’t think so. And a new federal law will see if they’re right.\n( MORE: Time for a Hands-Off 401(k)? )\n“ Prized-linked savings ” — an example of gamification — was just one of several intriguing ideas discussed at the webinar panel I watched Tuesday, Starting to Save: Innovations for Working America , from the Bipartisan Policy Center and the Center for Financial Services Innovation think tanks.\nThe New Law Offering Savers Prizes\nThat’s where I heard about The American Savings Promotion Act , a little-known law Congress passed in late 2014 that lets banks and credit unions offer customers cash-prize savings lotteries and raffles.\n“We need to help people save money. When you don’t have savings, it makes it a lot harder to weather the storms,” said Rep. Derek Kilmer, (D-Wash.), a co-sponsor of the law, at the savings panel. “Too often, savings is looked at as a chore.”\nIn states where prized-linked savings have been permitted, Kilmer said, “we’ve seen success with people opening accounts who never had one before and saving more than they would otherwise.”\nIt’s true.\nBetween 2009 and 2013, 50,076 people — mostly “financially vulnerable” — signed up for Save to Win programs permitted at 62 credit unions in Michigan, Nebraska, North Carolina and Washington and designed by the nonprofit Doorways to Dreams Fund , a group working to boost financial security. Each earned a raffle ticket for every savings deposit of $25, offering them a chance to win monthly prizes of up to $3,750 or annual prizes of as much as $10,000.\nThe Save to Win customers salted away more than $94 million; $921 to $2,662 per account, on average.\nThose impressive numbers helped inspire the new federal law.\n( MORE: 4 Ways to Jumpstart Your Retirement Savings )\n“One of the advantages of using prizes in connection with savings is that usually there’s a bargain with savings: do it today and you’ll be in a better position tomorrow,” said panelist Tim Flacke, executive director of Doorway to Dreams Fund. “For all of us, that’s a tough sell. But when you say: Put a dollar away and at the end of the month or year there’s a chance for something good to happen, you start to mess with the sense of delayed gratification.”\nAs the $70 billion spent each year on lottery tickets shows, an element of surprise is, as Flacke says, “a very powerful form of entertainment.”\nNow that all banks and credit unions have the ability to offer cash prizes to savers (much better than a toaster, if you ask me), it’ll be interesting to see how many ramp up prize-linked savings programs.\nA Split 401(k) for Emergencies and Retirement\nPanelist David John , deputy director of the Retirement Security Project at the Brookings Institution think tank, offered another intriguing idea to get people (especially ones with low- and moderate incomes) to save: a split 401(k).\nJohn is concerned about Americans’ lack of emergency savings and thinks split 401(k)s would help: These automatic-enrollment plans would let workers stuff a portion of their pay into federally insured passbook-like savings funds with penalty-free withdrawals and also put away cash for retirement, with the standard hands-off rules. They’d also help prevent employees from pulling money out of their 401(k)s for reasons other than retirement.\n“We need an approach that allows for a wide variety of savings for different purposes,” John said. His idea resembles one I wrote about previously on Next Avenue, from six retirement experts at Harvard, Yale and Cambridge. That one described the split 401(k) as having a Freedom account and a Savers account.\n“I don’t see this as counter to prize-linked savings,” said John. “I see it as a complementary approach.”\nAt the webinar panel, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging , said she thinks the split 401(k) idea is “ingenious and very much worthy of consideration.” (Props to her for revealing that “in my youth, I made a colossal error of withdrawing all the money in my federal pension plan to buy a car.”) Collins said if she’d had a split 401(k), “I don’t think I would have made such an ill-advised decision.”\nPutting the Savers Tax Credit on the EZ Form\nCollins also spoke about a bill she’s pushing that would let taxpayers using the 1040-EZ short form claim the Savers Tax Credit. Absurdly, even though that credit is targeted to low- and middle-income taxpayers, you can’t take it with the EZ. “It makes no sense,” said Collins. Fellow panelist Jason Fichtner, a senior research fellow at George Mason University, also favored the EZ idea.\nPersonally, I think the prize-linked savings, split 401(k) plan and revamped 1040-EZ ideas are worth trying. And I’m hoping states pick up on the Obama administration’s announcement at the White House Conference on Aging Monday to create programs allowing all their employed residents to save money through payroll deduction even if their employers don’t offer retirement plans.\nCollins told the webinar watchers: “There will be a tsunami of retirees who are going to lack funds for a comfortable retirement.” Maybe cash prizes, split 401(k)s and other innovative ideas can turn that tsunami to just a capillary wave.\nRichard Eisenberg is the senior Web editor of the Money & Security and Work & Purpose channels of Next Avenue and Assistant Managing Editor for the site and a contributor to Forbes.
