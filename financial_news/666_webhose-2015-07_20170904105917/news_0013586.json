Prospective buyers haven’t yet been invited to make offers, they said.\nPrivate equity firm TPG Capital is the company’s largest shareholder, with a stake of more than 21 percent. Parkway’s shares have dropped 15 percent in the past year. It isn’t clear if a sale of the business would attract interest from other REITs or a buyout firm, one of the people said.\nA spokesman for Parkway didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment, while spokesmen for TPG and Bank of America declined to comment. A representative for Wells Fargo didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMost REITs are publicly traded companies that own and operate property including apartments, offices, retail, self-storage facilities and hotels. By law, they must pay out at least 90 percent of taxable earnings to shareholders annually as dividends.\nOn Wednesday, Chambers Street Properties agreed to buy Gramercy Property Trust Inc. in an all-stock deal that will create a REIT with an expected enterprise value of about $5.7 billion.
