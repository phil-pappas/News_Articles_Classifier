Turnover was $206 million. The benchmark index climbed out of its morning slump after Asian markets opened better than expected. International markets have been spooked by a sharp correction on China's stock exchange. \"This morning volumes were very light and it actually felt as though there was a little panic selling from retail investors in the market - it was get-me-out-type selling as opposed to anything else,\" said Matthew Goodson, managing director of Salt Funds Management. \"All markets rebounded early-mid afternoon when Asian markets opened a little better. The Shanghai market is still up 70 to 80 per cent over the last 12 months.\" Mr Goodson said investors were also still worried about the unfolding Greece debt crisis. Kathmandu Holdings, the outdoor goods retailer facing a takeover by Briscoe Group, led the benchmark index lower, down 4.3 per cent to $1.56. Discount retailer Warehouse fell 2.6 per cent to $2.65 and Restaurant Brands, the country's largest fast-food operator, declined 2.6 per cent to $4.15. Fletcher Building closed 0.8 per cent higher at $7.94, recovering from an intraday drop to a two-and-a-half-year low of $7.72. Pacific Edge was the best performer on the benchmark index up 3.1 per cent to 66 cents.
