Harper's Conservatives are trailing in the polls to the left-leaning opposition.\nHarper repeated that target on Friday, two days after a Parliamentary watchdog forecast the country would run a deficit this fiscal year.\nThe finance minister's spokesman said the latest budget included room to account for global weakness.\nThe new law lets governments run deficits during recessions or extraordinary situation, but it imposes consequences. Operating spending and salaries for ministers and some bureaucrats are frozen after the economic recovery begins.\nIf a deficit is run in normal times, operating budgets would be frozen immediately and ministers would see their salaries cut 5 percent.\nStill, Askari said a government that projected a surplus could slip into deficit during the year and not trigger consequences, as long as the books are balanced when it releases its next budget. The recession can also have occurred, be occurring or forecast at the time the budget is tabled, according to the legislation.\nThe legislation can also be changed or suspended by Parliament. Many Canadian provinces were forced to suspend their balanced budget legislation following the financial crisis.\nBut politics may trump economics, said University of Manitoba professor Wayne Simpson, who has studied provincial balanced budget legislation.\n\"Bad economic policy never inhibited what people consider good politics,\" said Simpson. \"It's a popular thing to indicate that you're serious about being financially responsible ... and balanced budget legislation seems a way of sending that (signal).\" (Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and James Dalgleish )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T00:50:55.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
