University of Sydney/Matthew Vasilescu Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Tim Dodd Women make up a majority of new MBA students at the University of Sydney this semester, claimed to be the first time females have dominated the MBA intake of an Australian business school.\n\"It is common practice to see gender equality as a laudable goal but something that can only be achieved in the long-term,\" said the University of Sydney Business School dean, Greg Whitwell.\n\"Our MBA is only two years old and we have already achieved the rare distinction of having more women than men entering the program.\"\nThe school believes it is the only business school in Australia, and one of the first in the world, to reach gender balance in an MBA student intake. The cohort commencing their MBA at the University of Sydney Business School this semester is made up of 23 women and 22 men. The school takes up to 50 MBA students in each intake.\nThe school's MBA director, Guy Ford, said that, until now, the MBA program was typically about 40 per cent women and 60 per cent men, although the proportion of women had been gradually improving in each semester. But although the school has achieved balance in one MBA intake, men still dominate the overall MBA student numbers at the University of Sydney\nProfessor Ford said it was important to the business school to have diversity in the MBA, with not only gender balance but also a range of backgrounds and skills among students. Currently, MBA programs in Australia overall have only about one-third female participants and Professor Ford said he thought many women believed MBA programs were dominated by \"alpha males\" and focused on technical skills such as accounting, finance and operations management.\n\"We have tackled these stereotypes by striking a balance between personal, interpersonal and technical skill development and by focusing on experiential learning with regular and ongoing feedback on the student's specific leadership skills and competencies,\" he said.\nBoosting scholarships Like other business schools, the University of Sydney Business School has boosted numbers of women MBA students with scholarships. The Australian National Committee for UN Women school awarded a full scholarship to a woman student for an MBA at the University of Sydney, and this year's winner, Kim Johnstone, is part of this MBA intake.\nDr Johnstone, the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment's principal demographer, is currently vice-president of the Family Planning Association of NSW and the Australian Population Association.\n\"I am expecting the MBA to give me the tools to apply my experience across a range of sectors in Australia and the Pacific,\" she said.\nAdditionally the business school awarded four part MBA scholarships, each worth $10,000, to other finalists in the UN scholarships.\n\"The scholarships have been important to those women who have taken time off work and had a drop in income,\" Professor Ford said.\nOther business schools are also working hard to increase the number of women doing MBAs. Macquarie Graduate School of Management earlier this year launched its Women in MBA program which aims to provide MBA scholarships for 100 women, with most of the scholarships covering the full tuition cost of the degree", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TimDoddAFR", "https://plus.google.com/+TimDoddSydney"], "published": "2015-07-05T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:09:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
