When the Teletubbies craze crossed the Atlantic, massive tubby icons adorned the side of its flagship store in Fifth Avenue. It had a floor piano big enough for Tom Hanks to play Chopsticks with his feet in the 1980s’ comedy Big. \nThese were typical larger than life gestures by a retailer which transcended the gap between store and much loved institution during its 145-year existence in Manhattan. But last week the shop shut the doors of its home in Fifth Avenue. \nThe lease was not due to expire until 2017. But Toys R Us, the retail behemoth, which has owned FAO Schwarz since 2009, decided to pull the plug early . It was a hard-headed decision by the world’s largest specialist toy retailer, whose prime investors include two leading private equity houses, KKR and Bain Capital. \nThe statement explaining the decision was a model of corporate communication, raising more questions than it answered. \nF.A.O. Schwarz has been in Manhattan for 145 years (Getty Images) \n“For the past several years, Toys R Us has been reviewing its lease renewal options for the FAO Schwarz Fifth Avenue location and one of these options was to not renew the lease agreement, which the company has decided to do. \n“In working with the property owner, the company was able to agree on an early exit in advance of the 2017 lease expiration, providing the opportunity to realise meaningful rent savings. \n“The decision to vacate this space is due to the continuing rising costs of operating a retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City.” \nBy way of solace for the millions of people who flock to the store to hug outsize plush toys and be greeted by mock guardsmen, it added that it was “actively searching” for another location somewhere in Manhattan. \nThough exactly when it will open its doors again has not been made public. \nRents for retail space in that stretch of Manhattan, which has been home to FAO Schwarz nearly 30 years, are the most expensive in the city. \nAccording to a study by CBRE, landlords are demanding $3,617 (£2,334) a square foot, a rise of 3.3pc on the same time last year. \nEven (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) moving to Times Square, about a 20-minute walk away, would save more than a third, assuming a suitable site could be found. \nIn truth the store has had a rather nomadic existence since it was founded by Frederich August Otto Schwarz as Toy Bazaar in Baltimore in 1862. \nIt arrived in New York City in 1870 and has shuttled around Manhattan over the years. At one point it was based on E14th Street, before moving slowly up town via W 23rd Street, eventually arriving at its prime location on 5th Avenue and 58th Street in 1986. \nStores close all the time and other venerable Manhattan institutions have gone, such as B Altman and Company, a “fine goods store” which operated from a splendid Renaissance inspired building on Fifth Avenue from 1906 to 1989. \nBut somehow FAO Schwarz pulling out of Fifth Avenue and shutting its last premises in Manhattan heralds something more significant than just a property deal. \nTo some it feels like the ending of an era, the disappearance of an iconic store which has been a must-see destination for tourists and a treasure trove for generations of New York children. \n“My earliest memory of FAO Schwarz was looking at the catalogue and picking out what I wanted for Christmas from Santa,” said John Stern, 73. “It was really unique. Now (NYSE: DNOW - news ) it is just more evidence of corporate America dumbing everything down and getting rid of the independent stores.” \nApple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) 's Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan (Alamy) \nOne of the clues to FAO Schwarz’s demise is right on its doorstep, Apple’s flagship store. \nIn fact Apple will move into the space FAO Schwarz vacates while its own premises undergo a major facelift. It is a sign of the times. “There is a plethora of digital devices which are competing with toys,” says Rita McGrath, a professor of management at Columbia Business School in New York. \nIt was just one of a number of problems which the store has had to face. “There has been an hourglass effect on the market. \n“People are spending a lot at the top and at the bottom, but the middle end of the market has just hollowed out, that space has just eroded away.” \nEven the store itself, a wonderland of fun, is a problem. “Kids are going into the store and having a great time. But they are not paying for it, their enjoyment is not translating into revenue.” \nThere is also a cultural difference between FAO Schwarz and its corporate parent, a company which believes in piling goods high and getting them out of the door. \nGiven the gimlet-eyed approach to profit taken by the company’s equity partners, she questions whether there is even the will to stump up the funds to do something imaginative with the space. \nBut even if it could, some argue FAO Schwarz is facing the corporate equivalent of the task of Sisyphus who, according to Greek mythology, was condemned in perpetuity to roll a huge stone up a hill only for it to roll down again as he neared the top. \n“Over the past decade the way in which people have shopped for toys has changed drastically,” said Robert Gregory, the global research director of Planet Retail, a leading consultancy. \n“Going back 10 to 15 years, going into a store to see the latest releases was quite an experience. \n“But now most parents hate buying toys. It is really a bad experience having to drag your kids around the store. \n“Stores are not good places to go, especially with all the heavy security. Even Toys R Us is suffering. \n“The only advantages stores had was that you could pick the stuff up. Once you are shopping online with Amazon or Walmart, it just comes down to price.” \nEven when the store has gone, the FAO Schwarz brand will remain but online. \nAs for the mock guardsmen who have posed with visitors for years Toys R Us remains rather cryptic. “The company is working diligently to place as many full and part-time team members as possible at Toys R Us and Babies R Us locations in the greater New York/New Jersey area.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T17:52:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
