That reflected an outperformance by longer-dated bonds after Fed Chair Janet Yellen reiterated that interest-rate increases, which she expects to start this year, will be gradual. Officials next decide on policy on July 29. Demand for Treasuries was sustained this week even after Greece signed a bailout deal and Chinese stocks stabilized.\n“Yellen made it clear that the expected path of interest rate hikes will be moderate,” said Ralf Umlauf, head of floor research at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen in Frankfurt. “That is what market participants are pricing in.” The next policy meeting “could make it clearer whether September is on the cards or not,” he said, referring to the potential timing of the first rate increase.\nTreasury 30-year bond yields fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.09 percent as of 6:57 a.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 3 percent security due in May 2045 rose 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 7/32. The yield has dropped 10 basis points this week, the steepest decline since the period ended May 29.\nYield Spread Two-year note yields were little changed at 0.66 percent, having increased two basis points this week. Benchmark 10-year note yields were little changed at 2.35 percent, down five basis points since July 10.\nThe spread between two- and 30-year yields has narrowed 12 basis points this week to 243 basis points, and touched 242 on Friday, the tightest since July 9.\nShorter-dated securities are more sensitive to the outlook for central-bank policy, while the direction of longer-maturity debt is driven more by investors’ outlook for inflation.\nYellen said Wednesday that central-bank officials may raise rates this year if economic growth matches up with their projections. Fed funds futures show a 35 percent chance the central bank will increase its benchmark rate at its September meeting from virtually zero, and 67 percent odds for a rise by year-end, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nTreasury market volatility has tumbled this week. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch MOVE Index, which tracks price changes based on options trading, fell to 76 basis points on Thursday, the lowest level since April 30.\n“She’s laid down this foundation for a rate hike this year, and volatility is falling,” Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG Ltd. in Melbourne, said in an interview with Bloomberg. “I think that’s a very positive thing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T16:59:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
