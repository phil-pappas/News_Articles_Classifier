The Dow ended the week up 1.8 percent, and the S&P 500 ended up 2.4 percent. In other news: Greece's parliament passed the terms of the proposed bailout; Iran sealed a historic accord to curb its nuclear program in return for lifting crippling sanctions; and China's GDP in the second quarter was a surprising 7 percent. Below is a recap of the markets for each day of the week. \nThe markets were up on Monday as Greece considers the tough bailout requirements: tax reforms, pension cuts, budget cuts, and surrendering financial authority to European supervisors. Oil fell nearly $0.50 to $52.25. The Dow rose 1.2 percent to 17,977; the S&P 500 rose 1.11 percent to 2,100. \nOn Tuesday the markets rose despite a very poor retail sales report which is raising questions about the consumer and resulted in reducing estimated GDP to 2.5 percent (from 3.0 percent). Oil rose $0.67 to $52.87. The Dow rose 0.4 percent to 18,054; the S&P 500 rose 0.45 percent to 2,109. \nOn Wednesday the markets dropped fractionally on weak economic news: no growth for the manufacturing component of the industrial production report; manufacturing also showed weakness in the Empire State report; the Beige Book showed moderate growth; and producer prices showed a gradual increase in inflation. Oil dropped $1.50 to just below $51.50. The Dow dropped fractionally to 18,050; the S&P 500 dropped fractionally to 2,107. \nThe markets strongly rose on Thursday on Greece's acceptance of new austerity terms and mixed economic news: jobless claims dropped; Philly Fed report showed slowing growth in July. Oil fell $0.50 to $50.75. The Dow rose 0.40 percent to 18,120; the S&P 500 rose 0.80 percent to 2,124. \nOn Friday the markets were mixed on economic news that points more strongly toward a Fed rate hike in September: consumer prices rose for a fifth straight month; housing starts & permits were very strong; and consumer sentiment is down sharply. Oil held steady at $50.75. The Dow dropped -0.2 percent to 18,086; the S&P 500 rose 0.11 percent to 2,127. \nThe markets rallied this week to near all-time highs (the top of their range) with the Nasdaq closing at new highs (up 4.25 percent). Sector returns were mostly positive (8 out of 10) with Technology up 5.3 percent and Financials up 3.0 percent; the energy sector was down -1.2 percent due primarily to the drop in oil prices. The rally was primarily due to the decline in Greek debt fears and the end to China's plunge in the equity markets. \nThe austerity bill passed by the Greek parliament will pave the way for 86 billion euros ($94 billion) of financial aid. There was a lot of dissension both within and out of parliament, including 39 members of the Syriza party; expect a cabinet reshuffle and possibly new elections in the near future. Former Greek finance minister Gikas Hardouvelis said that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras could succeed and stay in power by \"opening up professions, fighting oligopolies, fixing the public sector, justice sector and tax system -- all these things give power to the people. If he is a part of that and he does do reforms, he will succeed. But if he does not…he will be gone from the political scene. It's up to him at this point.\" Greece's short-term financial needs are being met, but its long-term debt is still an issue. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that without a debt \"haircut\", resolving Greece's long-term debt will be difficult. \nThe Iran nuclear deal represents a historic accord that took two years of torturous negotiations. The next step is for President Obama to convince a skeptical Congress, and the Israel lobby , that the deal is the best possible approach to blocking Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. The President must assuage Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who condemned the deal as a \"historic mistake\" and has vowed to sink the deal within Washington. In addition, the President must also reassure Arab allies (Saudi Arabia especially) that the agreement will not create a realignment in the Middle East that would be a detriment to them. The 159-page agreement, including five detailed annexes, places tough restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for reducing harsh international sanctions that brought Iran to the negotiating table. A multi-level verification process will be put in place that will make it impossible for Iran to enrich uranium and weapons-grade plutonium that are needed for developing a nuclear bomb. The President has warned that if Congress does not pass the accord, he will use his veto power to defend it. \nEconomists were surprised with China's 7 percent growth rate in GDP . Many had predicted a lower growth rate (6.8 percent) raising doubts over the reliability of the official figure (coming after weeks of chaos in the Chinese stock market , which saw over $3 trillion lost). While the goal of Beijing is to reduce its role in the economy, the plunge in stock prices forced the government to take drastic measures: halting IPOs; and freezing the sale of stocks by major stockholders. China’s official news agency said , ahead of the GDP announcement, that “More than three decades of break-neck growth, driven by over-reliance on exports and over-investment in sectors like real estate and factories, has left the country with vacant houses, idle factories and piling corporate debt.” \nThe bottom line: economic reports point to increasing pressure for inflation. This is good for the Fed which is trying to increase inflation, and bad for consumers. Economic growth is currently around 2.5 percent which is consistent with the Fed's expectations, and makes a rate hike in September more likely. \nThe focus next week in the U.S. will be housing: FHFA house price index; existing home sales; new home sales. Globally the focus will be on manufacturing and services. In addition, the focus will be on the following: UK (BoE monetary policy, retail sales); eurozone (manufacturing, services, composite PMI); Germany (producer price index, manufacturing, services, composite PMI); China (manufacturing PMI); and Japan (merchandise trade balance). \nYear-to-date the markets are up: Dow 1.5%; S&P500 3.3%; Nasdaq 10.0%. \nThe Markets for the past week were: DJIA up 1.8%; S&P500 2.4%; Nasdaq COMP up 4.3%. \nCommodities (ETFs) for the past week were: Gold (GLD) down -2.55%; Silver (SLV) down -4.37%; Oil (OIH) down -3.40%; Dollar (UUP) up 2.07%; 30-year Bonds (TYX) dropped 13 basis points to 3.08%. \nThe VIX this past week (a measure of market sentiment and volatility) dropped to 11.95% due to declining concerns over China and Greece. \nTo see what's on the calendar for next week, go to the Econoday calendar. \nThe economic calendar for next week is light: o Monday – nothing o Wednesday – EIA Petroleum Status Report, Existing Home Sales o Thursday – Weekly Jobless Claims o Friday – PMI Manufacturing Index Flash, New Home Sales \nIf you're trading options, it is suggested trading Put Credit spreads for next week at 1.75 standard deviations or greater. Expect the price of the SPX to fall within 2058 and 2197 (2 standard deviations). \nFor more information about options, see the 'Suggested Links' below.
