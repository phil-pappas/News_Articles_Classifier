He also noted that vast amounts of assets are held by entities, including non-profits, foreigners and retirement funds, not subject to the individual capital gains tax.\nClinton's proposal comes as part of her plan to fight what she sees as an excessive focus on quick profits in capital markets.\nSeveral fund managers and financial planners said they did not think the proposals would significantly change corporations' or shareholders' behavior, although they would probably cause a small increase in costs for brokerage firms.\nClinton's plan to revamp capital gains tax rates appears to be a shift from her position in 2008, when she last sought the party's nomination and vowed not to raise long-term capital gains tax rates above 20 percent, if at all.\nAsked about this shift in an online forum with the public on Monday, Clinton wrote that \"the increase in short-termism has grown in urgency since 2008, and the urgency of our solutions has to match it.\" (Additional reporting by Amanda Becker in Washington and David Randall in New York; Writing by Susan Heavey and Jonathan Allen; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T01:17:13.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
