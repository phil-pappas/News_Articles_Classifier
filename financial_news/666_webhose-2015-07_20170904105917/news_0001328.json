They declined to be identified because the company has not yet disclosed the matter. \nSumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings are the three banks, the sources said. \nToshiba denied it has sought a credit line, including reports that talks with banks were prompted by worries that demand for its commercial paper, issued for short-term financing, could take a hit. \n\"We are not seeing a worsening in short-term financing,\" a spokeswoman for the company told Reuters. \"There is no truth to the story that says we made such a request.\" \nThe company may need to mark down past earnings by over 100 billion yen, more than double earlier estimates, after investigators found more irregularities than previously identified, a source familiar with the matter said on Saturday. [ID:nL3N0ZK01P] \nSome reports on Wednesday put estimated writedowns at up to 200 billion yen. \nToshiba's shares fell 3 percent, giving the conglomerate a market value of $13.8 billion. \nThe company said in a separate statement after the close of trade that it did not yet know the extent of potential earnings revisions due to the probe by an independent committee, which is scheduled to report its findings in mid-July. \nThe investigation, which is looking at irregularities that have taken place over several years through 2013, has previously found inappropriate bookkeeping in areas such as highway electronic toll collection systems, power meters and semiconductors. \nThe current accounting investigation is Toshiba's second in less then two years. In October 2013, it announced that it found its medical subsidiary, Toshiba Medical information Systems, had overstated results for several years. \n($1 = 121.5400 yen)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T15:08:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
