Photo: Bloomberg\nBHP Billiton and Rio Tinto's interest in the Zaldivar​ copper mine in Chile has not been consummated, with half of the asset being sold to Chilean copper miner Antofagasta​ overnight on Thursday.\nZaldivar's owner Barrick​ agreed to sell 50 per cent of the mine to Antofagasta for $US1 billion, in the first step of broader partnership with the family-run company.\n\"Following a highly competitive auction process, we are pleased to reach an agreement with the ideal partner for Zaldivar. Antofagasta has an outstanding track record of building and operating mines in Chile, and we see this as the first step in an ongoing, collaborative partnership. There are many potential opportunities to benefit from Antofagasta's experience as Barrick evaluates development projects in the future,\" Barrick's co-president Kelvin Dushnisky​ said.\nBHP and Rio's interest in Zaldivar was piqued by the fact it is adjacent to the Escondida copper mine that they jointly own, and had potential to be connected into Escondida's operations.\nAdvertisement It is unclear whether the acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Zaldivar, as opposed to buying the entire asset, would have interested BHP and Rio and their Japanese partners in Escondida.\nAside from BHP and Rio, China Molybdenum Corporation was also fancied to pick up the asset, having flagged itsreadiness to make a $US2.15 billion acquisition in recent weeks.\nThe transaction with Antofagasta continues Barrick's efforts to sell assets to reduce its debt, having recent sold its Cowal mine in New South Wales to Evolution Mining for $US550 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T18:17:48.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
