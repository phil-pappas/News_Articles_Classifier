But investors looking for an undervalued stock may want to head the other way.\nEBay EBAY, +3.39% gave a slight uptick in its revenue forecast for fiscal 2015, raising the lower-end of its guidance to 3% from flat-growth previously. The upper-level of the guidance calls for sales growth of up to 5%, adjusted for currency fluctuations.\nShares of eBay were up 3.5% to $65.72 Thursday morning. They have risen more than 15% over the last three months, outperforming the broader S&P 500, up 0.8%.\n“We are doing everything we said we would do in the first half,” eBay’s incoming Chief Executive Devin Wenig told investors Thursday on a conference call dedicated to the results and impending spin-out. “We are feeling good about where we are, we are on the right path.”\nIn its last quarter as a combined company with PayPal, eBay reported better-than-expected earnings and found a buyer for its enterprise business, reaping $925 million. The sale of its corporate business will enable eBay to focus on its core customer base of small- to medium-sized sellers, as well as perform a $1 billion stock buy-back.\nOn the call, investors asked Wenig for an update on eBay’s plan to move its product listings to a more structured database, which would enable listings to be found easier by search engines.
