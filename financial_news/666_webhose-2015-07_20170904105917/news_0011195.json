Supplied Share on twitter by Michael Smith While Echo Entertainment is the favourite to win the right to build a new multibillion-dollar casino in Brisbane do not take James Packer's silence on the issue as a sign that Crown Resorts has rolled over.\nWith final bids now in, the government is expected to make an announcement after the July 14 state budget on the winning consortium.\nInvestors are betting on an Echo win, which has been reflected in an uptick in the company's shares but they are also aware of the fact that nothing is certain when politics and Packer are involved.\nBoth sides were making changes to their submissions in the lead up to the final stage of the race and it is rumoured that Crown has increased its financial offering to the Queensland government to help get its bid across the line.\nThis is what it did in New South Wales in 2013 when its winning bid to develop a second gaming facility at Sydney's Barangaroo included an upfront $100 million licence fee.\nIndustry sources also say Crown is willing to work inside the cap on the number of poker machines in the state. One way this could be achieved is through a buyback from pubs and clubs to keep the numbers down.\nPoker machines are a political hot potato and Crown is expected to try and offset the backlash from pub and club owners who earlier this year said they feared it would apply for new licences to operate between 1500 and 2500 machines .\nEcho, on the other hand, can transfer its 1600 machines operating at its existing Treasury Casino to the new gaming site if it wins.\n The actual number of licences Crown has applied for is likely to be well below the industry's original estimate. CLSA analysts say a second casino licence would require at least 1500 new slot machines. Part of Crown's winning bid for Barangaroo in Sydney was an agreement for no poker machines.\nEcho last year teamed up with Hong Kong-based joint venture partners Far East Consortium and Chinese conglomerate Chow Tai Fook to build the proposed casino, hotel and residential project at Brisbane's Queen's Wharf .\nCrown, meanwhile, has partnered with Chinese state-owned developer Greenland Holdings.\nWhile Labor's surprise state election win in January initially put a question mark over the massive infrastructure project, new Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk quickly backed the development. It is in the spotlight as one of the state's few big-earners after the shelving of $37 billion in asset sales, put the brakes on infrastructure spending.\nEcho and Crown remain fierce rivals but the absence of the ferocious public campaign when the two gaming groups last clashed in Sydney, has surprised many observers watching the Brisbane process.\nThis has led some to assume that Packer, distracted by his growing commitments offshore, was never really serious about winning Brisbane â€“ at least not in the same way that Sydney mattered both personally and commercially.\nThe explanation for the silence from both parties is strict probity guidelines Queensland laid down to avoid a repeat of the circus surrounding the Sydney process, restricting what they can say in public about the matter. The reality is that Crown needs Brisbane less than Echo, and it is in its interest to make things as tough as possible for its competitor. But it has not funnelled millions of dollars into the Queen's Wharf bidding process for a laugh either.\nEcho hired former Queensland premier Rob Borbidge and former Queensland Labor Party treasurer Damian Power to lobby on its behalf. Crown chief executive Rowen Craigie has led the rival bid process alongside banking heavyweights at UBS, Mathew Grounds and Kelvin Barry.\nEcho has the home town advantage as it already holds the city's only casino licence at Treasury, which it plans to redevelop into a boutique hotel and retail space. It is also pushing its bid politically as a drawcard for tourism to the city compared to an influx of new apartments to the area.\nBut Crown can point to its reputation as a successful developer of greenfields sites.\nmichael.smith@fairfaxmedia.com.au\nTwitter @MikeSmithAFR", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@MikeSmithAFR", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-07-06T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:04:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
