But prolonged low interest rates have pushed many schemes into deficit, making them expensive to insure. \nBritish private sector pension scheme liabilities total 2 trillion pounds, outstripping the country's GDP for the first time, consultants Hymans Robertson said last month. \nThe CAA deal was a buy-in, in which Rothesay insures part of the overall pension scheme, the firm said in a statement. It gave no financial details of the deal. \nRothesay Life, whose backers include Blackstone (NYSE: BX - news ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) , has said it is preparing for a possible stock market flotation.
