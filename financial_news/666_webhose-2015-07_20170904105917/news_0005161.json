AP The Australian dollar slid below US74c on Thursday morning after US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen said the prospects remain good for a rise in US interest rates this year.\n\"If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target,\" Yellen said in testimony Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee in Washington. She said Fed officials expect growth \"to strengthen over the remainder of this year and the unemployment rate to decline gradually\".\nThe Aussie was trading at US73.75¢ at 5.15am AEST, compared with Wednesday's local close of US74.72¢. It was also hit by the Bank of Canada cutting interest rates overnight, which may augur more monetary stimulus by resource-producing nations. The New Zealand dollar also tumbled to a multi-year low.\nYellen, 68, again emphasised that the timing of the first rate rise in almost a decade is less important than the subsequent path of increases, which she said would be gradual. She said Fed forecasts for higher rates this year are projections and \"not statements of intent to raise rates at any particular time\".\nIn the first of two scheduled days of testimony before Congress, Yellen repeated that the Fed will tighten policy when it sees more improvement in the labour market and is \"reasonably confident\" that inflation will head back toward 2 per cent in the medium term.\nStocks and Treasuries were little changed, while the US dollar strengthened.\nResponding to questions, Yellen said that the Fed could decide to raise rates at any meeting, not just those that are typically followed by a previously scheduled press conference. She also said that raising rates sooner could allow the Fed to follow a more gradual path later, while waiting to tighten could mean a faster pace.\nYellen came under fire from Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, for the Fed's handling of an internal investigation of a 2012 leak of confidential policy information.\n Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, said the Fed had \"crossed the line\" by failing to comply with a subpoena for documents. He also said the Fed's guidance on the likely path of monetary policy is \"opaque\" and said the Fed's actions should be more predictable.\nYellen said the Fed is seeking to cooperate with the committee and that complying with the subpoena would interfere with a existing criminal investigation by the Department of Justice.\n\"We fully intend to cooperate with you to provide the documents you requested but we are not going to provide them now,\" she said in a heated exchange with Sean Duffy of Wisconsin.\n\"Madame chair, it appears that you are the one who is jeopardising, or the Fed is the one who is jeopardising, this investigation,\" Duffy said.\nYellen's testimony on the economy was similar to a speech she gave on July 10. She again acknowledged concerns over the situation in Greece and added China to her list of overseas risks.\nStill, she sounded a note of optimism, saying that \"economic growth abroad could also pick up more quickly than observers generally anticipate, providing additional support for US economic activity\".\nShe added that \"the US economy also might snap back more quickly as the transitory influences holding down first-half growth fade and the boost to consumer spending from low oil prices shows through more definitively\".\nForecasts issued by the Federal Open Market Committee in June implied two quarter-point rate rises this year, followed by a shallower path of increases than officials predicted in March. The forecasts were included in a Monetary Policy Report released by the Fed Board along with her testimony.\nWhile the median forecast of policy makers called for two increases by year-end, a larger number of officials said just one would be enough.\nThe Fed is likely to make its first move in September, according to 76 per cent of 51 economists surveyed by Bloomberg from July 2 to July 8. Futures traders are less confident. A Morgan Stanley index based on futures trading shows the Fed won't act until early 2016, while federal funds futures show the probability for a move in September of just 33 per cent.\nYellen will complete her semi-annual congressional testimony tomorrow before the Senate Banking Committee. Headed by Alabama Republican Richard Shelby, that panel in May approved a proposal that would ease regulations for mid-sized banks and toughen oversight of the Fed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T00:06:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
