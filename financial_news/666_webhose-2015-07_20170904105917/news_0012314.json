Increasingly, it does not.\nThe S&P/ASX 200 Index finished 2014-15 with a lowly 1 per cent return for the year after a loss of 7 per cent in the fourth quarter, thanks to the Greek debt crisis, a slowing Chinese economy, and concerns that bank shares were overpriced. The safety net of dividends would still put most investors ahead on a total return basis, reminding everyone that income, despite its high price, still has a dominant role to play in the Australian market.\nWith Greece's place in the eurozone still uncertain and a bear market seizing Chinese equities, investors have two new big risks hanging over almost every asset class.\nIn a grim take on the 12 months ahead, Societe Generale put it to investors that \"losing the least amount of money may be the best source of success this year\". The proverbial elephant in the room is the slowing global economy, the bank said.\nIt is often said that only two positions are necessary in times of crisis: cash and the foetal position.\nBut experts are not advocating selling just yet, although some leading fund managers have been boasting higher cash allocations heading into the new financial year. The events of the past week may present an opportunity for switching, however.\nEscala Partners chief investment officer Giselle Roux advocated for investors to evaluate their risks if they don't already understand them.\n\"Let's assume that while this is an uncomfortable and somewhat unsettling period, it doesn't feel like one that's going to be catastrophic,\" she said, highlighting that sharemarket performance for most of 2015 anyway has been \"somewhat ordinary\".\n \"The key to me is people should be really careful of concentrating their risk, and that is, 'Should I have that much Australian equities? What is a lower risk way of participating in equity markets?'\"\nRoux is referring to the tendency for the Australian dollar to perform poorly when investors grow nervous. Given the currency's informal status as a proxy for Chinese growth, it has followed the script with the downturn in the Shanghai Composite. Since the index's peak on June 12, the Australian dollar has lost 2 per cent.\n\"Having global investments helps that,\" Roux says, \"if for no other reason alone than the currency tends to be weaker in times of uncertainty.\"\nThe other trap, so to speak, is that Australian investors tend to inadvertently have high weightings towards financial stocks because of the unique composition of the ASX 200.\nThis could be a sector to tread carefully around. \"Not because the Australian banking sector's risky, but we saw in 2013 the cost of funding for our banks really blows out because we fund in global markets,\" Roux says, referring to the way credit markets respond in times of crisis.\n\"Bear in mind that interest rate movements have a broader impact on most people's portfolios here. This is not about selling the financial sector, it's about 'How much do I have?'\"\nWilson Asset Management chairman and fund manager Geoff Wilson had been building a cash position of up to 42 per cent heading into the new fiscal year. He's since reduced that to under 40 per cent by picking up some stocks at more attractive prices.\nWilson, who predicted in front of an audience last month that \"there will be blood and we're getting closer and closer to the blood,\" thinks the market has not reached that flashpoint yet.\n\"We're 76 months into this current bull market, a little over 6Â¼ years, and that is a long bull market. We know what it's driven by: record-low interest rates, and it's driven money into equity markets and property markets. My view is that currently people are mispricing risk and what we've seen over the last month with the Australian market is a reminder that when you invest in equities you are taking a fair degree of risk.\"\nBut Wilson also addresses the paradox of investing in tumultuous times and the human bias to take cover.\n\"You have to move counter to what your emotions tell you: when you're fearful you should be investing, when you're feeling confident you should be selling,\" he says.\nThis has been proven correct in every cycle, but bold investors need to have an appetite for volatility to play the trade out.\nA complication for any investor is that the world really is different after $US4 trillion of central bank balance sheet expansion since the global financial crisis, and record-low interest rates.\nIt forces a rethink of the traditional roles asset classes have played as diversifiers and hedges. And bonds have the biggest question mark over them of all.\nMatthew Sherwood, Perpetual's head of investment strategy, points out that since 1901 there have been 31 years when Australian equities have suffered losses and in 26 of those, the 10-year bond has delivered positive returns and offset equities.\nBut, in the five periods when bonds went against the grain, those were associated with rising bond yields.\n\"We're back to a world where at least for the time being, markets have much more ups and downs than ... has been the case for several years,\" says Sherwood.\n\"Investors in this world have to be very, very careful about not falling victim to the law of averages. In any major market the expected return for bonds is at an all-time low, whereas the capital risk from a back-up in yields is at an all-time high.\n\"Bonds may not provide the protection they have historically because there is significant capital risk in buying bonds in this world.\"\nThat means looking elsewhere for diversification, such as cash (which offers no inflation protection), or in sectors of the equity market that are cheap and exposed to a rise in inflation, such as global financials or energy.\nSherwood favours stocks that offer low debt-to-equity ratios. If investors can find those at an attractive price, that is one of the best risk-management strategies that can be deployed. Japan, where companies are paying interest costs at around 0.5 per cent, is one market where investors might find sufficient candidates.\n\"It's not like these shocks came from nowhere,\" Sherwood says of Greece and China.\n\"You've got to sit here and say, 'What are the true triggers of that?' Both economies have had very large increases in the level of debt in the past 10 years. At the same time economic growth has declined and inflation has also declined. High debt, weak growth and weak inflation is not a good combination for equities.\"\nFund manager and Clime chief investment officer John Abernethy says the volatility is especially testing for retirees and emphasises a long-term view.\nHe advocates moving offshore, but not because of the return of volatility. Abernethy says investors should capitalise on the fact that the Australian dollar is not responding to weak commodity prices nor the deteriorating outlook for the Australian economy, and switch to US dollars or sterling.\nThen, when opportunities arise, investors can deploy that cash into foreign equities. They will have to decide whether to maintain hedged or unhedged exposures too.\n\"The volatility is telling me there's something wrong in the Australian market and the behaviour of the currency is not consistent with the reality of the trade account,\" he says. \"Move out of Australia.\"\nAbernethy says it could be three to five years before the cycle becomes favourable for the Australian economy again, because the transition away from mining is so haphazard and policy decisions from government are absent.\nIndeed, the best-performing major equity markets have been Japan and Europe, according to Schroders; \"no coincidence\", because these are the two markets where monetary stimulus is still being pumped out by central banks.\n\"The good news about Greece is that it isn't big enough to derail the European recovery, nor is it likely to upset the European banks significantly as Greek exposure has been largely quarantined,\" says Simon Doyle, Schroders head of fixed income.\nHe advocates for being defensively positioned, but not ultradefensive, because the biggest concern for markets would come not from Greece or China but from a downturn or recession in the US and \"we still think is some way off\".\nDoyle likes Australian equities because valuations look less stretched after the sell-off; he is cool towards US stocks and says there is not enough value in emerging markets to justify the risks. The Australian dollar will keep falling, and in fixed income Schroders has cut its exposure but nor has it dismissed bonds altogether. Despite rising yields, if global growth starts slowing, bonds will resume their rally.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf"], "published": "2015-07-03T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T12:30:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
