The buyback scheme was due to end last week but the NSW government extended it for three months.\nThe threat seemed to be directed at Metgasco, which has an exploration license in the politically sensitive Northern Rivers area. Mr Roberts said Metgasco was one of the companies he was negotiating a buyback with.\nHowever, Mr Roberts said the government was still looking positively at AGL's remaining project in the Gloucester region and Santos' Pilliga project which are both in relatively sparsely populated areas north-west of Sydney. \"They are going through a planning process,\" Mr Roberts said.\nBut he said the government would insist on world's best practice and a \"triple bottom line\" approach. He denied there had been a \"quid pro quo\" where AGL agreed to surrender the Sydney and Hunter Valley licences in exchange for approval for Gloucester.\nDrilling curtailed Drilling has been on hold for more than two years in the three areas where AGL agreed to sell back licences on Monday because the NSW government imposed a series of bans on drilling near homes, water catchments, horse studs and vineyards.\n AGL told the Australian Stock Exchange that, \"While there is significant coal seam gas in the Hunter Valley, the overlay of critical-industry clusters and the 2 kilometre setback result in this resource not being economic to develop.\"\nAGL simultaneously announced a $193 million write-down for the Gloucester project because of \"significant delays in production of first gas and the latest estimates of gas volumes, development costs and lower forward gas prices.\" It said that it would delay a final decision on the project until 2016.\nLock The Gate Alliance, an anti-CSG group, welcomed AGL's decision to sell back the Hunter and Sydney licences but vowed to block its Gloucester project too. \"The Gloucester project has been plagued with environmental difficulties and community resistance. AGL's announcement that they are again delaying their final investment decision on Gloucester is welcome relief, but in reality, we expect that in a year's time, they will pull out of Gloucester too.\"\nMr Roberts criticised the former ALP government for handing out too many exploration licences and said the buyback program that started earlier this year had cut the share of the state's territory covered by tenements from 60 per cent to 9 per cent.\nThe Coalition lost the seat of Ballina in the March election to the Greens after a strong local campaign against Metgasco's coal seam gas projects in the Northern Rivers area. Metgasco recently won a Supreme Court case overturning a ban on drilling in the area which the government imposed last year on the grounds that Metgasco had failed to consult adequately with the community. Mr Roberts publicly announced he had asked the Independent Commission Against Corruption to investigate allegations of corruption against Metgasco, but ICAC said these allegations were without merit.\nALP spokesman Adam Searle said the buyback was misleading because most CSG licences being reacquired have no gas worth extracting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T13:03:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
