Source: News Limited\n“The Chinese have been trying to stabilise their ­systems, regulate the ­market and produce their own brands but there is such a big demand for Australian brands,” Mr Hansford said. But Melbourne mum Daniella ­Chapkoun told Leader Newspapers the rationing was annoying.\nHaving carried three tins around the store she was angered to be told, at the check-out, there was a two-tin limit on every transaction at Greensborough Plaza Coles.\n“I’ve got three children under five so it’s not very easy to go shopping,” Ms Chapkoun said.\nHampton’s Ebony Millis supplemented her breastfeeding of five-month-old Hudson with infant formula for health reasons.\n“I use an Australian-made, organic brand and I haven’t had any trouble buying it, but I have noticed some shelves for other brands such as S-26 have been quite empty,” Ms Millis said.\nA Woolworths spokesman said last year they had implemented a four-can ­restriction on individual transactions.\nChemist Warehouse customers can buy two cans at a time of baby ­formula including brands such as Bellamy’s, Nan and Karicare.\nA Coles spokeswoman told Leader that ­customers were limited to four cans of infant formula each, due to “short-term” supply issues.\nOriginally published as Baby formula crackdown hits shelves ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Baby+formula+crackdown+hits+shelves&c=AUSTRALIAN+super%26%23173%3Bmarkets+are+cracking+down+on+shoppers+sending+baby+formula+overseas%2C+enforcing+strict+limits+on+the+number+of+cans+that+can+be+bought.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/skyrocketing-demand-for-baby-formula-prompts-supermarkets-to-extend-rationing/story-fnkgdftz-1227441575330?sv=bb32a9e3b1e55acb39812171f71aa909", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/news/demand-for-baby-formula-forces-supermarkets-to-ration-sales/story-fnglekhp-1227440295393", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/skyrocketing-demand-for-baby-formula-prompts-supermarkets-to-extend-rationing/story-fnkgdftz-1227441575330?sv=bb32a9e3b1e55acb39812171f71aa909&title=Baby+formula+crackdown+hits+shelves", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/skyrocketing-demand-for-baby-formula-prompts-supermarkets-to-extend-rationing/story-fnkgdftz-1227441575330?sv=bb32a9e3b1e55acb39812171f71aa909", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/skyrocketing-demand-for-baby-formula-prompts-supermarkets-to-extend-rationing/story-fnkgdftz-1227441575330?sv=bb32a9e3b1e55acb39812171f71aa909&h=Baby+formula+crackdown+hits+shelves", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/skyrocketing-demand-for-baby-formula-prompts-supermarkets-to-extend-rationing/story-fnkgdftz-1227441575330?sv=bb32a9e3b1e55acb39812171f71aa909", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/skyrocketing-demand-for-baby-formula-prompts-supermarkets-to-extend-rationing/story-fnkgdftz-1227441575330?sv=bb32a9e3b1e55acb39812171f71aa909&title=Baby+formula+crackdown+hits+shelves"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:13:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
