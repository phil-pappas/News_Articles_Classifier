With wages showing early signs of a pick-up and US unemployment down to 5.3%, he set a high bar for delaying a hike. \nOnly if labour markets unexpectedly weaken, if core inflation starts to drop off, or if the wage gains dissipated, “those would be the things that would make me want to pause and wait and see whether there is further evidence,” he said.
