Photo: Nic Walker\nIt's a classic rebound relationship gone wrong. Oroton Group hooked up with American charmer Brooks Brothers in 2013 after Ralph Lauren walked out on their 25 year relationship.\nBut just two years into a tie-up that was supposed to last a decade Oroton is single once more. Despite opening 13 stores and an online shop Brooks failed to bring in results it used to court Oroton.\nChief executive Mark Newman will now focus the company on its own eponymous brand.\nOroton has scrapped its forecast of second-half earnings growth. Photo: Supplied\nHe said in a statement on Friday morning that the pair agreed it is the time for parent company Brooks Brothers Group to manage the Brooks Brothers business locally\nAdvertisement Oroton wants some me time.\nThe separation, Mr Newmans said, would allow his company to place key resources on its troubled Oroton brand, as it looks to reposition the label and ditch discounting.\nOroton Group has cut its ties with US retailer Brooks Brothers, but still has brand ambassador, actress Rose Byrne. Photo: Oroton\n\"We look forward to continuing to work closely with Brooks Brothers by providing some support services in the future,\" he said in a statement to the ASX.\nUnder the deal, Oroton will sell its entire shareholding in Brooks Brothers Australia Pty Limited, the joint venture company, to Brooks Brothers International, LLC, finalising its financial commitments. Oroton will also provide management and administration services to Brooks Brothers Australia for up to two years following the change of control. The sale is intended to be finalised by July 25.\nFormer Oroton boss Sally Macdonald sealed the 10-year joint-venture agreement with iconic American apparel brand in 2013 before her departure. Oroton had big plans to build Brooks Brothers in Australia, opening 13 stores and a local online shop over the past two years. The venture was meant to help plug a gap in earnings after Oroton's Â­25-year-relationship with Polo Ralph Lauren came to an end.\nThe mid-tier luxury handbag and accessories maker said the transaction is not expected to have any further negative impact on earnings for fiscal 2015, beyond what was included in the profit warning in May when it downgraded earnings expectations for the second time this year. The company's strategy to sell more full-priced products cost more than expected, and slower sales at its Gap and Brooks Brothers ventures hurt profitability.\nThe vertically integrated retailer, one of Australia's few home-grown luxury brands, has been trying to reposition itself but has run into branding and pricing issues, leading to weak sales momentum and pressure on profits. Oroton same-store sales fell 6.5 per cent in the first half, and the trend continued into the second half. Oroton no longer expects earnings before interest and tax growth in the second half of fiscal 2015\nIt lost $14 million of its value on May 22. The stock has tumbled to $1.86 and is a far cry from its all-time high of nearly $8.58, hit in December 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:33:42.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
