Since Australia temporarily banned live cattle exports to Indonesia in 2011, AACo has been growing its business in the boxed beef market. The company spent $91 million building the Livingstone Beef abattoir in Darwin, which was officially opened in February. It will process up to 1000 head of cattle a day at full capacity. AACo managing director Jason Strong said the volume of cattle processed at the plant was progressively increasing to meet demand. \"We are in an environment now where we have strong global demand for proteins, particularly for beef,\" he said. \"In the grass fed part of the business, we made a strategic decision to substantially reduce the number of cattle sold externally and this process will continue in 2016.\" Boxed beef sales accounted for 77 per cent of group revenue in its fiscal 2015 year, up from 59 per cent in fiscal 2014. Wagyu beef accounted for 52 per cent of its boxed beef revenue.
