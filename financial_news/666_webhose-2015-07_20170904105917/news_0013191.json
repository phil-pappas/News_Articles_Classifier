Tamara Voninski Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Clancy Yeates The Commonwealth Bank has reversed its May decision to raise two deposit account interest rates, a move it had said previously was influenced by consideration of savers.\nIn a tactic that was copied by several rival banks, the CBA did not pass on the full value of the Reserve Bank's May cut in interest rates to home loan customers, but took the unusual step of raising some deposit rates.\nAt the time it said the deposit changes – a 55 basis point lift in 8-month term deposits and a 5 basis points increase in its GoalSaver account – were recognition of the importance of interest income for the 7 million customers who had savings accounts, especially retirees and the young.\nBut in recent weeks these moves have been reversed. In late June the bank cut the interest rate on its 8-month term deposit by 55 basis points – the same amount as the May increase – to 2.5 per cent.\nIt also made a 15 basis point cut to its GoalSaver account, to 2.9 per cent. This is a deeper cut than the 5 basis point rise in this product in May.\nThe changes bring CBA's offers in these segments into line with rivals and have occurred as other banks also cut term deposit rates in the face of fierce competition in home lending, which is eroding profit margins.\nThe term deposit change was highlighted in a note by Deutsche Bank analyst Andrew Triggs, who wrote that term deposit rates had continued to drift lower, providing a \"tailwind\" to large bank profit margins.\nRival banks Westpac, ANZ Bank, and National Australia Bank also cut various term deposit rates during June, figures from RateCity show.\n A CBA spokeswoman said the bank's interest rate offers were influenced by several factors, including official moves by the Reserve Bank, funding costs and international conditions.\n\"We frequently review our product offering to ensure they remain reflective of market conditions. We believe our deposit products also continue to provide value to customers,\" the spokeswoman said.\nWhen CBA announced its move to raise certain deposit rates in May, group executive for retail banking Matt Comyn said it had considered the needs of deposit customers as well as borrowers in its decision.\n\"Lifting the rates for our deposit customers at a time when the cash rate is decreasing recognises the importance of savings income, particularly for retirees and young people,\" Mr Comyn said in a May statement.\nRateCity research manager Peter Arnold said it had always been a \"stretch\" to compare term deposit interest rates with variable home loan interest rates, because these were affected by different forces. He said recent cuts in term deposit rates from banks were probably reflecting the growing possibility of a further RBA rate cut this year.\n\"At the moment it's looking like there could be another rate cut in the second half of this year.\"\nThe RBA board is expected to leave official interest rates on hold at 2 per cent when it meets on Tuesday.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/117021518580315645042", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/cba-fails-to-pass-on-full-rate-cut-to-borrowers-20150506-gguurb.html", "https://twitter.com/clancyyeates"], "published": "2015-07-06T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:08:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
