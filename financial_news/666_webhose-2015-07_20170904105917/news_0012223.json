New research into the financial pressures on retired people has revealed the average amount owed by children over 18 to their retired parents is £3,100, with one in 10 owed more than £5,000, It also revealed that nearly a million over-65s have adult children and family living with them. Property prices creating generation of mummy's boys The figures are part of a new cost of retirement index from insurance giant MetLife, which looks at the finances of the UK's 10-million-plus retired people. Children in the north-east of England are most likely to owe money to their retired parents with 36 per cent in debt to older family members. Grown up children in Wales are least likely to owe their parents money with just four per cent in debt, the survey of 1,000 people found. In Scotland one in five (20 per cent) of retirees are owed money by their children. In addition, 22 per cent of pensioners north of the border have family members living with them, the highest of any region in the UK. Dominic Grinstead, managing director of MetLife UK said: \"Being able to lend adult children money is important to millions of retired people and many can definitely afford to do so and are happy to pay out. \"But the fact that so many are helping out adult children demonstrates that people need flexibility in their finances in order to be able to fund potential financial surprises.\" Percentage of retired people owed money by their children South West 12% London 21% East Midlands 19% South East 31% West Midlands 28% Yorkshire & Humberside 26% North East 36% Scotland 20% Eastern 20% North West 25% Wales 4% Nationwide 22% Follow @telegraphnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T02:04:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
