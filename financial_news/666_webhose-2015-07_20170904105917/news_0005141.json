The index is up 3.3% for the week, and if that pace keeps up, techs will log their best weekly return for the index since late April.\nSome stellar results this week have helped, with Google GOOG, +3.50% up 13% in premarket trade and Netflix NFLX, +18.02% up another 1.3% after results dazzled Wall Street. Netflix has had a sublime week, up around 19%.\nRead: The streaming revolution is real, and Google and Netflix are capitalizing\nNext week will mark an even heavier week for technology stocks and could add further plumping out to the Nasdaq gains, with Apple AAPL, +1.33% Microsoft MSFT, +1.97% Amazon AMZN, +3.10% IBM IBM, +1.47% among the big names set to report. For now though, it seems to be the Internet stocks that are gathering the attention, and some of the concern.\n“Rotation from semis to Internets in TMT (technology, media telecom) evident,” said analysts at Credit Suisse in a note to clients Friday.\nWhile the S&P 500 SPX, +0.80% and Dow industrials DJIA, +0.39% have fought to stay in the black this year, up 3% and 1.6%, respectively, the Nasdaq has managed a 9% gain. And within this, Internet stocks are shining. The First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF FDN, +2.39% an exchange-traded fund that tracks Internet stocks closely, is up over 15%. Biotechs are doing even better, of course, with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund IBB, +1.26% up 30% so far this year.\nLooking at ETFs that generally track technology stocks—Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, +1.28% iShares US Technology ETF IYW, +1.27% and Vanguard Information Technology Index VGT, +1.15% VGT, +1.15% the gains are more in the ballpark of 3%.\nSome strategists aren't at all at ease with what’s going on. Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, told clients in a note on Friday that he’s getting “flashbacks to the equity bubble blow off in early 2000.”\nNeed to know: Market top? Not with these tech earnings\nHe specifically cites concern over the $160 billion in market capitalization growth for the S&P 500 biotech sector over the past year, but that’s not all. Google added $87 billion when factoring in last night’s earnings-related nearly 12% gain, said O’Rourke.\n“It’s one thing to see $5 to $10 billion market cap companies move 20% in a day or a week. It is entirely different to see a $50 billion or $400 billion company to move in such a manner.”\nRead: Biotech finally nears a top\nWhat’s it all about? O’Rourke says investors are lurching around for growth, and prepared to pay any price to get it, noting that the current estimate for 2015 S&P 500 SPX, +0.80% earnings growth is $115.24, which is less than 2% growth over 2014.\n“When growth is slowing (like it was in Q1 of 2000), consensus is forced to chase the ‘growth’ it can find,” says Keith McCullough, chief executive officer of Hedgeye Risk Management, responding to a question via email. He points out that Morgan Stanley’s “New Tech” index MSH, +2.04% is trading at 149.5 times forward earnings.\n“This is probably bubblier than it was then given the lack of market memory,” says McCullough, who shows the following chart that compares trailing 12 month price/earnings, to forward 12-months earnings.\nSome, though spit in the eye of any market fears.\n“It’s still a bull market…and if you try to sell it, if you get out of it, especially if you try to go short of it, you make a fool of yourself,” Dennis Gartman, the founder and editor of the “Gartman Letter” told CNBC in an interview on Friday.\nAlso read: When this market crashes, traders get trashed\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://etf.com/FDN", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/17/dennis-gartman-stock-market-bull-run.html"], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T15:06:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
