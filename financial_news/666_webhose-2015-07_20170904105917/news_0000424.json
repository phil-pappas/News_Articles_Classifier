Spending on national security or health is less controversial. \nThe report said the world was not on track to limit greenhouse gas emissions to keep temperatures within a UN goal of two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times. \n“It is very likely that the world will continue to follow a medium to high emissions pathway for the next few decades,” the authors wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T09:49:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
