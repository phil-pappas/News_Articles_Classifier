( http://1.usa.gov/1Sjw5eo ) \nThe drug was previously approved for use only in patients who did not respond to chemotherapy. \nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The National Cancer Institute estimates more than 158,000 will die from the disease this year. \nThe approval could breath new life into the drug, whose sales fell 5 percent to $144 million in the first quarter. \nDrugs like Iressa and Roche Holding AG (Other OTC: RHHBF - news ) 's Tarceva have been on the market for several years and provide a valuable treatment option for some lung cancer patients with a certain genetic mutation.
