The component that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - rose 0.8 percent, suggesting inventories will provide a boost to growth in the second quarter.\nThe economy contracted at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter and growth got off to a slow start in the second quarter, in part because of the lingering effects of a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector.\nBut data since then, including in job growth, suggest the economy is picking up steam.\nSales at wholesalers rose 0.3 percent in May, a slowdown from their big surge in April and less than the 0.6 percent increase expected by economists. Petroleum sales increased 4.3 percent in May, down from a revised 5.9 percent rise the prior month.\nAt May's sales pace it would take 1.29 months to clear shelves, the same as in April.
