Josh Robenstone Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey The federal government and its traditional business ally are at daggers drawn after Treasurer Joe Hockey took issue with criticisms by Business Council of Australia chief executive Catherine Livingstone about the weak state of political leadership.\nMr Hockey told a small business breakfast that it was \"easy to sit on the sidelines and to pass comments\" but Ms Livingstone's \"blanket attack on everyone\" was unhelpful to the reform cause.\nOn Wednesday, a renewed push by Mr Hockey to have the states reconsider their opposition to increasing the GST was dead by lunchtime when the federal opposition and premiers refused to budge.\nOn the same day, a draft proposal by Labor to price carbon was set upon by the government even though it was not actual policy.\nPreviously, the Australian Financial Review revealed the government dropped consideration of superannuation tax reform for political reasons. A Freedom of information request showed the government abandoned consideration because Labor proposed a policy of its own.\nMs Livingstone branded Wednesday ths week \"a low point for political leadership in Australia\".\n\"Within hours of the Treasurer outlining a compelling case for the need for fundamental tax reform and rebalancing of the tax mix, both major parties began ruling out key elements of sensible tax reform, including changes to the GST,\" she said.\n\"At a time of great economic uncertainty, Australia needs and deserves strong leadership, and the opportunity to discuss reform options as a community.\n \"Any policy reform is hard, but that is not an excuse for resiling from the challenge.\"\nMr Hockey said there was no point pursuing reforms, such as changes to the GST, if there was political resistance from the states and the federal Opposition.\n\"The Labor Party say there's no way they're going to agree to reform under any circumstances, whether it be at a State level where the State Premier is the beneficiary of a change in the GST, or be it at a Federal level where the Labor Party and the Greens have the capacity to block it in the Senate,\" he said.\n\"Well, I don't think we should spend an enormous amount of time debating that particular issue, when there are plenty of other issues to focus on.\n\"It's easy to sit on the sidelines and to pass comments, whoever you may be, but from our perspective we're getting on with the job of reforming not only the Australian economy, but facilitating the reform of the Australian economy.\"\nHe said everyone was entitled to participate in the debate but \"I'm not sure that a blanket attack on everyone is necessarily going to be helpful to the debate\".\nMs Livingstone's outburst follows similar calls from other figures. Earlier this week, her predecessor Tony Shepherd waned of the next three year term of Parliament being wasted like this one because of a reluctance to embrace economic reform.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-17T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T08:16:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
