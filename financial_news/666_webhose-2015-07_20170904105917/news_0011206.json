He is just one example of those seizing upon the early days of a newly emerging industry, a time ripe for anyone with an idea, a vision or a plan. \n\"We are inundated with requests for properties right now\" says 35-year-old Drinkwater. \"There are a lot of people who are normal, everyday, hardworking people who just want marijuana to be part of how they relax.\" \nWith recreational marijuana legal in four naturally beautiful U.S. states - Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska -- it didn't take long for travel businesses to take notice, and give birth to cannabis tourism . \nIn Colorado alone, there are numerous examples of this growing industry, which caters to the marijuana-seeking traveler. The state has witnessed the creation of everything from luxury limousine companies developed to chauffer people around while they enjoy smoking, to bed and breakfasts that cater to the weed smoking crowd and tour operators offering cannabis themed itineraries that include 4-star hotel stays, trips to farms, cooking classes, art museum outings and massages with THC-infused oils. \nThe legalization of marijuana has spawned an explosive \"cannabusiness\" market led by sophisticated \"ganja-preneurs,\" according to 2015 Spa & Wellness Trends report from Spafinder Wellness 365. \nTravelTHC, launched in April 2014, already lists hundreds of properties, ranging from entire estates to rustic cabins and luxurious ranches. (The site differentiates itself slightly from the Airbnb model in that none of its properties has a host currently living in the home.) And while TravelTHC may only offer accommodations in Colorado and Washington right now, Drinkwater and his partners, a group of five people who range in age from twentysomething to early 40s, hope to expand as legalization spreads across the country. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:22:08.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
