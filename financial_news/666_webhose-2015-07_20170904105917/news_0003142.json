View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150716005159/en/ Operator networks are demanding a more comprehensive approach to protect against advanced mobile threats, starting with a clear understanding of their threat vectors and vulnerabilities. As mobile networks increasingly become a target of abuse and exploitation, it is vital the industry is able to remain one step ahead and protect against individuals and organisations that pose a threat to either personal or national security. The recently revealed security threats to the SS7 network show how rogue access to this network is possible and a lack of end-to-end authentication is leaving operator networks vulnerable to new types of attacks. As seen in Ukraine in 2014, subscriber locations can be accurately pin-pointed, personal phone calls and messages monitored, network and subscriber data manipulated and defrauded, and user privacy and revenues from key services placed under threat.
