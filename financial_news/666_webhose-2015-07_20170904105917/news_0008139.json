Photo: Paul Jeffers\nThe second Bitcoin miner to try a listing on the ASX has said it will be a further two weeks before it can resubmit its prospectus after the corporate cop hit it with an interim stop order.\nOn Thursday, an employee of Melbourne-based Chinese company Bitcoin Group said it was still working on a new prospectus after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued the order on July 13.\n\"ASIC got back to us two weeks after we lodged it on June 29,\" he said. \"I can't disclose what problems they raised.\"\nThe original prospectus is no longer available.\nAdvertisement Bitcoin Group is following in the footsteps of bitcoin miner digitalBTC, which became the first publicly listed bitcoin company in the world via a reverse takeover on the ASX in June last year, raising $9.1 million in the process.\nBitcoin Group is looking to raise about $20 million at 20c a share and was due to list on the ASX on September 2. The company could not say whether ASIC's action would delay the listing.\nBitcoin miners solve complex mathematical equations to record a bitcoin transaction on its distributed ledger, known as the blockchain.\nBitcoin Group has powerful computers to do this work in seven sites across Australia, Iceland and China.\nChief executive Sam Lee runs a bitcoin arbitrage fund. The company has built an automated crypto-currency trading engine that moves money between major bitcoin exchanges when prices deviate from the historical average.\nA spokesman for ASIC confirmed the interim stop order, but would not say why this had been applied. Some of the reasons can include that the prospectus is not worded in a \"clear, concise and effective manner\". It could also be deemed to be misleading and deceptive.\nHe noted that ASIC had a run-in with Bitcoin Group in February, when it ordered the company to stop promoting its plan to list on Chinese social networking site Wechat.\nThe regulator said this could entice investors to commit money to the group without the benefit of a detailed prospectus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:21:36.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
