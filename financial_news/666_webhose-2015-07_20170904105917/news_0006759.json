The Indian stock markets have been range-bound and the major indices have dipped a little, compared to last week’s closing values. On Friday, the movements of the major indices were as follows: Over the week, on Monday, the stock market indices closed marginally in the red on the back of worries surrounding the monsoon progress, a likely troubled parliament session, and the upcoming monetary policy review. On Tuesday, lower-than-expected first-quarter results and the logjam on the first day of Parliament's monsoon session dampened the sentiments in the Indian equity markets. Major results like Infosys, HDFC Bank, Sun Pharma and Hindustan Unilever released on Tuesday had the biggest impact on stock- or sector-specific indices. Investors were also anxious about the ability of the government to pass key bills like Goods and Services Tax (GST) and land bill during the monsoon session. On Wednesday, investor's sentiments were buoyed after positive statements were made by the government, indicating political willingness to resolve the impasse on crucial legislations like the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the land bill. The major indices improved by more than 1% on just the positive indications from the government. On Thursday, political uncertainty continued. The logjam in parliament and anxiety surrounding a rate hike in the US subdued the Indian equity markets. Key economic data revealed a recovery in the US economy just before the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meet on July 29, which will give further clues as to when the rate hike might take place there. With higher interest rates in the US, the FPIs (Foreign Portfolio Investors) are expected to be led away from emerging markets such as India. On Friday, there were no negative macroeconomic cues, but the Parliament logjam on ethics in politics is continuing to cast a shadow over the market. India Vix closed at 15.46, down 0.40%. NSE turnover was at 81.03 crore.
