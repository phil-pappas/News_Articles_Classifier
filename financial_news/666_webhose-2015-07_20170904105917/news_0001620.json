This is done with the technology of the Octopus system. This solution not only offered an effective response team but also saved millions by replacing hundreds of in effective guards with 25 teams of 2 people riding the motorcycles.” \nBar Or added that “In addition we offer bank branch managers and certain employees, a mobile phone distress signal application for signaling in case of emergency.
