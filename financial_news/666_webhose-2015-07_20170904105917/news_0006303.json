They offer, it's said, unparalleled benefits to members when compared alongside the big, corporate bank you're using. But are credit unions always better than banks? The answer is no, they're not. But who are credit unions right for? And who is better off using a bigger, multinational bank? \nThe Benefits of Big Banks \nMike Sullivan, director of education with Take Charge America, says these days he does most of his banking with credit unions . But when we asked him to talk about this topic, he started wondering why he used credit unions and asking himself if that had always been the case. He realized that when he traveled more, he did more of his banking with bigger banks. \"I liked that if I showed up in Tokyo or London I could find a branch,\" he said. \"I could get help with financial affairs when I needed it.\" More Headlines The Best and Worst Things to Charge on Your Credit Card \nJohn Heath, managing attorney with LexingtonLaw, agrees that national banks offer far more in the way of convenience than local credit unions. \"There's a major convenience factor when you're traveling, whereas credit unions tend to be local.\" \nSullivan is quick to note that this rule of thumb applies to more than just international travel. It also applies right here in the states. \"If you travel in the U.S., you're more likely to find a branch of Citi or Chase than you are your local credit union,\" he said. He concedes that this is one area where bigger banks get a win over credit unions but also over smaller community banks. \nAnother area where big banks get the edge, according to Sullivan, is when it comes to credit cards . \"Credit unions don't have the same robust operations in rewards programs, acceptance and fraud protection,\" he said. \nHeath notes that credit unions tend to be more conservative than bigger banks when it comes to lending money than large banks. \"They're looking for higher credit scores and less risk,\" he says. \"We're still in that environment where lending is not what it used to be. But banks have become a bit more liberal.\" \nFinally, Sullivan thinks that, for the most part, the breadth of services that you get from bigger banks can give them a bit of an edge. \"You're more likely to find online deposits at a bigger bank,\" he said. \"Most credit unions don't offer much support for business. Some do, but for the most part they don't offer the same level of service.\" \nSo who are credit unions good for? \nThe Credit Union Advantage...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T21:53:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
