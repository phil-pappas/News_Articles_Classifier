Greece is offering spending cuts, pension savings and tax increases in return for a rescue worth at least 53.5 billion euros ($60 billion).\nTsipras wants to shore up domestic support with backing in Parliament that can also show resolve to European counterparts. Prospects of a deal to end almost half a year of confrontation between creditors and Greece’s anti-austerity Syriza-led government prompted the euro and stocks to surge on Friday.\n“What will now be crucial for Berlin is confirmation from the institutions that Greece’s own measures are sufficient to move the country towards debt sustainability,” Eurasia Group analysts including Mujtaba Rahman wrote in a note to clients. “From Germany’s vantage point, it is unclear how Tsipras can implement a package that is even more onerous than the one a majority of his population voted against last Sunday.”\nFor now, Tsipras may command broad support both from his ruling Syriza party and opposition lawmakers. The ‘Left Platform’ faction of the group will back the government’s proposals, Skai TV reported on Friday, without saying how it got the information. Three opposition parties -- Pasok, New Democracy and To Potami -- have all pledged to support it.\nMixed Response ‘If there’s broad support in Greece, it gives more credibility,’’ Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who will chair an emergency session of his euro-area counterparts in Brussels on Saturday, told reporters in The Hague. “But also then we have to see whether the proposals are good, if it gets Greece really out of the crisis.”\nAcross Europe, the response to the bailout plan has been mixed. French President Francois Hollande said in a rare Twitter post that its reform proposals were “serious, credible” and demonstrated Greece’s determination to stay in the euro area. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said the new offer “will really not be enough,” Reuters reported.\nThe package almost mirrored that from creditors on June 26 -- which was rejected by Greek voters in a July 5 referendum. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government said that discussions for that plan only covered a five-month extension whereas the new program request is for three years, so would have to include tougher conditions than addressed at the end of June.\n‘Not Quite’ “Our concern has always been the hardening position of Germany and Netherlands in the negotiations,” Michael Michaelides, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, wrote in a note to clients. “A deal, whilst now more likely, is not quite nailed.”\nBefore then, euro-zone officials await an assessment from the three creditor institutions, which may only arrive during the meeting of finance ministers on Saturday, according to Finnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb. Leaders are then due to meet on Sunday.\nThough has Tsipras ceded ground with his bailout proposal, he insists long-term debt needs to be made more manageable to allow Greece to recover from a crisis that has erased a quarter of its economy. He has a growing support base that includes the U.S., European Union President Donald Tusk and the IMF.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T22:36:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
