The Law Ministry is vetting the standards and a notification will be issued soon,” a senior Health Ministry official told PTI.\nThe new FSSAI standards are in harmony with the global food standards of Codex Alimentarius Commission, established by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation and World Health Organisation, the official said.\nFSSAI, under the aegis of Health Ministry, has fixed maximum limit for use of food additives in various food groups to ensure that the intake of additives does not exceed the acceptable daily intake. Similarly, it has set norms for use of ingredients in preparation of processed food items.\nAfter the Maggi noodles controversy, the FSSAI has stepped up measures to strengthen the quality standards for food products. It is reviewing the existing standards set for caffeine content, metal and toxic contaminants and other residues in the food products.\nThe regulator is also in the process of setting standards for imported food items to ensure safe products are sold in the domestic market.\nFirst Published on July 12, 2015 3:52 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-12T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T23:44:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
