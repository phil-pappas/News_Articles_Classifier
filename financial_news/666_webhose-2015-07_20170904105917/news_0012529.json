His book points out how badly governments fail at creating entrepreneurial hubs when they merely pour money into a market without reforming the legal system\nSteve Case , the founder of AOL AOL and an advocate for entrepreneurs globally and in come-from-behind markets in the United States, makes a similar case, and has argued for , in the U.S., immigration law reform and the JOBS act.\nThere are powerful — and probably more complicated — connections between women’s entrepreneurship and the law. Women entrepreneurs worldwide face an extraordinarily unlevel playing field. Fewer than a quarter of economies worldwide, 20 out of 128, treat women equally under the law, researchers looking at the World Bank’s database, Women, Business and the Law concluded in 2010.\nBut despite the fact that legal systems and cultural traditions stand in their paths in myriad ways that we are only beginning to understand, they are moving ahead. In 2012, the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) , in a survey of 67 countries, found that there were 126 million women starting or running businesses, and 98 million operating established business, those that had been around for more than 3.5 years.\nAnd women’s entrepreneurship is widely coming to be seen as the one of the best resources for spurring global economic growth, especially in countries that are behind. For instance, Goldman Sachs concluded in its report on investing in women :\n“Closing the credit gap for women-owned (small and medium businesses) in the BRICs and N-11 countries over the next few years could boost real income per capita growth rates in those countries by around 85bp on average. If the credit gap is closed by 2020, incomes per capita could be on average around 12% higher by 2030 across the BRICs and N-11, relative to our baseline scenario.”\nAs the report suggests, access to capital would make a big difference. The IFC’s program, Banking on Women, is funneling $813 million to banking institutions globally to help anchor loans to women, so that banks will secure enough to lend their own cash. “Most financial institutions want to see hard collateral,” said Jessical Schnabel, product head of the program. “Many women business owners have other kinds of collateral.”\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.babson.edu/Academics/centers/blank-center/global-research/gem/Documents/GEM%202012%20Womens%20Report.pdf", "http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/investing-in-women/gmi-report-pdf.pdf", "http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2-13-13CaseTestimony.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-30T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T22:38:12.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
