(NASDAQ: VVUS) (the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company commercializing and developing innovative, next-generation therapies to address unmet needs in obesity, sleep apnea and sexual health, today provided a business update, reported its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 and announced a restructuring plan. \n\"The U.S. market for branded anti-obesity pharmacotherapeutics has developed at a substantially lower rate than expected, held in check by a number of factors,\" said Seth H. Z. Fischer, CEO. \"As stated previously, we have watched this trend closely while controlling our costs throughout the first half of 2015, and we have undertaken a further review of all aspects of the Company's operations. In order to reallocate resources most efficiently in support of Qsymia and other projects, VIVUS is announcing, effective immediately, a corporate restructuring that will reduce headcount and expenses with an objective of achieving neutral or positive operating cash flows by year-end 2016. We will be reducing our Qsymia sales force to fifty territories and streamlining further our headquarters staff. We believe that this cost-saving restructuring is timely, prudent and consistent with evolving obesity market realities and the opportunity as it currently exists. Going forward, we will continue to monitor market conditions for any positive developments with physicians, payors, and patients that may indicate an increased investment is warranted.\" \nMr. Fischer continued, \"We are working with leading cardiovascular outcome trial experts in planning substantial revisions to the original design and execution of the FDA-required Qsymia cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) known as AQCLAIM, with the goal of reducing costs while also fulfilling the requirement of further demonstrating the long-term cardiovascular safety of Qsymia. We met recently with the FDA to provide a CVOT program update. This dialog is ongoing, and we are committed to involving the FDA in reviewing alternative proposals that will satisfy the existing requirements.\" \nVIVUS is actively pursuing a commercial partnership for avanafil in Latin America, and the Company plans to make an announcement as soon as an alliance is secured. VIVUS is pleased with the plans being executed currently by its STENDRA® and SPEDRA™ commercialization partners to integrate the 15-minute onset of action data into their promotional campaigns. \nSecond Quarter 2015 Financial Results Total revenue was $23.0 million in the current quarter, compared to $21.9 million in the second quarter of 2014. Of the total revenue, net product revenue was $14.0 million from sales of Qsymia in the current quarter, compared to $11.0 million in the second quarter of 2014. In addition, under our commercialization agreements for STENDRA® or SPEDRA™, we recognized $8.1 million in supply revenue in the current quarter, compared to $5.7 million in the second quarter of 2014. We also recognized $0.9 million in royalty revenue in the current quarter, compared to $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. \nApproximately 152,000 Qsymia prescriptions were dispensed in the current quarter, compared to 138,000 in the second quarter of 2014. \nTotal cost of goods sold, excluding inventory impairment, was $9.9 million in the current quarter, compared to $7.0 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase was due primarily to the cost of STENDRA supply in proportion to the increase in supply revenue. \nTotal selling, general and administrative expense was $22.2 million in the current quarter, compared to $28.3 million in the second quarter of 2014. Selling and marketing expense for the commercialization of Qsymia totaled $15.3 million in the current quarter, compared to $17.4 million in the second quarter of 2014. The total decrease was due primarily to the realignment of our sales force, refinement of our marketing and promotional programs, and continued cost cutting initiatives. \nTotal research and development expense was $2.6 million in the current quarter, compared to $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. The fluctuation was due primarily to the timing of clinical projects. \nTotal inventory impairment charges of $29.5 million in the current quarter consisted primarily of excess raw material inventory for Qsymia. In conjunction with our restructuring plan, approximately 60 job positions, including sales force personnel, will be eliminated and consequently, our future sales forecast for Qsymia will be reduced and will result in excess inventory. In accordance with GAAP, in addition to the inventory impairment charge recorded in the current quarter, we will incur additional charges for severance and facility closure of approximately $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. We expect annual savings of approximately $14.4 million in operating expenses beginning in fiscal year 2016. \nNet loss, excluding inventory impairment charges of $29.5 million, was $19.8 million, or $0.19 net loss per share, in the current quarter, compared to a net loss of $25.8 million, or $0.25 net loss per share, in the second quarter of 2014. \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Available-for-Sale Securities Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities (collectively cash) totaled $274.2 million at June 30, 2015, as compared to $299.6 million at December 31, 2014. The decrease was due primarily to cash used in operating activities and repayment of debt. \nRecent Business Update On May 14, 2015, we announced presentations of new Qsymia clinical and pharmacoeconomic analyses at the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists 24th Annual Scientific and Clinical Congress (May 13-17, 2015; Nashville) and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research 20th Annual International Meeting (May 16-20, 2015; Philadelphia). \nWe recently initiated a specialty sales force co-promotion pilot program with Kadmon Corporation intended to introduce Qsymia to liver disease specialists. This pilot program will be evaluated at year-end 2015. \nNote to Investors As previously announced, VIVUS will hold a conference call and an audio webcast to discuss the second quarter ended June 30, 2015 financial results today, July 30, 2015, beginning at 4:30PM Eastern Time.

If you experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, and call a doctor right away. \nSudden decrease or loss of hearing has been rarely reported in people taking PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA.
