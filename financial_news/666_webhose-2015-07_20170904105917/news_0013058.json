Runways UK, which supports new aviation capacity in the South East (HKSE: 0726.HK - news ) of England, was holding a two-day conference at the hotel discussing Sir Howard's Heathrow decision. \nOne campaigner complained of an injured wrist as he was removed by a guard. Another shouted \"we can't expand aviation and have a safe future, we have a choice between the two\" before being ejected. \nSir Howard Davies, the chairman of the Airports Commission \nLord Digby Jones, who hosted the dinner, also attempted to calm the situation and police were called to the scene. \nThe protesters stormed into the dining room just after Sir Howard finished a speech in which he assessed political and media reaction to the commission's recommendation last week that a new, £17.6bn runway be built at Heathrow. Opponents of the proposal, which is being examined by the Government, are concerned about the air pollution and noise it would cause to local communities. \nSir Howard said he took a \"dim view\" of Zac Goldsmith's assertion that he had decided to back Heathrow expansion before the commission had even begun, which he said was untrue. Mr Goldsmith, who is the MP for Richmond (Taiwan OTC: 2743.TWO - news ) , is vehemently against the runway being built. \nSir Howard also lambasted Boris Johnson's claim that the Heathrow runway was \"the sort of thing you could have got away with in China in the 1950s\" . He said the massive expenditure and disruption that would have been caused by the Mayor of London's unsuccessful proposal for a Thames Estuary airport was more akin to fifties China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T13:06:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
