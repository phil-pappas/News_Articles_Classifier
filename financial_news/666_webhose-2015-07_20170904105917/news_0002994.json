The purchase will be charged on the user's Uber account and the handset will be delivered shortly thereafter to his or her physical location.\nFor Xiaomi, a company renowned for its marketing savvy, the partnership could generate more buzz for a product launch at a time when it is looking to expand rapidly into markets like Southeast Asia and India.
