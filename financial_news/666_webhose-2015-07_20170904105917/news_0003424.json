Or, in this case, don’t change it. \nLinkedIn is dealing with some very unhappy users after making it more difficult for them to export contacts. \nBusiness Insider reports that users can still download their contacts for the site, but it now takes longer. As of Thursday, LinkedIn users had to get an archive of their data to do the procedure, and that can reportedly can take up to 72 hours. Before, users could download user contact information immediately. \n“Our members can continue to easily request an export all of the data LinkedIn has stored on their account, by visiting our help center ,” LinkedIn told Business Insider. \nThe publication sifted through social media to find some users unhappy with the changed process to easily export their contacts : this is absolutely horrible, even by @LinkedIn ’s normal walled garden standards: https://t.co/AVAlQv03Qn \n— Mitali Pattnaik (@mitali) July 24, 2015 whoa – scumbaggery at its finest RT @bartlorang : Wow. @LinkedIn Just Removed the Ability to Export YOUR Contacts https://t.co/1WwIyOchE2 \n— Chris Conrey (@conrey) July 23, 2015 Seems @LinkedIn think it's OK now to make you wait 3 days to export your contacts.

In short, what’s really changing here is that you can no longer export your contacts immediately. Now you have to get them as part of a data archive request, which can take up to three days.
