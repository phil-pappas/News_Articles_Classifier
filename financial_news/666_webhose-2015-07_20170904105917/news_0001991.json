With e-commerce becoming more mainstream, it is encouraging several entrepreneurs to set up businesses online,” SMEcorner founder and chief executive Samir Bhatia told PTI.\nSMECorner has tied up with Snapdeal, Flipkart, eBay, Paytm, among other e-commerce players to play a catalyst role to secure easier loans for sellers, he said.\nIt has also partnered with several leading NBFCs.\nLendingkart, which recently raised USD 10 million from PE funding has also tied up with Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon to offer easier loans to sellers who want funds in excess of Rs 1 lakh.\nAccording to a recent study by the Union MSME ministry, only 6 per cent small businesses get finance from organised lenders, indicating the difficulty of small businesses to get loans.\nIn May, the nation’s largest lender State Bank of India also jumped on to the bandwagon and tied up with Amazon India to help e-commerce sellers access easy loans.\nSecuring loans for sellers is high on priority for the competing online marketplaces.\nLast year, eBay had tied up with the Confederation of All-India Traders (CAIT) representing self-employed traders.\nCAIT has a membership of over six crore traders.\nPartnering with SMEcorner is expected to fulfil the funding needs of more than 50,000 sellers estimated to be listed on eBay.\nBoth Flipkart and Amazon had stated earlier this year that they aimed to more than double the number of sellers on their platforms to 1 lakh each by the end of the year, while Snapdeal has targeted to get over 10 lakh sellers on board over the next three years.\n 13, 2015 5:40 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T13:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:16:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
