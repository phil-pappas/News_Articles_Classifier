Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Global financial markets outside Europe responded in a relatively composed manner to Greece's historic no vote against harsh austerity demands by European lenders, as investors bet that the European Central Bank would unleash extra money printing in the event of a Greek debt default or exit from the eurozone.\nOn Wall Street, the US S&P 500 finished down 0.39 per cent on Monday. In London, losses were contained to 0.76 per cent on the FTSE 100, indicating that international investors are downplaying the global systemic risks of any contagion from a possible \"Grexit\".\nThe steeper falls on European exchanges, including the 2.2 per cent slump in the Euro Stoxx 50, were more substantive. Investors dumped banks in Italy, where there are concerns that anti-austerity political parties will use Greece's no vote as a template for domestic political action.\nAs Greece and its European creditors prepared to resume tough negotiations, the former US Ambassador to Greece, Daniel Speckhard, said the reasonably overall calm market reaction would assist European leaders in the debate.\n\"The Europeans will be watching the markets and I think if the markets are calm, they're going to be fairly tough with Greece,\" said Mr Speckhard, now a non-resident senior fellow at Brookings Institution in Washington.\nTalk in the markets has now turned to the fallout if Greece and its European creditors fail to reach a compromise on Athens' crippling debts.\nTraders are pricing in the chances of ECB president Mario Draghi ramping up the central bank's 1.1 trillion euro asset purchases campaign to offset any negative effects.\nRiverFront Investment Group chief investment officer Michael Jones said if a Grexit occurred, he was betting the ECB would unleash further stimulus that would boost stocks.\n \"They're going to print money to ease the impact on the peripheral economies, which means further downside on the euro [currency] but upside for equity markets,\" Mr Jones said on CNBC.\nWells Fargo Securities institutional equity strategist Gina Martin Adams said investors should wait for the ECB or US Federal Reserve to \"save the day\" before taking advantage of the dip in US stock prices.\nSpeaking in the global financial capital of New York, former Greek prime minister from 2009 to 2011, George Papandreou, said he had heard that markets had already factored in Greece exiting the eurozone.\nThe US S&P 500 finished down 0.39 per cent in New York on Monday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.26 per cent and the tech heavy Nasdaq 0.34 per cent weaker.\nGermany's DAX lost 1.52 per cent, France's CAC 40 dropped 2.01 per cent and Italy's major bourse crashed 4.03 per cent.\nAfter slumping 12.1 per cent last week on fears of a bubble in Chinese stocks, the Shanghai composite's slide was halted on Monday after Beijing introduced emergency measures to prop up the market, including stopping new equity issuances and forcing the central bank to extend credit to brokers.. The Shanghai Composite Index ended up 2.4 per cent, after jumping almost 7 per cent in earlier trade.\nA flight to safety pushed up the US dollar against the euro to $US1.1058 on Monday in the US. The rush into safe haven assets caused the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond to fall to 2.28 per cent, down 0.10 of a percentage point.\nBessemer Trust chief investment officer Rebecca Patterson said US markets were holding up because the possibility of Greece leaving the euro has been talked about for years.\n\"The risk of contagion to make it a European Lehman [Brothers] moment, is much, much smaller than a few years ago,\" she said.\nSince Greece's sovereign debt crisis last flared up in 2012, the ECB has unloaded a huge money printing program. The European economy is also relatively stronger, foreign bank exposure to Greece has been substantially cut and the possibility of contagion into other countries has diminished.\nMonday's sell off was tempered by risk averse investors dumping stocks before Sunday's resounding 61 per cent Greek vote against the tax rises and pension cuts demanded by European lenders.\nEuropean stocks fell 2.9 per cent last week, with France down 4.4 per cent and Germany shedding 3.4 per cent. The risk aversion spread to the US where the S&P 500 fell 1.2 per cent before the long-weekend for Independence Day.", "external_links": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/greece_details_hype/index.html", "https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:13:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
