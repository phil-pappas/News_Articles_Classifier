Analysts at HSBC downgraded the company to a “hold” last week because of “the unclear outlook in Nigeria”. \nNigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan (L) presents a gift to president-elect Muhammadu Buhari at the presidential villa in Abuja \nAround 50pc of PZ Cusson’s personal care brands, which also include Sanctuary toiletries, are now sold in high street discount chains such as Poundland and B&M. Bargain hunters have prompted the company to develop a new low-cost range. \nThe company is also expected to reveal the extent of the impact on the business from the economic crisis in Greece where it is the biggest olive oil brand. \nBrandon Leigh, finance director, told The Daily Telegraph earlier this month that its Greek arm would be fairly resilient as olive oil was essential to the Greeks’ diet and the last thing that they would cut from their shopping baskets. \nHowever, the business, which sells olive oil and feta cheese under its Minerva brand and dates back to the 1900s, is expected to have limited impact as it only accounts for 3pc of overall sales.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T23:58:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
