Through this partnership, the institutions are working with local banks in emerging markets to catalyze existing capital for women-owned SMEs by addressing barriers in the lending market such as unsuitable product offerings and credit terms. For example, in the past year, the facility began collaborating with Chase Bank Kenya Ltd, the only bank with dedicated branches for women in Kenya, to expand their portfolio of loans to women-owned SMEs. The Facility is also working with local banks in eight other countries, including Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, India, Indonesia and Laos. \n\"With a development finance portfolio reaching over 100 countries worldwide, OPIC aims to create inclusive, bottom-up economic growth across the developing world,\" said Elizabeth Littlefield, OPIC's President and CEO. \"This Goldman Sachs initiative is well-aligned with OPIC's mission, and I look forward to the possibilities that can result from OPIC and IFC's participation in it.

Addressing that need will create jobs and improves lives for future generations. Partnerships like this are the key to making it happen.' said Jin-Yong Cai, Executive Vice President and CEO, IFC. \nSOURCE International Finance Corporation (IFC) Kenya \nIn October 2013, a month after the Westgate Mall attack, the same elite American Seal Team Six that had killed Osama bin … see more » Copyright © 2015 PR Newswire.
