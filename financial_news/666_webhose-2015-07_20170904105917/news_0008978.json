Tim Wimborne Share on twitter by Jens Meyer Citi has upgraded BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to a buy, from neutral, after shares in the two miners fell sharply over the past weeks due to rising fears of a 'Grexit', China's fragile share market and a tumbling iron ore price.\nBut the bank also cut the target price on both stocks to $29 for BHP (previously $30) and $58 for Rio (from $60), due to a predicted fall in earnings after base metals and oil prices fell in a note to clients today.\n\"Despite the upgrades to buy, we see significant risks remain given the pressure on commodity prices from global uncertainty,\" Citi says.\nThe US investment bank notes that dividends yields of above 6 per cent for both stocks are very attractive in a low yield environment. Yields are \"likely to become more attractive if the Aussie dollar continues to fall as progressive dividend policies are US$ based\".\nHowever, Citi warns that recent share price falls have shown that while yield provides support, it does not create a floor.\nThe economists have revised down global growth forecasts due to disappointing growth in both advanced economies and emerging markets.\nCiti expects Chinese demand for commodities to remain under pressure in the third quarter as the economy transitions and credit has been tight.\n\"However, an improving real estate market and additional efforts to loosen monetary policy could yield benefits late in 2015 and in early 2016, especially for copper and some other base metals; in contrast, we expect bulk prices to remain under pressure.\"\n Both shares were leading a sharemarket rally on Friday after the iron ore price bounced nearly 10 per cent , with BHP up 2.9 per cent at $26.62 and Rio rising 2.65 per cent to $52.24.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/markets/west-australian-of-the-year-david-flanagan-is-bullish-on-iron-ore-20150709-gi8rsm.html", "https://twitter.com/@jemeyx"], "published": "2015-07-10T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:05:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
