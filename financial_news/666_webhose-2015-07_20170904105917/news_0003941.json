Talks could still fall apart as the car maker consortium of BMW, Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler and Audi hammers out final details such as intellectual property rights with Nokia, the people said. Nokia has sought as much as 4bn for the unit, called HERE, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nRepresentatives for the car makers and a spokesman for Espoo, Finland-based Nokia declined to comment.\n\nBMW, Audi and Mercedes are typically fierce competitors as they vie with one another for the global lead in luxury-car sales. While they do cooperate from time to time, teaming up on an acquisition of this scale would be unprecedented. With Google testing its own self-driving cars, the bid for HERE shows the importance of securing access to the detailed maps that smart vehicles of the future will require.\n\nNokia's shares rose as much as 0.9% to ‚6.39, reversing earlier losses, and were up 0.2% at 1:35pm in Helsinki.\n\nMapping competitor TomTom of the Netherlands curbed losses of as much as 3.7% to trade 0.8% lower in Amsterdam. Harold Goddijn, chief executive officer of TomTom, earlier in the day declined to comment on Nokia's negotiations and whether his company was also talking to any potential takeover candidates.\n\nThe carmakers, which are keen to protect driver data from Google, first approached Nokia about a sale. As a key source of HERE's revenue, they've had the upper hand in the competition to acquire the business. HERE supplies maps data to about 80% of cars with in-dash navigation systems in North America and Europe.\n\nOther companies interested in HERE have included Apax Partners and Uber Technologies, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nThe sale would complete Nokia's transformation into a provider of wireless-network equipment, after its exit from mobile phones in 2014. The company agreed to buy rival network maker Alcatel-Lucent for ‚15.6bn (16.9bn) in April to better compete with Huawei Technologies Co and Ericsson AB.\n\nWhile digital maps have gained users, Nokia's foray into the business didn't live up to expectations. The company built its maps unit by buying Navteq Corp for 8.1bn in 2008, and also acquired other location-technology companies.\n\nHERE provided mapping data for a 32-acre (13-hectare) simulated city being used to test self-driving cars in Michigan. TomTom today said that German auto-parts supplier Robert Bosch is using its high-precision maps in automated test vehicles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T18:02:21.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
