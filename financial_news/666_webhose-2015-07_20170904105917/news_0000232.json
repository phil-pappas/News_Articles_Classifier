Sean Davey by Joanna Mather Director churn resulting from the government's new rules for superannuation boards could cost up to $168 million, which will be borne by members of non-profit funds.\nThe $168 million figure, calculated by lobby group Industry Super Australia, is larger than earlier estimates for likely costs associated with recruiting new directors for 100 funds.\nThe federal government has put forward draft legislation mandating that super funds have one-third of independent directors and an independent chair.\nIndustry Super said the changes would be costly, with 359 trustee positions likely to be affected.\nThe group has estimated the costs of recruiting and training new directors, as well as the higher fees charged by independent directors, at somewhere between $89 million and $168 million over the five-year transition period.\n\"Because the vast majority of costs will be incurred by not-for-profit funds, this burden will fall directly on their members,\" Industry Super public affairs director Matthew Linden said.\nBut Australian Institute of Company Directors chief executive John Brogden said the cost argument was nonsense because directors would be happy to take whatever fees were offered.\n\"I think there will be many who will be happy to take the fee because superannuation is a very interesting area of business and policy,\" said Mr Brogden, whose previous role was as head of the lobby group representing retail super funds.\n \"To suggest that people will only accept higher fees is a pretty ridiculous argument.\"\nAICD supports the changes proposed by the government, which has said having more independent directors on the boards of super funds managing $1.2 trillion in assets is in line with international best practice.\nThe changes target representative trustee funds, which manage $715 million in assets.\nThese include industry, corporate and public sector funds.\nIndustry Super is critical of the fact the government is proposing such a big change but has not released a regulatory impact statement showing the costs and red tape involved.\nBut Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said regulatory impact statements were released when legislation was introduced to parliament, which had not yet occurred.\n\"The key driver of this reform is to improve governance in the $2 trillion superannuation sector and to produce better outcomes for members, and these changes will do just that,\" he said.\nUnlike retail funds, which are owned by banks and other financial services-type companies, representative trustee funds have a long-standing governance structure whereby representatives of employers and employees are equally represented on the the board.\nIndustry Super said 64 independent chairs would have be appointed. A further 295 directors would have to be brought in as replacements for existing directors. There would also be additional 48 director positions created. This last figure comes from the fact that some boards will opt to grow in size to accommodate existing directors while adding new independent ones.\nThe Financial Services Council, representing retail funds, has already shoehorned its members into similar arrangements by making them a condition of membership. The council has said the government's new laws do not go far enough and a list of prohibited relationships should be drawn up to prevent conflicts of interest.\nAs the Australian Financial Review reported on Monday, ISA claims the new rules will fundamentally undermine a system of governance that has produced better outcomes for members than for-profit retail funds. This is because the legislation will no longer contain a requirement for equal representation.\nAnother industry group, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, previously estimated that 200 directors would have to be replaced, along with 40 chairmen. This would likely cost $20 million in the first year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:18:50.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
