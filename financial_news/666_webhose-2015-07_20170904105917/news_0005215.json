This would take estimated FCF for the new company to ~$900 million following the deal’s completion. Shareholder returns: Earnings per share and dividends \nThe newly formed combination would be able to raise its dividend to $0.50 per share. Coty paid an annual dividend of $0.20 per share in fiscal 2014. \nThe deal is expected to be immediately accretive to the EPS (earnings per share) of the newly formed entity. EPS would rise by ~$0.83 per share. But transaction costs, share issuance costs, and interest expenses are estimated to reduce EPS by $0.58 to $0.65 per share. \nAs discussed in the previous article in this series, Coty expects cost savings and synergies from the deal to total about $150 million, effective in year three onward. These savings are expected to raise the EPS by $0.15 per share annually. \nCOTY generated EPS of $0.48 in fiscal 2014. The company expects to generate EPS of between $0.95 and $0.98 per share in fiscal 2015, ended June 30, 2015. \nIncluding the $400 million in cost savings realized immediately after the deal closes, and an additional $150 million in annual cost synergies realized by the end of year three, pro forma EPS for the combined entity would come in at between $1.28 and $1.37. That’s about 30% to 44% higher than estimates for Coty in fiscal 2015. Growth comparisons \nInorganic growth via acquisitions has lately figured prominently in the strategies favored by beauty product firms. Peers Estée Lauder (EL) and Inter Parfums (IPAR) have been active acquirers. Estée Lauder (EL) has in fact been involved in several acquisitions in 2014 and 2015. And IPAR bought Rochas from Procter & Gamble this March. \nCoty’s adjusted EPS has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 36.7% over the last five years. Here’s how its peers have fared in that time frame: 15.6% – Nu Skin Enterprises (NUS) 31.2% – Estée Lauder (EL) 3.9% – Procter & Gamble (PG) 3.8% – Inter Parfums (IPAR) \nCoty, Estée Lauder, and Nu Skin Enterprises together constitute 0.1% of the portfolio holdings of the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (IWB) and 0.2% of the holdings in the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (IWF).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T16:51:12.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
