Nic Walker Share on twitter by Sue Mitchell Almost a year after outlaying $2.1 billion for David Jones, South African retailer Woolworths is preparing to sell two of its landmark central business district stores to fund hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in IT systems, stores and new food venues – reversing years of underinvestment at Australia's oldest department store.\nWoolworths chief executive and David Jones chairman Ian Moir has confirmed that David Jones was close to making a decision to sell one of its two Sydney CBD stores and one of its two Melbourne stores in deals which could raise almost $400 million.\n\"We'd look at rationalising down to two, expanding in each but investing a significant part of any proceeds of the sale of the two we decide to part with back into creating the two best department stores in the southern hemisphere,\" Mr Moir.\nThe proceeds would be invested into new financial, merchandise and customer relationship management systems, a new customer loyalty and financial services program, store refurbishments, improved visual merchandising and overhauling David Jones' four ageing food halls – lifting Woolworths' investment in David Jones to more than $2.5 billion over the next few years..\n\"It's fair to say that… there was significant underinvestment in the systems in David Jones,\" Mr Moir told Fairfax Media after addressing an Australia Israel Chamber of Commerce lunch in Sydney on Wednesday.\n\"We've come in with a different approach, and perhaps with deeper pockets, and a belief that we can transform the business through this expenditure and we'll get a good return on this expenditure,\" he said. \"There's nothing I've seen so far would cause me to change my mind on that.\"\nWoolworths remained on \"on track\" to lift David Jones earnings by between $130 million and $170 million over the next five years, as forecast at the time of the takeover, and was confident of eventually achieving cost of capital, despite the additional investments.\n\"All the metrics we set at the time [of the takeover] are still appropriate – we are ahead of where we expected to be in both quantum and timing but the end result we're still confident we'll be in the ballpark, even with extra investment, because we always envisaged that,\" Mr Moir said.\n Strong sales growth Last week, Mr Moir revealed that David Jones had posted its strongest sales growth in eight years – silencing critics who feared its strategy to devote more space to mid-market brands such as Witchery, Trenery, Country Road, Seed and FCUK would alienate its affluent customers.\nTotal sales rose 6.4 per cent and second-half sales by more than 10 per cent, fuelled by the introduction of Country Road's four brands into all 38 stores, the removal of about 80 underperforming womenswear brands, and better customer service.\nDavid Jones has also widened its private label range, introducing Woolworths' Studio W and RE: denim brands into stores in the last week, ahead of a formal launch next month.\nMr Moir is confident the surge in sales is not a \"flash in the pan\" and expects David Jones to continue to gain market share from rivals such as Myer and specialty retailers.\n\"I think we are capable of really building strong sustainable growth over time in the David Jones business by doing all the things we said we'd do – we wouldn't have bought the business for $2.1 billion if we didn't think we could drive the top line and significantly improve profitability,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Moir is cautious about the impact on spending of increasing the GST to 15 per cent.\n\"I've lived through a few introductions of either VAT or GST and the reality is you have a short-term rush of spending before it's introduced then a decline over time,\" he said.\nMr Moir also said David Jones would consider opening stand-alone gourmet food stores after spending at least $8 million fixing its existing food halls – confirming a report in Fairfax Media last month .\n\"We need to fix what we've got – we need to improve the quality, improve the presentation and improve the mix and quite frankly have a much better food offer than we have currently,\" he said.\n\"If that works and resonates and we see success with it we'll look at some small stand-alone offerings,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/suemitchellafr", "http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/woolworths-vs-woolworths-djs-new-owner-to-overhaul-food-business-20150625-ghwgqo.html"], "published": "2015-07-22T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:11:52.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
