Waiting too long, on the other hand, might force the Fed to tighten at a faster pace to keep the economy from overheating.\n“My own preference would be to be able proceed to tighten in a prudent and gradual manner,” she said.\nYellen’s comments this week were consistent with her often-stated advice to investors: the date of liftoff matters less than the subsequent pace of increases. And she has assured them that those increases would be measured.\nThe concern that tightening prematurely could throw the recovery off track is one reason why the federal funds rate has been kept near zero as long it has, Yellen said.\n“We also want to be careful not to tighten too late because, if we do that, arguably we could overshoot both of our goals and be faced with this situation where we would then need to tighten monetary policy in a very sharp way that could be disruptive,” she told lawmakers.\nUnexpected Blow Yellen said there’s another disadvantage to holding the main rate near zero: It leaves the central bank little room to respond to an unexpected blow to the economy.\n“If there is a negative shock to the economy with interest rates pinned at zero, we don’t have great scope to respond by loosening policy further, whereas with a positive shock of course we can tighten monetary policy,” she said.\nAs she spoke, investors judged the risk of a shock from overseas was diminishing, pushing U.S. stocks higher after Greek lawmakers passed a bailout agreement.\nThe Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.8 percent on Thursday to 2,124.29 at its close in New York, within 0.3 percent of its record. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed at 2.35 percent. Trading in federal funds futures indicated that investors increased their bets that the Fed would tighten in September.\nYellen offered other reasons for an upbeat assessment of the economy in her testimony Thursday. She said the job market is returning to a “more normal state,” even though the 5.3 percent unemployment rate understates the degree of slack. And she expects to see further gains in wages.\nT-Shirts Printed Fed officials say they will let the latest data on employment and inflation guide their decision on when to raise rates. To drive the point home, the San Francisco Fed has printed T-shirts with the message: “Monetary Policy -- It’s Data Dependent.”\nHow the Federal Open Market Committee will weigh the data over coming months is a matter of debate among economists.\nDana Saporta, a U.S. economist at Credit Suisse in New York, said that Yellen’s views already take account of an unexpected drop in retail sales in June and a decline in some commodity prices, including crude oil, which was trading at $50.91 late Thursday, down from $59.47 at the end of June. Lower oil prices tend to hold down inflation, which has lingered below the Fed’s 2 percent goal for more than three years.\nModerate Growth Saporta said even if the economy is in a period of moderate growth two months from now, central bankers may raise the benchmark rate.\n“The Fed is clearly trying to tell us that subject to the data over the next two months they are leaning toward modestly reducing accommodation, perhaps as soon as September,” she said.\nNot everyone agrees. Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University, said the Fed will have to wait until December because U.S. consumer spending and overseas demand remain too weak.\n“They have to have clear evidence the economy is growing above potential,” said Dawan. “Where is the growth in the world?”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T02:33:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
