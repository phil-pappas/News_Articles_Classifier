Someone is going to be wrong.\nA day after the NAB business survey showed that confidence levels were at their highest level in 21 months, prompting calls that it was a turning point for the economy, the Westpac Melbourne Institute index showed consumers are still down in the dumps.\nIndeed, earlier this week the ANZ Roy Morgan consumer confidence numbers showed that consumers were now more concerned about the medium term outlook for the economy than they were during the global financial crisis.\nGlobal fund managers must also be nervous if the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey is any guide.\nThe survey shows investors haven't had this much cash in their portfolios since the end of 2008, a few months after Lehman Brothers went bust.\nSo, if consumers aren't spending, and are on the cautious side, how can business be so upbeat and confident?\nMaybe business is expecting the concerns consumers have about Greece won't last and a repeat of what happened in 2011 is on the cards.\nBack then the Westpac index also took a dive on the European crisis and concerns that Greece would exit the union, but then it rebounded sharply.\n Still, for 15 months out of the past 17 months the Westpac consumer index has fallen below 100 points, indicating there are more pessimists out there than optimists.\nYet the NAB Business Survey is among the best leading indicators on the economy.\nThe accompanying graph from Royal Bank of Canada's Su-Lin Ong shows that if \"history is any guide, business confidence may struggle to strengthen or retain these levels\".\nIt's not out of the question that the two surveys might continue to be out of kilter for a few months to come. It happened towards the end of 2013 and early in 2014 when consumers were more upbeat before it faded out towards the end of last year.\n\"We admit to being surprised by the rise in business confidence in June to its highest level since the period around the change of federal government in September 2013. With the exception of this period and the first six months of the new government, business confidence has largely languished below its long-run trend for much of the last four to five years,\" said Ong.\nInterest-rate traders are still toying with the chance that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut rates again from their current record low of 2 per cent.\nBut Westpac's chief economist, Bill Evans, who has called the past few moves in rates better than most, thinks rates are on hold until the end of 2016 despite this latest survey.\nThere are still valid reasons why consumers are so nervous, including the high level of household debt, the small chance of getting a pay rise any time soon and the falling Australian dollar, which can dent confidence because it reduces our purchasing power.\nIndeed, it's one reason why the RBA has cut rates, and rings true as the terms of trade retreat from all-time highs.\nOng thinks that one reason why business is so confident is the small business initiative from the federal budget, which they have high hopes for.\nThe other possibility is that record-low rates and the $A closer to US74Â¢ are slowly giving some support to business confidence.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-15T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:04:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
