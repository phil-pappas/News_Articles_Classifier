Therefore private airlines like Skywise will do their best to ensure, not only the survival, but also the viability and progressive profitability of the business,” said Tabassum Qadir, Co-Chairperson. \nRecently, Mango announced plans to expand its regional routes and remain the fastest-growing low-cost carrier in Africa to operate with the lowest cost base. \nMango, a 100 percent subsidiary of loss-making SAA, operates with a cost base that is 50 percent lower than SAA’s main fleet. \n– CAJ News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T00:48:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
