Michael Mucci Share on twitter by Philip Baker Bank shares have been under the pump since April, but investors snapped them up after news that although they will still have to raise billions to fall in line with global standards, they have been given breathing space compared with other banks around the world .\nSo does that mean the worst is over for the banks?\nWell, it did fpr most of Monday when gains in the major banks helped spark a rally in the sharemarket, turning a 35 point loss in the major S&P ASX 200 index in early morning trading, into a 40-odd point gain by the afternoon session, before closing down 18 points.\nIndeed, for a time traders' pulses raced faster as the sharemarket extended its recent recovery despite the Greece issue that is still unresolved .\nBut smart investors should be asking if it is merely another rush from \"risk off\" to \"risk on\" by short-term traders.\nThese short-term flurries may be good for a 5 to 10 per cent move in the market, but there is no guarantee they necessarily signal the solution to the really big investment questions.\nThe bank index is still down 13.5 per cent since the high point in April compared with an 8 per cent fall in the major index.\nDeutsche Bank's analyst Andrew Triggs has released a series of charts that value the major banks on all sorts of different measures.\n Not surprisingly, they throw off all sorts of different signals.\nFirst up, he has ANZ and Westpac as his best picks along with the Bank of Queensland, while he's not as keen on the Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank.\nHe says the major banks as a whole are slightly on the cheap side when investors compare their average price earnings ratio with the PE of the industrial sector over the past five years, but some are cheaper than others.\nAs one of the accompanying graphs show, ANZ and Westpac are trading at much larger discounts to their average PEs of the past five years while CBA is pretty much in line with its average PE, and NAB with just a small discount of about 2 per cent.\nTriggs notes that from an absolute perspective, the majors are trading about 12 per cent above the five-year average on a one-year forward PE valuation, but there is decent support for them when looking at their relative yields.\nAlthough the average one-year forward dividend yield of 5.7 per cent for the major banks is below the five-year average of 6.3 per cent and below the 10-year average of 6.1 per cent, it looks good when compared with the 90-day bank bill over the past five and 10 years.\nBut the banks are trading on a forward PE of about 13.2 times earnings and that compares with an average PE over the past five years of 11.8 times and over the past decade of 12.1 times. When the golden run of the banks started back in 2011 the PE was closer to 9 times so they are still looking expensive.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhilABaker"], "published": "2015-07-13T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:02:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
