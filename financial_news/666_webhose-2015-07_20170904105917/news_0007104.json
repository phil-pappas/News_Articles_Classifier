The S&P 500 ended less than 3 points from its record close on May 21.\n\"The decline in gold prices is consistent with the drop in the VIX and the rise in equities that took the Nasdaq to a record high,\" Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management said in a note to clients.\n\"It signals to FX traders that there is a sense of calm in the markets,\" she said.\nPart of that calm is due to a more stable situation in Greece, where banks reopened as Athens began the process of paying off billions of euros owed to international creditors after it agreed to a new reform plan in exchange for another bailout to keep it in the euro zone.\nThe dollar jumped to its highest since April 23 against a basket of major currencies on Monday, before paring gains and ending flat.\nThe euro edged up about 0.1 percent on the day to $1.0833 , after dipping to its lowest since mid-April overnight.\nThe dollar was steady against the yen at 124.295 after scaling a 4-1/2-week peak of 124.390 yen on Monday.\nUnderpinning the greenback, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Fox Business Network that there was a better than 50 percent chance that the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates in September.\nIn other commodities trading, crude oil futures continued to slip, pressured by the strengthening dollar and concerns about a supply glut.\nU.S. August crude, set to expire later on Tuesday, was down about 0.2 percent in early trade at $50.07 a barrel. On Monday, it tumbled below $50 for the first time since April.
