Alexis Ohanian, another co-founder who has been working as executive chairman of reddit, will work “alongside” Huffman, said Reddit board head Sam Altman in a statement on Friday.\nPao said in a separate statement that she was leaving because the board had asked for higher growth than she thought was possible.\nControversy erupted around Reddit last week when the company’s director of talent, Victoria Taylor, was dismissed. Site volunteer moderators shut down around 300 discussion sections in protest.\nEllen Pao achieved notoriety through a sex discrimination lawsuit filed against her former employer, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. She lost the suit earlier this year, and is appealing the decision.\nShe joined Reddit in April 2013 and became its acting chief executive in November.\n 11, 2015 3:47 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:40:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
