The bank's surprise $5.5 billion rights issue in May left it better capitalised than the other majors. Louie Douvis Share on twitter by Michael Smith National Australia Bank boss Andrew Thorburn's latest public speech on Wednesday was focused on leadership and the role big business should play in developing economic policy. But the elephant in the room was the billions of dollars in capital the banks are going to have to raise to meet new regulatory rules.\nHis speech came two days after the banking regulator released its somewhat opaque guidelines around how much capital the major lenders will need to hold to meet new global standards aimed at avoiding another financial crisis.\nWhen questioned by the audience, Thorburn said NAB has already done most of the heavy lifting in terms of capital and was well placed to meet the new requirements.\nThis is true to an extent, as the bank's surprise $5.5 billion rights issue in May left it better capitalised than the other majors.\nThat is not be the end of the story though. NAB needs some of that capital to fund its exit from the United Kingdom. Analysts predict the majors will need to raise a combined $40 billion, depending on the outcome of Basel negotiations earlier next year.\nThorburn, the first big bank chief executive to speak on the issue since the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) responded to a key financial systems inquiry recommendation on Monday, says it is inevitable capital ratios need to be increased in Australia in order to harmonise the local banks with their global peers.\nThe language is more conciliatory, compared with the fierce lobbying going on last year by bank chiefs who were firmly opposed to Australia's domestic-focused banks having to play by the same rules as global institutions.\nBut Thorburn did say there is more work to be done to determine whether APRA's suggestion that banks will need to raise 200 basis points in capital to be \"unquestionably strong\" applies to total capital or Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\n APRA response to FSI puzzling Off the public stage, bank executives are scratching their heads and wondering what to make of this week's response by APRA's to the recommendation. On one hand, they welcome the flexibility the regulator has afforded them by not dictating a timetable for implementing any new rules or stating exactly how it will be measured.\nOn the other hand, there is a bit of muddling around trying to work out exactly how to approach the issue, when they don't know exactly how much capital they will have to raise.\nThorburn was billed as being a straight shooter when he landed the top job at NAB last year. He has a reputation in his former role in New Zealand for being direct in speeches about the investment property market and would not have had trouble obtaining access to government ministers.\nHe is more guarded in his new, larger role. Thorburn started out on Wednesday arguing that Australia must commit to further economic reform. He points to the fact that the last meaningful reform in the country was the introduction of the GST in 2000. He also says business leaders must do more to talk up Australia's prospects and advocate for change.\nBut Thorburn stopped short of directly criticising politicians or addressing the growing disillusionment in business circles about the political process and the policy vacuum in Canberra.\nThorburn, 50, is one of those personable chief executives who knows how to charm a room full of staff by coming across as a real human being. He recently told a group of employees that while he was \"passionate about you, our people … I won't ever allow the job to break my marriage\".\nThorburn, a practising Christian, said on Wednesday his family were the most important people in his life but admitted he is \"pretty driven and … can be a bit obsessed about stuff\".\nHe has plenty to obsess about as he faces a host of challenges just under a year into the job, including tough new regulatory rules and the threat of digital disruption.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/MikeSmithAFR"], "published": "2015-07-15T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:06:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
