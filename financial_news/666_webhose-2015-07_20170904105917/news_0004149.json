Patrick Scala by Matthew Smith It's not easy to find an investor willing to step up and support Woolworths at the moment â€“ but one prominent funds manager has emerged with a substantial stake in the beleaguered grocery chain.\nListed global funds manager, Magellan Financial, disclosed a new stake in troubled Woolworths worth around $750 million.\nA stake this large makes Magellan one of the largest single investors in the company.\nThe Woolworths stake was included in the first quarterly disclosure of the funds manager's newly listed exchange-traded managed fund.\nWoolworths is the only domestic holding in Magellan's global portfolio, which is populated with US-listed names including software company, Microsoft; American retailers Target, Home Dept and Unilever; and US financial institutions including Visa, Bank of New York Mellon and State Street.\nMagellan's Woolworths bet accounts for 2.4 per cent of the manager's $30 billion-plus portfolio.\nWhile the manager is unwilling to disclose exactly when it pushed into the Woolworths trade, Magellan appears to have made the bet following the disclosure of Woolworths' first-half profit fall at the end of February when shares dropped 15 per cent.\nShares in the once bulletproof retailer have since traded down another 10 per cent on top of the initial fall since CEO Grant O'Brien announced he would step down and further speculation has surfaced about a spin-off of its home hardware business, Masters.\n In Magellan's June monthly disclosure the manager mentioned Woolworths' disappointing quarterly result and the CEO's departure but also pointed to the company's \"lean retail\" program which it said should contribute to Woolworths' efforts to restore growth.\nWide retail reach Magellan owns significant positions in other overseas retailers including Lowe's, the US home improvement company.\nMagellan said it holds Lowe's because it believes the company will continue to benefit from the US housing market recovery in the medium term. The manager also owns UK grocery chain, Tesco, which similarly reported an historic loss during the last quarter.\nMarket watchers have been united in their concerns over Woolworths' growth opportunities following the profit downgrade in February. Analysts and investors point to the increased competition from rival Coles and the potential of discount overseas retailers such as Aldi and Costco eating into the healthy margins Woolworths has been enjoying.\nEven if Woolworths managed to sell Masters, it's likely the company will continue to face headwinds for years to come, according to Erik Metanomski, co-founder and portfolio manager of deep-value investment firm, Lanyon Asset Management.\nIn an interview with AFR Smart Investor , to be published later this week, Metanomski says Masters is contributing to the drag on Woolworths' share price\n\"If Woolworths cut Masters loose today, the stock would probably be up $2 or $3. But then it gets back to the grocery dynamics and they are structurally challenged for the next five years,\" Metanomski says.\nBut Magellan is not only backing Woolworths, the manager considers the stock a buy relative to the world of opportunities its considers for inclusion in its portfolio.\nMagellan has built a strong reputation among retail investors seeking to correct their domestic bias by investing more in overseas companies. The manager has also successfully marketed its fund to investors in the United States and has increased its marketing efforts in Asia recently too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:03:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
