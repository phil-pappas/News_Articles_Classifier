Photo: Graham Tidy\nWhile pop-up shops seem to be an increasingly common component of retail strips across Australia, their presence is not new and is actually an effective tool both landlords and retailers use for short-term gain. Despite the perception that pop-up shops are a passing trend, these agreements will continue to gain popularity and will increase once more retail supply becomes available.\nPop-up shops are usually employed by landlords to bridge the gap between tenancies, and can last for a few days to a few months, depending on the retailer. This kind of leasing should not be confused with casual leasing in shopping centres, which are temporary sites let out year round on a short terms basis.\nThe benefits pop-up shops provide to both landlords and tenants is a key factor behind their rising popularity. For landlords, the ability to have a space occupied and generating significant income and excitement while a more permanent tenacity is established is extremely advantageous. For retail tenants, these spaces allow the market to be tested in the launch of a product or service or to offload excess stock, without committing to a long-term agreement. The ability for pop-up shops to generate revenue for both landlords and tenants must not be underestimated in the current retail environment.\nAdvertisement Recently, pop-up stores in the CBD have been used by a range of retailers, from international beverage brands through to automotive dealers, in the launch of new products. By choosing to launch products via a pop-up shop arrangement, retailers are able to save significant amounts on rent and shop fit-outs. Due to the fleeting nature of pop-up stores they also generate excitement from consumers and are able to draw attention to a space that would otherwise be vacant.\nDespite the increasing popularity of pop-up stores, some landlords are still hesitant to embrace short-term leases. These landlords often believe that it is a time-consuming task - in terms of establishing a licence agreement, preparing the site for occupancy, and handling incoming and outgoing tenants - for not a great deal of financial reward. In spite of this, many are still willing to give pop-up tenancies a chance when they have a vacancy and can see the opportunity for revenue.\nWhen establishing a pop-up tenancy, it is important for landlords to ensure there is an agreement in place for the period and that the tenant is occupying the property for less than six months. Under legislation it could turn into a lease if the lessee is in occupation for a continuous six-month period.\nLeif Olson is the head of retail brokerage leasing Australia at CBRE.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:30:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
