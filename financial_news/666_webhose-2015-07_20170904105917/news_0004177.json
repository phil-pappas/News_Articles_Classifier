Take Your Business Global \nShipping to Canada is now a lot less expensive than many people realize. (NAPS) Posted: Friday, July 10, 2015 4:44 am | Updated: 12:30 am, Sat Jul 11, 2015. Want to Increase Revenue? Take Your Business Global By NAPS, North American Precis Syndicate Moscow-Pullman Daily News \n(NAPSI)—International selling may seem daunting, but thanks to the Internet, it’s more attainable than ever. With the right tools in place, small businesses can go global and increase revenues without the headache. \nThe question then is, “Where should I sell?” Consider these two destinations as you map out your plan for international growth: \nCanada \nCanadians are e-commerce enthusiasts—in fact, 60 percent of Canada’s online shoppers buy from U.S.-based sellers. As an added bonus, there’s typically no language barrier for U.S. businesses selling into Canada. \nGiven this opportunity for U.S. small businesses, the U.S. Postal Service opted to create zone-based pricing for all Priority Mail International ® shipments headed to Canada starting on May 31, 2015. \nThis means that the USPS will charge for shipping based on the U.S. origin ZIP code and the Canada destination postal code, instead of blending expensive routes into one flat rate. \nThere will now be seven pricing zones for shipping. Some rates will increase, but for businesses in major cities—such as San Francisco, Miami and Chicago—savings will be around $8 per package. \nBrazil \nLatin America is the world’s second-fastest-growing e-commerce market, and leading this boom is Brazil. With 202 million citizens, of whom 33.5 million shop online, Brazil presents a huge opportunity for U.S.-based businesses looking to expand, though it’s not without its challenges. \nDue to delays in customs clearance, postal packages could take up to 20 days to arrive. Duties and taxes, as well as complicated custom forms, slow the process for both U.S. merchants and the buyers. \nHowever, there are solutions. Shipping technology company Endicia just launched a program called Endicia Global Service, which allows shipments from U.S. businesses to reach Brazilian customers in as little as 8 days. Additionally, duties and taxes can be paid by the buyer up front, and there are no complicated customs forms to fill out. \n“International selling is a great way to grow a business and secure additional revenue,” said Endicia co-founder and general manager Amine Khechfé. “These markets in particular are undergoing massive growth, and there’s never been a better time for small businesses to look into them.” \nTo learn about the tools you need to succeed in going global, check out www.endicia.com/go-global .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T20:57:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
