Yet they still find themselves talking clients down and adjusting their strategies to shield them from the more detrimental effects of a rate hike, while preparing them to adapt to a new climbing rate environment.

Just because the Fed is raising interest rates doesn’t mean that it will be a drag on the economy if rates are still low in absolute terms.” \nThe last time the U.S. economy saw a rising rate environment was when the federal funds rate climbed from 1% in May 2004 to 5.25% in August 2006. It plateaued there until June of 2007, when the housing crisis, subsequent bank failures and economic collapse sent them plummeting for the next two years. At the outset, a rising rate makes rock-solid bonds suddenly fallible. \n“What it means in the short term is that investors ought to temper themselves for a change in sentiment around bonds and fixed income investing,” says John Diehl, senior vice president of strategic markets at Hartford Funds. “If we are indeed nearing the era of rising rates, it will mark the end of one of the most impressive positive market runs for fixed income investing in history. Therefore, we should adjust our expectation that yes, fixed income securities can lose money. \nNot just a little, either. Dan Yu, managing principal with EisnerAmper, notes that for each 1% interest rate rise, the average bond duration of three, four or five years loses 3%. That loss only happens if hist client has to sell the bonds early before they reach maturity, but those clients have no such worries at the the current rate. As the Fed has flirted with rate hikes, Yu says he has kept investors prepared by addressing the short term first. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T16:21:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
