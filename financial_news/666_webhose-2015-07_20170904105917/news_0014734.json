Of these, 1.31 billion are using the service on mobile devices. \nWhen trading closed in New York on Wednesday, Facebook's share price stood at $96.99 (£62.15), which means the company is now valued at $276.4bn (£177bn). \nFacebook's financial results come a day after Twitter (Xetra: A1W6XZ - news ) confirmed it was still struggling to add users, even though its revenue for the second quarter was also above analysts' expectations. \nTwitter has 316 million monthly active users, barely a fifth of its rival. \nThe site's co-founder, Jack Dorsey, has admitted the company is \"not satisfied with our growth in audience\" and is plotting a massive overhaul of the service which could see it looking a lot more like Facebook. \nChief Financial Officer Anthony Noto has also conceded that many people simply find the social network too difficult to use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:04:53.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
