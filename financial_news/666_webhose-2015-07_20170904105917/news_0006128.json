This is why we want to use this rewarding campaign to help mitigate the impact of the dumsor,'' he noted. \nExplaining the mechanics of the campaign, he said customers of the Peak brand would be required to text a 12-digit batch number on Peak's 170g Evaporated milk tin to a defined toll-free SMS short code. \n'This will be followed immediately with a message indicating whether or not the said customer has won any of the items,' he said. \nWhile expressing optimism about the impact of the campaign, he urged all and sundry to avail themselves of the opportunity. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T02:59:27.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
