Glenn Hunt by Jared Lynch Sunbeam blenders have helped GUD Holdings whip up an 88 per cent surge in net profit.\nThe kitchen appliance to mop maker's net profit jumped to $33.2 million in the year to June 30, after underlying earnings before interest and tax at its Sunbeam division soared 383 per cent to $7.3 million\nGUD managing director Jonathan Ling attributed the uplift to more efficient freight and logistics, as well as its joint venture, signed in 2014, with US consumer products giant Jarden.\nThe deal - which involved Jarden taking a 49 per cent stake in Sunbeam in return for GUD taking a 49 per cent share in Jarden's Asian business – allowed GUD to tap into Jarden's brand and product portfolio, including the Oster Blender.\nMr Ling said the introduction of the popular US product helped lift Sunbeam's earnings, despite sales slipping 2 per cent across the 2015 financial year.\nHe said the sales drop was recorded mostly in the first half, which recorded a 7 per cent decline. In the second half, which included the introduction of the Oster Blender, sales increased 3 per cent.\n\"The Oster launch is a direct outcome of the arrangements entered into with Jarden in November 2014 and is indicative of the benefits that will accrue through the joint ventures,\" Mr Ling said.\nGUD's shares jumped 7.5 per cent to $9.09 on Thursday morning.\n Revenue across GUD's entire business - which also includes Oates cleaning products, Davey pumps, Ryco automotive filters and storage company Dexion – rose 3 per cent to $611.5 million\nDexion posted a 72 per cent underlying earnings lift to $5.4 million. Mr Ling attributed the increase to improving market conditions in New Zealand and Asia as well as the completion of several big projects, which included the closure of its Sunshine factory in Melbourne, and the relocation of its racking factory in Sydney to Malaysia.\nUnderlying earnings from the automotive products division increased 7 per cent to $32.3 million, with Mr Ling citing sales growth in Ryco's agricultural and heavy duty filters. Meanwhile Oates and Davey posted a 8 per cent and 3 per cent rise respectively in earnings before interest and tax.\nMr Ling expected further growth in FY16, particularly in the automotive division, which would include the acquisition of lighting and battery group Brown & Watson International (BWI). GUD bought BWI for $200 million in May, with deal effective from July 1.\n\"Whilst we have been extremely pleased with the progress made in FY15 we expect a further substantial uplift in financial performance in FY16,\" Mr Ling said.\n\"This will come from a continuation of the sales momentum evident across the group in the second half of FY15 and from the BWI acquisition.\n\"In addition we are maintaining our cost-focused profit improvement programs.\"\nGUD will pay a final dividend of 22 cents a share, fully franked, on September 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:44:12.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
