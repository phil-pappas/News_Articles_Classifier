You may have established a good relationship, or even a friendship, with your advisor.\nIt’s not uncommon. The foundations for a good client-advisor relationship — like trust and communication— are also the basis for a good friendship.\nFinances are a very intimate thing. There could be things your broker or financial advisor knows about you that no one else in the world knows.\nPeople don’t usually talk about money openly in social situations, or even within families, but it’s necessary for your broker to be informed, since he or she is managing your money. Your advisor needs to know your goals, your intentions for the funds, and much more.\nYour advisor may even be a family member or neighbor that you see regularly, which raises concerns about things being awkward after you move on.\nWhatever the reason, making an advisor and/or firm change can be a tough thing to execute even when you know it’s the right thing to do. As a result, breaking ties with your advisor, with whom you’ve shared so much, might feel like “breaking up.”\nThere may be some good reasons for the change. Maybe the new firm has additional services, such as tax planning strategies, estate planning, and trust services. It could be that its fee structure is more aligned with what you are looking for, with a fee-based approach on a fiduciary platform rather than a commission-based model. You might like a financial planning-based approach rather than one strictly focused on managing assets.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:29:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
