Madigan contended Illinois' constitution and statutes prevent the comptroller from continuing to pay expenditures, including payroll, without a budget. The first fiscal 2016 paychecks are scheduled to be issued on July 15.\nDemocrats who control the Illinois legislature and the Republican governor are at an impasse over a fiscal 2016 spending plan.\nLast week he vetoed a $36.3 billion budget passed by Democrats, saying it contained a $4 billion deficit.\nThe governor has insisted the legislature take up his reform agenda that includes a local property tax freeze, legislative term limits, and workers' compensation changes, before he will consider a revenue increase.\nOn Wednesday, the Senate approved a $2.26 billion, one-month budget to fund essential services that the House could take up next week. Rauner has signaled he would also veto a temporary spending plan.\nIn addition to payroll, Madigan asked the court to clarify payments for \"critical government services, such as medical care for children in foster care, residential placements for mentally disabled individuals, food assistance for low-income families, and the operation of the state hotline to report child abuse and neglect.\" (Reporting By Karen Pierog ; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T19:11:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
