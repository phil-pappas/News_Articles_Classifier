Written by: Brian O'Connell 07/06/15 - 3:48 PM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) -- U.S. new home sales are at a seven-year high , and it might be a good time to go \"all in\" on a new home purchase. Meanwhile, 90% of U.S. Markets monitored by RealtyTrac remain \"more affordable than historic averages\" in terms of getting down payment help . According to RealtyTrac, the average down payment program benefit for all 370 U.S.counties with 100,000 residents measured $10,443, about 6.84% of the median home sales price recorded in April, 2015. Lower down payments are generally available to new buyers, although geography plays a big role in the deal you get. For example, in RealtyTrac's assessment of these markets, new buyers in \"top five\" low down payment markets include Ashtabula, Ohio; Imperial, Calif.; Hernando, Fla.; Clayton, Ga.; and Lackawanna, Pa. Not surprisingly, Fairfax, Va. and New York City, which are among the most expensive regions for homebuyers, with the lowest affordability rates for homebuyers looking for down payment help. Ideally, if you really want to lock down a deal on a new home, the more cash you bring to the table in the form of a down payment, the better your chances. But in an improving home affordability market, even if you can't muster up that down payment, financing sources are available to help you get one. \"There are a plethora of loan options that help the first time buyer purchase with only a 3% down payment,\" says Mike Pappas, president of the Keyes Company in Miami, Fla. \"Our average income household earner can buy almost two times the average priced house in South Florida. Many of them will look back at this opportunistic time as one of the best times to purchase a home in the area.\" If you prefer alternative methods of securing a home down payment that don't involve pure savings, help from family, or going to a lender, there are no shortage of options. \"One of the things I do is help buyers get into properties with less than a 10-20% down payment by matching them with sellers I have negotiated financing or 'rent to own' deals,\" says Dirk Watters, a real estate investor based in San Diego, Cal. \"I teach people that rather than saving up for a long time and sinking a lot of cash into a property as a down payment, it's smarter to negotiate directly with a seller and get a much better deal.\" Still, there's a lot to be said for the old-fashioned approach to obtaining a home mortgage down payment - saving for it. If you can't afford a home down payment, then maybe you can't afford a new home, says Paul Richards, executive director of the Institute of Consumer Financial Education. But saving for a down payment not only gets you in the door, it also helps you develop the savings habits you'll need as a homeowner.
