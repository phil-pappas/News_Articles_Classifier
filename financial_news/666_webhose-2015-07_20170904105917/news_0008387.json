Bloomberg by Matthew Stevens The Pilbara's Third Force continues to impress with iron shipments growing at a rate faster than its global opposition while falling costs sustain a secure place in the global seaborne market for this font of Andrew Forrest's hard-earned wealth.\nWhile Fortescue's annual production report works to confirm market chatter that the Pilbara's junior major pumped tonnes at a spectacular rate through the June quarter, the company has stuck rigidly to past guidance that output will level out at 165 million tonnes through 2016.\nThis ceiling is firmly in line with FY15 shipments, which hit 165.4mt. For all that, Fortescue – which could easily tweak capacity to 180mtpa – appeared to run its system at an annualised run rate of nearly 170mtpa through the fourth quarter. Through a harum-scarum June the miner moved 15.3mt. If Fortescue could sustain that run rate it would export 183.6mtpa and the company insists it has latent infrastructure capacity beyond that number\nBut Fortescue insists it will maintain the same market disciplines that shaped its FY15 numbers. \"As previously flagged, Fortescue has completed all expansion capacity and acted to maximise value by maintaining shipments at 165mtpa, which has been the annualised run rate for the last 12 months.\"\nFortescue made it very clear that, whatever out-performance had been squeezed from its network over the final months of the financial year, 165 it's the point at which it matches peak efficiency and productivity with long-term sustainability.\n\"Iron ore inventories have now been drawn down to efficient and sustainable levels with mining and processing outputs broadly matched to ensure inventory levels remain balanced to support shipments of 165mtpa on an ongoing basis.\"\nAll of this only matters, of course, because Fortescue has directed so much anxiety and outright anger at the Pilbara's legacy majors over their determination to fulfil long-baked expansion strategies by running their individual and competing iron ore systems at their newly forged capacity.\nThe Fortescue proposition is that, for whatever malicious reason, management at BHP and Rio Tinto deliberately talked the iron ore price into precipitous retreat in November by flagging a future iron ore market in surplus. It also argues that its bigger competitors, including Brazil's Vale, should have acknowledged the change market circumstance by recasting expansion targets.\n Insistent Third Force For all that, the Third Force continues to insist that the market remains in near balance and that the spot market has never been tighter. \"The iron ore market remained in balance during the (June) quarter as Chinese port inventories were drawn down to 78mt, 32 per cent lower than peak inventory levels, which reached 115mt in November 2014,\" Fortescue reported on Thursday.\n\"Despite this, market volatility remains high and continues to be driven by speculation associated with the threat of additional supply driving iron ore futures, together with market concerns over the Chinese economy and the Greek economy,\" it added.\nThis threat of additional supply is, of course, very real. The bigger three (Vale, Rio and BHP) will deliver about maybe 120mt of additional capacity to the market over the coming three years while Gina Rinehart's new Roy Hill mine will add another 55mtpa. As well, Fortescue itself continues to ponder the addition of another 20mt of new magnetite production from its Ironbridge joint venture with steel giants Baosteel of China and Formosa of Taiwan.\nThe problem for all these growth stories is that the Chinese steel market has simply not grown as it was expected too back when the expansion narratives were being written, approved and then funded. At best Chinese steel output is flat. At worst, as some month-on-month data indicates, it is currently in retreat. Either way, the result is a supply side imbalance that is likely to worsen yet, and that has seen everyone in the iron ore sector attempting to drive their costs to the lowest point in the cycle in an effort to defend their places in the system.\nThat Fortescue has a materially lower cost base now is without question. For example, when Fortescue hit a financial wall as iron ore markets tanked in September 2012, its cash cost of production was $US55 a wet metric tonne. At year end FY15 it was $US19wmt and Fortescue says that number will drift to $US18wmt through the current financial year.\nToday, Fortescue's all-in cost (that is the cost of digging, shipping, paying royalties and interest on its debt) sits at $US31wmt, which is 38 per cent less than it cost just to dig up the stuff three years ago. But with iron ore currently trading at $US51 a tonne and forecast to fall further and with Fortescue product trading at a 15 per cent discount to that index price, sustaining this achievement is patently necessary.\nAn awful lot less spending Through recent quarters there has been an awful lot of sceptical focus on Fortescue's claimed cost reduction and whether or not they are sustainable over the longer haul. That incredulity is sustained by the very obvious fact that Fortescue is spending an awful lot less revealing its ore iron than it has in the past.\nTo illustrate, through the June quarter Fortescue removed 41.4 million tonnes of overburden while it mined 42.1 million tonnes or iron ore. The iron ore mined was up 19 per cent on the previous quarter but the overburden removed was down by 38 per cent.\nFurther, just a year ago Fortescue removed 106.7 million tonnes of overburden while delivering 43.8 million tonnes of iron ore to its system. Year-on-year then, Fortescue's overburden task has dropped by 61 per cent while its total ore production rose by 33 per cent. A year ago its overburden-to-ore ratio stood at 2.41-to-1. It finished this financial year at 0.97-1.\nMoving overburden is an unproductive and costly necessity of the mining business. Traditionally, one of the first indicators of a mine being high graded – which means being run with short-term financial outcomes as the focus rather than long-term sustainability – has been a sudden drop in the overburden effort in concert with steady or growing ore output.\nThe least of the risks exposed by the Fortescue trend was that management was simply delaying a cost in the name of driving cash flows through this extended dip in iron ore's price cycle. Those backing this view began anticipating some level of cash flow crisis for Fortescue within, say, 18 months as the overburden effort ramped up again.\nThe worst case here though was that the numbers indicated a change of mine plans that could result in long-term reserve and resource numbers being permanently recast because richer or lower cost levels of deposits were being tapped ahead of schedule to confect a lower cost base.\nThis criticism obviously sat front of chief executive Nev Power's mind as he watched over drafts of this latest production report. Because Power has worked to present a cogent defence of the sustainability of Fortescue's cost base.\nPotential underestimated The main point here appears to be that we have all underestimated the potential of Fortescue's fleet of five ore processing facilities to redraft the cost base of the business. The miner reports their effect has been transformational by allowing \"ore to be blended and beneficiated, increasing the upgrade and allowing the progressive reduction in mining cut-off grades\".\nWhat this really means is that stuff Fortescue once could not mine is now a valuable resource. It can be added to the system without eroding average ore and its effect is to lower average production costs because it reduces the overburden commitment.\nFortescue totally rejects any idea of that it has sacrificed the long-term mine plan to bring forward cash flows. But it does acknowledge that the benefit of lower strip ratios will be relatively short lived and that they will return to recently lowered life-of-mine averages of about 2.2-1 through the back end of FY16.\nCertainly then at least one big cost is going to rise in the near term. But Fortescue insists that this will be mitigated by a range of cost savings that should be in place by the end of FY16 and that will amount to about $US8.60 a tonne.", "external_links": ["https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/ironore_exports_hype/index.html"], "published": "2015-07-23T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:37:45.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
