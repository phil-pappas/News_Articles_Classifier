The S&P 500 gained 12.58 points, or 0.61 percent, to 2,081.34 after briefly falling below its 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq Composite added 5.52 points, or 0.11 percent, to 4,997.46. \nNine of the 10 major S&P 500 sectors finished higher. The utilities index jumped 2.48 percent while the materials index was down 0.33 percent. \nSome investors believe the storm clouds over Greece and China may give the Federal Reserve reason to hold off raising U.S. interest rates, or at least slow the pace of their rise. \n\"The U.S. economy should benefit from lower interest rates and lower oil prices that are a result of a slower China and the Greek crisis,\" said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer, Multi-Asset Strategies and Solutions, at Voya Investment Management. \nA warning from Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices about weak demand for personal computers pushed its shares 15.4 percent lower and hurt peers such as Nvidia and Intel (Swiss: INTC.SW - news ) . \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,837 to 1,248, for a 1.47-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,636 issues fell and 1,150 advanced for a 1.42-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. \nThe benchmark S&P 500 index posted 14 new 52-week highs and 48 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 46 new highs and 166 new lows. \nAbout 8.6 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, well above the average of 6.9 billion in the past five sessions.
