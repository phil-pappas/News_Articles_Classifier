More Budget pension raid hits £110,000 salary \nIf a provider fails, consumers enjoy 100 per cent protection for annuities and other savings held within long-term insurance contracts. However, a cap of £50,000 applies for investments, including those held within Self-Invested Personal Pensions or Sipps. \nThe issue has become more of a concern as retirees switch away from buying annuities , where savings are turned into a secure income for life, to keeping their funds invested in income drawdown products. \nIn the first two months after pension freedoms were introduced in April, about 10,300 income drawdown policies were sold, with the average fund used to buy a contract of £69,900, according to industry figures. \n“We are very keen, therefore, to discuss protection limits with the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, as part of their forthcoming review of FSCS protection and funding,” the FSCS said in its annual report, published on Thursday. \n“Meanwhile it is extremely important that consumers understand fully the choices involved in accessing their pensions savings, particularly as there is the potential for individuals to move funds from an FSCS protected environment into a position where there is far less (or no) protection.” \nThe FSCS said it was also “working closely” with the regulatory bodies and consumer advisers, including Pension Wise, the government-backed free guidance service, to keep consumers closely informed about the benefits of FSCS protection. \n“PRA and FCA rules also place responsibility on the industry to tell consumers about FSCS and the protection in place for different products and services,” added the FSCS. \nThe need for protection was illustrated by what the FSCS said was a steady rise in Sipp-related complaints. \nAverage payouts rose by about 50 per cent to £16,375 in 2014-15 from a year earlier, and both the numbers and costs of “complex Sipp-related decisions” are set to rise steeply again in the coming year, the FSCS said. \nAdditional reporting by Judith Evans Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T22:17:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
