With expectations building for interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England markets wanted reassurance that economic growth was feeding through to corporates' bottom-line. \nThe release of the minutes from the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) 's last policy-meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, were likely to help inform their decisions. \nThe Footsie drifted lower, surrendering 19.62 points to end at 6,769.07. \nIn the background, commodities traders were still licking their wounds after gold crashed 4% on Monday, with the Bloomberg Commodity Index sinking to its lowest since 2002. Those moves came on the heels of US dollar strength, worries surrounding China and recent weakness in the currencies of many commodity exporting countries, such as Australia or Canada, but also across a large swathe of South America. \nTime (Xetra: 17T.DE - news ) to go to Europe A trip to Greece may not be the best way to benefit from lower prices over the Summer, analysts at Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) told clients, as they called time on stocks focused on the UK economy. \nInstead, they recommended clients buy shares in those companies with the greatest exposure to the Eurozone's periphery. \nThe FTSE 250 and the Small Caps have outperformed strongly over even just the last three months, the analysts pointed out. \nHowever, relative earnings revisions for domestically focused stocks have turned negative for the first time since early 2012. Expectations are also building up for a first hike in Bank Rate, while the \"recent introduction of the £9 national minimum wage is likely to have a material negative impact on labour costs, operating margins and earnings for the [leisure and retail] sectors,\" the broker said. \nGreece still very much in a tight spot As regards Greece, no less than 71% of economists participating in a Bloomberg survey thought there was still a risk the country would crash out of the euro by the end of 2016. Half of those canvassed thought the size of the current bailout package was too small. \nWriting in the Financial Times on Monday, Wolfgang Munchau said: \"The Germans refuse any discussion on this subject, citing some trumped-up rules according to which Eurozone countries are not allowed to default. This is legal hogwash [...].\" Stay calm and keep cutting Public sector net borrowing excluding banks fell in June to £9.4bn - the smallest shortfall for seven years. Economists had expected a larger decrease, to reach £8.5bn. \n\"However, this is nothing for George Osborne to worry about at his stage given that he is still very close to target -and the public finances can be volatile from month to month and subject to appreciable revisions,\" Dr.Howard Archer, chief UK+European economist at IHS Global Insight said in a research note e-mailed to clients. \nFitch gives a boost to insurers Insurers led gains on the top flight index, after ratings agency Fitch waxed optimistic on the sector. In an afternoon report its analysts said: \"After three years of steep decline, and more recently, stagnation in UK motor premiums, there seems to be some signs of timid relief on the horizon for motor insurers' technical profitability. A continuing rise in motor claims frequency and severity, despite government-led reforms, pushed UK insurers to increase their premiums in 2Q15.\" Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in appliance maker AO World surged following a pre-AGM update when the company said its first quarter growth would be 'muted'. \nCroda International (Other OTC: COIHF - news ) said the first half of the year has been encouraging, with the recovery in underlying sales trends that began in the second half of last year continuing, as it posted a 7.3% jump in pre-tax profit. For the six months ended 30 June, adjusted pre-tax profit came in at £135.7m up from £125.3m last year. Sales were up 5.2% at £564.6m from £537.4m, reflecting growth in all sectors and all regions, particularly the Life Sciences division. \nTelecoms provider Cable & Wireless Communications (LSE: CWC.L - news ) reported a 4% increase in revenue in the first quarter and reiterated guidance for its current financial year. In a statement released on Tuesday, the FTSE 250 group attributed the rise in overall revenue to a strong performance in its broadband and video arms, which rose 14% and 11% respectively thanks to a sharp increase in subscribers. \nHousebuilding and construction group Galliford Try (LSE: GFRD.L - news ) has signed contracts with Birmingham City University to build the £46m Conservatoire in central Birmingham. The new landmark building, designed by Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, will move the Conservatoire from its existing home to the Eastside area of the city centre, adjacent to the university's Parkside building. The facility will house teaching facilities and a 500-seat auditorium as well as two additional performance spaces. \nRoyal Mail (LSE: RMG.L - news ) delivered a mixed first half trading statement, with group revenues flat as UK parcel volumes were higher than expected across the year but letter volumes worse. Guidance for the full year was kept steady as the three months to 28 June, a period of relative lesser importance compared to the key Christmas season, saw a 2% decline in revenues at the parcel and letter arm UKPIL counterbalanced by 8% growth at European parcels arm GLS. \nPZ Cussons (LSE: PZC.L - news ) increased its full year dividend again, despite revenues and profits being dragged down by the major currency devaluation in Nigeria, its largest business. These challenges are expected to continue in the new year, the company cautioned, as further weakening in exchange rates in the west African country, Australia and Indonesia is seeing imported inflation affecting margins as well as consumer disposable income. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,195.19 -0.64% FTSE 100 6,769.07 -0.29% FTSE 250 17,755.89 -0.14% FTSE 100 - Risers Admiral Group (LSE: ADM.L - news ) (ADM) 1,518.00p +4.47% Fresnillo (FRES) 652.00p +3.66% RSA Insurance Group (RSA) 440.20p +2.16% Randgold Resources Ltd.
