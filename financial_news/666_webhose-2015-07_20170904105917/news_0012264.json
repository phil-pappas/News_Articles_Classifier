Skilled was a naming rights sponsor of the Geelong AFL team's home ground until 2011. Getty Images by Simon Evans Project Cat started purring more contentedly after a late-morning meeting on June 11 on Level 23 of investment bank Macquarie's office tower in Melbourne at 101 Collins Street.\nThose striding along the bustling Collins Street footpaths below were oblivious as Skilled Group chief executive officer Angus McKay was ushered into a private meeting room in the plush Macquarie offices, where Programmed Maintenance managing director Chris Sutherland had also arrived, after flying in from his Perth headquarters.\nThe two bosses talked at length about the final price that might be needed to cement a $750 million merger of the two groups to create a combined labour hire company with annual revenues of $3.4 billion. They were hard-headed negotiations, befitting the tough industries that both men presided over, providing contract labour across sectors including oil and gas, mining, manufacturing and blue-collar tradespeople.\nThe meeting was a seminal event in the long game that was Project Cat, so named because Skilled Group had been the naming rights sponsor of the home oval of the Geelong Cats team in the Australian Football League for 10 years until 2011. The Kardinia Park oval where Geelong had a fearsome home ground record of success was known as Skilled Stadium before the company relinquished the naming rights.\nThe chief executive meeting on June 11 came a little over a week after an exhausting two-day gathering at the Melbourne offices of investment bank UBS, where top-level executives from both Programmed and Skilled were bunkered down to thrash out a full sweep of cost synergies and savings that could be extracted if the two groups did end up merging.\nThe \"synergies\" meeting on June 2 and 3 made it clear there were substantial benefits in a merger that made increasing sense as mining companies and oil and gas firms cut back hard on their own capital spending as commodity prices tumbled. The number-crunching came up with a broad figure of $35 million in cost savings over three years.\nThe negotiations between both sides gathered speed after June 11, culminating in a trading halt on the Australian Securities Exchange on June 22, and the formal announcement on June 24 that a deal had been struck where Skilled shareholders would be offered 0.55 Programmed shares plus 25Â¢ in cash for each Skilled share. A $3.5 million break fee was negotiated to stop either side courting anyone else, and Skilled shareholders will vote on whether to accept it at a scheme-of-arrangement meeting scheduled for September.\nInvestment banker David Mustow of Macquarie had been advising Mr Sutherland and his board, who agreed that paying a little over 9 per cent more than an original offer put to Skilled in late December 2014 would deliver the right outcome and value for both sets of shareholders.\n UBS investment banker Michael Stock was in Skilled's corner, assisted by long-time investment banker Peter Scott, who had known the Skilled chairman, Vickki McFadden, from many years ago when she had been an investment banker herself as Principal of Centaurus Corporate Finance and then at Merrill Lynch.\nSkilled was on the front foot on the corporate governance front. Max Findlay, who was appointed to the Skilled board in 2010 and had been the managing director of Programmed Maintenance for 18 years until stepping down in 2008, absented himself from board deliberations on the deal because he still has a shareholding in Programmed.\nFor McKay, who was the former chief financial officer at Foster's Group before the brewer was swallowed in a $12 billion takeover by SABMiller, it will likely turn out to be a brief stint leading Skilled. There was always the prospect that Skilled would merge, because previous Skilled chief executive Mick McMahon had been doing some number-crunching himself from time to time about the benefits of the duo joining forces, but with Skilled as the potential aggressor.\nProgrammed originally went to Skilled in the week before Christmas 2014 with its first secret overtures. McKay, who wasn't due to officially start in the role as chief executive until January 2015, received a call from his chairman asking him to start early. He donned his suit and hotfooted into the hot seat, with the prospect of a relaxing Christmas having disappeared.\nSkilled later labelled that first approach as a \"confidential, conditional and non-binding indicative proposal\" on December 29, 2014, when a formal offer was put to Skilled built around a \"merger of equals\" where each set of shareholders would end up owning 50 per cent of the merged entity.\nMcKay, the board and the advisers beavered away through the hot early weeks of January, and on January 22 officially rejected the first offer. A separate strategic review of the Skilled business was accelerated by McKay in a dual-track process, knowing it was highly likely Programmed would return again, and the board needed a concrete assessment of the future of Skilled and its prospects as a stand-alone business, to weigh it up against. The subsequent deal has Skilled shareholders owning 52.4 per cent of the enlarged firm.\nOnly time will tell to which set of shareholders Project Cat has delivered the cream.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T10:05:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
