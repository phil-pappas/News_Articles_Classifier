However, it is likely that more stimulus measures will be required to ensure that the sector can regain growth momentum and to encourage job creation.\"\nEarlier on Wednesday, China's official factory data showed activity in its manufacturing sector expanded slightly in June though not as much as analysts had expected, while growth in the services sector quickened.\nThe official data focuses on larger, state-owned firms, while the private survey tends to concentrate on small- and mid-sized companies which are facing more financing strains.\nChina's central bank lowered lending rates last weekend for the fourth time since November and trimmed the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves, stepping up efforts to support an economy that is headed for its poorest performance in a quarter century.\nSaturday's combined easing highlights Beijing's concerns that money isn't flowing to some of the most-needy sectors in the economy and that stubbornly high borrowing costs could fuel bankruptcies and more job losses.\nThe last time the central bank simultaneously cut interest rates and reserve requirements was at the height of the global financial crisis in late 2008.\nThe latest move could also be aimed at comforting investors following a more than 20 percent plunge in the country's stock markets over the last two weeks, some analysts said.\nSHAKY SIGNALS\nEconomic signals in China have shown hints at turning in recent months as earlier policy easing efforts finally start to bear fruit, though rate cuts have not paid dividends as quickly as in past downturns.\nProperty prices and sales have shown signs of improving, at least in big cities, but investment remains weak with high local government debt and bureaucratic delays thwarting Beijing's efforts to get big infrastructure projects off the ground.\nThe sharp plunge in Chinese stocks could pose fresh risks for the economy and put new strains on the financial system if heavy selling persists.\n\"A 'best case' scenario is that a continued equity collapse would knock a percentage point off China's GDP growth simply by cooling currently overheated financial sector activity,\" Capital Economics said in a note this week.\n\"But the rapid expansion of leverage over the past year means that a sharper economic slowdown is possible.\"\nAnnual economic growth slowed to a six-year-low of 7 percent in the first quarter, and recent data showed a further loss of momentum in the second quarter.\nWeighed down by the property downturn, factory overcapacity and high financing costs, China's economic growth is expected to slow to a quarter-century low of around 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014, even with additional stimulus measures.\n(Reporting by Pete Sweeney ; Editing by Kim Coghill)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T05:18:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
