Fitch by Christopher Joye Bank lending to business grew at a rate of about 15 per cent a year over the five years to mid-2008. This was about 8 percentage points below its growth rate over the five years to mid-1989 – the tipping point for the last recession.\nThis smaller rise in debt to 2008, along with structurally lower interest rates, meant the business sector's aggregate interest burden peaked at about 17 per cent of profits during the global financial crisis, well below its level in the early 1990s recession.\nPartly in response to the problems of the early 1990s, and partly in response to the imposition of risk-based capital requirements and other regulatory pressures, banks had improved their management of credit risk by the start of the GFC.\nToday, the prevailing wisdom is that the Australian sharemarket is conservatively geared. But there are many examples that show the non-bank market is regearing as it looks to sustain earnings growth.\nBloomberg consensus data for the top 100 Australian non-financial stocks suggests that net debt will increase 14.6 per cent by 2015-16, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will increase by only 4.4 per cent.\nConsequently, overall leverage for this portfolio of stocks will rise to 1.34 times in 2015-16, compared with just 0.8 times in 2010-11.\nThis increase in leverage will be principally driven by the energy and natural resources sector; for instance, higher net debt levels for Woodside Petroleum and Origin Energy and lower cash flow generation (as measured by EBITDA) for BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals. This will be partly offset by falling leverage in the transport sector, thanks to Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia Holdings, and in the utilities sector courtesy of AGL Energy, APA Group and Spark Infrastructure Group.\nCredit ratings house Fitch has highlighted stocks that have the unfavourable mix of forecasted falling cash flows and rising net debt over 2014-15 and 2015-16. Fitch calls this the debt \"red zone\", and says Woodside Petroleum, Rio Tinto, DUET Group, Transpacific Industries Group, Downer EDI, Beach Energy and Mineral Resources, among others, are expected to enter that zone.\n Woodside is facing the biggest deterioration, with net debt expected to increase $3.9 billion between 2013-14 and 2015-16 while annual cash flow is expected to fall $2 billion between 2013-14 and 2015-16. This can be attributed to forecast lower oil prices and net debt levels rising to fund its debt-funded acquisitions and capital expenditure commitments.\nBHP Billiton and Newcrest Mining exhibited these characteristics between 2011-12 and 2013-14 but no longer do for the period to 2015-16, given lower budgeted capex levels.\nSome companies fall into the less drastic but still negative category of expecting bigger growth in net debt than growth in cash flows in 2014-15 and 2015‑16. They include Transurban Group, Fortescue Metals, BHP Billiton, AusNet Services, Crown Resorts and Wesfarmers. Transurban heads this category because of a forecast $6.2 million increase in net debt, largely as a result of its Queensland Motorways acquisition in 2014.\nThe Reserve Bank has noted that the historical credit loss experience of Australian banks offers insights into the credit risks they face in future. It supports a continued focus on the analysis of the business sector's financial health. But it also notes that future macro-economic shocks may have a larger impact on households. There have been, for example, no large nationwide falls in house prices in recent decades.\nIn addition, a rise in unemployment on par with that of the early 1990s could be expected to have a more severe influence on household credit losses, given the large rise in household indebtedness since.\nIn other words, rising indebtedness should be seen as a red flag for both Australian corporates and Australian households.\nAnnualised net losses on Australian securitised prime automotive asset-backed securities (ABS) have also been rising. At just 0.62 per cent, the loss rate is low but is still 15 basis points higher than a year ago. Could this be a fresh sign that an increasing number of consumers are under financial stress?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T11:09:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
