Dmitry Lovetsky Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop have marked the downing of Malaysian Airlines MH17 in a rebel-held part of Ukraine by stepping up their campaign to establish an international criminal tribunal to try those responsible.\nThe families of victims of the MH17 disaster, that killed 296 and 38 Australians, will attend a national memorial service at Parliament House on Friday to honour their memory one year on.\nMr Abbott will unveil a plaque on the House of Representatives' gardens, with Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, and the Prime Minister's MH17 Special Envoy, Sir Angus Houston, also expected to speak.\nMr Abbott will tell families the nation grieves for their loved ones and will continue to support their case for justice.\n\"There were 298 innocent people on this aircraft and their deaths offend our sense of justice,\" he is expected to say.\nSir Houston has said he hopes the October release of a report on the evidence collected will be compelling and help \"hold these responsible to account\".\nThe international campaign for a tribunal hit a snag on Friday, with Russian President Vladimir Putin rejecting calls for a UN tribunal to prosecute suspects during a phone call with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.â€‹\nMr Putin said the move would be \"counterproductive and premature\".\n Undeterred, Ms Bishop said establishing the framework for a tribunal before October would make the tribunal less political.\n\"We will continue to appeal to Russia to establish the framework now. We don't want to politicise it and wait for the report to come out,\" she said.\nShe said the move has precedents and was an issue of international security and airline safety.\n\"Once we have that report we can send it to a tribunal, there have been cases in the past when these ad hoc tribunals have been set up, in Lebanon, former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. We believe it's an issue that goes to international peace and security,\" she said.\nTwo international investigations on the crash are ongoing: one carried out by the Dutch Safety Board and another criminal investigation by the Dutch Public Prosecution Service.\nMs Bishop will \"never forget\" getting the call about the tragedy, and her determination to bring offenders to justice \"is as strong to day as it was then\".", "external_links": ["http://www.canberratimes.com.au/world/mh17-crash-vladimir-putin-says-calls-for-un-tribunal-premature-20150716-gie9ix.html", "https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-17T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T05:57:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
