Reuters Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Lisa Murray China's financial sector is in need of urgent reform to address wasteful investment and excessive debt levels, the World Bank has warned in its latest economic update.\nThis includes addressing the surge in margin financing for buying stocks, which underpinned this year's stock market rally, the organisation said in its report.\nThe words of warning came as investors endured another day of volatile trading on China's stock market. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index changed direction at least 10 times before closing down 5.2 per cent to 4053.70.\nThe fall reverses Tuesday's gains and took place despite the central bank cutting interest rates to a record low on Saturday and the government announcing it would allow the state-owned pension fund to invest in equities.\nAfter more than doubling in the year to June 12 to a seven-year high, the Shanghai Composite Index has shed 20 per cent in the past three weeks.\nInitially shares rose in early trade on Wednesday after two business surveys released by the government suggested economic activity was stabilising. The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 50.2 in June, coming in above the important half-way mark for the fourth month in a row. The services PMI index, meanwhile improved as businesses reported a pick-up in new orders.\nHowever, a private sector business survey, the HSBC/Markit PMI, which focuses on smaller manufacturing firms, showed conditions deteriorated in June. At the same time, investors have started to unwind their margin positions and this appeared to dampen sentiment among investors in afternoon trade.\nShare market volatility adds to China's complicated economic outlook.\n The World Bank said ongoing adjustments in real estate, a build up of excess capacity and decelerating export growth were all affecting industrial activity. At the same time, it said growth in services \"remained robust as composition of growth continues to improve.\"\nThe group expects China's growth rate to slow further over the next few years, dipping below 7 per cent in 2017, due to an \"orderly correction\" in real estate and policies aimed at slowing the rapid build-up of credit.\nIt said this was a \"not unexpected\" and \"desirable\" outcome as it reflected Beijing's efforts to contain shadow banking, limit borrowing by local governments and reduce excess capacity.\nHowever, the World Bank also found that \"without fundamental reforms, the current financial system will be unable to support any substantial reallocation of credit to support productive growth.\"\nIt said Chinese authorities needed to improve regulation of the shadow banking sector, strengthen the investment climate and reduce red tape.\nThe group noted that unlike other countries, state ownership and control of the banking system in China was \"pervasive.\" The state has formal ownership of 65 per cent of commercial bank assets and defacto control of 95 per cent of those assets. The Communist Party and the government exercise control by appointing and dismissing board members and executives. There are also internal Party committees which sit above these boards.\n\"Almost a decade after restructuring, state banks have yet to make real progress at commercialising their activities,\" the group said.\nOver the next decade, the World Bank expects China will likely shift from rapid to moderate economic growth, with an average annual pace of around 5 per cent.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/lmurray75", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/app/basic/117863643605371534837/posts"], "published": "2015-07-01T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T11:06:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
