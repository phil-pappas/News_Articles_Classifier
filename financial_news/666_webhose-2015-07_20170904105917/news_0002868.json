His Excellency has become a Governor and today he is refusing to pay the existing salary structure not to talk of the 100 per cent he promised. \n\"Comrades, as at today, the Governor has refused to approve the payment of salaries of workers since he assumed office which is not only frustrating but unacceptable to Ebonyi workers. \n\"All these are happening in the face of the recent federal government's release of intervention funds to states including Ebonyi to clear all backlog of salaries and pension arrears. \n\"In the light of the above, the Organized Labour in the state has resolved to resume the suspended indefinite strike action with effect from Tuesday July 21st, 2015. All workers in the state civil and public service are hereby directed to comply accordingly by staying at home until otherwise directed otherwise by the Organized Labour\", the statement stated. \nMeanwhile, the state government has appealed to the workers to shelve the intended strike and be patient. \nThe Commissioner for Information and State Orientation, Emmanuel Onwe, made the plea while briefing journalists on the outcome of the state's Executive Council (EXCO) meeting. \nMr. Onwe noted that the government understood the plight of the workers and would ensure that the salaries and other entitlements are paid promptly. \n\"We know it will be helpful to the workers if they are paid in order to take care of domestic needs and engage in other activities such as farming,\" he said. \n\"All contending issues surrounding the payment of the salaries would be resolved imminently, as a committee consisting of eminent personalities in the state, has been set to achieve this aim,\" he said. \nThe commissioner claimed that no bailout was given by the federal government to the state, except an option to borrow money. \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had, after meeting with governors, approved the disbursement of emergency funds from the federation account to states to offset salary arrears of workers. He also asked the Central Bank of Nigeria to grant soft loans to affected and interested states.
