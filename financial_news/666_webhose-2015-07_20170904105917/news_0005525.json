Written by: Robert McGarvey 07/21/15 - 1:45 PM EDT More Headlines Top 10 Travel Destinations for Summer 2015 \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — See an ad for a used Kia next time you eyeball your iPhone, and that just may say a whole lot especially if your pal in the next cube is getting BMW convertible ads. That’s because there is feverish rumoring that Apple is planning to begin to factor in user credit scores in determining what ads it will serve. Apple did not respond to TheStreet 's request for comment, but here’s the apparent proof: Apple now holds a patent issued under the bland name: Method and System for Delivering Advertisements to Mobile Terminals. Right in the opening abstract, Apple explained what the patent is about: “Method and system for targeted advertising of goods and services to users of mobile terminals, based for example on the users' profile. Goods and services are marketed to particular target groups of users sharing a common profile which may be selected to increase the likelihood of the users responding to the advertisements and purchasing the advertised goods and services. The common profile of users may be based on the amount of pre-paid credit available to each user .” (Emphasis added.)In other words: the more credit available to you, the better the stuff you see. And if your credit card is in the sub 500 range expect to see a blizzard of dollar store ads. Is that an invasion of your privacy? Apple, in its application, insists this is all good for users: “An advantage of such targeted advertising is that only advertisements for goods and services which particular users can afford, are delivered to these users.” Why tempt you with an ad for a five-star hotel in Paris when your budget has you heading to a youth hostel in the wrong arrondissement? The patent application - in wooden, murky language - explained how Apple plans to make its calls. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T21:54:49.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
