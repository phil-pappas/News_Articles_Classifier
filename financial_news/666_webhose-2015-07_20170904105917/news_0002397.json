Nevertheless, some observers were left scratching their heads after what some commentators described as a confusing climb-down by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, given that his proposals appeared to be quite similar to those offered by his creditors before the latest referendum. \nTraders thus turned their sights to Saturday's Eurogroup meeting of finance ministers, hoping that an - even if only short-term - agreement might finally be reached. \nThe Footsie finished the day higher by 91.75 points to 6,673.38. The second tier FTSE 250 gained 190.27 points to 17,486.27 and the FTSE Small Cap index was up by 47.36 points to 4,681.16. \nOn other side of the channel, the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 rose 3.18% to 3,528.31 points as government bonds in the periphery advanced. \nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Italian government bond was down by 16 basis points to 2.02% after hitting an intraday low of 2.03%. The yield on similarly-dated Gilts was up by 13 basis points to 2.08% as the safe-haven bid they enjoyed over the last few sessions evaporated. \nSignificantly, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was cited as having said that Greece's debt was not sustainable without debt relief, adding later that the IMF was 'right' to have pointed this out. \nIn a more critical vein, Berlin stock exchange boss Artur Fischer has labelled the Greek government the 'financial Taliban' and questioned credibility of fresh proposals. \nBe that as it may, in a research report e-mailed to clients on Friday morning RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) 's Alberto Gallo said: \"A deal on Greece is likely this weekend. The hard proposals now square well with creditors' requests. Political developments have also moved in favour of a deal, with strong support from creditor countries (France, Italy, IMF/US).\" \"This is now the most likely scenario, by far, in our view. The latest reform proposals by Greece are on the table, and get very close to the creditors' demands.\" Chinese stocks jump, auto sales slump The Shanghai stock exchange rose 4.54% overnight to end the day at 3,877.80 points, for its biggest two-day advance since September 2008. In Shenzhen, a grand total of zero stocks fell, while 733 rose. All but 21 of them rose more than 9%. \nHowever, figures published on Friday morning revealed that Chinese automobile production shrank in June for the first time ever. \nStandard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) , St.James lead gains A bullish note from Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) also injected some life into insurers and other money managers, with Standard Life, St James's Place, Schroders (LSE: SDR.L - news ) and Legal & General (LSE: LGEN.L - news ) topping the leaderboard and London Stock Exchange (Other OTC: LDNXF - news ) and Experian (Other OTC: EXPGF - news ) in the wider financial sector also gaining. Barclays highlighted potential for merger and acquisition activity and developments over the EU's Solvency II, citing specifically that Standard Life owned \"some of the most attractive assets in UK Life insurance\". \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in InterContinental Hotels (Other OTC: ICHGF - news ) also booked in some gains after agreeing the sale of its Hong Kong hotel for $938m cash, with analysts expecting a special dividend will be announced soon as a result. \nSports Direct was jogging higher in the late afternoon, as it emerged that Odey Asset Management had increased its holding in the retailer to 5%. \nBrewin Dolphin (LSE: BRW.L - news ) leapt higher after a 'buy' recommendation from a fellow broker, Panmure Gordon, which downgraded its estimates by 7% but upgraded its price target to 350p from 300p on the basis that the current share price is anticipating no organic growth. \"We anticipate this will be the new focus for the company as it moves the strategy from efficiency to focusing on revenue growth,\" said analyst Jeremy Grime. \nAnalyst opinion weighed on Lonmin , however, with a UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) downgrade to 'sell' sending the platinum miner's shares sliding. The Swiss bank cited likely downside \"even if platinum group metals (PGM) prices recover\" and slashed its 12-month price target to 75p from the prior 130p. \nEgyptian gold miner Centamin , meanwhile, lost ground despite an upgrade from Canaccord, which said it believed production guidance would be exceeded. A stronger influence on investor opinion seemed to be the fact that the price gold remained broadly flat as safe haven demand failed to fire up. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,146.67 +0.82% FTSE 100 6,673.38 +1.39% FTSE 250 17,486.27 +1.10% FTSE 100 - Risers Standard Life (SL.) 452.30p +4.22% St James's Place (STJ) 952.00p +3.82% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) ) 1,077.00p +3.66% Schroders (SDR) 3,104.00p +3.47% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 403.60p +3.43% London Stock Exchange Group (LSE) 2,546.00p +3.41% Marks & Spencer Group (MKS) 538.00p +3.36% Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) (SPD) 730.00p +3.33% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 531.00p +3.21% InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) 2,686.00p +3.07% FTSE 100 - Fallers ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) (ARM) 1,015.00p -2.87% Weir Group (WEIR) 1,596.00p -1.18% Randgold Resources Ltd.
