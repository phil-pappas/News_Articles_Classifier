The FTSE 100 climbed by as much as 1.2pc, before closing 58.49 points, or 0.6pc, higher at 6,490.70. \nEuropean equity markets also rebounded after sliding into negative territory earlier in the week following the Greek referendum. Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras promised his government will submit “credible reform” proposals to its creditors on Thursday, as Greece submitted a request for a three-year loan from the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund. The German DAX advanced 0.7pc to 10,747.3, while the French CAC added 0.8pc. * Budget 2015 summary and highlights: Everything you need to know * Budget 2015: British business reacts to Osborne's 'double-edged' plans \nShockwaves from the Chinese stock market crisis could be felt across global equity markets, as miners and other exposed stocks came under pressure after the Shanghai Composite Index dropped by a further 5.9pc . In an attempt to stem declines hundreds of companies halted trading in their stock and regulators unveiled measures to prop up the value of small-cap stocks. \n“With China and Greece under the cosh there appears to be no real reason to buy in to this market and any bounce should present some selling opportunities,” Mike McCudden, of Interactive Investor said. * Chinese stocks put on ice in attempt to stem market crash In London, it was Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) that shocked the City by ousting chief executive Antony Jenkins as the board decided a “new set of skills were required for the period ahead”. The announcement comes weeks after John McFarlane took over as chairman of the bank. \nAnalysts at RBC Capital Markets said “the message is very much an acceleration of the existing strategy rather than one of major changes”. James Invine, of Societe Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) , believes there may be another review of the group’s businesses, akin to those conducted by Bob Diamond in 2011 and Mr Jenkins in 2013 and 2014, but with a tougher threshold as to retain a business or not. The investment bank could well be in the firing line and could be “shrunk further”, as the lagging division has not generated targeted returns, Mr Invine says. \nThe stock was changing hands at 262.25p at 13:01 on Wednesday as Chancellor George Osborne announced a phased reduction of the bank levy rate and the introduction of a surcharge on banks profits. However, the rally was short lived as the stock fell steadily to 257.3p by close - marking a one day rise of 2pc. \nOther banking stocks followed suit, Lloyds tumbled 2pc to 82.3pc, Standard Chartered, who has exposure to Asian markets, slipped 14.6p to 984.1p, while HSBC crept 0.6p higher to 559.2. Having previously been exempt from the bank levy given the small size of their balance sheets, challenger banks suffered their worst loss on record. Aldermore plunged 14.9pc to 253.7p, Shawbrook was down 10.6pc at 326.4p, while Onesavings Bank and Virgin Money tumbled 10pc and 9pc, respectively. \nLuxury housebuilding bore the brunt of the emergency summer budget with over £1.5bn wiped from the combined value of the big eight UK builders , after the Chancellor revealed the government would tighten “non-dom” tax rules and abolish permanent non-dom status which gives tax advantages to people officially domiciled abroad . Niall Shah, of Edison Investment Research, said “an overheated quoted housebuilding sector has seen an immediate correction from the Chancellor’s removal of higher rate tax relief on buy-to-let mortgages”. Barratt Development fell sharply, down 36p, or 5.7pc, to 594.5p, Persimmon (Other OTC: PSMMF - news ) slid 4.7pc to £18.76p and Taylor Wimpey (LSE: TW.L - news ) tumbled 5pc to 176.2p. \nMeanwhile, the FTSE 250 plunged 100.07 points to 17,112.86 following the budget speech. Shares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in Drax Group (LSE: DRX.L - news ) nosedived 99.3p, or 28.1pc, to 254.6p - its lowest level ever - as the budget indicated clean power will not be exempt from a climate-change tax. Traders in the City said the power-producer could face a £50m hit from the scrapping of the tax exemption. \nJohn Musk, of RBC Capital Markets, said the loss of revenue will have a “meaningful impact on renewable generators”, but he believes the chancellor “decided to cancel the scheme to stop taxpayer money benefiting electricity abroad”. Imported power has been deemed by European generators to be coming from renewable sources and as such qualifies for levy exemption certificates. \nBAE Systems (LSE: BA.L - news ) advanced 15.4p, or 3.5pc, to 460.9p, as the government said it would commit to NATO’s defence spending pledge for the next five years . Mr Osborne also revealed that the government would guarantee a real increase in the defence budget every year - reaching £47.7bn by 2020. * Budget 2015: Department expenditure shows the axe is falling on welfare, defence and international development Among the risers, Aviva (Other OTC: AIVAF - news ) claimed the FTSE 100 top spot - up 3.5pc to 497.1p - despite Mr Osborne disclosing that insurance premium tax would increase from November . Concerns about Glencore’s balance sheet evaporated as the stock recovered following Tuesday’s commodity rout, which saw the share price plunge to its lowest level ever. The stock recovered from sharp falls to record gains of 7.3p, or 3.2pc, to 237.9p. \nDays after issuing a sales warning, Monitise (LSE: MONI.L - news ) plunged 24.4pc to 7.5p following notification that Visa Europe, a major shareholder in the mobile payments technology company, said it would sell its 5.3pc stake. \nFinally, Rank Group fell into negative territory, down 4.7p, or 2.1pc, to 223.5p, as the Supreme Court ruled in favour of HM Revenue & Customs relating to a refund of VAT that HMRC demanded Rank pay back. The gambling company received £30.7m from HMRC after it claimed that it paid too much VAT on certain types of amusement machines between 2002 and 2005. Two years ago, the Court of Appeal ruled Rank must repay the money - in May 2014 it had repaid £25.2m and fully provided for the remainder it says. As such, Rank says the decision will have no impact on their financial performance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T22:31:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
