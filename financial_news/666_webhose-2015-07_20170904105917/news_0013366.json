Since fiscal 2004, the county's pension funding ratio has fallen to 45 percent from nearly 95 percent and the unfunded pension liability has climbed to $910.5 million from just $49.6 million, according to the review.\nDetroit went through a similar process that led to the filing of the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy, which the city exited last December after shedding about $7 billion of its $8 billion of debt and obligations.\nWayne County Executive Warren Evans requested the review last month, asking the state for a fiscal emergency declaration and a consent agreement to fix the problem.\nLast week, the county sold nearly $188 million of taxable notes due on Dec. 1, 2017 with a hefty 6 percent yield and 5.75 percent coupon.
