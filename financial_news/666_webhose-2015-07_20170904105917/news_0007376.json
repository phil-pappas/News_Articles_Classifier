What and when you collect will make a huge difference to your lifetime benefits.\nToday’s Social Security question is about whether it would be best for a lower earning older spouse to delay action till the younger spouse reaches full retirement age.\nQuestion : We are quite concerned as we will need to rely so heavily on Social Security in our retirement years. I just turned 62 and my husband recently turned 60. He has been the breadwinner and I have (for the most part) been at home taking care of kids and grandkids. I have a Social Security statement that reflects a tiny sum that I could collect. Think bare minimum!\nI understand that I can expect to get half of his much larger Social Security amount at some point. My husband ideally (I think) would wait until he is 66 to file and suspend and then collect at 70. Since I am two years older than he is, when should I apply? I imagine I shouldn’t do anything until he turns 66 and I am 68? Still, I wonder, even if my Social Security check on my own account amounts to peanuts, I would hate to leave it on the table unless it made sense to. Every penny counts. Thanks so much for being a great resource.\nAnswer : You will likely do better with the start-stop-start strategy that I outlined for Robin , depending on whether your husband is still working. (However, if he is still working, his early retirement benefit and your own spousal benefit could be zapped by the earnings test , which would be applied to both of your benefits in a proportional manner.)​\nIn contrast, my guess is that others will likely do better following a file-and-suspend strategy. This is the maddening thing about Social Security’s awful complexity. What will max out one household’s lifetime benefits won’t necessarily max out another’s. Two couples, A and B, can have the same gaps separating the spouse’s ages, but what’s best will differ depending on differences in work records between the two spouses in each couple. This is where a computer is needed.\nBut cash flow considerations also come into play. Can you actually get by, in terms of having some spending power, if you follow the strategy that maximizes lifetime benefits? Maybe you can continue to work full time or part time? Maybe you can tap retirement accounts. Maybe you can borrow at a low rate on your home. Maybe you can get a loan from your kids or siblings? Or maybe not. There are other higher detailed and extremely accurate consumption-smoothing software programs that can show you the cash flow (feasible spending) implications of any given Social Security collection strategy you enter into the program.\nYou said, ​“I imagine I shouldn’t do anything until he turns 66 and I am 68?” Since ​waiting to collect your own retirement benefit beyond full retirement age​ ​won’t produce a higher benefit once you start collecting your spousal benefit, ​you ​should ​definitely ​file ​for your own retirement benefit when you reach full retirement age.\nMy weekly Social Security column appears on PBS NEWSHOUR’s website .", "external_links": ["http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/rtea.html", "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/receiving-extra-social-security-credit-military-service/", "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/lkotlikoff/"], "published": "2015-07-29T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T15:48:58.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
