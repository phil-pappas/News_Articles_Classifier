Srikanth told reporters on Friday, after the company posted estimate-topping first quarter profit boosted by its highest gross refining margin in six years. \nReliance will use a two-pronged strategy for ensuring device availability, using open market as well as self-branded devices under its retail unit's electronics arm, Reliance Digital. \n\"Reliance Digital would be a catalyst by making available entry level to ultra premium 4G LTE smartphones... in driving the device ecosystem in India for Jio,\" the company said. \nThe much-delayed launch and investment in the venture has drawn criticism, but Ambani allayed some concerns when he told shareholders in June that the Jio network will roll out with coverage to about 80 percent of the country's population. \nApart from the 1,000 'Jio Centers,' the company will have 500,000 connectivity outlets and 1 million additional recharge outlets at launch, the company's presentation said. \nIt has also engaged with global smartphone brands including Apple (AAPL.O), Samsung , Huawei [HWT.UL] and Xiaomi [XTC.UL] to ensure availability of 4G devices and pocket routers across price ranges, the company said. \nReuters had reported in May that the company was in talks with Chinese manufacturers to secure cut-price devices that could be bundled with its network and sold in packages at prices as low as $30. \n(Reporting by Aman Shah; Editing by Ros Russell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T16:03:49.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
