It's unclear whether this has worked out in practice. Reuters by Andre Tartar Greece may have bought itself a bit more time with a third bailout, but its economic troubles are set to continue this year, and possibly even get worse.\nWe asked 20 economists where they thought Greece was headed. Their answers make for a depressing read.\n1. The great shrinking economy Gross domestic product will contract 0.7 percent in 2015, compared to a 0.8 percent expansion in 2014, according to the median forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg. That would be the seventh annual decline in eight years. Bear in mind that the $200 billion economy has shed a quarter of its size since entering a recession in 2008.\nGDP 2. More people out of jobs Unemployment will average 26.3 percent this year, up from an estimate of 25.9 percent in the last survey Bloomberg conducted in April.\nThis spells more pain for youngsters- more than half of them out of work - faced with the option of moving back in with their parents or looking for gainful employment elsewhere.\nMany of the country's best mindshave already fled.\n Jobs 3. A balance sheet in tatters \"No pain no gain\" has been Germany's mantra for Greece. It's unclear whether this has worked out in practice.\nThe economists we surveyed see the budget deficit reaching the European Union's 3 per cent of GDP ceiling, up from an earlier estimate of 1.9 per cent of GDP. A predicted trade surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP will instead turn into a deficit of 0.7 per cent of GDP.\nBudget deficit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:13:29.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
