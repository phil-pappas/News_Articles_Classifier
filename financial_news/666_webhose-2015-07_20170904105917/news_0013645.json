This followed the effects of the negative circumstances it faced during the last three years, and to continue its activity during the current tourism season, according to Abdel Aziz.\n\nMisr Insurance tops the list of property insurance companies in the Egyptian market, with market shares amounting to 53.3%, and direct instalments exceeding EGP 4bn. This is out of the total direct instalments of the sector that amount to around EGP 7.6bn.\n\nThe company targets a growth rate of 4.8% in the volume of its direct instalments during the next fiscal year (FY), to reach EGP 4.8bn. It also seeks increasing its profit with a rate of 10.9% by the end of the next FY to reach EGP 722.4m, compared to EGP 651.3m achieved in the last year, according to a statement of Adel Moussa, Chairman of the company.\n\nAccording to Hany Gawish, member of the Nuweiba-Taba Tourism Investors Association, the region suffers from official's negligence, which led to the decline in tourism. The Nuweiba-Nakhil road remains unrepaired as a result of the May 2014 torrents, especially the area of Wadi Watir.\n\nGawish said that leaving the road with no development makes the process of transporting the tourist groups difficult. Moreover, millions of cubic metres of water are being wasted due to not building dams, which would make use of these rains annually.\n\nGawish estimated the material harms suffered by the hotels from in May 2014 at more than EGP 1.5bn. \"Some hotels suffered from significant material harms in their buildings, in addition to suspending their work,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T22:58:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
