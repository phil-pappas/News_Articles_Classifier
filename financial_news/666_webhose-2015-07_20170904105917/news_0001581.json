Gabriele Charotte by Marianna Papadakis and Sarah Thompson Macquarie Bank has launched court proceedings against a company linked to top loan provider Liberty Financial and its managing director Sherman Ma.\nThe bank obtained a temporary injunction in the NSW Supreme Court on June 1 to freeze the assets of one of Mr Ma's associated companies, Luxembourg-based Juno Holdings S.a.r.l, which it claims owes it $25 million.\nMacquarie Bank took Juno to court over the debt in the Netherlands and won and is now seeking to have the judgment enforced in Australia.\nThe matter is listed for a one-day hearing on July 8.\nAccording to court documents including affidavits tendered by the bank, Macquarie alleges Juno and Liberty Financial, along with several other companies, are part of the same corporate group and that Mr Ma is or was at all relevant times a director of all or most of the entities.\nAccording to one affidavit, Macquarie alleges that for a number of the relevant entities, Mr Ma's only co-director is a local trust company or employee of a local trust company.\nNotes regarded as listing prelude The reclusive businessman is best known as managing director of one of the biggest third-tier lenders, Liberty Financial.\n The lender has been issuing notes in the past few years, a move regarded as a prelude to listing, which it has been racing for against a key rival Pepper Home Loans.\nMr Ma is currently overseas. A spokeswoman replied on his behalf saying Liberty was not a party to the court proceedings, which arose out of legacy matters and it would be inappropriate to comment on it.\nHowever the spokeswoman said Liberty was committed to providing innovative solutions and superior service to its valued customers and business partners.\n\"Our focus remains on continuing to do so and any evaluation of an IPO is made within that context and that of present and future stakeholders including shareholders, customers and investors,\" the spokeswoman said.\nThe legal dispute between Juno and Macquarie Bank arises from a deal in 2004, in which the bank allegedly lent the company $US11.5 million via a note agreement and a strategic alliance.\nIPO abandoned Macquarie alleges the funds were to be used to set up Liberty Financial for a potential float but the global financial crisis hit, credit markets shrank and the planned initial public offering was abandoned.\nMacquarie demanded early repayment of the note, which Juno agreed to, but Macquarie claims Juno never paid the money back and after years of negotiation has headed to the courts to demand about $25.5 million, the initial amount with interest.\nLiberty Financial was a subsidiary of Juno up until a restructure in 2013, following the Netherlands judgment, which separated their accounts and placed Liberty under a different arm within the group.\nMacquarie Bank claims the restructure led to assets being transferred out of Juno, whose property holdings in Australia now solely include patents for financial applications and that further assets could be dissipated from Juno to related entities if the freezing order is lifted.\nThe bank also contends Liberty Financial licenses the applications via a complex web of companies including Juno and Jupiter. Macquarie has moved to have a bailiff appointed to sell Jupiter.\nAccording to the financial records for the Liberty group filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, it paid $79 million in royalties to related parties in the 2014 financial year. After allowing for those payments, the group reported a consolidated net loss after tax of $17.4 million off revenue of $290.8 million.\nJuno ordered to pay $16m Macquarie took legal action against Juno in the Netherlands in April 2008 and the company was ordered by the Joint Court of First Instance of the Netherlands Antilles in Curacao to pay the bank about $16 million including interest and costs on August 19, 2010.\nThe company appealed the ruling in the Supreme Court of Netherlands in September 2013 but lost.\nLiberty Financial recently hooked up with private equity giants TPG and Blackstone and potentially Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan to make a tilt for ANZ Banking Group's Esanda Dealer Finance.\nLiberty Financial also backed TPG's bid for the local consumer finance business of GE Capital, which ended up being sold to KKR & Co, Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners for $8.2 billion in March.\nHaving derived his fortune from Liberty Financial, which provides low doc loans to people who have been rejected by the big banks, 41-year-old Mr Ma was a regular on Business Review Weekly 's young rich list.\nBorn in the United States, Mr Ma came to Australia with management consultancy McKinsey & Co in the 1990s and formerly worked for Credit Suisse before launching Liberty in 1997.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:10:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
