Advertising Print This Post \nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has issued an interim stop order on the planned initial public offering (IPO) of Bitcoin Group. \nAccording to its website , Bitcoin Group operates a mining pool where investors can earn bitcoins. The site was previously nearly identical in layout to Bitcoins Reserve , which claims to offer “cryptocurrency arbitrage,” merchant services, insured cold storage, and “cryptocurrency creation.” The cryptocurrency arbitrage service was claimed to have generated a return of over 205.8%. \nBoth businesses are based out of: Level 11, 470 Collins Street, 3000, Victoria, Australia. They appear to have different management teams, although the current CEO, Sam Lee, was previously reported as CEO of Bitcoins Reserve. \nLast October, Bitcoin Group announced it was seeking to raise $20 million through an IPO. It boasted plans to become the world’s first publicly traded bitcoin company, despite the existence of others, even within Australia. \nASIC did not disclose the reason for the stop order, which can be issued to prevent offers being made under a disclosure document if it contains “a misleading or deceptive statement, an omission of information required to be provided under the legislation, or a new circumstance has arisen since the disclosure document was lodged.” \nAccording to a July 8 press release , the exposure period for the company’s prospectus was extended by 7 days. The stop order was issued shortly thereafter. \nIn February, ASIC warned Bitcoin Group against further public statements over its intended IPO after it attempted to woo investors on WeChat, a Chinese social media platform. \nThe stop order can remain in effect for up to 21 days, after which a hearing is held to consider the company’s position. Thereafter, either the interim stop order is lifted or a final stop order is issued. Got a news tip?
