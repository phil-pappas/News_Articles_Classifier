The award is yet another victory for Karcher in the home cleaning category, as the Sweeper beat out six other products thanks to its innovative features during the final rounds of vetting in Verona, Italy. \n\nWith a working width of 125 cm, the new KM 125/130 R has an area performance of up to 10,000 m/h and combines user-friendliness with efficiency. The Sweeper's unique features include a state-of-the-art rotating brush which cleans corners and hard-to-reach spots, and a built-in TACT system that provides automatic filter cleaning every 45 seconds. \n\nIts intelligent sweeping programs and positioning of the main sweeping brush between the rear wheels also means the brush isn't damaged when driving over speed humps as the brush lifts with the back wheels.\n\nKarcher attributed the success of the sweeper to its loyal and dedicated client base, noting that the award is yet another vote of confidence for Karcher and a testimony to the Karcher quality seal. The numerous innovative features make this a universal machine for use in logistics and diverse industrial environments such as manufacturing facilities, warehouses, yards, parking areas, etc.\n\nKrcher Fleet, the fleet management system, is also available as an option for the cleaning management of large machine fleets and access to specific machine data for optimised usage and service. Other stand-out features include an automatic filter cleaning system, hydrostatic traction drive and overhead sweeping capacity. \n\nAbout Alfred KÃ¤rcher GmbH & Co.
