The agency called the plan unworkable.\nInvestors would receive $1.96 billion of interest payments from 2016 through 2023, according to the bondholder plan. That’s about $984 million, or 33 percent, less than what Prepa is currently obligated to pay on interest during that time, Larkin wrote in a report Friday.\nThat may be fine for distressed-debt investors who purchased the securities at 60 cents on the dollar or less, Larkin said. Other bondholders who bought the debt at full value would feel some pain, he said.\nForbearance Agreement Under the proposal, debt-service payments would be suspended on existing securities and interest costs reduced by selling new obligations that would be repaid from a surcharge on Prepa’s customers. Those changes would free up about $2.5 billion through 2025 to modernize plants and diversify fuel sources for commonwealth’s main electricity provider.\nPuerto Rico and its agencies racked up $72 billion of debt by borrowing to fix budget deficits as the island’s economy has struggled to grow since 2006. Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla last month said the commonwealth can’t afford to pay its debts, igniting concern an island issuer will default. Officials are set to draw up a restructuring proposal by Sept. 1.\nThe utility in August 2014 signed a contract with investors, banks and bond insurers that keeps negotiations out of court, called a forbearance agreement. Prepa must craft a debt-restructuring plan by Sept. 1 or that accord will expire. The utility avoided defaulting on a July 1 bond payment with the help of a loan from bond insurers.\nThe utility’s bonds rallied following news of the latest bondholder proposal. Prepa debt maturing July 2042 traded Friday at an average 57.2 cents on the dollar, the highest since June 8 and up from 49 cents on Wednesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The average yield was 9.4 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-25T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:35:38.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
