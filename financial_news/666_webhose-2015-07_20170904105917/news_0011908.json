Reuters by John Kehoe The International Monetary Fund has ramped up pressure on the United States to delay raising interest rates by warning that economic growth could be \"significantly debilitated\" by a soaring American dollar, just as the Australian currency dipped below US74¢ for the first time in six years.\nIn its annual check up of the world's largest economy, the IMF said an important risk to growth in the US and emerging economies is a further US dollar appreciation.\n\"The real appreciation of the currency has been rapid, reflecting cyclical growth divergences, different trajectories for monetary policies among the systemically important economies, and a portfolio shift toward US dollar assets,\" the IMF's article IV consultation on the US economy said.\nThe greenback hit a new six-year high against the Australian dollar, which briefly dipped to US73.98¢ just after midnight AEST on Wednesday morning. It later recovered to US74.36¢.\nThe $A briefly traded as low as US73.98¢ against the $US shortly after midnight on Wednesday AEST. The local currency had shed 21 per cent against the greenback in the last 12 months, after eclipsing parity just over two years ago. Part of the reason for the reversal is the rout in the price of iron ore which has crashed below $US50 a tonne and monetary policy differences as the Fed moves to lift rates and the Reserve Bank of Australia signals that rates are on hold at 2 per cent for the forseeable future.\nReflecting a flight to safe haven US-dollar denominated assets amid uncertainty over Greece's debt problems and China's wobbling stock market, the US dollar is trading at around decade highs against the euro and Japanese yen.\nThe euro has slumped to $US1.09, down 19 per cent since the start of 2014. The greenback is 16 per cent higher against the yen over the same period and was fetching 122.43 yen on Wednesday in Tokyo.\nThe strong US dollar has hurt US exporters by pushing up the price of their goods for overseas buyers.\n US exports fell 0.8 per cent in May, widening the trade deficit to $US41.9 billion, from $US40.7 billion in April, government figures published on Tuesday said.\nGAMCO Investors portfolio manager Christopher Marangi said the strengthening dollar has had \"tangible deleterious effects\" on US exporters.\n\"Raising rates – effectively moving in a direction opposite that of Europe – would like strengthen the dollar further and compound those effects,\" Mr Marangi said.\nThe US Federal Reserve has signalled it plans to raise interest rates before the end of the year, an intention which has added to the greenback's momentum, as other central banks pledge to keep monetary policy loose.\nBacking up a call last month from IMF managing director Christine Lagarde who said a \"rate hike would be better off in 2016\", the IMF said Tuesday the Fed should defer its first increase in rates until there are greater signs of wage or price inflation.\nDespite the unemployment rate falling to 5.3 per cent, inflation and wages have been stubbornly weak, confounding economists who expect price pressures to build as the jobs market improves.\n\"Based on staff's macroeconomic forecast, and barring upside surprises to growth and inflation, this would imply a gradual path of policy rate increases starting in the first half of 2016,\" the IMF said.\nThe IMF is concerned that further appreciation of the US dollar against major trading partners in Europe and Asia could blow out the US current account deficit.\n\"If so, the US external position would be pushed further away from levels justified by medium-term fundamentals and growth could be significantly debilitated,\" the IMF said.\nThe Washington-based fund estimates that if the current account deficit rose to around 5 per cent, this would point to the move in the dollar having gone \"too far\" and \"potentially creating future risks, including in some emerging market economies, as global imbalances reassert themselves\".\nThe IMF has responsibility for global financial stability and warned of potential \"global spillovers\" from a sustained dollar appreciation.\nWhile many emerging and low-income economies funded by US dollars have lowered their vulnerability to a US dollar appreciation, the large gross dollar funding positions \"could pose vulnerabilities for some\", the IMF said.\n\"The rise in US dollar debt issued by highly leveraged corporates in emerging economies is a notable source of risk,\" the IMF said.\nIn June, 15 of 17 Federal Open Market Committee members agreed that 2015 was the appropriate time to raise rates from around zero.
