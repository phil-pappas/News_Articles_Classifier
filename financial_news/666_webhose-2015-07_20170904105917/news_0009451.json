As in,\n“I should replace that burned out light bulb.”\n“I should exercise more often and eat better.”\n“I should make the time to get a handle on my money life.”\nWe are all full of the “ shoulds ”. They plague our existence with a daily dose of guilt and dissatisfaction.\n“Must” however, is full of strength and determination. It’s a there’s-no-choice-here word. “I MUST take out the garbage” vs “I should take out the garbage”. Livable home vs rat-infested disease and squalor. Quite a difference.\nSo how do you make that transition from the lazy-would-be-nice-if “ should” and the powerful, can-do laser-focused MUST with your money? Start with the declaration of your choice. For example, “I must get out of debt” or “I must increase my financial literacy” or “I must spend less and save more for retirement/college/house down payment.” Pick the one that rings truest for you.\n1. Articulate your MUST and talk it over with your partner, spouse or significant other(s) who are impacted. Make sure their voices are heard.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T18:39:57.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
