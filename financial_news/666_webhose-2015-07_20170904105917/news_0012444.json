Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Support to legalise gay marriage continues to increase but the issue is unlikely to be a significant vote changer because it is not regarded as a top-tier concern, according to new research.\nWhile the Liberal Party's resistance to change could see it lose voters from the progressive middle, very few voters care enough about gay marriage for it to influence their vote.\nThe research, conducted for The Australian Financial Review by JWS Research, finds that since the federal election in September 2013, support for changing the definition of marriage in the Marriage Act to include same-sex relationships has increased 9 percentage points to 54 per cent.\nThe poll of 1000 voters shows women and young people aged between 18 and 34 years are the most supportive whereas people aged over 55 years and men are the least supportive of change.\nResidents of South Australia and Western Australia are the most resistant to change.\nWith Prime Minister Tony Abbott fighting attempts within his own party to even allow a debate on whether to shift the party's policy from opposition to a conscience vote, chances of gay marriage being legalised before the election are slim at best.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten promised on the weekend that if elected, he would seek to legalise gay marriage within the first 100 days of office.\nLabor figures claim Mr Abbott would be damaged in an election campaign in which he opposed gay marriage.\n Senators Cory Bernardi and Penny Wong shake hands at the end of the same-sex debate. Alex Ellinghausen Indifference trumps passion But the research, which is a mixture of quantitative polling and focus group research, qualifies that assertion.\nJWS Research's John Scales said the focus group polling found many people were indifferent towards gay marriage.\n\"Although most people support same-sex marriage, very few are particularly passionate about it and many feel that it is simply not the most important issue facing Australia,\" Mr Scales said.\nCommon comments from the focus groups included \"it doesn't affect me\", \"why does it get so much attention?\", \"it doesn't bother me\" and \"they should just do it\".\nMr Scales said on balance, Mr Abbott's refusal to countenance the issue, let alone support it, would benefit Labor because it furthers the image of a Prime Minister stuck in the past.\n\"They will lose votes in the progressive middle by not being receptive to it,\" he said.\nOpponents to same-sex marriage in the Liberal Party are canvassing delaying the issue beyond the next election by promising a national plebiscite.\nThis is the preferred option of the Australian Christian Lobby which envisages the proposal would not receive the requisite support of a national majority plus a majority in the states and territories.\nThe poll shows there is majority support in most states and territories with Victoria the highest at 59 per cent, followed by Queensland on 54 per cent, NSW/ACT 51 per cent, SA on 50 per cent and WA on 48 per cent. Tasmania and the Northern Territory were not polled.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-30T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:52:08.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
