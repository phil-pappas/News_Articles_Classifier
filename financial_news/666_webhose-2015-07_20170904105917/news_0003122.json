We're doing our own investigations of his conduct. He won't be coming to your sites,'; Mr Daish said.\nMr Kivalu was charged on Friday with two counts of blackmail and remains in custody until a bail hearing next Wednesday. He plead not guilty to the charges.\nHe was arrested on Thursday after it was revealed by the commission he allegedly extorted more than $150,000 from employers in the ACT.\nMr Kivalu has denied that the CFMEU knew he received payments from employers. And Mr Daish said the CFMEU officials at the meeting in 2012 did not tell him why they stood Mr Kivalu down.\nMr Daish said he agreed to pay $3,674 for 12 \"ghost\" CFMEU memberships in 2010 after Mr Kivalu and other CFMEU officials forced his employees to stop work on a project to build apartments.\n He said he employed six to eight workers on the site and almost all of them were already members of the union's NSW branch.\nAccording to Mr Daish, Mr Kivalu said \"you need to pay anyway ... I'll just make up 12 names, you need to pay for 12 employees,\"\nDescribing the phantom workers as \"ghosts\", Mr Daish said his company had been under significant pressure to complete the project and \"and this seemed like a fairly easy way to sort of move forward and get through it\".\nIn a statement issued on Friday before Mr Daish's evidence was known, the CFMEU's national leadership said there had been no evidence from employers to the commission that the union was aware of the employer payments to Mr Kivalu.\n\"The leadership commends all the honest, hardworking officials and delegates who represent the union in their workplaces,\" they said. \"We want them to know that we won't allow the good work they do and the reputation of the union to be tarnished and undone by corruption.\"\nEmployment MInister Eric Abetz said on Friday that it took \"exposure in the royal commission and a police arrest for the CFMEU to finally admit to a problem of serious corruption within its ranks\".\nIn evidence reminiscent of a Sopranos episode, the commission heard how Mr Kivalu met with employers in his car as well as restaurants and cafes in Canberra where they handed over envelopes of cash totalling tens of thousands of dollars. Mr Kivalu admitted receiving payments from two companies but insisted the money was given voluntarily.\nMr Kivalu was expelled this week by the CFMEU after contractor Elias Taleb told the commission he paid more than $135,000 to Mr Kivalu.\n​​Mr Kivalu admitted that he took $60,000 from Mr Taleb. But asked by counsel assisting the commission Jeremy Stoljar whether he had also demanded $50,000 from Mr Taleb for the \"Morris job\", Mr Kivalu said: \"I didn't demand any money from anyone.\"\n​\n​", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-17T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:04:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
