Photo: Supplied\nConsidering a Rio Tinto worker was sacked for swearing at his supervisor, you might think swearing at work is completely inappropriate. But actually, context is everything.\nCholena Orr, director of training consultancy pac executive, says most of her colleagues agree they are not offended by swearing as long as it is not aggressive, bullying or creates an overall negative environment for others.\n\"In the past, I may have used a swear word or two in order to express myself or demonstrate that I'm not a pushover but I now believe there are so many other great words I can use,\" she says. \"I'm also very mindful of how the words that I choose have an impact on others in and out of the workplace.\"\nHowever, she agrees, as a general rule, the use of swearing depends on the environment and the relationship you have with your colleagues.\nAdvertisement \"If you are lucky enough to have a small and tight group of colleagues where no one is offended, then it may be acceptable to swear within reason and context,\" she says. \"In an open plan workplace where your audience extends past your close colleagues, swearing shouldn't be condoned.\"\nOrr says while swearing is allowed in her office, the business doesn't tolerate any behaviour that makes employees or clients feel unsafe or disrespected.\n\"I don't think having a 'no swearing' policy would be appropriate to our team. They'd feel like they couldn't be themselves and that would lead to disengagement,\" she says.\nWME Group SEO specialist Stuart Edwards says his company has recently installed several charity jars around the office where employees caught swearing have to contribute.\n\"Put simply, swearing isn't tolerated at WME but playful, foul-mouthed slip-ups, in context, are ignored,\" he says. \"We also regularly show clients around our office and if loud obscenities were heard, then I can pretty much guarantee that employee would be reprimanded in some way.\"\nRecruitment marketing specialist Employment Office recently surveyed 200 of its employer clients on workplace issues. It has found 56 per cent have had a candidate swear in a job interview, while 38 per cent have disciplined a staff member for swearing at work.\nEmployment law barrister, and founder of consultancy Employsure, Edward Mallett says when you look at what amounts to misconduct in a workplace, it's important to look at it subjectively.\n\"For example, the reaction to swearing in an environment like a butcher shop might be quite different to swearing in an office,\" he says. \"The issue is that not all small businesses are the same. The relationship between staff differs between workplaces, as does the culture.\"\nWhen the Fair Work Commission views complaints about swearing in the office, Mallett says it looks at issues such as what the workplace is like and whether the conduct has been reasonable in the context of the workplace.\nHe says determining whether swearing amounts to misconduct can be tricky.\n\"Employers may have an employee handbook outlining what misconduct is and while it might not refer to swearing, it could put instructions around what to do if someone acts in an insubordinate manner,\" he says. \"Constantly swearing in an aggressive way could apply here and discipline taken if appropriate.\"\nWhether any action can be taken over an employee swearing depends on the gravity of the situation, he says.\nIn the Rio Tinto case, the worker who was sacked said, \"f--- you\" to a supervisor who confronted him over alleged unsafe conduct.\n\"Being aggressively told 'where to go' is a situation that is likely to start straying towards serious misconduct where you might take action,\" Mallett says. \"If it's a heat of the moment thing and very unusual behaviour, then it's unlikely taking any action is warranted.\"\nOrr believes each workplace should have its own code of behaviour with consequences when the code is breached.\n\"The first warning is critical as it provides immediate feedback and sets expectations,\" she says. \"Depending upon the nature of the issue, this could extend to a fireside chat from the boss, and if repeated, to a written warning.\"\nShe adds if the behaviour continues, counselling may be required, and in very unique and inflammatory breaches, it could lead to termination subject to an appropriate performance management process.\nMeanwhile, Mallett stresses whether it's OK to swear at work remains subjective.\n\"The rule of thumb is that what equals serious misconduct in one place doesn't equal serious misconduct in all places,\" he says. \"You have to understand the particular culture of the business before you can make a call.\"\nWhat do you think?
