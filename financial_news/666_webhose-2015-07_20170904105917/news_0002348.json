The minutes showed that voting members struck a markedly dovish tone and pointed to a likely delay in the central bank's timetable for a normalization of monetary policy.\"Most commentators have been predicting the Fed will raise rates for the first time in 9 years at its September meeting but it has always been our belief that the Fed missed the window of opportunity to hike last year,\" explained Toussaint. \"In our view, it's becoming patently obvious that, while the US economy may be improving there is an undeniable slowing in the pace of that improvement. Short of another collapse in oil prices, we don't see any catalyst that could miraculously produce an acceleration in the pace of this recovery,\" he continued.Philippe Torres advised clients to remain \"on the sidelines\" in the US equity market but suggested buying Japanese equities on dips citing the potential for further monetary easing from the Bank of Japan.About Philippe TorresPhilippe Torres provides independent financial advice to individuals, professionals and any small to medium sized enterprises.Philippe Torres are a dedicated team of veteran level advisers and analysts who develop long-term relationships with our clients and other professionals.
