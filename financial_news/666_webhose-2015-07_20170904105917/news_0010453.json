Each count carries as much as 10 years in prison.\nProsecutors say Hayes bullied and cajoled fellow traders and brokers to move benchmark rates to make his positions more profitable. Hayes’s lawyers say the practice was widespread.\nConversations between traders and submitters pre-dating Hayes’s arrival at UBS in 2006 were read by Hayes’s lawyers, which they said showed the bank was already setting Libor according to its trading positions.\n“Do we have fixings?” the yen rate-setter asked a trader in a September 9, 2006, chat.\n“Net -50bio 6m today let’s go lower 6m Libor,” the trader replied, referring to the six-month yen Libor submission.\nHayes’s lawyers produced another e-mail from March 2006, months before he joined Zurich-based UBS.\nA trader asked submitters for a specific rate on a six-month position. “6m fra we’re long we want high Libor fixing,” referring to a position in forward rate agreements.\nBefore Hayes first took the stand Tuesday, Judge Jeremy Cooke said that the former trader was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome. Hayes testified that he had not conspired dishonestly to manipulate Libor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T14:44:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
