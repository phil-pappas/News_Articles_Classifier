PUBLISHED: 19:20, Tue, Jul 28, 2015 | UPDATED: 19:29, Tue, Jul 28, 2015 GETTY James Corden with Oscar Isaac at The Venture Awards The Government is the only entity profiting from our business Will Waldron \nThe London-based beer company donates its entire profits to Prostate Cancer UK and Waldron says non-profit organisations like his need wider tax exemptions to help their finances.“We have to pay duty as soon as the beer has left the brewery, which can be challenging for a small company’s finances as we may not have sold it yet,” he said at the final of The Venture, a competition for social entrepreneurs sponsored by Scotch whisky distiller Chivas in San Francisco.“The Government is the only entity profiting from our business, aside from Prostate Cancer UK. I’ve written to George Osborne calling for tax relief but got a politely-worded response along the lines of ‘thanks but no thanks’.”Tax exemptions would help social enterprises deal with the extra costs of dealing with large retailers.“You also have to factor in subscription services to payment order companies even to deal with the likes of Tesco, which costs us an extra £2,000 per year,” he said.Two Fingers donates at least 10p from every bottle made to help the fight against prostate cancer. It already produces a beer and a golden ale, stocked by vendors including Tesco and Ocado, with plans to launch a lager by next summer.Last year, in its first full year of trading, Two Fingers sold 80,000 bottles and donated more than £8,000 to Prostate Cancer UK. The firm is looking to at least double its sales next year.Two Fingers was the UK finalist of The Venture and the eventually winner of the contest, which will soon be open for applications from social enterprises for next year’s competition.
