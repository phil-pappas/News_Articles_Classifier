Washington, D.C. (PRWEB) July 02, 2015\nAs the July 4th holiday approaches, the Independent Community Bankers of America® (ICBA) and the nation’s more than 6,000 community banks are providing consumers with the information they need to help keep their money secure before they plan for the holiday weekend or their next vacation.\n“Running out of money or losing your wallet is a quick way to ruin your trip,” said ICBA Chairman Jack Hartings, president and CEO of The Peoples Bank Co., Coldwater, Ohio. “Community bankers are relationship bankers who work with their customers, so in the event something unfortunate does happen, they will be ready to lend a helping hand.”\nFinancial professionals agree that the safest and most convenient way to travel with your money is to take a small amount of cash with you. Another good idea is to bring a debit and/or credit card as well. These cards are convenient while traveling because they are easy to carry, easy to use and often offer the lowest fees and the best exchange rates. Additionally, in the event that your debit and/or credit card is lost or stolen, you can easily have it deactivated to prevent further spending by calling your bank’s customer service number for added security as opposed to lost or stolen cash, which cannot be tracked.\nICBA offers these tips to consumers about what they need to take care of before they take off:\nLet your community bank know when and where you will be traveling so that you will avoid any potential denials or fraud alerts when out-of-the-ordinary transactions are presented. Ask your community bank about daily spending and withdrawal limits to help avoid a card denial when traveling. Find out which ATM or debit card fees you may be subject to while traveling or at your travel destination. Be sure to know your community bank’s customer service phone number. Better yet, add the number to your mobile contacts in case you have to report the card lost or stolen. Have a backup card stored in a different place when you travel in case other cards get lost or stolen. Make sure your card brands are accepted at the locations or countries you are traveling to. Avoid logging onto your online or mobile banking account via public WiFi networks. Instead, use cellular data networks, or call the bank directly. If using cellular data, use virus protection to protect your accounts and phone. Do not give financial information to callers who contact you and claim to be from your bank or credit card company, especially if they ask you to provide them with private information. If you are concerned about your bank account, credit card information or other personal financial data, contact your local community bank directly.\n“Whether you and your family are traveling close to home or to a different country, it is better to be prepared for any event that comes your way. Your local community bank is always there to help ensure your finances will be kept safe,” Hartings said.\nTo find a community bank in your area, visit ICBA's community bank locator at http://www.banklocally.org .\nAbout ICBA\nThe Independent Community Bankers of America®, the nation’s voice for more than 6,000 community banks of all sizes and charter types, is dedicated exclusively to representing the interests of the community banking industry and its membership through effective advocacy, best-in-class education and high-quality products and services.
