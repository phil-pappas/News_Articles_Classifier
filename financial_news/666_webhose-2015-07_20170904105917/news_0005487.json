They are using global positioning system (GPS) units to monitor the daily activities of clients, albeit with their permission. Srei BNP Paribas , a joint venture between Kolkata-based Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd and BNP Paribas Leasing , recently decided to install GPS on the used-commercial equipment that the firm finances. The idea is to monitor the daily use of the equipment as a tool to judge the client’s ability to repay loans, particularly for commercial vehicle and commercial equipment loans—susceptible to heavy defaults. Since 1 June, Srei BNP Paribas has enabled GPS tracking on equipment worth Rs. 200 crore and the company plans to extend this to equipment worth Rs. 7,000 crore within a year, according to chief executive officer D.K. Vyas . Loan-to-value ratio in the equipment financing industry stands between 80% and 85%, which means loans worth Rs. 5,600 crore will be tracked using this system. This GPS device, which can be fixed anywhere on the equipment without meddling with its internal working, helps the lender track whether the equipment is being used regularly or not. Vyas says that this is part of the company’s plan to mitigate risk using technology. “There are only two reasons why the equipment is not under use. One is if the equipment is under repair or if the borrower is not getting enough business. In either case, we can help the borrower out,” Vyas said, adding that the lender can lead clients to larger contractors to try and win business. Srei BNP Paribas’ net non-performing assets (NPAs) for the year ended 31 March stood at 3.83% of net advances, lower than 4.07% reported in the year-ago period. The equipment financing market is said to be around Rs. 15,000-20,000 crore, where Srei BNP Paribas has 30% market share, Vyas said. Both the commercial vehicle and the commercial equipment segments have seen relatively higher default rates, particularly in times of economic stress. According to India Ratings & Research in May this year, the early delinquency index (EDI) for the commercial vehicles segment had fallen to 7.19% in February 2015 from 8.05% in the same period a year ago, PTI reported. However, for construction equipment, the weighted average delinquency rose sharply to 4.94% in February 2015 from 3.23% a year ago. “Lender vigilance can probably help in catching up with wilful defaulters or help the borrowers in prioritizing which lender to repay first in case of a multiple lending arrangement. However, since a large number of these companies have pending payments from older orders and are also suffering from lack of new business, a proactive lender can’t change much for them,” said Vibha Batra, senior vice-president, ICRA Ltd , a credit rating agency. While so far the devices are being added to the equipment post-production, the firm is in talks with original equipment manufacturers to produce new equipment with an in-built GPS tracker, so that even new vehicles can be tracked in future. Srei BNP Paribas aims to track about 75% of the equipment it has financed within the next three years using GPS. “As a lender, the fact that the equipment is being used regularly gives me a lot of comfort. It just means that my borrower is getting more business and therefore loan repayment will not be delayed,” Vyas said. Apart from the immediate risk of repayment due to limited use of equipment, the resale value of such equipment also falls if it is not used—further risk in cases where loans are backed by collateral in the form of equipment. Not everyone is convinced the strategy will work. “We have not put GPS in any of the vehicles and have no plans to use it. GPS has been in the vogue for many years now but not many are doing it. The problem is that it can also be removed,” said S.V. Parthasarathy, head, consumer finance, IndusInd Bank Ltd , which also has a significant presence in segments like commercial vehicle lending.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:04:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
