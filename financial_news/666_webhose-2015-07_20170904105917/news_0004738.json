Gold took support on Tuesday from unexpectedly weak U.S. retail sales data, which stoked speculation a rate rise could be pushed back.\nIn Greece, lawmakers from Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' Syriza party and their allies are preparing to vote on European Union prescribed austerity measures on Wednesday, seen as the key hurdle to a final agreement for a bailout.\nA lot of the measures in a deal struck with Greece's lenders will have a recessionary effect, but removing the prospect of a \"Grexit\" will help offset their impact and bring in investments, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said.\n\"Greece developments have not had a bullish impact on gold but further glitches in the Greek debt relief process could lend modest support to prices,\" HSBC said in a note.\nAmong other precious metals, silver was down 0.3 percent at $15.30 an ounce, while platinum was flat at $1,023 an ounce and palladium was up 0.5 percent at $652.97 an ounce.
