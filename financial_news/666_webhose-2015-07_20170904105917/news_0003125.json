Other service sectors are expected to gain traction as the switch from a mining economy continues.\nActuarial firm Rice Warner says while the average expected return from Australian equities for the next 10 years has been revised downwards to 8.1 per cent from 9.7 per cent three years ago, it remains respectable.\nFar less enticing are the average expected 10-year returns of Australian fixed interest and cash of 2.5 per cent and 3.3 per cent respectively. The average expected 10-year return from global fixed interest is even lower at 2.1 per cent.\nRice Warner senior consultant Alun Stevens says the downward revision of long-term earnings expectations across asset classes will make some of the more ambitious targets of superannuation funds with balanced investment strategies – notably those promising 4 per cent-plus above inflation – difficult to achieve over the next 10 years.\nSo as the marketing departments of superannuation funds prepare to go into overdrive managing client expectations, where should direct investors head in a low-growth environment?\nUBS Wealth Management's head of investment strategy David Sokulsky says though now is not a time to be taking on a lot of risk, there are companies here and overseas that will benefit from cyclical growth. But the key is to be selective.\nSokulsky says the search for yield has pushed up the price of many of the obvious domestic investor choices, including the big banks and utilities, although those prepared to ride out some long-term volatility could still benefit.\nImportance of yield Better growth and income prospects could be found among stocks such as insurance company QBE Insurance, medical network Primary Health Care and energy provider Origin Energy, he says.\nMiddleton Securities principal and adviser Nick Loxton also warns against chasing growth and yield, and then trying to justify the higher stock prices.\n\"If you overpay for assets, it usually doesn't end all that well,\" he says.\nLincoln chief executive Elio D'Amato says the key ingredient to successful long-term investing is not picking the best sectors but identifying and holding on to the best companies.\nWhile identifying several preferred companies with good growth prospects, he says yields will be still be important in 2016 when the low earnings growth environment is expected to make dividends even more important.\nD'Amato's top growth and income stock picks include food outlet group Collins Foods, Coles owner Wesfarmers, financial services group Perpetual, consumer leasing company Thorn Group and footwear business RCG.\nElite Wealth senior investment strategist Geoff Saffer sees better value in the small to mid-cap sectors.\n\"There has been much talk about the Australian economy struggling. We are growing at below-trend pace and the slack from the mining investment slowdown has not really been taken up by other sectors, but there are still plenty of appealing investment opportunities,\" says Saffer.\n\"Investing in smaller companies certainly carries an element of extra risk, but buying a good company is more important than buying a large company,\" he says.\nWhether it is big or small, investment risk can be reduced by following some simple rules, Saffer says: look for stocks that are experiencing sales growth, increasing margins, boast a solid balance sheet, have a competitive and appealing product range and are in sectors enjoying tailwinds from economic or customer trends.\nFour smaller stocks with good growth potential that Saffer says investors could consider adding to their portfolios include IT services company ASG Group, Collins Foods, recently floated distributor of kitchen appliances and consumer products Shriro Holdings and oil explorer Otto Energy.\nTop 10 growth stocks\nTop growth potential still overseas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:11:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
