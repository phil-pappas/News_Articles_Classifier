The US$500 million worth data center will be located in Fort Worth Texas and will be using the power of sun as its electricity. \n“Facebook’s new goal of using 50 percent renewable energy and commitment to powering its Texas data center with clean wind power demonstrates the kind of transparency needed to show that it is making steady progress toward its goal of using 100 percent renewable energy,” David Pomerantz, senior climate and energy campaigner with Greenpeace, was quoted as saying in a statement. \nFacebook’s new data center, thanks to its 200-megawatt wind project, will not be using air-conditioning units to cool its offices. Instead, it will use natural air. The company is partnering with Citigroup Energy, Alterra Power Corporation and Starwood Energy Group in its clean energy project. \nAside from cleaner alternative energy, Facebook said the venture has saved the company more than $2 billion over the last three years. Data centers, according to Forbes, use a significant amount of energy, but they are also the companies that are targeting increased use of renewable energy. \nComputer World cited a rise in the use of renewable energy with a significant number of Fortune 100 companies saving $1.1 billion in energy costs through their renewable energy targeted goals. \nScientists and environmentalists have urged economies to put in place concrete actions to implement climate solutions and reduce the amount of dangerous carbon emissions.Climate change is one of the environmental threats facing the world and a key solution to it is a shift to renewable energies. \nCountries and companies within the nations are transitioning to the use of both wind, solar and other renewable forms of energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Private sectors, developed and developing nations are trying to make a massive technological change to clean energies.A recent report stated that overall, solar power has attracted the most investment with more nations shifting to “greener’ energy. Data from Clean Edge showed that by 2022 clean energy revenues will be worth $426.1 billion, almost double of its total value of $248.7 billion three years ago. \nMeanwhile the new report, “Power Shift: Emerging Clean Energy Markets,” showed that renewable technologies are projected to be responsible for 60 percent of new electricity generated worldwide by 2030 that could translate to a $5 trillion opportunity. \nIt added that from 2013 to 2030, more than 5,570 gigawatts can cover 60 percent of the total global demand energy, which could surpass the fossil-fueled, run energy sources. \nThere are many types of renewable energy, which can reduce economies reliance to fossil fuels and its threat to the climate. More and more countries are realizing the importance of the alternative source of power from biofuel, wind and solar markets. \nVarious reports have also noted that among all types of renewable energy, solar energy usage is growing as the world quickly switch to clean and affordable energy sources. \nRenewable energy has so many benefits: it not only allows world economies to have a safe climate future, but it can also expand several industries such as copper mining. \nCopper is an important component in clean energy systems because it has the best and cost-effective electrical conductor. One company that mines and produces copper is Amur Minerals Corporation (London AIM: AMC). \nThe nickel copper sulphide miner is focused on base metal projects in the far east of Russia. The company's principal asset is the Kun-Manie sulphide nickel, copper project located in Amur Oblast, with production of 830,000 nickel equivalent tonnes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T03:27:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
