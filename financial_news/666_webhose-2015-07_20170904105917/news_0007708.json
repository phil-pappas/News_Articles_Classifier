Glenn Hunt Share on twitter by Mark Ludlow The battle over New Hope Group's $900 million expansion of its Acland coal mine, west of Brisbane, has found an unlikely ally – Queensland's parliamentary speaker Peter Wellington.\nWhile the focus of attention has been on the approval of the Shenhua mine in the Liverpool Plains in NSW, across the border in south-east Queensland a similar struggle is being waged over the potential damage to prime farming land in the Darling Downs.\nToowoomba Regional Council mayor Paul Antonio says the issue has split communities in the region between farmers who are worried about damage to the water table and those who support the jobs and investment the mine brings to the region.\n\"It is dividing the community. The council has had our say when needs be and we have expressed our concern about water,\" Councillor Antonio said.\nSpeaker Peter Wellington says: \"Business in Queensland is more than coal - much, much more than coal.\" \"But in saying that there are many people in this community who see the economic benefits as being pretty significant. There are some farmers who are still on their farms today because they have alternate income [from the mine].\n\"It's pretty evenly split and there is enormous passion on both sides. It's a pretty tough one but we have tried to strike a balance.\"\nThe Queensland government has yet to make a decision on the mine expansion – which will extend its life to 2027 – but it is wary of how prickly the issue has become and how quickly anti-mining groups, such as Lock The Gate, can whip up opposition to resource projects.\nConservative radio announcer Alan Jones, who has also been a vocal critic against the Shenhua mine, - used his opposition to the Acland mine as an effective weapon against former Liberal National Party Premier Campbell Newman during the state election campaign earlier this year.\n The Newman government controversially approved the expansion of the third stage of the Acland mine late last year. But Mr Jones said it was a broken promise after telling farmers in the Darling Downs he did not support the mine expansion. He also highlighted the $700,000 in donations by New Hope Group's parent company, Washington H Soul Pattinson, to the federal Liberal Party.\nAmid growing community anger in the rural towns, such as Oakey and Jondaryn, over the mine, the Palaszczuk Labor government last week changed the laws to re-instate community objection rights to big mining projects.\nMr Wellington, the Independent MP for Nicklin, has lent his support to the cause, accepting a petition of 4000 people against the mine. Premier Palaszczuk is reliant on Mr Wellington's support to form minority government.\n\"I say let's stop it now. Business in Queensland is more than coal, much, much more than coal, and I will not be persuaded or lobbied by the mining groups or anyone else,\" Mr Wellington told a small rally outside state parliament last week.\nFarmers argue the further expansion of the mine, increasing the output from 4.8 million tonnes to 7.5 million tonnes per year, will damage water supplies in prime agricultural land.\nCattle farmer Frank Ashman, who bought his Brymaroo property four years ago, said New Hope's own environmental impact statement acknowledged the project would take a toll on water supplies.\n\"If we can't water our stock, there's no argument about it – our livelihood's done,\" he said. \"And that's pretty unfair when you think we've put $1.8-1.9 million into trying to develop this particular starting operation.\"\nFellow farmer Aileen Harrison recounted how the constant clouds of dust emanating from the construction of the mine contaminated her water tanks and caused health problems before she accepted an offer to be bought out.\n\"If stage three is allowed to go ahead, there will be another lot of people who are going to lose out again.\"\nBut New Hope Group managing director Shane Stephan​ said it was committed to expanding the mine which it said has provided hundreds of jobs to the local community since it began operations in 2002.\n\"The current stage two of the mine is due to finish operations in 2017 or so, meaning if stage three is not approved, hundreds of employees will lose their jobs, plus thousands more indirect jobs will be lost in the region,\" Mr Stephan said. \"Stage three of the New Acland Project will provide a further boost of $12 billion to the local, state and national economies over the life of the mine.\"\nQueensland's Natural Resources and Mines Minister Anthony Lynham said the new laws restoring community objections to mining projects showed the Labor government was listening and would strike a balance between appropriate development and community input into projects.\nNew Hope is yet to be granted a mining lease or environmental authority for the Acland expansion. The case is also off to the Land Court as well as an internal government review of the Newman administration's approvals.\n\"We are restoring rights that the LNP stripped away landholders and members of the community. I want people to have their day in court, but not years in court. I will be closely monitoring how this plays out,\" he said.\n\"The Palaszczuk Government supports sustainable economic development of our resource sector because we want to create jobs for Queenslanders.\"\nOpposition mines spokesman Andrew Cripps said the unnecessary reviewing of the Acland project was affecting investor confidence in Queensland, citing a Queensland Resources Council survey of mining chief executives who said regulatory uncertainty was their biggest concern.\n\"We've got Labor rejecting a one-stop shop for environmental approvals to reduce red tape, so activists can tie new resources sector projects up in green tape for months or years on end,\" he said.\n\"This survey shows the Queensland resources sector is losing confidence in the ability of the Palaszczuk government to provide the regulatory certainty they need to invest with confidence and they are worried about the increasing influence of green activists.\"\nWith AAP", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/M_Ludlow"], "published": "2015-07-23T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:00:57.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
