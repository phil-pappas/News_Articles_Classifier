Also, please try and get the person's name and which department they work in and then phone the bank back via switchboard to verify the fact that this person exists, rather than taking it at face value that the caller works for the bank. This should be done for any transactions that sound a bit strange. Rather phone once too often than too little and keep your hard earned cash,\" noted Muranda. \n\"People who have lost their loved ones will receive a call from a person introducing him/herself to be an employee of FNB. The person would advise that the deceased had a policy with FNB and that he/she is the beneficiary of the policy. The fraudster would then ask for banking details of the beneficiary and identity details supposedly to deposit the benefit. This is in actual fact just a trick and the person will call back after a while telling them that in order to hasten the payout of the claim, the customer needs to deposit a certain amount to a given account and or e-Wallet, for funds to be cleared. This is unheard of and a scam,\" explained Muranda. \n\"I would like once again to caution all customers to be wide awake and super alert and to look at and react to any finance issues carefully. It seems as if numerous money scams are continuing and unfortunately people still fall for them. Also - always remember - if it sounds too good to be true - it usually is. If you have suddenly inherited millions, but they need your bank details and more for transfer - do not react. \nIf you are asked for a deposit in order to receive funds you are not aware of - chances are this is a scam. Remain alert and vigilant at all times, please,\" warned Muranda.
