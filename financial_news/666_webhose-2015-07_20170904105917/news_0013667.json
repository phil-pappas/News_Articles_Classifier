As competition grows in Sydney, however, Chinese attention will flow to Melbourne, Ray White and Juwai.com say. Anna Kucera Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Chinese commercial property investment in Sydney more than quadruples that of Melbourne, but that is likely to change as Sydney yields compress, a report by Ray White and property portal Juwai.com says.\nSydney and Melbourne both registered 41 commercial property transactions over the 12 months to June, but while those totalled $4.18 billion-worth of deals in Sydney, the Melbourne total was just $950.7 million, due to Sydney being the focus of bigger-ticket, institutional investment and Melbourne a focus for family groups and smaller businesses, the report says.\nThe average commercial transaction in Melbourne was $23.19 million, compared to $101.94 million in Sydney.\n\"Big institutional investors mostly focus on prime assets in Sydney, while smaller investors are most interested in less expensive assets,\" Juwai co-CEO Andrew Taylor said.\nThe balance may be changing. Chinese interest in Melbourne as a destination – measured by interest expressed on Juwai.com's website – surged over the last quarter. While that was no guarantee of purchasing behaviour, increased competition for site, rising prices and lower yields in Sydney were likely to drive investors south down the Hume Highway, said Ray White Commercial head of research Vanessa Rader.\n\"Those people missing out in Sydney will start moving to Melbourne as it has become a more affordable option,\" Ms Rader said.\nEstablished networks They were likely to choose Melbourne over an alternative like Brisbane because the larger proportion of Chinese residential property owners in the Victorian capital meant many commercial buyers would have a network and already be familiar with the market, she said.\n \"There is a large comfort level with Melbourne,\" Ms Rader said. \" It's an easier transaction to go to Melbourne than Brisbane, as there is that established network.\"\nAny change wouldn't be quick, she said.\n\"It'll probably be over the next 12 to 18 months.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "http://www.contactually.com/li/dc977d3ef323fd19cc33", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-05T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:03:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
