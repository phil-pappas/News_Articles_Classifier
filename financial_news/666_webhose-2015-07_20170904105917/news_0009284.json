That compared with a rise of 1.7 percent in the first quarter. \nVolume, which measures the amount of tobacco sold, fell 2.9 percent. \n($1 = 0.6409 pounds) (Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T10:49:13.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
