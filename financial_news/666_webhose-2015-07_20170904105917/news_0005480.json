In the current environment of ample supplies, and rising demand for energy due to a growing economy, firms and industries that use energy increase their stockpiles or inventories. This is beneficial to the energy storage and transportation sector. Since oil prices crashed last year, the sector benefited greatly; an oil glut means it's a seller's market for storage. \nSo, what are the best oil and gas storage and transportation investors should be buying? Here are the top four, according to TheStreet Ratings , TheStreet 's proprietary ratings tool. \nTheStreet Ratings projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and dividends.
