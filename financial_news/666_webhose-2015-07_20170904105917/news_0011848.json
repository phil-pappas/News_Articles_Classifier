There will be changes in the branch location as well, depending on where the habitation is moving,” she said.\nShe said the bank had started on the digital journey officially from last year in July by opening\nIntouch branches by converting the brick and motor branch into a digital place with no cash and with lots of screens.\nShe said the bank will also target the younger population by opening digital branches in localities where the population is largely young professionals.\nFirst Published on July 2, 2015 12:19 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:13:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
