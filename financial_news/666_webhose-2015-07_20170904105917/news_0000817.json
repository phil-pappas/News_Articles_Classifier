The UN body is also not satisfied with Bangkok's earlier decision to deport 170 Uyghurs with Turkish passport to Turkey.\n\"While we are seeking further clarifications on what happened exactly, we are shocked by this deportation of some 100 people and consider it a flagrant violation of international law,\" Volker Turk, UNHCR assistant high commissioner for protection, said.\n\"I strongly urge the Thai authorities to investigate this matter and appeal to Thailand to honour its fundamental international obligations, notably the principle of non-refoulement, and to refrain from such deportations in the future,\" he was Quote: d saying by the Thai media.\nNon-refoulement, a facet of refugee law, a principle that forbids the rendering of a true victim of persecution to his or her persecutor. Such a prosecutor is usually the government of a country.\nHuman rights experts have expressed concern that the deported Uyghurs will be treated as suspects of terrorism acts, and prosecuted. Xinjiang, the province to which they belong, is a hotbed of terrorist activities.\nThe UNHCR also urged Thailand to allow the remaining 50 illegal Uyghur migrants to stay in the country, and seek asylum in other countries.\nThailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha has clarified that they were repatriated in accordance with its international obligations and national procedures.\n\"We repatriated them in accordance with the processes and evidence [of their nationality],\" he said.\nThe Chinese government has assured Bangkok of the safety of the 100 Uyghurs, who were deported to China, according to Thai officials. China was unhappy that 170 other Uyghurs were sent to Turkey but Bangkok stood by its own law, they said. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Uyghur Muslims,UNHCR,Turkish passport,non-refoulement,disturbed Chinese Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-07-29T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:50:11.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
