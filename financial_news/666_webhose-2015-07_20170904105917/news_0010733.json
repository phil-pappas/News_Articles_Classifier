He’ll be based in New York and report to Jeff Fields, head of North American FIC sales, and Vimal Patel, who runs global algorithmic trading.\n“We are not replicating our equities algorithmic model in fixed income,” Jonathan Hunter, RBC’s global head of fixed income, said in an interview. “Rather, we are utilizing the intelligence from our equities platform to further build and strengthen our FIC platform.”\nRBC has been making inroads in electronic trading, gaining attention last year in Michael Lewis’s book “Flash Boys” for its role developing software to protect against traders using speed as an advantage. The firm also has supported alternative stock-trading venues including those run by IEX Group Inc. and Aequitas Innovations Inc. in Canada.\nAli joined RBC in 2012, and previously worked at Quantitative Brokers, a New York-based broker-dealer, according to his LinkedIn profile. He has a degree in computer engineering from the University of Illinois.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:37:12.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
