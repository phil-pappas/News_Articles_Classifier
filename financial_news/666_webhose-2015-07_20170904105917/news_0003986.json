When it comes to your self-managed superannuation fund, the question is even more important.\nPlenty of statistics are thrown around about the level of insurance (or perhaps underinsurance) that Australians in general hold. Do you have enough life insurance to cover your debts and the future needs of your family if you were to pass away? What if you were to suffer a traumatic event that resulted in large medical expenses?\nThere are important considerations when it comes to insurance within the SMSF environment. Many are consistent across the superannuation industry generally but as the trustee of your own fund you are also responsible, and ultimately liable, if something goes wrong.\nAs a result of changes made last year to the super laws from July 1, 2014, a superannuation fund is not able to own a new insurance policy if the event insured under that policy did not correspond with a superannuation condition of release.\nThis means that where an insurance policy is held through a super fund for the benefit of a member, if the policy were to pay out to the fund the member should have access to the insurance proceeds.\nOn the face of it, this change makes sense. The last thing you would want as a member is to think you had done the right thing, had obtained the right level of insurance, only to then find out you couldn't access the funds when you most needed them.\nPerhaps the biggest concern in this area was where members had taken out total and permanent disability (TPD) insurance based on \"own occupation\". Under these policies, the benefit would be paid out where the member was no longer able to work in their particular occupation.\nHowever, if, based on their education, training and experience, the person was still able to work in another occupation, then often the funds would not be able to be paid out from the fund. This is because the TPD definition for the release of benefits from a superannuation fund requires that the member is no longer able to be employed in \"any occupation\" based on their education, training and experience.\n Don't sit still You might ask why this issue is relevant now if the change was made over 12 months ago. The answer is that any good financial plan needs to be reviewed on a regular basis – it should never sit still.\nJust as you may review your investments regularly, you should do the same with insurances. SMSF trustees are legally required to review their investment strategy on a regular basis, and this should cover the needs of the members (including insurances).\nWhen it comes to insurance, many people could (or should) ask: do I have enough? But it's equally relevant to consider if you have too much. If a member's investment has performed well, do they have more insurance than required? Lowering the level of coverage should lead to a lower level of premium, meaning there is more left for investment within the fund itself.\nAnd if you were to change insurance levels (either up or down), it's always worth considering if you have the entire level of coverage for different events that you need, and whether your current insurer remains the best option, or if there is a better deal available. But remember, if you take out a new policy, then the changes that applied from July last year need to be considered.\nThe other area of concern is the approach the Australian Taxation Office has taken. If you have borrowed to acquire property within your SMSF, you may have received a recommendation to also take out insurance to ensure the debt could be repaid in the event that, as a member, you were to pass away or were unable to work.\nOften the purpose behind these policies was to ensure there was enough liquidity within the SMSF to remove the need to sell property if that was not the intent. And even if selling the property was an option, that can take time and not provide the funds needed at the time.\nThese changes all highlight one important thing: if you make the decision to have an SMSF, it's vitally important to keep up to date with developments – not only legislative changes that may have happened some time ago, but also the way that changes are being interpreted today.\nThere is a wealth of support available to help you do this, including from financial planners, fund administrators and the ATO's website. Ensuring you stay on top of these insurance changes will help set you up for success.\nBryan Ashenden is the senior manager, advice strategies and knowledge, BT Financial Group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T23:08:38.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
