The real answer is that, while there is a clear and significant boost in business confidence, it is too early to quantify.\nSales in the sector have been generally showing moderate growth, and better than many other sectors of the retail market.\nLarge-format retailers have just finished a solid end-of-financial year sale time thanks to the budget, record low interest rates and reduced petrol prices.\nIn NSW, however, benefits of the tax package may be hampered due to the lack of large-format retail stores in NSW. A recently released evidence-based report backed by Professor Allan Fels AO, Large Format Retail in NSW, 'Investment + Competition = Jobs identifies a substantial lack of floor space allocated to the sector; in fact, there are numerous municipalities in the Sydney metropolitan area that do not even have land zoned for large-format retail purposes. There is an increased drive-time for customers to visit a large-format retail outlet in NSW, compared with Victoria and Queensland.\nThe sector has evolved in Australia as a direct result of consumer demand and occupies around 30 per cent of all retail floor space in Australia; accounting for $59.8 billion a year, or 21.9 per cent of all retail sales. It employs more than 388,000 Australians, both directly and indirectly.\nThe sector offers a depth of product ranges and is well equipped to meet many of the needs of Australia's small business needs, but in NSW, it desperately needs the planning and zoning laws changed to allow opportunities such as the small business package in the federal budget to be optimised.\nPhilippa Kelly is the chief executive of the Large Format Retail Association.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:13:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
