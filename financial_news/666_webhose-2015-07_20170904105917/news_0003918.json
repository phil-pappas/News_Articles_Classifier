Currently, credit card companies are expanding their reach through rewards programs, advertising and incentive programs. These actions are intended to give cardholders an incentive to use credit cards over other payment methods. \nThis is resulting in ever-growing numbers of merchants accepting a variety of credit cards, in turn creating a culture where it is ever easier to have and make use of credit cards. They also have the added benefit of providing greater security for transactions. Shifts in the global marketplace are resulting in greater reliance on credit cards in the United States, and around the world. Here are some of the trends that are expected to affect the future of credit cards. \nCollecting Data and Targeting Offers \nThe banks that hold your credit cards know a lot about you. Not only are they aware of your credit card account, they also know where you work, your pay and where you spend it. All of this data is collected and will eventually be used to make targeted offers based on what’s relevant to you. It’s something like the rewards program offered by many national grocery store chains, but expanded to include a wide range of merchants. \nUsing Mobile Platforms \nNot only will the data collected on you be used to make targeted offers, it will also be incorporated into mobile platforms, so that offers can be made directly to you, depending on your location and spending habits. It remains to be seen whether these offers will be viewed as helpful or intrusive, but banks are intending to mitigate that issue by making the offers highly relevant and valuable. \nReaching Unbanked and Underbanked Customers \nNearly 10% of the adult population in the US does not have bank access. Without a savings or checking account, it can be costly and difficult to cash checks, make payments or buy items online or build a good credit history. Banks are exploring the option of partnering with major retailers to offer pre-paid cards to those don’t have, or don’t want, traditional bank access. \nEvolution of Credit and the future as viewed by our crystal ball \nWhile many banks are exploring new ways to reach more customers and increase the prevalence of credit cards, the changes that are planned won’t be revolutionary. Rather, they will represent a slow evolution to a new kind of credit card experience. Although many things will be changing, the regulatory landscape looks stable and the changes that are planned will be more about making credit cards more accessible and relevant for users. We at Painless Processing don’t believe that legislative efforts will disrupt the credit card industry but rather technologies like Apple Pay, Paypal and other solutions will drive fees down for business and lead to less rewards for consumers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T19:49:00.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
