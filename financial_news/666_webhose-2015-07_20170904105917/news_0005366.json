The dealer portion topped 50 percent in 2012.\n ``It is supportive for the Treasury market and reflective of the fact that dealers are less willing to take risk in this market in general,&apos;&apos; said Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut.\n The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, is 2.83 for the entire $1.115 trillion in notes and bonds sold this year, compared with 2.98 in 2014. Marketable Treasuries outstanding total $12.7 trillion.\nInvestor demand declined at Thursday&apos;s 30-year bond auction after Chinese stocks gained the most in six years, with dealers taking 40.8 percent of the $13 billion offering.\n``The 30-year is a much more challenging benchmark to underwrite&apos;&apos; due to its greater interest-rate risk, Lyngen said.\nThe 30-year bonds sold at a yield of 3.084 percent, compared with a pre-auction forecast of 3.081 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of six of the primary dealers that are obligated bid at the sales.\nThe Treasury auctioned $21 billion of 10-year notes Wednesday at a yield of 2.225 percent and sold $24 billion of three-year notes July 7 at a yield of 0.932 percent.", "external_links": ["http://assets.bwbx.io/images/i.AyND3vO.Rk/v1/460x260.jpg\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iPTU6d3ch7UA/v1/460x260.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-07-10T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T23:43:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
