Marathon Petroleum Corp bought natgas processor MarkWest Energy Partners LP in a $15.6 billion deal earlier this week. \nKinder Morgan, which last year put all of its publicly traded partnerships into one corporate parent company, raised its quarterly divided by 14 percent to 49 cents per share. \nThe company said it continued to remain on track for 2015 dividend target of $2 per share. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) of Kinder Morgan were marginally up at $37.83 in extended trading on Wednesday. \nKinder Morgan's net income attributable to shareholders fell 29 percent to $333 million in the second quarter ended June 30, from the first quarter ended March 31. \nExcluding items, earnings from natgas pipelines, the company's biggest business, fell 14.6 percent to $928 million. \nEarlier this year, Kinder Morgan entered North Dakota's Bakken shale with a $3 billion acquisition of Hiland Partners, a pipeline and logistics company. \nThe company said growth in its natgas pipeline unit was \"partially affected\" in the second quarter due to weak commodity prices. \nEarnings in its carbon-dioxide unit fell to $240 million from $281 million.
