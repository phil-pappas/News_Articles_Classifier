This was the highest amount since August 2004, when 582 people joined agents. \nJune's figure was also up sharply from the 383 recorded by the National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) in May, as house-hunters rush to take advantage of mortgage deals before the Bank of England raises interest rates at the end of the year. \nTurmoil during the general election in May has also subsided, causing more people to re-enter the housing market. \nHowever, the spike in competition for properties has been made worse by the average number of available houses per branch falling to 44 in June, from 46 in May. \nThe average number of house hunters per estate agent branch has risen \nMark Hayward, managing director at the NAEA, said: “What we’re seeing is a market that lulled over the general election period, coming back to life in full force. \n\"Buyers are feeling more confident and those who put their plans on hold over the election and political aftermath have kicked off their hunt, causing this massive jump in demand. \n\"There’s also an impetus to buy right now in light of the impending interest rate rise as buyers fight to buy and fix mortgage rates.\" \nThe NAEA figures also showed that the average number of sales per estate agent remained at nine last month. \nThe housing stock has fallen in the past month \nHowever, first-time buyers were the big losers, with the average percentage of debut homeowners falling to 24pc, from 29pc in the previous month. \nThe announcement that the number of buyers is growing while the housing stock is shrinking will worry politicians and homebuyers alike. \nThe average cost of a home in the UK crept up from £271,000 in April to £274,000 in May - according to the latest official Government data - to levels last hit at the peak of the market last summer. \nEarlier this month George Osborne began to overhaul the country’s planning system in a bid to build more homes. \nThe percentage of first-time buyers fell to 24pc in June \nHe said sweeping reforms were needed to “confront the challenge of our lifetime”, including forcing local communities to accept developments against their will. \n\"The fact that demand is at an 11-year high without the housing stock to fuel it is bad news for the market,” Mr Hayward said. \n\"The growing gap between supply and demand is worrying and clearly demonstrates that more needs to be done to plug this. The election was full of promises to build more houses, but now those promises need to be put into bricks and mortar to respond to demand.\" \nCredit ratings agency Moody's said on Monday that UK households can withstand a rise in interest rates as they have been \"toughened up\" by the financial crisis. \nIt added that people are \"very unlikely\" to slip into arrears on their mortgages as they will reduce their spending on other items to compensate for the change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T02:48:22.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
