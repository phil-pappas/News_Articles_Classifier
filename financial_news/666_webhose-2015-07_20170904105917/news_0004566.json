So we’re looking to build a house on this new block while retaining the current property. We also purchased a property in Mango Hill where we’ve finished building six months ago.”\nMr Bhan said the “game plan” was to create a portfolio of properties that covered the spectrum of what was on offer in greater Brisbane, and with house rents in the area hovering around $650 a week, he was more than happy.\nMirvac residential development chief executive John Carfi said lifestyle was huge drawcard in properties that sat on Brisbane’s outer rim.\n“You can live in a peaceful pocket of outer Brisbane yet have all the amenities you need right on your doorstep. In Brisbane you can go from CBD to natural bush land in less than 30 minutes and Bridgeman Downs lies on the border of both.”\nOriginally published as Family quick to snap up site ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/blocks-building-up-the-outer-rim/story-fndbalka-1227434841211?sv=5fed1a648588793991a406325348ef1c&h=Family+quick+to+snap+up+site", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/blocks-building-up-the-outer-rim/story-fndbalka-1227434841211?sv=5fed1a648588793991a406325348ef1c", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/blocks-building-up-the-outer-rim/story-fndbalka-1227434841211?sv=5fed1a648588793991a406325348ef1c&title=Family+quick+to+snap+up+site", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/blocks-building-up-the-outer-rim/story-fndbalka-1227434841211?sv=5fed1a648588793991a406325348ef1c", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Family+quick+to+snap+up+site&c=ALVIN+and+Nitasha+Bhan+had+been+eyeing+off+their+dream+home+site+for+years.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/blocks-building-up-the-outer-rim/story-fndbalka-1227434841211?sv=5fed1a648588793991a406325348ef1c", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/blocks-building-up-the-outer-rim/story-fndbalka-1227434841211?sv=5fed1a648588793991a406325348ef1c&title=Family+quick+to+snap+up+site", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/blocks-building-up-the-outer-rim/story-fnihpu6h-1227434841211"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T08:30:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
