With oil stocks the worst performing shares in the world, there's fears it might be the latter. Photo: Reuters\nYou know the world is in trouble when investors look to the oil industry for safety.\nOil stocks, the worst performing shares in the world, are starting to lure investors, with dividend yields the highest since the financial crisis that began in 2008.\nTheir payouts are more remarkable in this era of record-low interest on cash and zero to negative yields on government bonds. Chaos in Greece and tanking Chinese markets only add to investor losses, with more than $US3 trillion wiped off global equities in the past month.\nRoyal Dutch Shell's dividend offers 6.7 percent on shareholders' cash, a rate not seen since the global financial meltdown and almost double the average for London's FTSE-100 stock index. Morgan Stanley says the extra yield offered by oil companies over the equity market is the most in 30 years.\n\"Undervalued share prices, continuous high dividend: It's a good time for investors to get into the oil companies,\" Richard Hulf, co-manager in London of Artemis Global Energy Fund, part of a group overseeing $32 billion ($43 trillion) for investors, said June 30.\nWith Europe at the centre of the global economic malaise, lending to Germany for 10 years gets you less than 1 per cent. In contrast, Exxon Mobil has a dividend yield of 3.5 per cent, the highest since 1996. BP and Chevron offer rates of 6.8 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively.\nBond proxy\n\"Top investors are buying Big Oil as a proxy to a bond,\" said Norbert Ruecker, commodities research chief at Bank Julius Baer & Co. in Zurich.\nOil companies' share prices, the denominator to the dividend numerator, have collapsed. Energy companies on the benchmark MSCI All-Country World Index of global stocks have sunk 7.1 per cent this year, the worst performance of any industry.\nCrude oil prices have fallen by almost half in a year, with the world on the brink of the longest-lasting glut in at least three decades. That cut earnings, with median net income among 15 of the largest integrated oil companies down 45 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier. The knock-on effects include producers' shrinking spending on the biggest projects and on exploration that will secure future income.\nBP chief executive Bob Dudley is preparing for a long period of lower oil prices, he said in London last month.\nValue trap\nEven when prices were at $US100 a barrel, some producers were failing to generate enough cash to fund both their investments and dividends. Instead, they took on debt to meet payments to shareholders. Prices for crude oil are now at $US60.\n\"When you see an abnormally high yield relative to the market, that can either be fantastic value or it can be a value trap,\" said Philip Lawlor, a strategist at Smith & Williamson Investment Management in London, which oversees about $US25 billion of investments. \"We're underweight on the oil sector.\"\nBrent, a benchmark for the fossil fuel, has tumbled 10 per cent this month as demand from a weakening Chinese economy slows and the US pumps more oil. Prices may drop further as the world will remain \"massively oversupplied\" before markets tighten in 2016, the International Energy Agency said Friday.\nIn 1986, when oil prices collapsed to $US10, the biggest European producers shrank capital spending by a quarter and operating costs on oil and gas output by about a third, Morgan Stanley said in a report published on June 29 with the Boston Consulting Group.\nThat meant a 16 per cent annual return on average in the following decade, compared with 12 per cent for the wider European market, the report shows. Oil companies will now have to lower costs by 20 per cent to sustain dividends, the analysts wrote.\n\"The companies are not likely to cut dividends,\" said Hulf at Artemis. \"It's sacred to them.\"\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:09:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
