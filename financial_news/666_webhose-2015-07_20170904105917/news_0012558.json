Reports Second Quarter Earnings of $107.5 Million or $11.37 Diluted Earnings Per Share Including a $103.0 Million Reversal of the Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance July 30, 2015 17:30 ET | Source: Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc. \nMADISON, Wisc., July 30, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc. (the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ABCW ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, AnchorBank, fsb (the \"Bank\") today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The Company recorded a strong and profitable quarter with net income of $107.5 million or $11.37 per diluted common share. Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 includes a one-time income tax benefit, net of current quarter provision, of $103.0 million or $10.89 per diluted share primarily resulting from the reversal of substantially all of the Company's net deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Pre-tax income of $4.5 million or $0.48 per diluted share included the impact of one-time gains and costs associated with several previously announced operational efficiency initiatives during the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Management anticipates these initiatives will result in annual net cost savings of approximately $5.4 million related to reduced compensation, occupancy and other operating costs. \n\"Our strong results reflect the significant progress the Company has made in restoring profitability, capital and improving asset quality. We're pleased with our performance and have positioned the Company to allow for the recapture of substantially all of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance,\" said Chris Bauer, President and CEO. \nHighlights include: \nDeferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance \nDuring September 2009, the Company established a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance. As a result of management's periodic assessment of all of the positive and negative evidence regarding the deferred tax asset position, during the second quarter of 2015, the Company has substantially reversed the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. The Company has determined that it is more likely than not it will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset, including its entire federal tax loss carryforwards and a significant portion of its state tax loss carryforwards, with the exception of $5.9 million pertaining to certain multi state loss carryforwards, including states we no longer do business in. This action resulted in the recognition of a $103.0 million of income tax benefit, net of current quarter tax provision, during the second quarter of 2015. As a result of the reversal, diluted earnings per share increased $10.89 to $11.37 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. \nNet Income Net income was $107.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to $6.1 million and $2.6 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively. Diluted earnings per share was $11.37 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to $0.65 for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 and $0.29 per diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.

The Bank incurred one-time costs of $2.3 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2015, composed primarily of employment severance and asset disposition costs related to operational efficiency initiatives. An additional $1.4 million is expected to be recorded in the quarter ending September 30, 2015. These operational efficiency initiatives announced on April 9, 2015 included: Offering a Voluntary Separation Plan to eligible employees providing a variety of benefits, including additional compensation, subsidized COBRA health benefits and optional job placement services; Entering into a definitive agreement for the sale of the Bank's Winneconne, Wisconsin branch to another financial institution located in Wisconsin. The sale will be completed in September 2015, at which time the acquirer will assume approximately $13.4 million in deposits along with loans and other assets; Consolidating six retail bank branches located in the Wisconsin communities of Appleton, Menasha, Oshkosh, Janesville, Franklin and Madison; and Creating a new universal banker staffing model in the Bank's branch delivery system to address a consumer shift towards digital products and services which resulted in lower transaction volumes. The position will perform most branch transactions for customers resulting in improved customer service. \nLoans Held for Investment, Net The Bank originated $104.0 million and $111.5 million of commercial, consumer and residential loans in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and March 31, 2015, respectively.
