Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey\nLabor leader Bill Shorten will announce on Friday that if elected he will announce a low-cost emissions trading scheme dealing in international permits to accompany a massive boost in renewable energy.\nMr Shorten will also announce a doubling of the refugee intake in a proposal, aimed at placating the party's restive Left faction, as well as voters who may defect to the Greens.\nThe Labor leader will use his opening address to the three-day conference on Friday to steel the party for another election fight over climate change by daring Tony Abbott to \"bring it on\".\nHe will formally announce Labor will adopt a 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030 as well as the low-cost ETS to allow Australian business to offset emissions.\n\"Boosting renewable energy will be at the heart of our plan to cut pollution,\" Mr Shorten will say before also confirming there will be an ETS.\n\"Around 1 billion people and more than 40 per cent of the world's economy have already embraced the opportunities of emissions trading schemes. We must give Australian businesses the opportunity to engage with this global market.\"\n\"A Shorten Labor government will build an Emissions Trading Scheme for Australia and we will not be intimidated by ridiculous scare campaigns.\"\n Labor will also double the number of refugees in the annual humanitarian intake to 27,000 as a trade-off to adopting the Coalition's hardline policy of turning back asylum seeker boats.\nSources said that under this policy change, a Labor government would increase the intake from 13,750 people to 27,000.\nMr Shorten announced Wednesday that if he were prime minister, he would want the option of turning back boats, which was a key part of the success of the Coalition's policy.\nThe Left faction had been seeking to amend the party's platform to rule out turn-backs. Mr Shorten wants the policy left blank on turn-backs, which would allow a Labor prime minister the discretion to use the policy if needed.\n\"I think it's important to be honest with my party and the nation and, if I was to form a government, I would want the option of boat turn-backs, where safe to do so, on the table,\" he said.\nWith no faction in control of the conference floor for the first time in three decades, the vote is expected to be tight with most of the left wing to vote against the leader.\nMr Shorten's leadership would be fatally wounded if he lost but multiple sources said Mr Shorten would prevail. Factional bosses and senior members of Mr Shortens shadow ministry, including those from the Left such as Deputy Leader Tanya Plibersek and Senator Kim Carr, were among those negotiating behind the scenes on Thursday, sources said.\nShadow defence minister Stephen Conroy, a leader of the Victorian right wing, said the numbers were \"very close\" but he believed Mr Shorten's position would prevail.\n\"There is a very difficult debate for the Labor Party. We have tortured ourselves debating this for many, many years but what we saw during our last government was through a combination of factors nearly 1200 people died at sea. Now that's not acceptable for any person in the Labor Party.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-23T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:59:31.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
