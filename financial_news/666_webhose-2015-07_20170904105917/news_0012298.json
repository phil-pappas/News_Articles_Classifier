Pat Scala Share on twitter by Ben Potter When Amit Jaiswal bailed up Malcolm Turnbull at a breakfast at the Fishburners start-up facility in inner Sydney earlier this year by asking about incentives for start-ups, the cat got the Communications Minister's tongue.\nJaiswal asked Turnbull what was to stop him moving his scheduling software company Foogi to a more welcoming country for start-ups, such as Singapore.\nThe minister started in on how Labor had wiped out employee share schemes, which cash-poor firms use to attract talent. Jaiswal asked what the government could offer.\n\"He said we can never compete with the Singaporean government when it comes to personal tax rates,\" Jaiswal says. When he persisted, the minister invited him to \"come and talk to us, and we'll think about it\".\nAustralia offers thin gruel to start-up founders. Tax incentives are poor and venture capital is scarce. Our appetite for risk is exhausted by resource exploration and gambling. Subsidies go mostly to established industries such as manufacturing.\nInstead of going to see Turnbull, Jaiswal intensified his due diligence on other countries' incentives for tech start-ups. He had been told by mentors at Startmate, a tech accelerator founded by successful entrepreneurs, that he should incorporate in the United States to raise money in Silicon Valley, and by investors who ploughed $250,000 into Foogi that he should base himself there.\nBut it wasn't necessary to base his development team in Silicon Valley. On the contrary, the presence of giants like Google and Apple – bidding up the wages of software engineers and raiding start-ups' best staff – make it disadvantageous. And other countries are aggressively pitching their wares to tech start-ups.\nThe Singapore government underwrites 85 per cent of investments in tech accelerators (facilities that offer mentors, connections and seed investment to the most promising start-ups they can find).\n Britain refunds 50 per cent of investments in start-ups as tax credits and 100 per cent if the start-up fails. Canada pays 85 per cent of payroll for a few years. New York City, a notoriously high-tax city, offers three to eight-year tax holidays. France has just unveiled tech visas and grants between $US14,000 ($18,000) to $US28,000 grants per team member.\nThey want \"to create an economy. They just want the next Silicon Valley to be in their country,\" Jaiswal says.\nPuny incentives Australian governments offer relatively puny incentives. Foogi is looking for Series A funding of $6 million to $7 million to scale up its product, which co-ordinates calendars and uses artificial intelligence to arrange meetings.\n\"I'd love to stay here but we have a lot of national disadvantages,\" Jaiswal says. \"If I was to go there I don't think I'd keep the tech team here.\"\nThis is challenging for Australia. We wisely forebore to subsidise silicon chip plants in the 1990s, and we are trying vainly to wean ourselves off subsidised industry.\nYet we need new sources of growth after the mining boom. The Abbott government's \"growth centres\" include medical technology and advanced manufacturing – two fertile fields for start-ups. But the Productivity Commission – a key government adviser – panned the policy last week .\nThe things start-ups want – more venture capital, tax incentives, research grants – lie across several ministries. A government source admits Australia is a long way behind other jurisdictions.\nTurnbull is not the only minister stumped by start-ups.\nMartin Scicluna, a fellow graduate with Jaiswal of University of Technology Sydney's software engineering school, had a similar exchange with Small Business Minister Bruce Billson at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Turnbull's electorate a few months ago.\nScicluna and co-founder Istvan Horvath put their own money into SmarterSoft, a data management and workflow software company with state and federal government customers.\nSmarterSoft is profitable, with sales in the low hundreds of thousands of dollars. But they need capital to grow, which is difficult to raise in Australia even for a proven product. Venture capital firms hunt \"flavour of the month\" apps, not unglamorous productivity tools.\n\"What really me bugged me was they were willing to give you money basically for just ideas. Our problem was we have got a product with a proven track record,\" Scicluna says.\nHe put the dilemma to Billson. \"I was given the impression that Singapore had their act together and my business was probably better off taken there rather than in Australia.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/OBenPotter"], "published": "2015-07-01T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:06:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
