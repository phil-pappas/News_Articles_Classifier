(AP) -- More than 20 cars on an oil train derailed in rural northeastern Montana and at least two of them were leaking crude, authorities said. Some area homes were evacuated. \nThere were no immediate reports of injury or fire, but of the 21 cars that derailed only two remained upright, Roosevelt County Sheriff Jason Frederick said. \nBurlington Northern Santa Fe spokesman Michael Trevino said the train was pulling 106 loaded crude oil cars when it derailed near Culbertson near the North Dakota border just after 6 p.m. MDT Thursday. \nPolice, fire and other emergency responders were at the site of the derailment, which forced the closure of U.S. Highway 2, the region's main artery. \nFrederick told The Associated Press that crews were not getting too close to the leaking cars until a BNSF hazardous materials team arrives from Texas. \nBut he said that there was no immediate threat to public safety. \nThe sheriff didn't know how many homes were evacuated but described area as a rural setting with ranch homes spread apart. \nThe Billing Gazette reported that the derailment came only about six hours after rail traffic started moving again after another BNSF derailment further west near Fort Kipp on Tuesday. \nRail officials declined to specify if the train was hauling crude from North Dakota's Bakken oil patch, where growing numbers of shipments have raised safety concerns. \nTrains hauling crude from the Bakken region have been involved in multiple derailments in recent years, some causing fires. \nU.S. transportation officials recently extended an order for railroads to notify states about shipments of hazardous crude oil shipments. \n___ \nAP writers Thomas Peipert in Denver, Matt Volz in Helena, Mont., and Bob Seavey in Phoenix contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T12:53:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
