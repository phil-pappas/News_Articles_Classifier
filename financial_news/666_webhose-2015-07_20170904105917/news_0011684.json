And ironing it out could cost the Exchequer nothing. \nIt’s the unfairly beneficial taxation of “final salary” type pensions, enjoyed among others by civil servants and MPs themselves, compared with the more common “money purchase” pensions. \n• The Chancellor must stun us with a radical tax-cutting Budget \n• What to expect at the 'Emergency Budget' \nUnder current arrangements someone with a final salary-type pension could start their retirement on an income of £50,000. They could do so and escape paying any tax under the pension “lifetime allowance”. \nThe most that a money purchase saver could hope to start their retirement on, before being hit with the 55pc tax resulting from the lifetime allowance, is around £28,600 on a like-for-like basis. \nThat difference is huge and iniquitous. \nIt arises from the way the value of a pension is calculated for the purposes of applying the lifetime cap. \nIf you are in a final salary-type scheme your promised annual pension at the start of retirement is simply multiplied by 20. Any lump sum you choose to take is added on top. From April 2016, the lifetime allowance is £1m. Above that, tax is applied of up to 55pc. \nIf you are a money purchase saver the process is entirely different. You are building up the pot as you work. The pot is what is measured for the purposes of taxation. \nBut what benefits can you get from a pot worth £1m? \nIf you were to buy an annuity the most directly comparable outcome to the benefits promised by a final salary pension your £1m would buy an annuity where the starting income was just £28,600. That annuity, like the final salary arrangement, would also offer inflation-linking and a spouse’s benefit on the pensioner’s death. \n• 'My pension is over the lifetime allowance. Do I pay a tax charge as well as income tax?' \n• The tables that reveal your tax bill on pension withdrawals \nTo get anything like the £50,000 starting pension enjoyed by the final salary saver, you’d need a £1.6m pot and be exposed to a tax bill running into several hundred thousands pounds. \nThe lifetime allowance is itself, as I’ve argued here before, an ill-judged tax that hurts younger savers and those who invest successfully. \nBut this unequal way in which it is applied is another order of unfairness altogether. \nIt wouldn’t take someone in the Treasury long to devise a better way of valuing final salary-type pensions for the purpose of this cap, taking into account comparable annuity rates and other factors. And yes, if applied today it would mean those savers with final salary schemes would pay more tax or get smaller benefits before tax was due. \nThere’s a misjudged tax, and there’s a misjudged tax unfairly applied. At least let’s deal with the latter. \n- richard.dyson@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T22:46:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
