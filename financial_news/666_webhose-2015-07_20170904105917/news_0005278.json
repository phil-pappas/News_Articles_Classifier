Customers typically get an undisclosed discount off the list prices.\nFedEx said the aircraft will be delivered over the fiscal years 2018-2023. The latest deal brings FedEx's firm orders for 767Fs to 106.\nThe contract is also the single-largest order for 767s in the history of the programme, allowing Boeing to extend the aircraft's production line well into the next decade.\n(Reporting by Siva Govindasamy; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T05:04:34.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
