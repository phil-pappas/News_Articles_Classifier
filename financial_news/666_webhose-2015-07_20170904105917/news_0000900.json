They want to pay it forward because someone took the time to help them at some stage and they knew I would pay it forward too.\" @YahooNZBusiness on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook David Jones performing well for new owners AAP \nDepartment store David Jones is performing well for its new foreign owners, opening a strong sales lead over arch â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T23:49:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
