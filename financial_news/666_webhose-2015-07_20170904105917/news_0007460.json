The changeover date was nearly four months ago. The process carried out by the other provider was exemplary but I am still waiting on a final closing statement. ScottishPower has still been debiting my account by £42 a month. I have been in touch with the call centre several times without success. TB, Kent You say that when you rang after your account had been closed, you were told that, if you cancelled the direct debit, ScottishPower would be unable to return what it said was the £244 credit owed to you. Later, when you rang, with still no progress made, another representative told you to cancel the direct debit immediately. You were told that your bank would recredit the latest £42 payment taken. The bank advised that it was too late to do that. Contacting the call centre was difficult with you being kept on hold 30 minutes between 4-5pm and a further 30 minutes from 6.30-7pm on one day. The following morning you did get through. Then a different refund figure of £163 was mentioned. Apparently, the higher one had been wrong. Naturally this did not imbue you with confidence. • 'Scottish Power says we've moved supplier but we haven't' • 'Scottish Power keeps insisting that I'm dead' ScottishPower admits that the account had not been closed correctly because of a technical issue. However, the facility that used to enable you to view the account was now blocked so you had not been able to see your old bills. Now you have a full, albeit you feel rather complicated, statement, and the money now owed and coming in two tranches of £163 and £116 respectively, plus £75 for goodwill. • If you want to contact Jessica, click here Follow @telegraph Telegraph Home Insurance Get a Quote: » Up to 25% discount for over 50's", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T02:41:18.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
