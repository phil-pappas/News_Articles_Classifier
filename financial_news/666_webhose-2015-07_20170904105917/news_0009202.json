Coca Cola, which stood second in the list of the top 10 most preferred employers of 2014, slipped to the sixth position this year. \nMoreover, Pepsi, which came sixth last year, has now fallen down to the eighth position. \n“Salary is no more the first priority while deciding the employer,” said Amit Garg, executive director, digital initiatives, HT Media, which owns Shine.com. \n“Students are increasingly looking for factors such as brand image, status of industry and opportunities of international assignments,” he added. \n“In 2014, Coca Cola was preferred by over 18 % students surveyed which came down to around 9 % this year. About 15 % students preferred Pepsi last year which plummeted to 9 % this year,” according to the survey, which covered 1,800 students. \nFast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant Dabur, the most preferred employer last year, has come down to the fifth position, losing its popularity by over 10%. \nAmong the information technology majors, Infosys and TCS topped the most preferred employer chart.Services sector has emerged as the most popular at campuses,” said Deepali Singh, executive vice-president, Firstnaukri.com. \nTelecom giant Bharti Airtel, insurance firm SBI Life and UK based carrier British Airways are the top three employers that are the most preferred by students pursuing marketing and various other post-graduation programmes, the survey said. \nInfosys and TCS were ranked as the most preferred employers by more than 26% and 19% participants, respectively, followed by Cognizant, IBM and Accenture. \nMost of the respondents said job profile, growth prospects and brand image of the company were the top three factors for choosing a particular company.
