Trading in the security was suspended by regulators in Frankfurt after it fell as much as 20 percent Monday. It never started in Milan and Paris.\nWith the Greek market shut until July 6, ETFs tracking the nation’s shares become vehicles for pure speculation, the only way to bet on what stocks will do when Athens reopens. In the U.S., more than 6 million shares of the Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF changed hands on Monday, six times the average for 2015, and 3.2 million shares traded on Tuesday.\n“Investors woke up on Monday in Europe to this -- it’s not really fair,” said Ralf Zimmermann, an equity strategist at Bankhaus Lampe KG in Dusseldorf. “It’s clear that they would want to sell the Greek ETF by just looking at what happened to the U.S. version.”\nThe U.S.-listed ETF plunged 19 percent on Monday after Greece shut its banks and imposed capital controls to shore up its financial system. It climbed 6 percent on Tuesday.\nRegulator Request Deutsche Boerse AG said the trading in the Lyxor security was halted at the request of German financial regulator Bafin, according to Frank Herkenhoff, the exchange’s spokesman. Borsa Italiana suspended the ETF because the Greek market was closed, the exchange’s Oriana Pagano said.\nWhile the Greek fund in the U.S. has had no such halt, anyone trading it is doing so with incomplete information for at least a week as regulators closed the Athens Stock Exchange. There’s nothing wrong with that, according to Michael Rawson, an ETF analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.\n“ETFs can be thought of as a price-discovery mechanism,” Rawson said. “If you can trade the ETF, but you can’t trade the underlying securities while that ETF continues to trade, you can get a gauge of where prices will open when trading resumes.”\nAs for Europe, “If trading on an ETF gets halted, you’re not any worse off than if you’d bought the underlying securities,” he said.\nFastest Growing ETFs, the fastest-growing segment of the money-management business, are bundles of securities that change hands on an exchange like stocks. In normal times, they move in tandem with indexes that reflect prices for public companies and rarely veer from those levels by more than a few percentage points.\nNo such prices will be available in Greece for as long as its markets are closed.\nFor the companies that manage ETFs, an extended closure complicates the process through which they balance supply and demand for the funds while keeping its price aligned with other assets.\nNormally, when demand grows for an ETF, its overseers issue new shares to institutions in exchange for bundles of the stocks or other assets that underlie it. In the Lyxor fund, that process has been suspended because of the Athens closure, according to spokesman Laurent Tison.\nThe Lyxor ETF’s prospectus says that its liquidity on exchanges may be limited when the benchmark index is suspended . The firm will post regular status updates on its website, Tison said, declining to comment further.\nMarket Cap The fund has a market value of 216 million euros ($241 million), according to the Lyxor’s website. The U.S. ETF’s market cap reached a record $367 million last week.\nEuropean investors can still place orders on the Greek fund over the counter. Christopher Meyers, an ETF trader at Flow Traders BV in Amsterdam, said his firm received some requests, though he declined to say whether they were to buy or sell.\nHellenic Telecommunications Organization SA was also suspended in Germany, while Coca-Cola HBC AG, listed in London, added 0.2 percent on Wednesday. American depositary receipts of National Bank of Greece SA advanced 7.9 percent in New York on Tuesday after Monday’s 24 percent plunge.\nEquities were not the only asset class affected. Tradeweb Markets LLC, a major market for sovereign debt, halted trading in Greek government bonds at the request of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, according to the company.", "external_links": ["http://www.lyxoretf.fr/france/en/retail/etffinder/lyxor-ftse-athex-large-cap-ucits-etf-distrib/eur\\"], "published": "2015-07-01T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T17:42:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
