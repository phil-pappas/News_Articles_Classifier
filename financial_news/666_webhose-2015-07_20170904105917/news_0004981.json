Nic Walker by Marianna Papadakis and John Stensholt Just when it looked like it could not get much worse for Nathan Tinkler, the former mining entrepreneur was hit with a mooted arrest warrant and bankruptcy application.\nOver the past three years, Mr Tinkler has lost a billion-dollar fortune, a $300 million horse racing empire, rugby league and football clubs, and a slew of other assets. He owes retail magnate Gerry Harvey tens of millions, had a stoush with a cameraman in Brisbane this week and his efforts to get back into the mining game have hit problems .\nNow, GE Commercial Australasia has asked the Federal Court to bankrupt Mr Tinkler over a $2.803 million debt.\nGE Commercial is among creditors encircling the resources entrepreneur , having lodged an application for a sequestration order in relation to Mr Tinkler's debt under an \"aircraft loan facility agreement\" agreed to in 2010.\nThe case is part of a long dispute over a Dassault Falcon 900C executive jet estimated to be worth up to $15 million and an Augusta A109S helicopter formerly owned by Mr Tinkler's Tinkler Group Aviation.\nAccording to court documents Mr Tinkler was served a bankruptcy notice on June 25 and failed to pay or otherwise comply with the notice's requirements.\nThe documents say GE has no security over Mr Tinkler's assets. GE declined to comment, citing the legal proceedings. Mr Tinkler did not comment.\nMr Tinkler was ordered to pay the $2.252 million debt by the NSW Supreme Court on May 19. The additional amount now sought is interest on the debt.\n Both aircraft were seized by receivers on behalf of GE in 2012 and put up for sale after the company collapsed. The case is due in the Federal Court on September 2.\nWind-up of Patinack Farm Mr Tinkler is fighting several battles with creditors over his unravelling business empire. The South Australian Supreme Court made orders for Mr Tinkler's arrest after he failed to appear at proceedings over the liquidation of his Patinack Farm thoroughbred racing and breeding empire.\nLiquidator Tony Matthews said the best outcome would be obtaining about $1.5 million from Tinkler, who this week said there was yet to be a warrant out for his arrest and that he would be staying put at his Brisbane home to negotiate a deal with the liquidator.\n\"At the end of the day I've lost my own money,\" he told assembled media outside his home. \"I haven't ripped anyone off, I haven't stolen anything, there never was any warrant and I certainly haven't been concerned at all about this.\"\nThe list of Mr Tinkler's creditors keeps getting longer, with revelations earlier in the week that he owes $41 million to his New York banker, Jefferies Group.\nJefferies Group lodged wind-up applications for Patinack Farm and its associated companies in March, while a fresh group of unsecured creditors are also owed $2.7 million from Mr Tinkler's Ocean Street Holdings, which was placed in liquidation last month.\nMr Tinkler was stripped of his licence to own the Newcastle Jets A-League club after he placed it into administration in June. The club was then placed in liquidation in June with unsecured trade creditors owed more than $1 million.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:13:47.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
