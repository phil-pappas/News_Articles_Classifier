Many sites quickly adjusted their businesses to emphasize high interest lending for stock market speculation, rather than the traditional P2P loans for small Chinese companies.\nMargin Finance As the share market started to slide last month, new loans began to dry up. Online lending for share purchases fell 15 percent in the week beginning June 22, and another 10 percent the following week, according to Yingcan data.\nA similar unwinding has been seen in the funding offered by China’s stockbroking firms. The margin finance balance on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges dropped 37 percent to 1.44 trillion yuan Friday from its record in June.\nThe online sites, which match borrowers with lenders, tend to charge much higher interest rates than those prevailing on the broker accounts and offer more leverage.\nAfter the CSRC announcement, a number of online sites have issued statements confirming they will withdraw from the stock lending business.\nMiniu98 , one of the largest, said on Monday it will stop lending money for share purchases, as did Xunqianwang , a Wenzhou-based company that started online stock financing in August.\nBorrowers Default Others were already in difficulties after some borrowers saw their investments wiped out in the market crash. Zhongxin Quick Loans, an eastern Jiangsu province-based company which lends to both individuals and corporates, issued a statement earlier this month saying it is liquidating its assets because its borrowers cannot repay their loans and investors are demanding their money back. Bangcheng Financial, another online lender based in Fujian province, said it is restricting payments to investors offering loans on its site after too many tried to cash out.\nOfficials at Zhongxin Quick Loans and Bangcheng couldn’t be reached for comment.\nYingcan’s Xu said many online lenders will survive by going back to traditional business of lending to Chinese companies. “It’s fortunate that they are just one of more than 10 lending businesses that P2P firms are offering, so I don’t think the crackdown on stock-related financing will crash the industry,” Xu said.\nCompany Lending Among the larger P2P sites, the proportion of loans for stock purchases at Guangzhou-based PPmoney.com had already dropped to 20 percent of the total from 30 percent previously, as a result of investor caution following the stock market decline, according to the company’s co-founder Terry Hu. The company has extended total loans of around 15 billion yuan.\nPPmoney said on Tuesday it will comply with the CSRC’s regulations and has stopped adding new clients or loans for stock purchases. The platform will explore the idea of applying for a license to invest in stocks, said PPmoney spokeswoman Chen Yi.\n“For those P2Ps that are lucky enough to survive the latest turbulence, they need to think where they want to go from here,” Yingcan’s Xu said. “Maybe the solution is going back to what they are supposed to do: matching borrowers with lenders.”", "external_links": ["http://www.wangdaizhijia.com/\\", "https://www.miniu98.com/news/1063.htm\\", "http://www.bc0592.net/indexs/notice/747.html\\", "https://www.xunqianwang.com/article/id_221.html\\", "http://www.zhongxinsudai.com/gonggao/a569.html\\"], "published": "2015-07-15T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T02:08:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
