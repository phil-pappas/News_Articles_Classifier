But strip that out, along with other one-off costs, and underlying profits still increased by 14pc. \nSecure Trust, a listed subsidiary of Arbuthnot Banking Group, typically offers customers unsecured personal loans, but it has also started to expand into small business lending . \nA branch of Handelsbanken in Malmö, Sweden \nMeanwhile, Handelsbanken, the Swedish challenger bank with a growing British presence , also reported a jump in earnings, with operating profits up 47pc in the first-half, boosted by higher business and mortgage lending and a big rise in deposits. \nOperating profits at the lender's UK arm - which has almost 200 branches - rose 47pc to £180.5m, while loan losses on the portfolio remained at just 0.02pc. \nChallengers like Secure Trust and Swedish lender Handelsbanken are seeking to take market share from the high-street banks, exploiting both the unpopularity of the big banks in the wake of the financial crisis and changes in the rules that make it easier for both new banks to establish themselves and for customers to move between banks . \nHowever, things might be getting more difficult for them following changes to corporation tax announced in the Summer Budget. \nPaul Lynam, who heads up Secure Trust, has previously complained that small banks will be hit hard by the 8pc additional corporation tax announced in the emergency Budget in July. \nHe told the Telegraph that he and the rest of the sector feels \"intense frustration\" at the new tax .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T15:26:45.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
