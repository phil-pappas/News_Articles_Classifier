Mike Simms Simms outlines Cone's three biggest revenue threats and discusses the system's strategies to combat them: 1.High-Deductible Health Plans a Hurdle Like most healthcare providers, Cone is experiencing a steep increase in the number of patients who have insurance plans with significant personal liability. \"We are seeing higher out-of-pockets with plans through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and employer sponsored plans. We are seeing $5,000 deductibles and financial obligations that are $6,000 or $7,000 in total,\" Simms says. \nFREE Insights Report: Revenue Cycle Integrity \nThis creates a collections hurdle because patients are often unable to pay in full for services they receive. To mitigate the impact on revenue, Cone has recently begun working with a third-party vendor to offer a loan program for patients who need time to pay in installments. \"We needed a way to allow patients to finance the debt because we didn't want to have a lot of long monthly payment plans. So, about a year ago, we started using a firm that does recourse financing, and we've changed our whole payment plan methodology,\" Simms says. \"If a patient has a balance and can pay it within six months, we will keep that account internally. If they can't, they have to go to the vendor that does the financing. If their [credit] scores are good, we'll get paid in advance so we don't have to wait two or three years. We get funded immediately. We have to pay a small discount rate for this program, but it's better than waiting years to be paid.\" 2. Patient Education and Engagement Needed Another area of concern, Simms says, is the lack of understanding many patients have with regard to their insurance coverage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T23:10:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
