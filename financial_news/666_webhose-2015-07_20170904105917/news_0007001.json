The stock was frozen as 12 Australian cents. Two months earlier Atlas had posted a A$1.1 billion ($806 million) half-year loss. \nMining was suspended when iron ore fell to $47 a tonne, as Atlas was losing $15 on each tonne mined. The miner has since established a $50 break-even price, helped by a profit-sharing arrangement with contractors. \nThe last of its mines reopened this month, with a hedging strategy on some future production until the end of the year guaranteeing Atlas floor prices of $50-$60 a tonne. \nIron ore stood at $50 a tonne on Monday. \nThe profit-sharing deal required contractors to put A$40 million towards the share offering. The new shares were priced at 5 Australian cents each, with a free option at 7.5 Australian cents. \n\"This raising will strengthen our balance sheet considerably, giving us a measure of further protection against iron ore price volatility,\" Flanagan said. \n($1 = 1.3526 Australian dollars) (Editing by Tom Hogue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T02:11:31.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
