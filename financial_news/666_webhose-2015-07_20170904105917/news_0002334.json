Against the yen, the shared currency EURJPY, +2.19% climbed 1.9%, to ¥137.20.\nThe euro was bolstered by signs the reform plan submitted by Greece late Thursday may be met with approval by its creditors and other European leaders. Greece’s creditors could deliver an assessment on the country’s eligibility for a new bailout as early as Friday.\n“Perhaps the silver lining to the still-unresolved Greek saga is that European policy makers may finally begin to tackle the structural weakness of the current set-up and may begin to create pan-European solutions to keep the monetary union intact,” wrote Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, in a note.\n“For now, the market liked what they see ... but the currency remains vulnerable to any last-minute glitches and, more importantly, to long-term skepticism from investors,” he said.\nWhile the prospect of a Greek deal “seems to be gaining momentum,” a rise by the euro “above the $1.1240 area is needed to signal a test of the June high near $1.1435,” said currency strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman in an note.\nThe ICE U.S. dollar index DXY, -0.68% a measure of the dollar’s strength against a basket of six currencies, fell 0.8% to 95.870.\nInvestors later Friday will look for comments from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen about the outlook for the U.S. economy. She’s set to speak at The City Club of Cleveland at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T15:08:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
