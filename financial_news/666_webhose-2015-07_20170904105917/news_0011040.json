Supplied by Jill Dupleix In 2006 two young Michigan brothers adrift in Brooklyn, Bob and Joe McClure, used their great grandmother Lala’s precious hand-me-down recipe to produce a batch of particularly crunchy, tangy, garlicky, cucumber dill pickles.\n“We knew we had a great recipe, we just didn’t have much else,” explains Joe. With no staff, the pair put their parents to work on the pickling, and with no room in their apartment, they stored the jars at cult neighbourhood bar, the Bushwick Country Club, paying the rent in pickles.\nOne night, bartender Reggie Cunningham took an order from a customer for Old Crow whiskey with a chaser of “that pickle brine over there”. The pickleback – a shot of whisky with a shot of pickle juice – was born. “I probably had [orders for] eight or 10 picklebacks myself that night,” recalls Cunningham. “The rest is history.”\nJoe says the sharp, garlicky brine is as much fun as the pickles themselves, recommending it for use in salad vinaigrettes, martinis, bloody marys, and, of course, for chasin’ whiskey.\nBut it’s the pickles he’s most proud of. “It’s great to be a part of the whole regeneration of something that had just become a supermarket commodity,” he says. “Our parents even get paid to work for us now.”\nMcClure’s Pickles are available from gourmet grocery stores nationally, $17.95 for 900g. www.mclurespickles.com\nDegustation reading When your restaurant serves only an exquisitely crafted multi-course degustation menu, how do you convey the rhythm and flow of the dining experience in a cookbook?\n If you are Corey Leeof San Francisco’s celebrated Benu restaurant – which this year won its third Michelin star in four years – you simply create an exquisitely crafted, multi-course degustation cookbook.\nLee’s elegant and minimalist debut manual contains a tasting menu of 32 recipes, including his 1000-year-old quail egg with ginger, and a remarkable 20-fold xiaolongbau dumpling stuffed with foie gras and truffles.\nThe question is – will it get you cooking, or booking?\nBenu (Phaidon, $75) by Corey Lee www.benusf.com\nSuper fruit Charred kangaroo tartare, grass, wild garlic and gubinge.
