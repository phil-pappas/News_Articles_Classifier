In addition, glitazones have been associated with serious side effects.\nHowever, the authors are hopeful that these findings may pave the way towards other treatments that target the same pathway.\nThe study is published in PLOS Medicine.\n 22, 2015 4:35 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T00:14:51.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
