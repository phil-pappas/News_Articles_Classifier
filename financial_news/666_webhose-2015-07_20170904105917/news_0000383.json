EMV Chip technology implementation deadline is October 1, 2015 and a recent study conducted by the Aite Group found that one-third of small- and medium-sized businesses are unaware of the technology or the deadline. The Orange County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce’s mission is to support the development of the 30,000 Hispanic owned businesses in Orange County by providing opportunities for networking, legislative advocacy, access to capital, education and training programs. There is no better way to act on that mission statement then to educate members on new technology requirements that can save their businesses from being 100% liable for credit card fraud.\nBatched which is a minority owned business, brings transparency to the credit card processing industry by shopping rates and services with multiple providers on behalf of small business owners to ensure the small business owner is matched with the correct processor for their specific business type. Batched provided the educational content and technology training to the Hispanic business owners at the event to ensure the small business owners understand the risks if they do not upgrade their credit card processing equipment.\n“We understand that small business owners are extremely busy running their companies and overcoming obstacles on a daily basis. So when we were called on to educate fellow business owners on the major technology shift about to be implemented that will greatly impact their businesses and the security of their customer data we knew we had an obligation to inform” stated Oscar Garcia CEO of Batched. “The Batched.com platform is currently helping hundreds of small businesses around the country every week educating them through our merchant service coaches and even providing free EMV ready terminals to make sure businesses will not be liable for fraudulent charges and avoid the liability shift” added Garcia.\nTo aid in the implementation of EMV technology Batched.com is providing free EMV upgraded POS machines for merchants while supplies last.
