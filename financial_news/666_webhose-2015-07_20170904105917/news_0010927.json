My name is Loraine and I will be your operator for today's call. \n(Operator Instructions) \nPlease note that this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Patricia Gil. Ms. Gil, you may begin. \n\nPatricia Gil, Oil States International Inc. - IR [2] \n\nThanks, Loraine, and welcome to Oil States' second-quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Our call today will be led by Cindy Taylor, Oil States' President and Chief Executive Officer; Lloyd Hajdik, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And we are also joined by Chris Cragg, Senior Vice President, Operations; and Scott Moses, Senior Vice President, Offshore Products. \nBefore we began, we would like to caution listeners regarding forward-looking statements, to the extent that our remarks today contain information other than historical information. Please note of that we are relying on the safe harbor protections afforded by federal law. Any such remarks should be weighed in the context of the many factors that affect our business, including those risks disclosed in our form 10-K and other SEC filings. I will now turn the call over to Cindy. \n\nCindy Taylor, Oil States International Inc. - President & CEO [3] \n\nThank you, Patricia. Good morning to all of you and thanks for joining our earnings conference call today. Our second-quarter 2015 earnings remained in positive territory, but continued to be negatively impacted by the low crude oil price environment, particularly in North American well site services segment. WTI averaged $57.85 per barrel in the second quarter and has taken another leg down by $10.46 a barrel or 18%, ending at $47.39 as of July 20, 2015. \nAt the time of our first-quarter earnings conference call, held at the end of April, we believe that our well site services business would find a bottom and exit the second quarter stronger than where we entered it. However, the onshore market continued to deteriorate throughout May and into June, leading to a larger sequential decline then was originally expected. \nThe average US rig count decreased 35%, quarter over quarter. The backlog of wells drilled but not completed grew, while pricing pressures persisted. For the second quarter of 2015, consolidated revenues and adjusted EBITDA declined 20% and 37% quarter over quarter, respectively, representing decremental EBITDA margins of 38%, with well site services leading the way down. \nOur 2015 results are coming off a record year in 2014, resulting in ugly year-over-year comparisons. Our second-quarter offshore products revenues were a brighter spot during the quarter, coming in within our guided ranges, with an EBITDA margin exceeding the high end of our guidance. \nBidding and quoting for our offshore products and services continued during the quarter, albeit at a slower pace. With backlog declining 14% sequentially, we reported a book-to-bill ratio of 0.63 times, bringing us to a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 0.81 times. \nAt this time, Lloyd it will take you through more details of our consolidated results and financial position. I will follow with more details by segment and provide you additional comments on our market outlook. \n\nLloyd Hajdik, Oil States International Inc. - SVP & CFO [4] \n\nThanks, Cindy. During the second quarter, we generated revenues of $269 million and reported adjusted net income of $7.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. This excludes pretax charges of $1.7 million, for severance and other downsizing efforts. EBITDA, adjusted for the severance and other charges, total $43 million. \nFocusing on our balance sheet and our debt capital structure, we ended the quarter with total liquidity of $498.4 million, which is comprised of $409 million available under our revolving credit facility, plus cash on hand of $89.4 million. Our liquidity increased $70 million from the end of the first-quarter 2015. And we used our free cash flow to fund CapEx, repurchase stock and to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. \nOur financial position remains very healthy, with our gross and net debt levels at June 30 totaling $157 million and $68 million, respectively. Our net debt to book capitalization ratio approximated 5% at June 30. And our leverage ratio, using trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, was approximately 0.4 times. \nDuring the quarter, we invested $30.5 million in capital expenditures, the majority of which was associated with projects that carried over from 2014. Capital spending during the quarter was about evenly split between our segments and related primarily to the ongoing facility expansions in the offshore product segment, along with the addition of completion services equipment deployed to service the US shale plays. \nFor the full-year 2015, we expect to spend approximately $150 million to $160 million in capital expenditures. Our priorities are to complete our new offshore products facility in the UK and to continue to develop our two locations in Brazil. \nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased 359,000 shares under our authorized share repurchase program at an average price at $39.94 per share. And earlier today, our Board of Directors approved the termination of our existing share repurchase authorization that was scheduled to expire on September 1, and replace it with a new share repurchase authorization for up to $150 million, for the term of one year from today. \nIn terms of our third-quarter 2015 consolidated guidance, we expect depreciation and amortization expense to approximate $32.5 million, net interest expense to approximate $1.6 million, and corporate costs to approximate $11.5 million. Our corporate costs in the second quarter of 2015 benefited from expense reversals associated with our short- and long-term incentive compensation plans. \nOur 2015 consolidated effective tax rate is expected to average 35.8% for the full year, which equates to an effective tax rate of approximately 33.2% for the next two quarters. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Cindy who will take you through our business segments. \n\nCindy Taylor, Oil States International Inc. - President & CEO [5] \n\nOkay, thanks, Lloyd. In our offshore product segment, results were in line with or better than our projections and the guidance ranges that we provided in connection with our first-quarter 2015 earnings conference call. We booked revenues of $183 million, during the second quarter of 2015 compared to $196 million in the first quarter of 2015. \nEBITDA totaled $41 million in the second quarter compared to $43 million in the first quarter of 2015. Our EBITDA margin percentage averaged 22.3% for the second quarter of 2015, coming in slightly better than the 21.8% reported in the first quarter of 2015. \nThe second quarter of 2015 was impacted by a sequential decrease in revenues from drilling and elastomer products and the impact of $1 million of severance cost recorded, partially offset by increased production and subsea product sales. Bidding and quoting activity during the second quarter of 2015 continued, albeit at a slower pace due to delays in award timing and project deferrals. As a result, orders booked during the second quarter only totaled $115 million, which resulted in a sequential backlog decline of 14%, to $409 million at June 30. \nOur second-quarter book-to-bill ratio was 0.63 times, bringing our year-to-date 2015 book-to-bill ratio down to 0.81 times. We did not book any individual orders greater than $10 million in the second quarter. \nWe are pleased to provide an update on our new manufacturing facility that we have been constructing in the UK, which is now nearing completion. We are planning for our grand opening of this facility in the third quarter. \nAs we progress into the third quarter, we believe that revenues in our offshore products segment will increase slightly, to range between $185 million and $195 million. We are forecasting sequentially stronger revenue contributions from connectors, subsea pipeline products and production facility equipment, but we do expect to see further reductions in revenues in certain of our shorter cycle and consumable products, as our customers remain focused on cash flow preservation. \nIt is still our strong belief that projects focused on project infrastructure will ultimately be sanctioned, but the timing is not without the risk of further project deferrals. We are maintaining our EBITDA margin guidance at 19% to 21% for the third quarter. \nIn our well site services segment, our second-quarter results were impacted by the continuation of the decline of the US land drilling rig count, customers not completing previously drilled wells, and pricing pressure exerted by our customers. For the second quarter we reported a 39% sequential decrease in our well site services revenues, which totaled $86 million. This sequential decline in revenues was attributable to a 32% decrease in the number of completion services jobs performed, a 13% decrease in revenue per ticket and lower utilization for our land drilling rigs. \nEBITDA decreased 70% sequentially to $11 million and EBITDA margins averaged 12.9%, for the second quarter, compared to 25.8%, for the preceding quarter. Decremental EBITDA margins came in at 45% in this segment, due to cost-cutting initiatives. Land rig utilization levels continued to decline in the second quarter and averaged 34%, down from 44% in the first quarter. That is consistent with the guidance we gave you. \nWe currently have 11 of our total fleet of 34 land drilling rigs working, equating to approximately 32% utilization. We are assuming that 30% to 35% utilization levels for our land drilling rig fleet during the third quarter. \nIf there is a bright side to this market, the taste of recent rig count declines has abated. However, the lower absolute level of US drilling and completions activity that we are experiencing today will continue to weigh on our well site services results in the third quarter. With what appears to be a flattening and possibly the trough in the US rig count, we estimate that third quarter revenues for our well site services segment will range between $82 million and $88 million, with EBITDA margins averaging 12% to 14%. \nIn conclusion, the North American markets that we serve remain very challenged, with depressed levels of activity expected to continue through the third quarter and likely throughout the remainder of this year. We will remain focused on managing our cost structure, controlling discretionary spending, enforcing capital discipline and seeking to take advantage of investment opportunities where those investments make strategic sense during this cyclical downturn. \nTo that end, we believe that Oil States remains well-positioned both operationally and financially, with nearly $500 million of liquidity to support our businesses. That completes our prepared comments. Loraine, would you open the call up for questions and answers at this time, please?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T16:22:20.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
