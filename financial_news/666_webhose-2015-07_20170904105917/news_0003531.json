However, the monthly reading was 2.3 percent lower than June's index -- thanks, in part, to a decline in job security. The index measured 102.1 for the month. Any reading above 100 indicates improved financial security over the past 12 months. \nWhen asked how they felt about their jobs compared with 12 months ago, 22 percent said they felt \"more secure\" while 14 percent said they felt \"less secure.\" That was a weaker response than in June, when 29 percent said they felt \"more secure\" and 9 percent said \"less secure.\" \nAmericans also showed more pessimism about their level of savings. When asked about the money they'd socked away, 29 percent said they were \"less comfortable\" with their level of savings compared with a year ago. Only 18 percent said they were \"more comfortable.\" \nPrinceton Survey Research Associates International conducts the survey that accompanies the index. This month's survey was taken July 9-12 with 1,000 adults living in the continental U.S. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

Among the youngest in the survey (between 18 and 29 years old), the majority (32%) favored cash. Among those between 30 and 49, the majority (32%) favored real estate.
