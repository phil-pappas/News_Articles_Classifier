This garden forms the roof for the two-level retail building below.\n3XN founding partner and creative director Kim Herforth Nielsen said the commercial office tower at 50 Bridge Street is designed as a 'vertical village' that takes on board the ambience and social character of the street.\n\"It also reflects and maintains the connection to the nearby and world-renowned Botanic Gardens and Macquarie Place Park, with an emphasis on green space within the building,\" he said.\nAMP Capital managing director office and industrial Louise Mason said the landmark Quay Quarter Sydney project was a \"further demonstration of AMP Capital's long-term commitment to Circular Quay\", where it built Australia's first skyscraper and where the company has been located for more than 50 years.\nThe tower at 50 Bridge Street is jointly owned by investors in the AMP Capital Diversified Property Fund and the AMP Capital Wholesale Office Fund.\nConstruction is earmarked to start in 2017 once the necessary approvals are secured and is expected to take about 2&frac12; years to complete the construction.\nRevitalising the Circular Quay area will also involve the conversion of the former Coca-Cola Amatil building, near the Cahill Expressway, and the Gold Fields House office building into apartments and a proposed hotel.\nAt the opposite end of the quay, Lend Lease has also submitted plans for a new 220-metre office tower on Alfred-Pitt-Dalley-George streets, known as the APDG block. It is looking to sell the site, but retain the development, with the super fund, Cbus Property, said to be the front-running buyer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T19:04:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
