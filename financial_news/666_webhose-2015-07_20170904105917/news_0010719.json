The greenback had set a two-week low at 96.288 on Monday but has since pulled up from that trough. \n\"We expect the Fed to refrain from a clear indication on the timing of the Fed's rate hike. We still expect a hike in September,\" said Tohru Sasaki, the head of forex research at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo. \nSasaki also said the dollar/yen is unlikely to move much if the Fed does steer clear of dropping clear hints on its rate hikes, noting that dollar/yen has not shown any big reaction to the Fed' policy statement this year. \nThe euro held steady at $1.1060, trading below Monday's two-week high of $1.11295. \nWorries about the Fed's draining of cheap funding have been weighing on commodities and emerging market assets that had benefited in recent years from the Fed's money-printing. \nMany commodity currencies remained under pressure from worries about slowdown in the Chinese economy as well, though they bounced back from multi-year lows thanks in part to hopes Chinese shares are stabilising after their massive fall on Monday. \nThe Australian dollar eased 0.2 percent to $0.7322. On Tuesday it had set a six-year low of $0.7257. \nThe New Zealand dollar, worst-performing of the major currencies so far this year, edged higher after comments from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand were perceived to contain no new surprises. \nRBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler said the economy needed further rate cuts and a lower exchange rate. He added that local forecasts of further large rate cuts \"could only be consistent with the economy moving into recession\". \nThe kiwi rose to as high as $0.6739, its two-week high, following Wheeler's comments. It last traded at $0.6704 , up 0.2 percent from late U.S. trade on Tuesday. \n\"The RBNZ is still clearly jawboning the currency lower, and thus we might expect a relatively limited further bounce in the NZD,\" Greg Gibbs, head of Asia Pacific markets strategy for RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) in Singapore, said in a research note. \nStill, a further near-term bounce in the New Zealand dollar could not be ruled out, Gibbs said. The New Zealand dollar hit a six-year low of $0.6498 earlier this month, having fallen 16.7 percent from the end of last year.
