If you don't hold them, you're betting that you or your financial advisor is smart enough to outperform them. Simon Bosch by Trevor Sykes Rise and shine! It's the start of a new financial year and time for our annual investment health check. There are just eight questions you need to answer first.\nHow did you perform? Financial year 2014-15 was pretty rough, especially the last seven months. If you broke even, or better, you did well.\nDo you hold enough blue chips? Australia's big nine (the big four banks, Woolies, Wesfarmers, Telstra, BHP and Rio) dominate the ASX/S&P 200 index. If you don't hold them, you're betting that you or your financial advisor is smart enough to outperform them. Good luck.\nHow vulnerable is your portfolio? Compile list one, comprising the biggest stocks in your portfolio by current value. A conservatively managed fund should hold at least four or five of the big nine in its top seven stocks. Yes, you can lose money in the big nine, but they'll all be around next year and their capacity for recovery is strong. And yes, you can make more money if you pick big winners from outside the big nine, but you'd better be a good stock picker. This is a good time to work out how much risk you are taking and whether it is justifiable.\nAre you lucky? List two comprises your speculative stocks. If the definition of 'speculative' is too hard, just list the non-dividend-paying stocks. A well-constructed portfolio can afford to have a few lottery tickets – stocks that are unfashionable at present but have a chance of hitting better times. If their cost amounts to only a few per cent of total portfolio value they can be written off without much pain, while if they hit a winner they can really enhance the overall performance. But they need to be policed and this is a good time to decide whether the reasons for buying them are still valid.\nIs it time to get tough? List three comprises the losers: stocks that are trading below cost. There's no shame in having some losers – a tennis player who never double-faults isn't trying hard enough with his second serve. The acid question is: are they worth buying at the current price? If the answer is yes, hang in there. If it's no, dump them. Don't ever fall in love with mistakes, whether it's your fiancée or a stock you bought last year. Unrequited love is painful and on the ASX it can also be bloody expensive.\nHow is the fixed interest portfolio? When interest rates are peaking or falling, it's best to hold long-dated bonds. When rates are bottoming or rising, it's best to hold short-dated. If it's uncertain whether they're going up or down, stay short because if you're wrong the mistake can soon be corrected. These remarks don't apply to variable rate hybrids, because they will rise and fall with the tide.\nIs the pension covered? If you're drawing a pension from your super fund, it's desirable to ensure your capital will last as long as possible. If there's a $1 million in the fund and the minimum required withdrawal is 4 per cent, then $40,000 a year has to be withdrawn. In practice it's best to withdraw a few thousand more, because if the ATO should disagree on the valuation, they could hit you with a tax bill.\n A smart investor who picks the right stocks can cover the withdrawals by making capital gains each year. Anyone who isn't that smart can achieve a similar result by buying stocks which pay fully franked dividends. In our hypothetical example, the withdrawals would be covered if $700,000 of the portfolio were invested in stocks paying grossed up yields of 6 per cent. One more reason why professional investors love fully franked dividends.\nWho? Finally, look at your winners and remember who advised you to buy them. If it was yourself, take a bow. If it was someone else, buy him, her or them a lunch. The best investment you can make is to stay friends with people who are smarter than yourself.\nNow get up, get out there and start making more money.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:04:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
