It is up 4 percent this week after it reported strong quarterly earnings on Tuesday. \nSweden's SKF, the world's largest bearings maker, was the top faller, sliding 7.6 percent on its disappointing results and outlook. \nBritish luxury goods maker Burberry was down 1.7 percent, off its lows, after reporting a slowdown in underlying first-quarter retail revenue growth, held back by a further deterioration of the high margin Hong Kong market. \n\"The underlying performance reads well, but the worry over a sharp fall in activity in Hong Kong and lacklustre growth on the Chinese mainland will worry investors,\" Will Hedden, dealer at London Capital Group, said in a note. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:17:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
