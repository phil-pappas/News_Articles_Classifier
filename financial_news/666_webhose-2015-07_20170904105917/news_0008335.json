( ICA.MX ) and ( ICA ), the largest infrastructure and construction company in Mexico, announced today its unaudited results for the second quarter 2015, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. \nSummary for the second quarter of 2015 ICA’s second quarter results reflect the condition of the Mexican economy, especially in the civil construction area. Concessions, Airports, and ICA Fluor generated strong results, which were offset by the Construction division, as a result of the mix of projects and increases in the cost of production. Comprehensive backlog reached Ps. 55,168 million as of June 30, 2015; this is expected to result in an acceleration of construction activity in the second half of 2015 and in 2016. For the first six months of 2015, total revenues were unchanged compared to the same period of 2014, with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.1%. ICA’s strategic vision to create shareholder value involves a continuous process of monetizing assets in their operational phase and the search for strategic partners. As part of this process in the second quarter, the Company completed creation of ICA OVT, a platform for managing highway concessions and acquiring other operating highway and tollroad infrastructure assets in Mexico. The transaction generated proceeds to ICA of more than Ps. 3,000 million; these resources were used principally to pay parent company short-term debt. During the second half of 2015, ICA expects to generate an additional Ps. 2,000 million through capital recycling transactions. ICA’s priority is the generation of cash from operations and capital recycling transactions in order to reduce leverage in the short-term. Net Income (Loss) of Controlling Interest Non-Consolidated Affiliates and Joint Ventures 43,921 Comprehensive backlog was Ps. 55,168 million, as compared to Ps. 63,295 million as of December 31, 2014. This includes construction contracts of Ps. 33,824 million, long-term mining and other services contracts of Ps. 5,794 million, and ICA’s share of backlog of non-consolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures of Ps. 15,550 million, out of a total non-consolidated backlog of Ps. 32,618 million. Construction contributed 73% of second quarter 2015 revenues and 8% of Adjusted EBITDA. Concessions contributed 13% of total revenues and 50% of Adjusted EBITDA. 7,974 17 Highway traffic volumes (ADTV) rose 7% in 2Q15, principally as a result of growth on the Rio de los Remedios and Rio Verde-Ciudad Valles highways. As of June 30, 2015, Concessions had 17 projects, including 10 highways, 4 water projects, 2 social infrastructure projects, and an energy project. Of these 11 are in operation, and six are under construction. Airports contributed 14% of total revenues and 42% of Adjusted EBITDA. Consolidated net loss was Ps. 357 million in 2Q15. Loss of the controlling interest was Ps. 0.92 per share or US$ 0.24 per ADS. The loss resulted principally from the cost of financing, including an exchange loss of Ps. 345 million.
