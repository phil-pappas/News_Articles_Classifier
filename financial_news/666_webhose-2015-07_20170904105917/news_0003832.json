Cash was free flowing, and relaxed lending practices made it relatively easy to secure financing.\nAfter the Lehman Brothers crash and during the ensuing “credit crunch,” volume fell roughly 19 percent from 2008 until 2012. This general slowdown in lending coincided with stricter requirements placed on borrowers. Financing simply became less available — even for “creditworthy” companies. For the first time in U.S. business history, small business owners frequently were unable to secure credit even from their own banks.\nMany banks suffered losses when the housing bubble burst, and they became risk averse. In order to make loans, they often sought three years worth of financial data. Naturally, revenues declined during the recession, and startups were particularly challenged because they had no financial track record to highlight. Historical data from my company’s Biz2Credit Small Business Lending Index shows that big bank lending hit rock bottom four years ago in June 2011, when only 8.9 percent of small business loan applications were granted.\nSo what happened during this inefficient market? As bank lending fell significantly, so entrepreneurs looked for other sources. Technology enabled platforms such as Biz2Credit, BoeFly and Lendio, as well as balance sheet lenders OnDeck Capital and Kabbage, to emerge and match entrepreneurs with willing lenders.\nHad the banks not shut the spigot so tightly, borrowers might not have been so motivated to look elsewhere. Business owners went online in search of capital in the same way that shoppers adopted technology to find the best deals on consumer goods. These events led to the rise of peer-to-peer lending platforms, such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo, that collectively had provided more than $1 billion in financing for entrepreneurs by 2011.\nAlternative lenders (merchant cash advance companies, factors, and others) also took advantage of the opening when banks refused to lend. In return for a percentage of future revenues, they were willing to provide quick, short-term infusions of cash. These lenders were willing to take on riskier debt, and that risk manifested itself in the form of high interest rates, sometimes 30 to 40 percent, that often had to be paid off in six months or less.\nThe latest major threat to the supremacy of banks has been the rise of marketplace lending, which evolved from peer-to-peer. Now, instead of having individuals fund your company, institutional platforms have gotten into the small business lending game. Insurance companies, family funds, VCs and others are providing billions in capital through online platforms. They make quick decisions like other non-bank lenders, but offer longer terms and much lower interest rates.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "external_links": ["https://www.biz2credit.com/small-business-lending-index"], "published": "2015-07-16T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T23:44:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
