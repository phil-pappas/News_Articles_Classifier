Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Melbourne and Sydney are playing catch-up with the world's most innovative cities, ranked well behind front runners like New York and London in a study by CITIE.\nCITIE, a joint initiative of Accenture, Nesta and Future Cities Catapult, examined 40 city governments around the world and measured how they created the best environment for entrepreneurship and innovation, ranking them against nine characteristics in three areas - openness, infrastructure and leadership.\nNew York, London, Helsinki, Barcelona and Amsterdam made up the top five cities.\nOther front runners included San Francisco, Paris, Singapore, Chicago and Barcelona.\nSydney performed well in the advocate and digital governor categories, but ranked below the majority of countries in the other factors. Supplied Accenture Australia health and public service managing director Catherine Garner said the main success factors for city governments was being able to reduce the distinction between innovation policy design and delivery.\n\"When dealing with start-ups, cities such as New York tend to act like start-ups. They experiment to understand what works, they learn from failure, and they capitalise on success quickly,\" she said.\nAmongst the worst performers were Bangalore, Beijing, Doha, Istanbul and Nairobi.\nMelbourne and Sydney were in the third-tier of cities, classified as builders, among the ranks of Moscow, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Vancouver.\n These cities were found to be \"at a stage of rapid transition, actively investigating policies to enhance their budding ecosystem\", in contrast to the front runners which were \"able to build on the foundations of well-established innovation practices\".\nSydney was trailing the majority of countries in 5/9 characteristics - regulator, customer, connector, strategist and datavore characteristics.\nMelbourne was ranked below the majority of cities in two areas - 'host' and 'datavore' characteristics.\n\"To elevate Melbourne and Sydney out of the third tier there is a need to provide clear direction and the required internal capabilities to support innovation such as; establishing innovation leadership positions and having the teams and strategies in place for coordinating policy across departments,\" Ms Garner said.\n\"[There is a need to] find ways to accommodate innovative new business models into local economies... [and] remove barriers such as complex procurement processes to enable new players and smaller businesses to access the market.\"\nWhile both Melbourne and Sydney were left wanting in some major categories, they were top performers when it came to advocating innovation.\nThe cities also ranked well when it came to the city government facilitating access to capital and talent.\nThere were three characteristics that all high performing city governments had in common: They found creative ways to effect change outside of their formal policy responsibilities; they were open by default, willing to look to other organisations for expertise and they acted more like entrepreneurs than bureaucrats.\n\"Young, digital, high-growth businesses have become increasingly critical to the economic success of the cities they choose to locate in,\" Ms Garner said.\n\"Vibrant start up ecosystems are important not only for growth and jobs but also for a city government's ability to solve local problems and run itself well.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-07-07T09:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:12:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
