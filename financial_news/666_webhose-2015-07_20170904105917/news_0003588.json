Photo: Simon Schluter SMS\nAnother skyscraper is set to tower over Melbourne High School, with the owners of the Roger David clothing business applying to redevelop their South Yarra headquarters, adjacent to the college's hockey field.\nThe 31-level proposal comes seven years after a band of high net worth individuals including trucking magnate Lindsay Fox, who landed his helicopter at Melbourne High, unsuccessfully opposed the first skyscraper redevelopment plan abutting the school – a 16-level, 180-unit tower that replaced a former Lamborghini dealership.\nThe Roger David proposal is more substantial, with 399 apartments atop a multi-level, 172-bay car park.\nA Forever New model struts her stuff, but New's old office is being sold. Photo: Justin McManu\nIf approved, it would be one of the denser residential towers in South Yarra, too. Only a few weeks ago, LK Property Group was permitted to replace a much larger block at the corner of Chapel Street and Toorak Road with a 50-level tower containing 450 flats. That builder is expected to propose another 30-level plus building on a Claremont Street site bought last month for a speculated $14 million.\nNumerous towers of more than 30 levels have been approved for sites around Melbourne High School. The Roger David site was permitted for a 13-level redevelopment some years ago.\nIn the mid-1970s, Roger David sold its Parkdale production plant for $113,000 to the Kingston City Council, which refitted it as the suburb's library.\nMelbourne High School may soon gain another flanking tower. Photo: Andrew De La Rue\nBy comparison, the menswear business' South Yarra site could fetch about $20 million, sources speculate, if offered to the market with an approved 399-unit permit.\nFamily farewell\nMembers of the Thomson family – whose chain of residential real estate agencies are dotted across Melbourne – have parted with a Carlton building owner-occupied for generations.\nThe group's former office at 391-395 Rathdowne Street is now earmarked for a $30-million plus luxury apartment tower after quietly selling to a Preston-based developer.\nThe five-level proposal will be one of the tallest around the intersection of Elgin Street and near where Australand has been teaming with the Department of Human Services to replace a large commission flat compound with a private/public housing village.\nIf approved, the Rathdowne Street project will contain ground floor shops.\nCats move in\nService providers are starting to move into Fishermans Bend ahead of thousands of residents in dozens of new skyscrapers.\nLast week, a feline animal boarding house sought permission to replace a modern office building at 64-68 Wirraway Drive, Port Melbourne, with a facility capable of accommodating 120 cats. The plan would also see a ground floor reception area and upstairs office.\nThe application comes in the week developer Paul Little was approved to develop two towers rising 49 and 47 levels, and containing 940 flats, on a former timber yard at 85-93 Lorimer Street, nearby.\nAnimal-accommodation related applications are being reviewed north of the city, too, with the Melbourne Zoo in Parkville this week seeking to upgrade the Eastern Barred Bandicoot enclosure which does not meet animal welfare requirements.\nLighthouse rising\nThe industry charity which works with property players to raise money for various causes has launched another drive.\nThe Property Industry Foundation's Workplace Giving Campaign aims to raise $300,000 which, in Victoria, will be donated to PIF House at Bonbeach for the Lighthouse Foundation's therapeutic care program.\nPIF's campaign calls on employers to donate via their own fundraising events including BBQs or office gatherings. Companies expected to send out invitations soon include Australand, Boral, Dennis Family Group, Goodman Group, Investa, Leighton Properties, and banks NAB and Westpac.\nSince 1996, PIF has gifted approximately $20 million on behalf of the property industry to dozens of homeless youth charity programs.\n﻿ New site for New\nDipendra and Amanda Goenka, the Melbourne-based owners of global fashion chain Forever New, have offloaded two of three Kew East properties listed as part of a $10 million portfolio late last year.\nAt 722 High Street, a double-storey office has exchanged for $4.2 million, with part of the building now available for lease. This asset covered the largest land area of the three properties: 1275 square metres, and was being marketed for its residential redevelopment potential.\nA neighbouring site – a redundant warehouse on 949 square metres at 720 High Street – has also sold for just under $3.1 million.\nThe only asset still to exchange is Forever New's former headquarters at 714-716 High Street. The company quit the double-storey office after leasing 3500 square metres at the Botanicca business park, on the banks of the Yarra River, in Richmond.\nColliers International's Peter Bremner and Hamish Burgess marketed the Goenka's High Street sites for sale.\nConvenient location\nAn investor has paid nearly $9 million for an outer eastern suburb asset with medium term residential redevelopment potential.\nThe sale of 242 - 244 Maroondah Highway in Chirnside Park – a property leased to a convenience retailer until October 2019 - was struck at a low 4.1 per cent yield.\nThe supersized 9866 square metre site was offloaded by another investor. The sale, however, comes almost 12 months since the owners of 7-Eleven sold 15 properties in deals which realised $70 million.\nJLL sold all the 7-Eleven-occupied properties.\nOf Chirnside Park, directors Stuart Taylor and Stephen Bolton said the asset attracted a variety of prospective purchasers including investors, developers and other retail owner occupiers.\n\"The weight of demand for well-located retail assets is incredibly high, primarily being driven by the local private investor market,\" Mr Taylor said. \"Whilst yields are at a cyclical low, supply of quality retail assets to the market is still scarce which is compounding the demand factors.\"\nIn May, an overseas developer paid $12 million for a 4643 square metre Oakleigh car dealership which is leased for 15 years. In April, builder ICD paid $15.6 million for a 9057 square metre commercial building, leased to a gym until 2025. ICD said it bought the Highett property for its pipeline of medium term redevelopments.\nEmail: marcpallisco@gmail.com\nTwitter: @marcpallisco", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:15:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
