Philip Gostelow by Aaron Bunch, Jonathan Barrett and Tess Ingram ﻿\nWest Australian mining equipment traders are selling machinery at less than half boom time prices, while lunch bars once frequented by engineers and other resources company staff are nearly empty.\nA faltering state economy is linked to a dramatic pullback in mining investment , increased unemployment and, for the first time in recent memory, more people leaving to the eastern states than arriving.\nSteven Sakich, sales manager of Smith Broughton Industrial Auctioneers, said demand for earthmoving, mining and construction equipment had been hit hard. Prices are at least 50 per cent below levels in 2011 and 2012, he said.\nWA has been hit by the fall in the iron ore price. Michele Mossop \"The larger mining equipment is a lot more difficult at the moment because at the end of the day, for someone to purchase it, it needs a job to go to,\" he said.\nMining investment in Western Australia has decreased in line with the falling iron ore price. The iron ore spot price has dropped to below $US50 a tonne from $US187 in February 2011 . The state's unemployment rate is now at 5.8 per cent, up from a recent low of 3.5 per cent in 2012.\nWhile there are some positive signs in the local economy – farmers are looking to cash in on a third straight year of good crops – the magnitude of the transition from a mining investment-driven economy to the far less labour-intensive production economy is hard to ignore.\nChris Phan, the store manager at Lunch Box in West Perth, said he had seen sales progressively drop since 2013. He said sales were down on two years ago even though his lunch bar was picking up customers from the local food court where food outlets had steadily closed in recent months.\n 'For Lease' signage in West Perth, a reflection of increased vacancies and over abundance of commercial office space. Philip Gostelow \"The local food court is pretty vacant at the moment; a lot of tenants are moving out,\" he said. \"We've had a 10 to 15 per cent drop-off in terms of sales numbers. We've noticed lots of old faces aren't coming in any more. Just walking around West Perth there are heaps of vacancies and lots of empty shops.\"\nWest Perth is the city's traditional headquarters for small miners and explorers, which have been hit hardest. Office vacancy rates in the inner city are forecast to hit 20 per cent by year's end, according to the Property Council of Australia.\nIt is not all bad news for those who still have a stable income. During the boom, a shortage of workers and shop and office space meant the high cost of doing business was passed on to consumers.\nThis included exorbitant coffee prices. Perth still has the country's most expensive cappuccinos, according to analysis by coffee equipment supplier the Coffee Economist, but prices aren't rising any more.\nPerth coffees don't come with gold flakes often, but they are the most expensive in the country. \"We've seen the coffee price in Perth plateau,\" Coffee Economist managing director Wayne Fowler said. \"Operators aren't increasing their prices at the moment, and in some cases have decreased their price.\"\nThe company's cappuccino index puts an average Perth coffee at $3.89, compared with $3.32 in Sydney and $3.58 in Melbourne. Over the past five years, coffee prices have increased 11.8 per cent across the major cities, but just 4.9 per cent in Perth.\nWestern Australia was formerly the fastest growing state in Australia, as an iron ore price boom and major gas plant construction attracted workers from interstate and overseas. This put a strain on public infrastructure, but also underpinned housing demand and business growth.\nNet immigration to the state has fallen from a peak of 56,291 in 2012 to just under 19,000 in 2014. A net 400 people left the state and moved east last year.\nBen Gibson, director of restructuring and finance at Tiger Asset Group, said distressed businesses that would have previously found a buyer were now landing in an asset sale scenario. Paul Kane Businesses are trying to adapt. Dependable Laundry Solutions director Gabrielle Worthington said she had been supplying up to 100 washers and dryers a week to Pilbara mining camps until late 2013.\n\"It stopped dead in the water,\" she said. \"We didn't see the effects of the GFC. We say here that 2013 and 2014 has been our GFC. I don't think [demand] is ever going to go back; these camps are built now.\"\nShe said the company was now trading more with the Northern Territory, and was also focusing on servicing laundry units.\nTiger Asset Group is viewing the deterioration of the mining boom from the front line. The asset disposition firm provides valuations and sell-off services to restructuring firms and banks, and opened an office in Perth in May to meet growing demand.\nTiger director restructuring and finance Ben Gibson said the company had been kept \"pretty busy\" and had already completed a number of sales as the downturn continued to snare victims.\nHe said distressed businesses that would have found a buyer a year or two ago were now selling assets. \"It is not all big yellow equipment, although we have had a little bit of that. It has been mostly the support industry, so some transport stuff, some generators and compressors, and those kinds of support industries to the mining industry,\" Mr Gibson said.\nThe oversupply of mining and mining services equipment meant prices had been driven down by 50 per cent in some cases, he said.\n\"We put a 'forced liquidation value' on the assets when we get appointed by receivers or liquidators or work directly for bank and they will ask us what the worst case scenario is. This year, depending on the asset class, we are putting 30 to 50 per cent lower values on all of this type of equipment than what we would have put on it 12 to 18 months ago,\" he said.\n\"What we are finding is that we have to be more innovative and work harder to find the right buyers for some equipment.\"\nMr Gibson said Tiger was finding buyers overseas, particularly in Asia, and was working to sell some equipment into other industries. Buyers were also being inventive he said: one drilling company had recently teamed with an Asian private equity firm to pick up drill rigs on the cheap and \"park the stuff up for 18 months\" until conditions improved.\nSome of the very subdued sentiment in Perth – household consumption is very low – appears to be of the state's own making.\nThe state lost its triple-A rating soon after the boom subsided, as expenses started to outstrip income, and rating house Standard & Poor's now says it has a one-in-three chance of losing its AA+ rating within two years.\nThe avoidable downgrade has added to general malaise, according to Bankwest chief economist Alan Langford, who said West Australians should not \"scare ourselves into a recession we don't have to have\".\nHe said the state would benefit from the fruits of the iron ore and gas project investment boom over the long term, which include long-term production and maintenance jobs and royalties.\nWest Australia is forecast to return to operating surpluses from 2017-18; although the debt burden will remain uncomfortably above $35 billion unless planned government asset sales can alleviate some of the burden.\nHighways Traffic Management owner Jim Capelli said work generated out of several large infrastructure projects in Perth for his oversize transport escort company had offset work lost in the Pilbara.\n\"These projects that have occurred away from the mining industry have really come at the right time for us,\" Mr Capelli said.\nSeveral major government-backed projects, including a new football stadium, waterfront precinct, airport expansion and new children's hospital, have kept construction and services companies busy in Perth, although the pipeline of work is diminishing.\nMr Capelli said he was fortunate not to invest too much during the mining boom. \"During the course of doing business in the Pilbara I actually thought of moving north to open a sub-branch because you got the feeling it was never going to stop, but all of a sudden without really knowing, everything did stop,\" Mr Capelli said.\n\"And you wouldn't have known talking to the locals, they were saying, 'Oh no, this is a good place to invest'. It's just as well we didn't.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.coffee-prices.com/"], "published": "2015-07-15T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:11:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
