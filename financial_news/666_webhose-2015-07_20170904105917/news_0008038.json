Andrew Quilty Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Yolanda Redrup Navitas chief executive Rod Jones has forecast flat earnings in the coming year and failed to soothe investor concerns about the ending of the education provider's contract with Macquarie University in 2016.\nMr Jones' concession that there was still uncertainty about the impact of the lost contract overshadowed a 39 per cent jump in full-year net profit. Investors pushed the stock down 6.4 per cent to $4.27, significantly off its 52-week high of $5.61 hit last October.\nThe $1.7 billion company, which runs education programs in countries such as Australia, Britain and the United States, posted reported net profit after tax of $71.8 million for the full-year to June 30, up from $51.6 million in the prior year.\nMr Jones said the result was \"reasonable\".\n\"It reaffirmed what we said 12 months ago, but I think shareholders were hoping for a bit more,\" he told Fairfax Media.\n\"[Next year] earnings will be in line with what we've achieved this year. But the market is really concerned about what the Macquarie contract drop means and there's no question there is some uncertainty.\"\nKatana Asset Management portfolio manager Romano Sala Tenna praised the new joint-venture style contract design that Navitas will have with universities in future, but said a lack of clarity on the Macquarie fallout was disappointing for shareholders.\n\"The unis would actually need to pay them out if they end an agreement. That's probably the most exciting development I've seen from Navitas in the last 11 years,\" he said.\n \"But management need to have a more precise guidance to give shareholders the confidence that they're back on the growth trajectory.\"\nSuccesses elsewhere Revenue increased 12 per cent to $980.3 million and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation was up 13 per cent to $163.1 million.\nThe company wrote down the goodwill value of its Study Overseas and Navitas Resources Institute businesses by $10.5 million in the second half. The writedowns followed the $9 million impairment of the Sydney Institute of Business and Technology in the first half, which will be run by Macquarie University from the second half of 2016.\nNavitas still could not forecast the full implications of the ending of the Macquarie University contract, but Mr Jones said he was \"quietly confident\".\n\"The rest of the business is doing very well and the success of the other parts of the business will to a large extent offset the Macquarie loss,\" he said.\n\"There are also macroeconomic factors which exist today that haven't gone away. The number of international students studying outside their home country could grow to about 8 million by 2015.\"\nMr Jones was particularly confident about Navitas's professional and English-speaking division and its North American operations.\nThe falling Australian dollar also helps the company, as it encourages more international students to study in Australia, and results in a positive conversion from its US and UK operations.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/YolandaRedrup", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/114369306974649582739/about"], "published": "2015-07-27T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T20:48:21.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
