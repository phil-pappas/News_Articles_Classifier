Wise Bread Picks 0% Balance Transfer Credit Cards \nThe United MileagePlus Club Card is the elite version of the Explorer card and offers exclusive travel benefits for those who travel with United Airlines frequently. If you’re trying to decide which United Mileage Plus credit card to get, we have a side-by-side comparison chart to help. As for the Club Card, here are the terms and offers to consider. Why We Like This Card Sign-up bonus of $100 after your first purchase. United Club membership worth $500 per year. Exclusive travel privileges. How This Card Works \nEarn two miles for each dollar spent on tickets purchased from United and 1.5 miles per dollar spent on all other purchases. \nSign Up Bonus: Get $100 Statement Credit after your first purchase. \nMiles earned can be redeemed for one-way Saver Award flights for as few as 12,500 miles. You can also redeem your miles for seat upgrades, hotel stays, car rentals, merchandise, and gift cards with retailers at approximately 14,000 miles for a $100 gift card. There are no caps on the number of miles you can earn, and miles do not expire. Other Benefits \nFree checked bags. Includes free first and second checked bags for yourself and a companion traveling on the same reservation when you travel with United Airlines. \nUnited Club membership. You receive United Club membership, which allows you and eligible travel companions to access United Club airport lounges. These lounges provide members with complimentary beverages and snacks, high-speed wireless Internet and access to telephones and fax machines when needed. (See also: Credit Cards that Offer Free Airport Lounge Access ) \nPriority travel. This benefit includes travel privileges such as designated check-in lines, priority boarding, and priority baggage handling. \nLuxury Hotel and Resort Collection. In addition to benefits that make smoother and more comfortable flights, the card offers access to guest privileges with the Luxury Hotel and Resort Collection. This includes amenities such as room upgrades, breakfasts, and food and beverage credits often worth as much as $100, at over 750 luxury hotels, resorts, lodges, and spas. Costs 15.99% APR (purchases and balance transfers); 24.99% APR (cash advances) 3% Balance Transfer Fee $0 Foreign Transaction Fee Pros \n$100 Sign Up Bonus. This is a good sign up bonus because unlike most sign up offers, there isn’t a spending requirement -- you get the credit after your first purchase. Furthermore, this bonus is awarded basically as cash and not as miles or points that can sometimes hinder your ability to actually use the bonus. However, the MilelagePlus Explorer Card offers 30,000 bonus miles after $1,000 in purchases within the first 3 months, which is enough for a round trip Saver Award flight. \nEarn more miles. It is common for travel rewards cards to award double miles for purchases made with specific airlines and hotels, however, many only award one mile or point for each dollar spent on other purchases. The card allows you to earn 50% more on all of your purchases, which can help rack up miles that can be used for award flights a bit faster. \nFree checked bags. The benefit of free first and second checked bags for yourself and a companion traveling with you can be worth as much as $240 per roundtrip. Most cards only offer first checked bag free. \nUnited Club access. Access to the United Club airport lounges can cost $50 for one-time visits, $500 per year for yourself, or $750 per year for a spouse membership. As a card member, United Club membership is complimentary for you and your spouse if he or she is an authorized card holder and traveling with you. This also includes participating Star Alliance member lounges. \nNo transaction fees. Not having to pay a 3% fee when using a credit card abroad is always helpful. (See also: Best Credit Cards to Use While on Vacation ) Cons \nAnnual fee. Although the card provides numerous ways in which to cover the annual fee of $450 through bonuses and privileges, it is still one of the highest annual fees charged by a credit card. If you travel infrequently with United Airlines and are not positive that you will use the benefits fully, cards with fewer perks and lower annual fees could benefit you more. In fact, if you travel only occasionally with United Airlines, the MileagePlus Explorer Credit Card offers similar benefits and perks for travelers, but for a lower annual fee of $95 per year. \nNo elite status benefits. Like many other airline rewards programs, the United MileagePlus program offers status levels which provide additional benefits when flying with United. There are no additional elite status benefits provided with the Club Card, largely because many of the benefits are included with your card membership. However, if you have been saving miles or participating in the elite status program, you can reach statuses such as Premier Platinum and Premier 1K with the MileagePlus Explorer Card instead. Who This Card Is Best For \nThe United MileagePlus Club Card is a great card for those who fly frequently with United Airlines. It provides the most value if you can take advantage of the exclusive benefits and privileges such as United Club membership and free checked bags. Annual fees in this range are common among elite style credit cards and $450 per year is actually at the lower end of this group of cards. The value of almost any credit card, however, is dependent on how you use it and how it benefits you personally.
