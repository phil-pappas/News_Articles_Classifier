But others are just plain dangerous.\nSo let’s bust five of the most common myths we hear about investing, once and for all.\n1. YOU CAN’T GO WRONG WITH BRICKS AND MORTAR\nIt’s easy to point to the current madness in Sydney and Melbourne as evidence that property is a one-way ticket to wealth. But it’s not that simple.\nWhile prices in Sydney are up 15 per cent this year, over the past 10 years they’ve only risen by an average of 4.4 per cent, and have often tracked flat or downwards.\nMany people also underestimate the transaction and ongoing costs of owning a property, especially with interest rates at record lows ... Stamp duty, legal fees, agent fees, council rates, insurance etc. And they assume they’ll always be able to find a nice tenant who always pays on time, looks after the property and is happy with constant rent increases.\nFinally, keep in mind that if all of your money is tied up in your home and an investment property, you’re highly exposed if the market does change course.\nProperty is, and can be, a great investment but carries risk like every investment.\n2. NEGATIVE GEARING IS A LICENSE TO PRINT MONEY\nThis billion-dollar tax break gets a lot of bad press.\nIt’s billed as a tax rort for the wealthy and the cause of our capital city house price problems and, yes, at some stage the government will probably have to address it.\nBut owning a negatively geared property doesn’t guarantee you’ll make money.\nThat’s because negative gearing provides a tax break for losses incurred when you borrow money to buy an investment (in this case the losses are your rental income minus your loan interest).\nTo make money on a negatively geared asset, the asset must appreciate in value enough to cover these losses and lock in a profit. Plus negative gearing from a tax point of view really only works for those on the top tax bracket.\nThis is a great strategy in a rising property market. But remember what we said in point one …\nIf all of your money is tied up in your home and an investment property, you’re highly exposed if the market does change course. Source: Supplied\n3. I’M TOO YOUNG/BROKE TO THINK ABOUT INVESTING\nIt’s easy to think you’ll put off investing until you’re older, or some point in the future when you have money to spare.\nBut even setting aside a small amount each month can build big rewards over time thanks to the power of compounding. And the younger you start, the better.\nFor example, let’s say at age 25 Sarah deposits $2,000 into a high interest savings account and commits to kicking in $100 a week from then on.\nAssuming she earns an average return of 5 per cent on this money compounding monthly, by the time Sarah is thinking about retirement aged 65 she’s a compound interest millionaire with $1,006,630 in the bank.\nAnd she’s only deposited $300,000 in cash. Magic.\n4. SUPER IS A SET-AND-FORGET INVESTMENT\nMany Australian prefer to focus on the ‘now’ when it comes to their money and assume that everything will be OK in the long run.\nBut with people living longer, the government can’t afford to support our ageing population in the same way as they did for previous generations.\nYes, you can’t touch it right now, but that doesn’t change the fact that how you invest your super is one of the most important financial decisions of your life.\nSo take the time to consolidate multiple accounts, understand the fees and choose an appropriate investment option for your situation.\n5. FINANCIAL ADVISERS ARE CROOKS\nFees and commissions paid to financial advisers are a sore point for many people.\nBut a good financial adviser can save you many times the cost of the fees they charge by making sure your money is appropriately invested and putting a plan in place to help you achieve your financial goals.\nKnowledge is always your best investment. So if you don’t have it, buy it from someone who does ... And it’s tax deductible.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/busting-major-investment-myths-kochie-says-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-sure-thing/story-fn7kicty-1227421745763?sv=2f83c6a6baeda96794fea68a6d70d480", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/busting-major-investment-myths-kochie-says-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-sure-thing/story-fn7kicty-1227421745763?sv=2f83c6a6baeda96794fea68a6d70d480&title=Five+money+myths+you+should+stop+believing", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/campaign/home-loans/refinance#itm_t=story&itm_l=kochie-busts-investment-myths", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/busting-major-investment-myths-kochie-says-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-sure-thing/story-fn7kicty-1227421745763?sv=2f83c6a6baeda96794fea68a6d70d480&title=Five+money+myths+you+should+stop+believing", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Five+money+myths+you+should+stop+believing&c=CLICHES+about+investing+can+be+wrong%2C+and+just+plain+dangerous.+David+and+Libby+Koch+bust+five+of+the+most+common+myths+about+money.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/busting-major-investment-myths-kochie-says-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-sure-thing/story-fn7kicty-1227421745763?sv=2f83c6a6baeda96794fea68a6d70d480", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/busting-major-investment-myths-kochie-says-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-sure-thing/story-fn7kicty-1227421745763?sv=2f83c6a6baeda96794fea68a6d70d480", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/first-home-buyers#itm_t=story&itm_l=kochie-busts-investment-risks", "http://moneysaverhq.heraldsun.com.au/guide/high-interest-savings-accounts#itm_t=story&itm_l=kochie-busts-investment-risks", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/david-and-libby-koch/busting-major-investment-myths-kochie-says-theres-no-such-thing-as-a-sure-thing/story-fn7kicty-1227421745763?sv=2f83c6a6baeda96794fea68a6d70d480&h=Five+money+myths+you+should+stop+believing"], "published": "2015-06-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T05:21:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
