Louise Kennerley Share on twitter by Ewin Hannan Hutchison Ports is slashing more than 40 per cent of its waterfront workforce at its terminals in Brisbane and Sydney, prompting union claims the company is trying to bust the influence of the Maritime Union of Australia.\nThe waterfront's third operator had told employees that its 222-strong workforce at Port Botany and Brisbane would be cut by 96, a memo obtained by The Australian Financial Review said.\nHutchison has previously flagged unspecified job and customer services losses, signalling a retreat from its $700 million effort to bust the waterfront duopoly.\n\"This has been an important and difficult decision for the shareholders and management team to effectively reduce the size of the Australian workforce to the levels proposed,\" the July 24 memo said.\n\"We do hope that conditions will improve. If we retain the right mix of skills and experience, then we believe that we will have a better and more efficient offering in Australia. We do not, however, see this occurring in the next six months to 12 months and for that reason we feel that someone taking a period of annual leave or unpaid leave would not be appropriate.\"\nHutchison said it was possible redundant employees could return as casuals if business conditions improved. \"We would, of course, be very interested in having access to a trained casual workforce in the future,\" it said.\nEmployees were being assessed on their commitment to health and safety initiatives, ability to work in a team environment, skills and productivity, it said.\nBut Warren Smith, the MUA's assistant national secretary, said the company had embarked on a strategy dubbed Phoenix Rising to bust the union's influence.\n 'Like animals at a fair' He said the company was determined to weed out union \"troublemakers\", ranking employees \"like animals at a fair\", with union delegates targeted for redundancy.\nIn a bulletin to members, the union compared the company's tactics to those used by Patrick during the 1998 waterfront dispute.\n\"It's basically sneaking AutoStrads into the terminals and potentially remote-controlled quay cranes under the noses of the MUA, so there is no requirement to have negotiated manning levels or coverage,\" it said.\n\"An audacious plan only second to the 98 lockout, which will be fought by the union as vigorously and for as long as it takes to ensure union-busting plans for workers and negotiated outcomes around automation are met.\"\nMr Smith said the union was prepared to accept jobs cuts if the company could justify them but Hutchison management needed to negotiate about any further automation plans.\n\"In what can only be called an unbelievably twisted mix between James Bond and Harry Potter, it appears Hutchison Ports Australia have hatched a plan that involves the destruction of the Maritime Union of Australia and the rebirth of HPA,\" the bulletin said.\nChosen another path \"The MUA would rather negotiate through whatever difficult times were confronting the company. HPA have chosen another path. They are cultivating waterfront disharmony and provoking a dispute the MUA would rather not have but will engage to its fullest if the company implements automation without negotiation, uses automation as union busting and continually does not adhere to the EBA that was struck in good faith and made to work by the members at HPA.\"\nUnion members at Hutchison will stop work for four hours on Thursday and Friday to consider a further response. The existing enterprise agreement is not due to expire until February.\nThe MUA said it had also alerted its \"comrades\" in the International Transport Workers Federation to the \"devious plans\" of Hutchison in Australia.\nA spokesman for Hutchison declined to comment about the union claims.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EwinHannan"], "published": "2015-07-28T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T14:13:00.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
