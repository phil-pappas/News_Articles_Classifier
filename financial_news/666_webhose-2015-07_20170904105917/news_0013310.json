The data goes back to 2003, and scores have never been higher. If current trends continue, the average American credit score could cross 700 in the next few months.\nAs credit scores improve, the flow of credit to consumers will increase. In the first three months of 2015, credit card balances increased by over $20 billion, and this trend is expected to accelerate. People are applying for more credit, and banks are more willing to lend.\nAccording to the traditional narrative, we all over-indulged on easy credit before 2008. After the crisis we learned our lesson and went through a period of difficult de-leveraging and responsible budgeting. Banks also learned their lessons, and are now only making loans to creditworthy borrowers with stable jobs and good income. However, this convenient narrative ignores two simple facts. First, a big part of the de-leveraging resulted from banks writing off bad debt. And second, most negative information disappears from your credit report in 7 years, including home foreclosures. Even Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which is the ultimate negative mark, is gone after 10 years.\nThe Great Recession happened 7 years ago. Over the next few years, the negative marks of the Great Recession will disappear completely from the nation’s credit reports. Scores will increase. And banks will start lending to the same people, again.\nA System Built To Forget\nWhen a bank makes a lending decision, it is based upon information available in credit reports. The credit scoring models can only use data available on credit reports. And almost all negative information is gone in 7 years. According to FICO , “it’s a common misconception that a foreclosure will ruin your score for a very long time. In fact, if you keep all of your other credit obligations in good standing, your FICO can rebound in as little as 2 years.”\nBecause most banks tightened credit after the 2008 crisis, it became almost impossible to get new credit. And, as a result, it became very difficult for people to borrow too much because the credit just wasn’t available. But now it is.\nOur credit scoring system is built to have an automatic credit score jubilee. Mistakes and negative events in the past will be forgotten. Over time, our scores will improve so long as we don’t get drunk on credit too quickly.\nPage 1 / 2 Continue Get The Forbes Investing Digest", "external_links": ["http://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/data.html", "http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/questions/foreclosure-fico-score-affect.aspx"], "published": "2015-07-02T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T21:18:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
