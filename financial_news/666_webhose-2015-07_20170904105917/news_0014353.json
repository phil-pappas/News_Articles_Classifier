While payrolls grew overall, many people gave up looking for work and wage growth stalled. Bond prices rose. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23 points, or 0.1%, to 17,781 as of 10:16 am Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained three points, or 0.1%, to 2,080. The Nasdaq composite climbed five points, or 0.1%, to 5,018. US employers added 223,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate fell to a seven-year low of 5.3%. But the rate fell mostly because many people out of work gave up on trying to find a job and were no longer counted as unemployed. The report also said average hourly earnings rose 2%, slightly lower than consensus. Thomas Simons, an economist at the investment bank Jefferies, wrote in a report that the wage numbers showed a “glaring sign of weakness.” Investors bought bonds in anticipation that the inflation, and interest rates, will remain low. The price of the benchmark 10-year treasury note rose, pushing down its yield to 2.38% from 2.45% just before the jobs report came out. Greece’s government is pressing ahead with its plan to put austerity measures to voters after European creditors rebuffed its latest proposal for a new aid program. Greece failed to repay a loan to the International Monetary Fund that was due on Tuesday after talks between the nation and its creditors broke down late last week. “The latest news from Greece was somewhat ambiguous,” Mizuho Bank analysts said in a commentary. “Markets appear to have shifted attention to U.S. data releases, albeit temporarily.” Health Net rose $8.55, or 13%, to $73.64 after Medicaid coverage provider Centene said it will pay about $6.3 billion to buy the company. The deal is more evidence of managed-care companies looking to bulk up in response to the federal health care overhaul. US-listed shares of BP rose $1.90, or 5%, to $41.18 after the oil driller reached an $18.7 billion settlement with several states to resolve litigation over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Germany’s DAX slipped 0.3% and France CAC 40 fell 0.6%. Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.5%. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1% and South Korea’s Kospi added 0.5%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.1% and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.5%. But China’s Shanghai Composite slumped 3.5%.
