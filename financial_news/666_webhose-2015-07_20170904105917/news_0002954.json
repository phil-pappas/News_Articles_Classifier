Analysts are expecting at least one large initial public offering from the sharing-economy sector to be completed this fall.\n“They’re hoping to essentially be ahead of the trend,” Hamadeh said.\nThe sector that encompasses Etsy ETSY, -2.79% HomeAway AWAY, +0.19% Uber and on-demand labor company TaskRabbit is called the sharing economy, based on the idea that these companies share human and physical resources in some way. But it could be better defined as “on-demand” companies, or companies that are trying to tap resources that are under-utilized, said Hamadeh.\nDemand for these companies in the private sector is increasing. Investments in private mobile, on-demand companies reached $4.12 billion in 2014, a 514% increase from 2013, according to data firm CB Insights. The number of venture capitalists who had done a deal in the space grew to 198 in April 2015 from fewer than 20 in 2010.\n“People want the new tech and millennial (companies),” said Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.\nEtsy, which went public in April, has had a mixed performance since then. The stock climbed to its highest level on April 16, hitting an intraday high of $35.74. But in May, the company reported an unexpected loss in its first quarterly earnings report as a public company, sending its shares down about 18% the following day.\nEtsy shares enjoyed a brief spike last week after a positive mention of the company on the Google earnings call , but they have since leveled off.\nHomeAway, which went public in June of 2011, reached an intraday high of $48.90 in February 2014. Shares have gained 5% year-to-date, but are down 3% in the past three months.\nBecause investors are looking to profit from the trend, not the specific company, the fundamentals of Etsy or HomeAway hardly matter, Hamadeh said.\nFor now, there are few public sharing-economy or on-demand options to choose from, he said. After Etsy and HomeAway, the next closest may be eBay, which could benefit if Etsy stock takes off, he said.\nHamadeh said he expects Airbnb, which has a $24 billion valuation , to be the next in the group to go public, and it could benefit from the attention it is likely to attract ahead of Uber’s expected public offering. Uber, which is reportedly valued at $50 billion or more, needs to become more of a logistics company to justify higher valuations before it goes public, he said.\nOther highly awaited initial public offerings include grocery delivery company Instacart, TaskRabbit and ride-hailing company Lyft, he said.\n“I really don’t think we’ll see September end without some of these companies public,” Hamadeh said.\nWolff said he expects a “huge and exciting IPO in the not too distant future,” but in October at the earliest. He added that it may not necessarily be Airbnb, as the company is still grappling with some regulatory issues.\nOverall, startups are staying private longer and raising larger funding rounds, which makes it hard for non-mutual funds or small to medium-size investment firms to participate.\n“They’re just not going to be part of the conversation for a $1 billion round,” Hamadeh said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/more-startups-aim-to-keep-it-private-1420159193", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secret-math-of-airbnbs-24-billion-valuation-1434568517", "http://www.wsj.com/article_email/uber-plans-large-new-funding-round-1431137142-lMyQjAxMTA1NzA0ODkwODgwWj"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T04:30:50.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
