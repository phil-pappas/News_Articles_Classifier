Photo: Gabriele Charotte\nMacquarie Group is well on its way to returning to record profits after adopting a more bullish tone in its guidance for 2016, saying it expects profit to be up on the previous year.\nIn May, Macquarie said its 2016 full-year result would be \"slightly up\" on this year's $1.6 billion profit, but it has now opted to ditch the word \"slightly\". Macquarie chairman Kevin McCann and chief executive Nicholas Moore fronted shareholders at the company's annual general meeting in Sydney on Thursday.\nMr Moore said while the impact of future of market conditions made forecasting difficult, a strong performance in the first quarter led Macquarie to expect the profit result for the 12 months ended March 31 would be up compared to the result in 2015.\n\"Both Macquarie's annuity-style businesses and capital markets-facing businesses contributions for the first quarter of the 2016 financial year were significantly up on the first quarter of the 2015 financial year and broadly in line with the prior quarter,\" Mr Moore said in a statement to the stock exchange ahead of the AGM.\nAdvertisement Analysts are expecting a result in the order of $1.8 billion for 2016, in line with a record 2008 result. The company has in recent years typically upgraded guidance through the 12-month period.\nMacquarie also upgraded its guidance for the asset management unit, its largest contributor to earnings, saying it now expected that unit to post a higher full-year result than in 2015. It had previously said income from asset management in 2016 would be \"broadly in line\" with this year's result.\n\"Performance fees as well as the weaker (Australian) currency both have contributed to the upgrade for Macquarie Asset Management,\" Mr Moore told journalists ahead of the AGM. He also noted that Macquarie's position of raising capital to fund significant acquisitions remained unchanged.\nMacquarie's corporate and asset finance unit is bidding for ANZ Banking Group's Esanda dealer finance business, which may fetch as much as $1.5 billion. The competition regulator this week called for submissions on the potential acquisition, noting it would make a decision or release a statement of issues in September.\nMacquarie shares closed 0.4 per cent higher at $84.81 on Thursday, not far off eight year highs.\nMacquarie on Thursday also noted that its surplus capital above minimum regulatory capital requirements stood at $2.4 billion as at June 30, down from $2.7 billion at the end of March.\nThat follows changes by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority this week aimed at boosting the the level of capital required to be held against residential mortgages.Macquarie said it estimated the changes would have a $150 million impact on surplus capital, which would be met from retained earnings and existing surplus capital.\nMacquarie's first-quarter update included performance fees of $208 million, stemming largely from its investments in listed entities Macquarie Infrastructure Company and Macquarie Atlas Roads. The asset management unit had $477.4 billion in assets under management as at June 30, broadly in line with the previous three month period.\nMacquarie's business units that are closely tied to the performance of capital markets, including Macquarie Capital, Macquarie Securities and Commodities and Financial Markets, benefited from greater levels of transaction activity and volatility in the first quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T23:28:23.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
