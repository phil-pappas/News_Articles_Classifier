That may open as much as 157 billion euros ($174 billion) of securities outstanding to potential ECB buying, including notes from Volkswagen AG, Airbus Group SE and Telekom Austria AG, they said.\n“Let’s hope the ECB leaves its additions here, but there are plenty more companies that seem to tick its latest box for inclusion,” said Jeroen Van Den Broek , the head of developed-markets credit strategy and research at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam. “With the ECB buying up what little liquidity there is left in euro-zone investment-grade corporates, it pushes real money managers even further down the curve.”\nLiquidity has already plunged in the corporate-bond market, with trading tumbling about 90 percent since 2006, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. That slump, predominately caused by banks cutting holdings to preserve capital in response to tougher capital rules, has prompted the Bank for International Settlements to warn about liquidity traps.\nThe ECB’s entrance into the market could worsen the squeeze, given its history of building and holding positions in the covered bond and asset-backed securities market. The lender is pursuing a 1.1 trillion euro quantitative easing program, which also includes buying sovereign and agency bonds, as it seeks to boost lending and growth in the euro area.\nNew ‘Agencies’ The ECB didn’t say it was buying corporate bonds in Thursday’s update. Rather, it included the three listed companies, Snam SpA, Enel SpA and Terna Rete Elettrica Nazionale SpA, among 13 new “agencies” added to its potential bond-buying list. The other 10 were unlisted entities, such as Austrian railway builder OeBB Infrastruktur AG and French train operator SNCF Reseau.\nThe central bank said on its website it may further amend the list of borrowers “on the basis of monetary-policy considerations and duly reflecting risk-management issues.”\nGovernment-backed utilities and infrastructure companies are the most likely to be seen as candidates for addition, Barclays Plc strategists wrote in a note. BNP Paribas’ list of state-backed companies that could be added included Renault SA, Air France-KLM and Orange SA.\nBuilding Positions The ECB has bought 94.6 billion euros of covered notes since October and 8.6 billion euros of ABS since November, according to its website. The scale and pace of the purchases drove yields on covered bonds to record lows. In the ABS market, yield premiums slumped to the lowest since 2007.\nThe institution now holds about 15 percent of the 870 billion-euro market for covered notes, according to data compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc covering securities of 500 million euros or more. The share is 20 percent when bonds that don’t meet the ECB’s criteria for purchasing are excluded.\n“The ECB is a big liquidity taker when it comes to trading activity in secondary markets,” said Zoso Davies, a credit strategist at Barclays in London. “If you look at what’s happened to covered bonds and asset-backed securities, we’ve seen a significant fall in activity in those markets. It would be pretty odd if credit didn’t react in the same way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T14:00:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
