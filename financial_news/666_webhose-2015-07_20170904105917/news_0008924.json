It is now critical that firms act to restore trust and confidence in the system,” she said. \n“Firms should have in place systems to manage the risks posed by benchmark activities and to address the weaknesses that have previously been identified.” \nMore changes are on their way from regulators. \nThe Bank of England is working with authorities around the world to draw up a global code of conduct for currency traders . \nOn April 1, regulators added seven more benchmarks including gold, silver and oil indices to the list of those covered by tighter rules, which include the threat of prosecution and jail terms for traders who try to manipulate the markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:39:17.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
