The stock was changing hands at £10.07 by the close - down 36p, or 3.5pc. \nMeanwhile, it was a dreary day for Britain’s benchmark index as weaker metals prices and a disappointing earnings report from Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) dented stocks. The FTSE 100 closed at a one-week low of 6,667.34, down 101.73 points, or 1.5pc. \nRSA Insurance (LSE: RSA.L - news ) became a source of bid speculation, as traders in the City noted “unusually high trading volumes” amid chatter an announcement from Stephen Hester, the chief executive, was imminent. Although no definitive names were attached to the bid gossip, the stock advanced 9.3p, or 2.1pc, to 449.5p. \nA sharp fall in metals dragged mining stocks lower. Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) plunged 5.6pc to 813.5p, while Glencore (Xetra: A1JAGV - news ) dropped 5.4pc to 228p. \nBHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) was also dealt a blow after flagging a $650m hit to its full-year underlying profits, driven by writedowns in its copper business. It comes a week after the FTSE 100 company announced $2bn in writedowns to its US shale oil division . However, BHP managed to beat its own production guidance for iron ore this year. The stock was trading down 5.7pc at £11.80 by the close. \nGold slipped back towards five-year lows , knocking 2.6pc off Fresnillo and sending Randgold Resources 1.2pc lower to £38.45. \nMeanwhile, chip designer ARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) took a hammering after one of its biggest customers, Apple, revealed sales and iPhone shipments fell short of market expectations. Apple’s disappointing results overshadowed ARM’s 32pc jump in second-quarter profits , driven by royalties from devices such as the iPhone 6. \nWhile some analysts cast doubt over the strength of the smartphone market, Julian Yates of Investec (LSE: INVP.L - news ) said “the company has not seen any material signs of slowing in its end markets”. \nARM shares fell 69p, or 6.6pc, to 970p - its lowest level in six months. \nHowever, it wasn’t the only supplier to feel the effects of Apple’s weak forecast; graphics chip designer Imagination Technologies (Other OTC: IGNMF - news ) slipped 3.2p to 239.5p and components supplier Laird (LSE: LRD.L - news ) shed 10.7p to close at 362p. * Apple share price drop knocks tech stocks across the globe TalkTalk experienced its worst day in two years, sliding 34.8p, or 8.9pc, to 355.7p, after it said the British broadband market had turned increasingly competitive . Although the FTSE 250 company is on track to meet its full-year targets, it refrained from matching aggressive promotions by BT and Sky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) in the broadband market. \nIt wasn’t all doom and gloom in the equity markets, as Numis lifted Mitchells & Butlers to “add” from “hold”, citing like-for-like sales growth of 1.4pc over the first 32 weeks of the year. Analysts also said there should be limited downside risks to forecasts, as they now reflect the new living wage. The shares soared 21.5p, or 5.6pc, to 405.6p. * Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in hospitality sector hit by National Living Wage concerns Elsewhere, easyJet flew 82p, or 4.9pc, higher to £17.48 - its best day in six months - after full-year profits and guidance came in higher than expected . \nHowever, Mark Simpson of Goodbody noted a number of investor concerns, including “the risk of encroachment on easyJet’s premium network by Ryanair, the continuing uncertainty over the euro-sterling exchange rate and the need for more significant cost savings than currently being delivered”. Despite yesterday’s stellar performance, Mr Simpson warned these risk factors will continue to impinge on the airline’s return on capital employed. \nLow-cost airline Flybe issued a trading statement showing a 9.8pc rise in passenger numbers in the first quarter, sending the shares 16.9pc higher to 83p. Numis began covering the stock yesterday with a target price of 132p, as analysts noted “the business is now ready for profitable growth”. \nFinally, over on Aim, Tungsten (Other OTC: TUNG - news ) plunged 23.3pc to 67.5p after reporting a loss after tax of £27m for the yea r , a significant increase on last year’s loss of £10.2m. However, with group revenue of £23.1m, results were broadly in line with market expectations. \nThe firm remains in discussion to arrange a joint venture with a global financial institution analysts say, and despite its woes, Bob Liao, of Canaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) , believes the group has “sufficient cash to reach breakeven, even before a potential sale of its bank”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:49:08.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
