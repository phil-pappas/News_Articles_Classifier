Akwaboah, Engen Ghana Managing Director, said the competitive pricing regime being offered by the company was in conformity with global Engen's commitment to fulfil its vision of becoming the Oil Company of Choice in sub-Saharan Africa. \nMr Akwaboah said Engen Ghana was also offering Ghanaians new products, such as Dynamic Diesel, Primax, Extreme 5 w 40, Syntium 5 w 40, Readymix Coolant, and Engen 1Card. \nHe explained that: 'Customers expect the most from every tank; want more power, extra kilometres and extended engine life. \n'After extensive research we set out to develop fuels that would not only satisfy all our customers' requirements but exceed them.' \nHe said some industrial players had made motorists to believe that they needed to choose between fuel that satisfied performance and fuel that met demands of the economy. \n'Now with Engen Primax Unleaded, you can have both; so whatever you drive, fill up with new Engen Primax Unleaded, 'he said. \n'Available in both 93 and 95 octane, its tailor-made intelligent technology offers you superior performance and more kilometres per tank - making it the most intelligent fuel,' he said. \n'Engen Primax Unleaded is the most intelligent fuel currently available. It adapts to your driving needs, combining enhanced performance and fuel economy,\" he added. \nMr Akwaboah noted that the technologically advanced additive pack also included a new generation detergent that cleaned and improved car engines as the organic combustion provided more complete combustion of the fuel. \nHe said the new friction modifier reduced friction in the engine and improved lubricity to ensure energy efficiency and better fuel economy. \nThe new technology was specially designed for newer engines that operated at higher temperatures, but was equally effective on older vehicles, he added. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:41:38.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
