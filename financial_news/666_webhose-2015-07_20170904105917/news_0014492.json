Revenue did come in slightly below Street estimates, but its overall automotive profit was its best quarterly performance since 2000. \nPfizer —The drug maker beat estimates by 4 cents with adjusted quarterly profit of 56 cents per share, with revenue also beating forecasts. Pfizer also raised its full-year forecast on rising sales of its newer drugs. \nMerck —Merck earned an adjusted 86 cents per share for its latest quarter, 5 cents above estimates, though revenue was slightly below Street projections as the stronger dollar hurt sales numbers. \nDuPont —DuPont earned an adjusted $1.18 per share for the second quarter, matching estimates, but revenue was short of forecasts. DuPont also lowered its earnings outlook for the year on lower corn and soybean volumes as well as weaker demand for its crop protection products. \nWyndham —The hotel operator beat estimates by 6 cents with adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.32 per share, with revenue also coming in above forecasts. The company was helped by increased timeshare sales, even as revenue per available room fell both in the U.S. and internationally, and it also raised its forecast for the year. \nDR Horton —The homebuilder earned 60 cents per share for its latest quarter, 10 cents above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts as orders rose 22 per cent from a year earlier. \nReynolds American —The tobacco producer saw its earnings come in 5 cents above estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.02 per share. Revenue was slightly below forecasts, but the rest of its news was bullish as Reynolds increased its quarterly dividend, upped its yearly earnings forecast, and declared a two-for-one stock split. \nSirius XM —The satellite radio provider matched estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 3 cents per share, but revenue beat estimates and the company raised its earnings forecast for the year. Sirius is benefiting from strong auto sales, which is helping it add subscribers. \nCorning —Corning beat estimates by 1 cent with adjusted quarterly profit of 38 cents per share, thought revenue was very slightly below forecasts. Corning did say it sees falling demand this year for liquid crystal display (LCD) glass. \nProcter & Gamble —The Wall Street Journal reported that veteran P&G executive David Taylor will be named to replace A.G. Lafley as chief executive officer. Taylor is currently in charge of P&G's global health and grooming business. Lafley is expected to stay on as chairman. \nBaidu —Baidu posted earnings that beat analyst estimates, but the China-based internet search company gave weaker than expected guidance for the current quarter. \nBP —BP reported profits that were nearly two-thirds lower than a year ago, as crude oil prices slumped. BP also took a $10.8 billion charge related to the 2010 Gulf oil spill. BP also announced a cut in its full-year capital spending plans. \nHoneywell —Honeywell is buying the utility meter business of Britain's Melrose Industries for about $5.1 billion. \nToyota —The automaker was outsold by Volkswagen in the first half of the year, with VW selling 5.04 million vehicles and Toyota coming in at 5.02 million. Toyota has sold the most cars on an annual basis for the past three years. \nCaterpillar —Caterpillar announced plans to build its own line of dump trucks at a Texas plant. It is ending an outsourcing deal with Navistar, which has been building those trucks for Caterpillar. \nConstellation Brands —Constellation is planning to raise beer prices by 3 percent later this year, according to industry publication Beer Marketer's Insights. The magazine notes that it is unusual for Constellation to lead a round of beer price hikes, which are more often initiated by Anheuser-Busch Inbev . \nNike —Nike is offering partial refunds to customers who bought its FuelBand fitness tracker over the past three years. A lawsuit had charged that the product was not accurately tracking steps or calories. \nQuestions? Comments?
