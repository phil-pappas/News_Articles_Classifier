Alone in falling short, JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) was said at the time to need around $22 billion in new capital. \nThe bank had been singled out in a congressional report in November as having a particularly high and risky exposure to the physical commodity market. \nThe threat of risky activity by the largest banks to the financial system became clear in the 2008 financial crisis, when the government was forced to prop up some of the largest institutions to protect them from large losses and extreme funding vulnerabilities. \nSince the crisis, global banking regulators have made extensive efforts to identify \"systemically important financial institutions,\" also called \"too-big-to-fail\" because their failure had the potential to weaken the entire financial system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T21:27:48.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
