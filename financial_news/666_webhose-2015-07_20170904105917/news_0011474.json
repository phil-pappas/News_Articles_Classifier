The Bethesda, Maryland, defense contractor expects to fund the acquisition with cash on hand and new debt issuances. \nEven though the company is a leader in the industry, Lockheed can improve Sikorsky, particularly on contracting, cash flow and in reviewing the international security needs of customers, said Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner. \n“We think it fits well into our portfolio and this is what we do,” Tanner said. \nLockheed Martin is now reviewing its options for its government information technology and technical services businesses, primarily in the Information Systems & Global Solutions business segment, and a portion of the Missiles and Fire Control business segment. They represent about $6 billion in estimated 2015 annual sales. \nUnited Technologies, based in Hartford, Connecticut, said it will use proceeds from the sale to buy back company stock. \nCowen and Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr wrote that the proposed sale may be a “longer term strategic plus” for United Technologies would it to boost its position in aerospace systems where it could cut costs. \nThere is the potential, however for a close review of the deal by the Defense Department, von Rumohr said. \nIt is a natural fit for Lockheed Martin Corp., which is already the primary mission systems provider for Sikorsky’s MH-60 Naval Hawk, Canadian Maritime Helicopter, Combat Rescue Helicopter and presidential helicopter, von Rumohr said. \nThe deal is targeted to close by the end of the year or in the first quarter of 2016. \nThere have been sale rumors for more than a year as the military business fell with the U.S. exiting Afghanistan and reducing its presence in Iraq. Sikorsky, which is also used by major energy companies to ferry workers to and from deep-water oil platforms and other facilities, has also come under strain with the price of oil plunging this year. \nHewson sees a recovery in energy prices and predicted that Sikorksy will add additional value with any rebound.
