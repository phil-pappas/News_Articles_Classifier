However, some brokers expect platinum prices to recover. Even (Taiwan OTC: 6436.TWO - news ) so, both UBS (NYSEArca: FBGX - news ) and Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) downgraded Lonmin’s rating and slashed the stock’s price target. Analysts at UBS were concerned that the cash flow by the world’s third-largest platinum producer generated from an eventual increase in platinum prices will be used to increase capital expenditure. \n“Lonmin (LSE: LMI.L - news ) does not have the same asset flexibility as its peers, and it remains unclear how it could transform itself into a producer with the ability to generate cash through the cycle,” said Danielle Chigumira, of UBS. \nHowever, if lower platinum prices persist, analysts say the FTSE 250 company may struggle further. In May, Lonmin announced it would axe 3,500 jobs in an attempt to prepare itself for what it says could be another two years of depressed platinum prices, after it reported a half-year pre-tax loss of $118m. Other analysts cited Glencore’s distribution of its 23.9pc stake in Lonmin to its own shareholders as another element weighing on the share price. The company, which is due to publish a production report on July 24, closed 10.9p, or 11.7pc, in the red, at 82p. \nBuoyed by hopes that a debt deal between Greece and its creditors was imminent, after Greece presented reform proposals to Brussels late on Thursday , the FTSE 100 climbed to its highest level in more than a week, closing 93.78 points, or 1.4pc, higher at 6,675.41. * Greece submits new plan as two sides edge closer to deal Brewin Dolphin (LSE: BRW.L - news ) jumped 18.4p, or 6.3pc, after Panmure Gordon lifted its target price to 350p - up from 300p - citing organic growth had not been priced into the shares. Similarly, Sports Direct International (Other OTC: SDIPF - news ) was on the rise, up 3.3pc to 730p, after hedge fund Odey Asset Management disposed of just under 1.3m shares. \nJoining the upward trend, Standard Life (LSE: SL.L - news ) claimed the FTSE 100 top spot, rising 18.3p, or 4.2pc to 452.3p, after Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) raised its price target to 546p from 520p. In a bullish note on European insurance, the bank said it expects flows in life insurance to remain positive and subsequently upgraded a slew of insurers, among them St. James’s Place and RSA Insurance , which jumped 3.8pc and 2.3pc, respectively. * Budget 2015: Insurers warn tax grab could lead to higher prices Elsewhere, shares in cell therapy company, ReNeuron , rose 17.9pc to 5.75p, after it raised £68.4m through a conditional placing - its largest round of funding undertaken to date - to support its core cell-based therapeutic programmes. \nFinally, Aim-listed Imaginatik (LSE: IMTK.L - news ) jumped by as much as 10pc yesterday morning, but closed only 3.3pc higher to 7.8p after Rob Terry, the former Quindell (LSE: QPP.L - news ) boss, upped his stake to 6.32pc through his investment vehicle Quob Park Estates. Mr Terry only declared his initial shareholding in the company late last month , and he has been steadily increasing his stake ever since.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T10:40:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
