"Illustration: John Shakespeare\nWith all the battles on her plate at the moment, billionairess Gina Rinehart might need some help to lower the temperature in the boardroom of her unconventional oil and gas operation, Lakes Oil.\nThe company reported on Wednesday that Armour Energy has issued it with a notice to remove Lakes executive chairman Rob Annells and fellow board member Barney Berold​ , in a shareholder meeting to be held in September.\nArmour, the plaything of mining entrepreneur Nick Mather , pips Rinehart as Lakes' biggest shareholder with a 19.99 per cent stake.\nRemoving Annells and Berold will remove virtually every board member not associated with Armour.\nAdvertisement Rinehart's man, Professor Ian Plimer , would be one of the few survivors.\nIt is not clear, at this stage, if Rinehart is friend or foe of the wiley Mather and his lieutenants.\nCBD wonders if Rinehart might help defuse things by recalling one of her former Lakes Oil representative with strong credentials at the diplomacy game: Our high commissioner to Britain, Alexander Downer .\nDowner was on the board as recently as last year, and he is still pictured in Lake's boardroom portrait alongside the warring directors.\nIt should be easy work for a man who was chief United Nations envoy to Cyprus.\nBig Mac They don't call it the fee factory for nothing.\nAn outpost of Nic Moore 's Macquarie Group empire, US-listed Macquarie Infrastructure Corp (MIC), has announced another bountiful harvest for the mother ship – a \"performance fee\" of $US135.6 million \"as a result outperformance by the company of its benchmark index over the second quarter of 2015\".\nImagine what Macquarie would have got if its management of the US infrastructure investor \"outperformed'' for the whole year.\nThe fee might have got pretty steep for a company with a market cap of $US6.6 billion.\nNot that MIC's management team – led by former Fairfax Media exec James Hooke – are going soft on Macquarie.\n\"The MIC board requested, and the manager agreed, that the payment of a portion of the fee be in cash rather than entirely reinvested in shares as means of minimising any dilutive impact of a share issuance to settle the full amount,\" said MIC.\nIt also reassured investors that Macquarie agreeing to this cash-and-scrip settlement did not represent a change in Macquarie's views on the value of MIC shares, which have risen sixfold in the past five years.\nMacquarie, which also heads the consortium that owns London utility Thames Water, also scored a big win with its \"super sewer\" project beneath the city's streets.\nA consortium led by German insurer Allianz has been selected as the preferred bidder for the £4.2 billion project to build a 7.2-metre-wide and 25-kilometre-long tunnel to reduce the tens of millions of tonnes of sewage that overflows into London's River Thames every year.\nDon't worry, Macquarie's crew will not be footing the bill, that's what Thames Water's customers are for.\nSenate grill Roger Sexton , the chairman IPO hopeful Beston Global Food, has jetted back into the country and assured CBD he is happy to front a Senate committee for the other company he chairs, the embattled finance shop IOOF.\n\"I have advised the Senate I will be pleased to accept the invitation,\" he said.\nThe parties are agreeing on a date as we speak.\nAccording to Sexton, the only reason he was not alongside IOOF chief executive Chris Kelaher at last week's Senate grilling was the meagre three days' notice.\nThis meant it clashed with pre-arranged travel plans for the Beston float.\nLost orbit Newsat's controversial boss, Adrian Ballantine , has found a sympathetic ear at News Corp to plead the case that the collapse of the would-be satellite operator was not his fault.\n\"Our shareholders have had a very rough time from the lenders,\" he told Rupert Murdoch 's troops.\nBallantine was not impressed with Fairfax Media's coverage of his alleged excesses and impropriety.\n\"I found it extraordinary that someone would suggest that I was having $10,000 dinners when I've never had one,\" Ballantine said.\n\"In terms of travel, most of my travelling life has been business class; occasionally, I will travel first class, usually on an upgrade.\"\nThere was no detail on how many times he travelled first class without the benefit of an upgrade – which would explain how the company spent about $1 million on travel in two years.\nMaybe we should ask former investor relations manager Kahina Koucha , who infamously posted snapshots on Instagram of the NewSat trips to New York, Washington, Paris, Dubai and London in first-class airline cabins, luxury hotels, with French champagne, and lavish dinners.\nAs she said on one of her posts: \"We travel in stylllleeee (sic).\"\nAnd the alleged dodgy dealings between NewSat and his company Cresta Motor Yachts?\n\"The non-disclosure of the related -transaction, you know what? I didn't even know that had to be done,\" he said.\nGot a tip? ckruger@fairfaxmedia.com.au", "external_links": ["http://www.lakesoil.com.au/index.php/directors"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:08:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
