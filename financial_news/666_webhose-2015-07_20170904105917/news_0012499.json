With mobile assets sailing worldwide, he believes that a disruption in one small country without major international market share \"is more like business as usual.\"\nLooking in the opposite direction, the Morgan Stanley analyst highlighted the fact that \"Greek\" shipping companies have relatively low exposure to Greek banks. Petrofin Research estimated that they owned about $10.8 billion in debt for the firms at the end of 2014, less than 17 percent of total bank loans to Greek shipping companies. Giannakoulis believes that figure has dipped further since.\nIn fact, the one significant impact that he thinks a Grexit could have on Greek shipping companies is a good one. The depression of domestic wages that would ensue under an economic collapse, he said, would reduce labor costs.\n[benzinga]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-06-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T23:30:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
