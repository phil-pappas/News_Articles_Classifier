Written by: Ellen Chang 07/08/15 - 11:33 AM EDT \nNEW YORK ( MainStreet ) — As hurricane season begins, consumers should start prepping by checking their current auto insurance coverage . \nAlthough the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30, will be below normal, coastal areas are still prone to flooding from storms, tornadoes and hurricanes. NOAA is predicting a 70% chance of 6 to 11 named storms with winds of 39 mph or higher, including three out of six which could become hurricanes. \n“A below-normal season doesn’t mean we’re off the hook,” said NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan. “As we’ve seen before, below-normal seasons can still produce catastrophic impacts to communities.” More Headlines How to Cope with Grief in the Workplace \nDrivers have two options when they purchase auto insurance to protect their vehicles. Collision only provides coverage for when a driver collides with another object or vehicle. \nComprehensive insurance, which is cheaper and often purchased by people with older cars, provides coverage for risks such as fire, theft, falling objects, hail, wind, vandalism, striking an animal and floods, said Bill Crowley, worldwide automobile claim manager for Chubb Insurance in Warren, N.J. \nThe most common weather-related claims are for hail, falling tree limbs and water damage. To avoid gaps in your coverage, drivers should aim to purchase both collision and comprehensive coverage, he said. \nOne frequent occurrence is a claim for water damage after the car has been driven into water that is “deep enough to severely damage the vehicle,” Crowley said. Although Chubb considers these losses under the \"comprehensive\" coverage, other insurance companies will consider these situations as falling under \"collision\" and see the water as an object, he said. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T19:23:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
