Vince Caligiuri by Ewin Hannan The Labor Party would seek in office to renegotiate the free trade agreement with China should the party be unsuccessful in forcing changes to the deal when it comes before federal parliament later this year.\nDelegates to the ALP national conference backed union demands for changes to the \"inferior\" trade agreement struck by the Abbott Government, calling on the Labor Party to pursue all parliamentary processes to \"remove the significant faults\" in the deal.\nShadow trade minister Penny Wong said on Friday that Trade Minister Andrew Robb had failed to negotiate a high quality agreement and the deal required greater safeguards to protect Australian jobs, including improved capacity for labour market testing and skills testing.\nShe said if Labor was not successful from the opposition benches in changing the agreement, she would pursue changes with China - if the ALP was returned to government at the next election.\nSenator Wong revealed to the Australian Financial Review last week that Labor would seek to tighten provisions of the trade agreement when it comes before Parliament. But the Beijing has warned it has the right to renegotiate elements of the trade agreement if any changes are made.\nConference delegates passed a motion committing a Labor government to reviewing Investor State Dispute Settlement clauses in existing agreements. The clauses grant an investor the right to use dispute settlement proceedings against a foreign government .\nThe resolution says Labor would \"seek to work with Australia's trading partners to remove these provisions'.\nBusiness groups said on Friday the union campaign against the agreement \"supported by the federal opposition\" threatened to damage Australia's relationship with its largest trading partner and \"inflict long term harm on our economic interests\".\n The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry , the National Farmers Federation and the Minerals Council of Australia accused Labor and the unions of \"grossly misrepresenting parts of the (China deal) and associated agreements to stoke community fear.\"\n\"These provisions simply provide China with the same treatment afforded other free trade partners, with all arrangements subject to Australia's existing temporary migration rules,\" they said.\n\"The claim that the trade deal will provide unfettered access to cheap Chinese labour is completely wrong. The full facts regarding the change to the status of workers from China make clear it is no cause for concern. The China FTA is a high-quality trade deal that will deliver new opportunities for small, medium and large Australian businesses in our most important market. That will deliver new job opportunities in all states and territories.\"\nSteve Ciobo, parliamentary secretary for trade, said on Friday that Labor leader Bill Shorten had initially supported the China agreement but was now a \"puppet on union strings dancing to their tune\".\nAustralian Manufacturing Workers Union national secretary Paul Bastian said the agreement was a \"sell out on jobs, and a sell out on workers and their safety\".\nConstruction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union national secretary Michael O'Connor said the unions campaign was \"not about trade, it was about stopping greedy bastards trying to steal Australian jobs\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T21:06:53.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
