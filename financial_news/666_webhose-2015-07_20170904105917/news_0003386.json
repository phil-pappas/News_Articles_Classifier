Photo: Sasha Woolley\nThe chief executives of non-conforming lender Pepper Group are hoping the banking regulator's crackdown on banks over investor loans will boost its growth in these borrowers as it heads for a $500 million float, with regulators so far imposing no such restrictions on Pepper.\nCo-chief executives Patrick Tuttle and Mike Culhane, who lodged the company's prospectus with ASIC on Friday afternoon, have commitments from cornerstone investors of $144.5 million prior to the float on the ASX due on July 31.\nThey confirmed that Pepper Group had not been subject to additional scrutiny by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission on its investor loan growth.\nThe banking regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, has instructed the major banks to ensure that growth in investor loans remains at or below 10 per cent, and has said it will work with ASIC, which has jurisdiction over the non-bank lenders, to monitor the issue.\nAdvertisement \"ASIC is our corporate regulator and we are part of regular thematic reviews by it. But we have had no specific reviews on investor lending,\" said Mr Tuttle.\n​In fact, he said the clampdown on banks is an opportunity for Pepper. Investors make up about 15 to 20 per cent of its mortgage loan book, which he said was \"underweight\" compared to the average of the banks which is between 30 and 40 per cent.\n\"We are not going to fill our boots with investor loans, but what's happening to the banks creates an opportunity for non banks like Pepper,\" he said.\nASIC likely hadn't focused on Pepper, he said, because they haven't seen much growth in that category.\nPepper will list 181.1 million shares at an offer price of $2.60, which is 10 times forecast pro forma calendar year net profit after tax of $47 million, a 34 per cent rise on its 2014 profit, and implying a market capitalisation of $471 million.\nIt is understood the original offer was 12 times NPAT, but market jitters over the ongoing Greek debt crisis and worries about asset bubbles in China led to the lower offer price.\nThe deal was done via cornerstone investors, understood to include around a dozen local and offshore investors including local funds Perpetual, Regal and Cadence.\nMr Tuttle and Mr Culhane said they were \"delighted\" with the result and had always targeted $145 million for the raising. \"We have been privately owned for 14 years and we view this as an opportunity to partner with high quality, long-term institutional investors,\" Mr Tuttle said.\n\"The rate of growth we have seen is such that the private shareholders are unable to keep up with the capital that we need to grow,\" added Mr Culhane.\nThe money raised will be used mainly to pay off $120 million in debt, which will be replaced by a new debt facility. The remainder will be banked for working capital.\nManagement are the biggest shareholders with 78.5 per cent of the company, which draws 52 per cent of its revenue from mortgage lending, asset financing and advice in Australia and 48 per cent from its international businesses, which largely involves fee income from loan servicing.\nIt has operations in Ireland, the UK, Spain, South Korea – where Pepper owns a small bank – and Hong Kong.\nNon-executive director Seumas Dawes owns just over 50 per cent. The management is not selling any shares and will be diluted to 45.4 per cent post float, with Mr Dawes buying into the float.\nOne fund manager who had decided against being a cornerstone investor said Pepper had excellent management, a good business model and was listing at the right price. However, he found it hard to evaluate the risks faced by the offshore businesses and questioned whether management would remain owners of the business.\nManagement can sell down 50 per cent of their shares at Pepper's interim 2016 results due in August next year and the rest at its 2016 annual results. But Mr Tuttle insisted they are all long term shareholders. \"We're not in any rush to sell,\" he said.\nAnother local small cap investor was \"very tempted\" and said it was a good price for such a high growth business. But he decided against buying into the float because he couldn't assess the risks in its South Korean arm. While it is only a small proportion of revenue, he said Pepper is now growing its lending there by $88 million a month and he is worried any provisioning for bad and doubtful loans could drag on profitability.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:41:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
