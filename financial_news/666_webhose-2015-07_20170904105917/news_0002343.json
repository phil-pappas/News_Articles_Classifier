Michel O'Sullivan Share on twitter by Misa Han The Senate probe into credit cards may not deliver lower interest rates, as a Treasury analysis finds the credit card market is competitive and it is up to consumers to shop around.\nThe ministerial briefing document, released under freedom of information laws, found the credit card market is \"no less competitive\" than other lending markets and consumers should look for the most competitive products, including low-rate cards and free balance transfer.\nThe document says the credit card market features around 100 credit card brands offering over 250 products and barriers to entry are relatively low, with non-bank providers now able to issue cards.\nWhile the big four banks control around 80 per cent of the credit card market, it reflects \"the concentration of the Australian banking system more generally\" rather than being a unique feature of the credit card market,says the document, which was created in March.\nThe findings have been revealed less than three weeks into the Labor-backed Senate inquiry into credit card rates.\nThe inquiry has been launched in June to tackle the \"disproportionately high\" credit card interest rates and fees, despite the banks' insistence that the credit card market is highly competitive and a Senate inquiry into interest rates on cards unnecessary given the amount of consumer choice . The Senate is accepting submissions until August and is due to report back by November 24.\nBanks have been facing intense scrutiny over why the credit card interest rates have not dropped in line with the official cash rate set by the Reserve Bank .\nBased on the Treasury analysis, rates on \"standard\" credit cards have remained around 20 per cent and \"low-rate\" cards around 13 per cent despite the 2.5-percentage-point drop in the cash rate since late 2011 to a record-low 2 per cent.\n But according to the Treasury, headline interest rates are \"not a particularly good metric for evaluating relative competitiveness across loan products\" because only a fraction of cardholders pay credit card interest at any point in time.\nIt also notes that the \"effective\" interest rate – the headline interest rate multiplied by the proportion of credit card balances accruing interest – has moved in line with bank funding costs, which have been increasing since the financial crisis as banks switched to more expensive deposit funding.\nTreasury says that while headline interest rates have not budged, fewer cardholders are now paying interest on card balances and there is more competition in discounted balance transfers.\n\"The outcome of this is that those cardholders that do pay interest on balances, and who have not taken up discounted balance transfer offers, have been left facing high rates,\" it says.\nThe department recommends the government put out \"public communications\" to promote the availability of more competitive products.\n\"In the government's public communications, there would also be value in highlighting the diversity of product offerings in the credit card market – including the availability of low-rate cards and free balance transfer offers – and encouraging consumers to actively pursue the most competitive offerings.\"\nIt also recommends the government fix competition in the household lending market more generally, rather than look at the credit card market in isolation.\n\"It is recommended the government emphasise that, in responding to the Murray inquiry, it will be addressing the issue of competition in the household lending market more generally.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/misahan"], "published": "2015-07-12T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T14:51:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
