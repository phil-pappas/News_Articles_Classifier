The move follows a notice served on July 3 to the Rajasthan Cricket Association president, asking Modi to appear before the Mumbai court within two weeks in connection with a case lodged under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. As Modi failed to reply before the July 22 deadline, the Enforcement Directorate served notice through email, which also remained ignored. On Saturday, Modi claimed he had not received any notice in the matter. \"As the ED has not yet served me the notice to appear, I will tomorrow (Sunday) share international process,\" Modi tweeted, and uploaded relevant forms for the purpose. However, Modi's lawyer Mehmood M. Abdi denied any knowledge of the ED move seeking a a non-bailable warrant against the former IPL chief, who is now in London.
