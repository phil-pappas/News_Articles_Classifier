So much for good start to our vacation.\" \nAnother traveller Oliver Weiss wrote: \"Not my day so far. Delayed flight due to Heathrow security alert and Blackberry (Swiss: BB.SW - news ) fails just before I manage to send lengthy email.\" \nThere was support for the protesters from some. Environmentalist and writer George Monbiot tweeted: \"The brave @planestupid protestors occupying a Heathrow runway are defending human life and the living world against greed and short-termism.\" \nBut Tory MP and deputy Commons leader Therese Coffey said: \"Let's hope the activists disrupting Heathrow are arrested and charged very quickly. Swift justice needed.\" \nPolice at the scene have used cutting equipment to remove the demonstrators. \nSix people have so far been arrested for aviation offences and taken into custody. \nSky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) 's Joe Tidy, who was at Heathrow as the protesters were taken away, said: \"Airport authorities parked a ring of trucks and snow ploughs around the makeshift pyramid presumably to block the view of protesters from the nearby road. \n\"Around a dozen police cars, vans and fire engines were at the scene to remove and detain the protesters. One protester dressed as a polar bear had to be taken off the top of the structure using a cherry picker.\" \nElla Gilbert, one of the activists on the runway, said: \"Building more runways goes against everything we're being told by scientists and experts on climate change. \n\"This would massively increase carbon emissions exactly when we need to massively reduce them, that's why we're here. \n\"We want to say sorry to anyone whose day we've ruined, and we're not saying that everybody who wants to fly is a bad person. \n\"It's those who fly frequently and unnecessarily who are driving the need for expansion, and we cannot keep ignoring the terrifying consequences of flying like there's no tomorrow. \n\"No ifs, no buts, no third runway. And we mean it.\" \nA video posted online showed several activists chained together and being spoken to by a police officer. \nThe officer told them: \"As a consequence of you being here, you are causing severe disruption and it will be in the millions of pounds because it will take us a while to remove you. \n\"The cost will be in the couple of millions. The airport will attempt to make a civil recovery.\" \nHe added: \"There are international flights now being diverted.\" \nEarlier this month a long-awaited report recommended that a new runway should be built at Heathrow rather than Gatwick. \nAfter three years of investigation, the Airports Commission said Heathrow was best placed to provide \"urgently required\" capacity, but environmentalists warned that building a new runway there will make it harder to reduce air pollution and climate change emissions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T12:07:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
