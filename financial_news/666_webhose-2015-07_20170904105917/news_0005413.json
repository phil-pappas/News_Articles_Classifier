Analysts attribute this to the substantial appreciation in the value of the cedi. \nOn government’s fiscal operations, the data shows that, efforts to march revenue with expenditure appear to be working because of progress being made in tax collections. \nTotal import bill as at May this year, stood at a little over 1 billion dollars, whiles on the export side, government earned just 963 million dollars. \nThe report also confirms of some shortfalls in supply of cedi on market, mainly due to efforts by the Bank of Ghana to mobilize money outside the banking system, whiles credit to businesses increase marginally. \nThe Bank of Ghana in the report puts the cedi’s appreciation from January to May at almost 10 percent, while the average interest rates is pegged at around 29 percent over the period of review. \nIndustry Non- Performing loans for commercial banks in the country has also reduced marginally. \nThe Bank of Ghana’s reserves as at May this year also stood at 4.8 billion dollars, representing a 300 million dollar decline from April. \nHowever this will account for about 2.9 months of import cover.
