The sides gave themselves at least until Friday to reach an agreement on the Iranian nuclear program, but a source from one of the powers said on Tuesday they had to wrap up in the next 48 hours.\n\"The decline in oil ended,\" said Stephen Massocca, Chief Investment Officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. \"Energy stocks bounced, and when that happened it helped the indices move higher.\"\nConcerns about China's economy and its sliding stock market have weighed recently on an already ravaged global commodity sector, with prices of copper, coal, natural gas and iron ore falling towards their 2015 lows.\nEuro zone leaders held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Tuesday and plan another on Sunday to approve a plan to aid Greece if creditor institutions are satisfied in the meantime with a Greek loan application and reform commitments.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she expected a formal loan request from Athens on Wednesday and more detail on how Greece would cooperate to make its economy more competitive on Thursday, in order to seek the approval of the German parliament to start negotiations.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average rose 93.33 points, or 0.53 percent, to end at 17,776.91.
