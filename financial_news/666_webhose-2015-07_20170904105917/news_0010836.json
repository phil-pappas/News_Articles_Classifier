I know that this is not enough, but that's what I could take and so I took it,\" said Dyonisia Zafiropoulou, a former employee of the national electricity company DEI. \nShe said she was convinved Greece could weather the financial crisis. \n\"I lived during the Occupation, I experienced hardship and I think we will overcome this moment,\" she told AFP. \nUnder banking restrictions imposed all week, ordinary Greeks can withdraw up to 60 euros a day for each credit or debit card -- but many of the elderly population do not have cards. \nAnother customer, a retired mariner who asked not to be named, told AFP he had no cash to buy crucial medicine for his sick wife. \n\"I worked for 50 years on the sea and now I am the beggar for 120 euros,\" he said. \n\"I took out 120 euros -- but I have no money for medication for my wife, who had an operation and is ill,\" he added. \nIn Greece's second biggest city, Thessaloniki, a group of about 200 pensioners held an angry protest outside the National Bank (NYSE: NBHC - news ) of Greece. \nRetired Greeks traditionally draw their pensions in cash from their local bank. \n\"Each month the money is paid normally -- but not this month,\" said a retired employee of the Bank of Piraeus.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T15:03:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
