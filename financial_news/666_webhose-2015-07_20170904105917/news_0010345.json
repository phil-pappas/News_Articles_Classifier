Shares rose when the company's results were released right after 4 pm ET, as Twitter reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings. \nBut its shares dropped sharply after the 5 pm start of a conference call with analysts, where Dorsey and Noto continually criticized the company's disorganized product execution and inability to provide new users reasons to sign up for the site. \nThey also said new product initiatives, such as instant timelines and improving the experience for those without Twitter accounts who visit the site, have not yet helped grow the audience. Twitter's user base grew at its slowest rate yet, adding only 2 million core users from last quarter. \n\"We have not communicated why people should use Twitter nor made easy for them to understand how to use Twitter,\" Noto said on the call. \nDorsey said the company would focus on more disciplined product execution, simplify the site and better communicate Twitter's purpose. He did not elaborate on how Twitter will carry out those changes. \nTwitter did not offer criticisms that have not been heard before, analysts said, but Dorsey and Noto's acknowledgement of the problems may mean they are more aggressively seeking solutions. \n\"They made those remarks … with full disclosure in mind,\" said Ken Sena, Evercore ISI analyst. \"They were giving investors a sense of the challenge.\" \n(Edited by Stephen R.
