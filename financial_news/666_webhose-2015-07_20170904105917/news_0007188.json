Wayne Taylor Share on twitter by Ruth Liew More Australian investors will return to sharemarkets to beef up ailing returns as the world economy settles into a low-interest environment for the foreseeable future, according to one of Australia's oldest and biggest listed investment companies.\nThe $6.8 billion Australian Foundation Investment Company believes low interest rates will be a \"feature of global markets for some time\", fuelling a search for sustainable yield among investors.\n\"When you have low interest rates, people are willing to take more risk and invest in stocks that have that sustainable income,\" Mr Barker said.\n\"Low interest rates are reflective of weak global economic growth... so from that point of view, you've got concerns about the medium- and long-term outlook but it provides a lot of support for [investing in] the stockmarket,\" said Ross Barker, AFIC managing director.\nAFIC held $163.8 million in cash at the end of June, and is preparing to ride through the expected volatility in markets marked by a slowing Chinese economy, troubles in Europe and adjustments in monetary policy settings by the Federal Reserve in the US.\n\"However the low interest rate environment in Australia is likely to provide underlying support to the market even if there are setbacks. AFIC has the financial resources to take advantage of any market adjustments should they occur,\" the LIC said in a statement.\nAFIC's portfolio returned 3.9 per cent for the year – failing to beat the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index's 5.7 per cent returns. The group posted a 15.5 per cent rise in net profits to $293.5 million for the year to June, and a 14.3 per cent improvement in revenue to $325.6 million.\nShareholders will receive a final dividend of 14¢ a share, which is the same payout as 2014.\n During the year, AFIC bought into biopharmaceutical group CSL and logistics company Asciano. The company participated in rights issues from National Australia Bank and energy company, AGL.\nAFIC also took part in the initial public offerings of companies such as Regis Healthcare and Healthscope to diversify the holdings in its portfolio.\nBanking giants Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corporation and National Australia Bank numbered among the LIC's top five holdings, with mining giant BHP Billiton and telecommunications group Telstra Corporation rounding up AFIC's biggest investments.\nMr Barker said LICs such as AFIC remained keen on IPOs to hit the market this new financial year, but companies needed to be realistic in their price expectations as investors exercise caution on where to dispense their cash.\nInsurance group Greenstone pulled its IPO in June after investors pored over the group's accounting in its prospectus.\n\"The market is reasonably buoyant so I believe that it's likely, yes, more companies would come to market,\" he said.\n\"It was a bit of a sell-off in June and that dampened a few people then – but if we get a bit of a bounce back in July and August, it will prompt people to participate again. But the price expectations need to be sensible.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Ruth_LiewAFR"], "published": "2015-07-20T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T12:03:20.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
