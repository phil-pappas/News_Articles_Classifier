Hence, similar policy coverage like this would be far more expensive if the employee would have to purchase it on his own. That is pretty much the reason that most employees choose to take a policy offered by the company even though they have an existing insurance policy. In this kind of insurance, it is the company that holds the original insurance policy, whereas the employee holds a proof of insurance. Just like the case with any other form of life insurance, you can choose a beneficiary towards your policy. The policy is kept valid until you are in services with the company, mainly because the policy is driven through the company and not that from an individual. You would also have the option of changing your group insurance policy into an individual policy when you leave your employer. In that case though, keep in mind that your conversion premiums would be higher as compared to policies for individuals. In most cases, people who not in a position to be insured in any other way take advantage of such a conversion facility. Either ways, it would be a benefit to the employee as an insurance of this sort would help him out in a trying situation. Since the insurance policy is provided from the company, it is almost always completely paid by the company as an employee benefit. In a few cases, it is a share between both the employee and the company. The premium amount would not be a very high amount, since it is providing for a larger volume; hence companies add it towards their employee benefit schemes. An insurance policy of this kind is normally in the form of a term insurance and hence, the policy premiums are usually paid via a renewable yearly payment. In other words, it is in the form of a renewable term insurance. The amount of coverage also varies from company to company as it is again linked to employee benefits, but in most cases it is in between your annual salary or twice that amount.
