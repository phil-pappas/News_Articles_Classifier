But now, in 2015, 5 billion seems like a distant memory. With more than 3.5 lac births per day, the current population has exceeded 7.3 billion. While 7.3 billion can be both a challenge and an opportunity with allegations regarding sustainability, urbanization and youth resources what future are we assuring to the 8 billionth baby who is just about a decade away?\nIn a way to create awareness on population norms and to build a strong foundation for a better future, MOODS Condoms – one of India’s leading condom brands with a strong international presence is all set to run a lively online campaign, on World Population Day 2015. In this globalized networked society, with social media becoming the key medium of communication among youth, Moods Condoms is rolling out its Facebook campaign with a pinch of fun and more awareness.\nPopulation hinders development and in order to emphasize the increasing population and issues relating to it, MOODS is bringing out an interesting video. Clearly depicting the current population pressure, Planet MOODS emphasizes the need for population control among the burgeoning youth.\nMOODS has sparked a conversation among the youth, a conversation that no longer regards sex as vulgar, taboo or the domain of any gender. The brand inspires the younger generation to act with respect when it comes to sex. MOODS with its range of condoms, lubes and deodorants are symbols of respect that a man has for his partner. “MOODS promises pleasure filled, memorable moments with your partner,” says Dr M. AYYAPPAN, Chairman and Managing Director, HLL Lifecare Limited, one of the largest manufacturers of condoms in the world, whose flagship brand is MOODS. Consequently, the premise of the campaign is one of mutual respect which translates to the line, MOODS #PlayItRight.\n 11, 2015 11:16 am", "external_links": ["http://cms.businesswireindia.com/images/pixel.gif"], "published": "2015-07-11T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:19:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
