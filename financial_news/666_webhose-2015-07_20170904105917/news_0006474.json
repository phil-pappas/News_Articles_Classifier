Man Group was also set for its best one-day gain since February 2014. \nMan Group's shares had fallen by around 10 percent over the last week, with global stock markets hit by worries over Greece's debt crisis and a sell-off in the Chinese stock market. \nA Man Group spokeswoman declined to comment when asked about the stock's rally on Thursday. \nDespite the gains, Man Group's shares remain down by around 5 percent since the start of 2015. \nMan Group issued a cautious outlook in May, which took some of the shine off the company's record funds under management levels. \nAccording to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, the majority of analysts have a \"hold\" rating on Man Group's shares, while a minority rate the stock as a \"buy\". \nMan Group's top shareholder is fellow hedge fund Odey Asset Management, with just over 6 percent, followed by TIAA-CREF with just over 4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.
