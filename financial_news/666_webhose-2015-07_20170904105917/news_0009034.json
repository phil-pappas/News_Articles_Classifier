We maintained our momentum despite ongoing market challenges' CEO Sergio Ermotti said in a statement. \nThe US department of Justice in May dropped charges against UBS as part of a probe into currency rigging granting it conditional immunity for cooperating with authorities. \nBut as part of its deal with US officials a 2012 non-prosecution agreement in connection with Libor interest rate manipulation was revoked. \nUBS agreed to plead guilty to one count of wire fraud in the Libor affair pay 203 million in fines and accept a three-year probation. \nBoth UBS and analysts had predicted that the fines would not have a meaningful impact on second quarter results. \nUBS had been fined the equivalent of 1.5 billion in 2012 by US British and Swiss regulators for its role in the massive misconduct in the setting of the Libor rate a global reference that affects products from student loans to mortgages. \nExecutives at the bank have blamed the misconduct in the Libor matter on an isolated number of employees. \nConcerning the rigging of the foreign exchange market six major global banks have been fined a total of almost 6 billion. \nThe Swiss bank on Monday said that as of June 30 it had 2.4 billion Swiss francs set aside as provisions to cover future litigation costs down from just over 2.7 billion Swiss francs at the end of March. \nBut its wealth management unit in the America's has been negatively impacted by higher litigation provisions the bank added. \nBut in a sign that the bank was moving past its legal and regulatory troubles UBS said its wealth management division posted its best second quarter results since 2009 with a pre-tax profit of 769 million Swiss francs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T09:45:34.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
