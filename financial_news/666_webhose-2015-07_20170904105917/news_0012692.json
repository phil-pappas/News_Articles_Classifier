Is this the death of the buy-to-let boom years? THE 20-YEAR boom in buy-to-let may be living on borrowed time following last week’s emergency Budget. PUBLISHED: 17:10, Sat, Jul 11, 2015 | UPDATED: 17:32, Sat, Jul 11, 2015 GETY/EPA The latest Budget could effect the buy-to-let boom \nChancellor George Osborne’s decision to scrap higher rate tax relief on buy-to-let mortgage interest repayments could cost some amateur landlords thousands of pounds a year. This may deter new investors and even force existing landlords to sell up and look elsewhere for a decent return on their money. So are we finally witnessing the death of buy-to-let? Since the first buy-to-let mortgage was launched in 1996, investing in bricks and mortar has thrashed almost every other investment, as buyers have benefited from a combination of rental income and capital growth from rising property prices. They also bagged juicy income tax relief of up to 45 per cent on their mortgage interest payments, relief unavailable to residential homeowners. Critics claim this gave them an unfair advantage over first-time buyers, effectively driving them out of the market. We could see a flood of buy-to-lets being sold as the squeezed middle bows out of the rental market Genevieve Moore, partner at chartered accountants Blick Rothenberg Buy-to-let lending soared nearly 20 per cent in the first quarter of this year, while lending to homeowners rose just 1.6 per cent, according to Equifax Touchstone. David Ramsden, research analyst at DTZ, says: “There has been a growing trend of first-time buyers being gazumped by buy-to-let landlords in much stronger financial positions.” Osborne’s decision to reduce progressively the maximum buy-to-let tax relief to 20 per cent from 2017 is aimed at levelling the playing field. It should also raise £665million for the Treasury in the 2020-21 tax year. Russell Quirk, founder of online estate agent eMoov, says this is bad news for landlords: “Based on average rent they could be up to £2,000 worse off each year.” The Chancellor has also scrapped the automatic right for landlords to claim 10 per cent of the rent on furnished properties against wear-and-tear costs. From April 2016, they will only be able to deduct costs they actually incur and must supply receipts. Many landlords will feel they are being scapegoated for the UK’s growing housing crisis. Older savers who bought one or two rental properties to top up their pension will be feeling particularly hard done by. Genevieve Moore, partner at chartered accountants Blick Rothenberg, says the Budget move will hit ordinary workers who had saved hard and invested in property to boost their income. She believes many will now give up on buy-to-let altogether: “We could see a flood of buy-to-lets being sold as the squeezed middle bows out of the rental market.” Brian Murphy, head of lending at the Mortgage Advice Bureau, says buy-to-let investors are being unfairly blamed for the housing crisis. “This can be remedied only by a large programme of housebuilding.” Osborne’s move could be seen as an attempt to take the heat out of an increasingly frenetic housing market. Earlier this month, the Bank of England’s Financial Stability Report warned that buy-to-let poses a threat as borrowers are investing too much and there could be a rush to sell in the next economic downswing, which would worsen house price falls. Others claim that buy-to-let, and the property market as a whole, will survive relatively unscathed. Russell Gardner, UK head of real estate at accountants EY, says cutting tax relief will only hit landlords who are also in the higher rate income tax bracket: “This may marginally dampen down buy-to-let as an investment proposition for the middle classes over time, but we doubt people will sell.
