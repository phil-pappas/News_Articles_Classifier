Grexit or no Grexit, euro or no euro, we have closure, at least for now. \nHad Greece exited the Eurozone, there would probably have been some more volatility in the markets. Greece’s economy would have gone from unproductive while wasting hard-earned European cash to unproductive without wasting hard-earned European cash (or even, perhaps, a lesson would be learned…). The new dawn of a Greece-less Eurozone would eventually take shape, and Europe can move on, no longer on the hook to funnel money into a bottomless pit. \nEither way, the uncertainty underpinning crypto markets was going to end. Once it became clear that the all-night haggling has bore fruit, bitcoin dropped by 8.5% to $281, wiping out most of its weekend gains. \nThe drop represents the third time in 2015 where bitcoin failed to tread water above $300 for much more than 24h, frustrating investors wondering when the much-awaited recovery will materialize. \nLitecoin, which had appeared to find some temporary support around $5.00, resumed its slide. It is currently trading at $4.30. With the combination of last week’s bubble and the Greece rescue, further losses are likely. \nAnother sign of pending volatility is the price disparity between trading venues. Prices on BTC-e are 2% lower than elsewhere, the gap ranging as high as 3.5%. \nMost other major coins are in the red by double digits. \nGold, whose gains throughout the crisis were unimpressive, fell to $1,155, challenging its lowest levels since 2010.
