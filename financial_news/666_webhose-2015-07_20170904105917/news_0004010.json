Notice that during the boom years from 2003 to 2007, real lending rates were much higher than they are now. Indeed, they were much higher in 2002 and 2003 as well, but that didn’t prevent the boom from happening. Note also that real lending rates were higher in the mid-1990s, when India had an investment boom.\nThe big difference between the boom years of the 2000s and now is the global and local growth outlook, which was buoyant at the time. In contrast, the consensus is that what we are seeing now is a painfully slow recovery. As a 10 July note from Kotak Economic Research put it, “In the current cycle, global demand buoyancy and corporate balance sheet space are missing. Hence, interest rate cuts can help at the margins but cannot catalyze revival. New investments will continue to be dictated by the government’s reform policies in banking and power, among others. Till then, we hope that the multiplier effects from government expenditure in roads, railways and other sectors feed into growth.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T14:35:24.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
