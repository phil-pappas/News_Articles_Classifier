In addition (traditional) brand names also also play an important role as they carry a certain guarantee of quality. There is also strong visible consumer loyalty to favourite and well-known brands within sanitary protection as the consumerâ€™s experience with the quality of the product is crucial when making a purchasing decision within this category. In addition surface (mainly its softness and permeability) and absorption capacity are other important factors when choosing a brand/product within sanitary protection. However despite their preference for quality Czech consumers also monitor prices within sanitary protection and thus quality branded products that are discounted were in demand the most at the end of the review period.\nFull Report Details at\n - \nCompetitive Landscape\nProcter & Gamble Czech Republic remained the clear leader within sanitary protection accounting for a 42% value share in 2014. The success of the company lies in its wide product range and wide brand portfolio within sanitary protection. Procter & Gamble is also the clear leader within pantyliners and towels and was ranked third in tampons in 2014. It offers four strong brands namely Always Naturella Discreet and Tampax which are well-known and well-established amongst Czech consumers thanks to their promotional support. The company has achieved its largest success through its Always brand which led sales of sanitary protection with a 24% value share in 2014.\nIndustry Prospects\nIt is expected that sanitary protection will see a stagnate performance in volume terms over the forecast period which is a better performance than was seen over the review period. Sales will be driven by the increased willingness of Czech consumers to spend their money due to the better economic situation and an anticipated increase in the consumption of pantyliners over the forecast period.\nReport Overview\nDiscover the latest market trends and uncover sources of future market growth for the Sanitary Protection industry in Czech Republic with research from Euromonitor's team of in-country analysts.\nFind hidden opportunities in the most current research data available understand competitive threats with our detailed market analysis and plan your corporate strategy with our expert qualitative analysis and growth projections.\nIf you're in the Sanitary Protection industry in Czech Republic our research will save you time and money while empowering you to make informed profitable decisions.\nThe Sanitary Protection in Czech Republic market research report includes:\n * Analysis of key supply-side and demand trends \n * Historic volumes and values company and brand market shares\n * Five year forecasts of market trends and market growth\n * Robust and transparent market research methodology conducted in-country\nOur market research reports answer questions such as:\n * What is the market size of Sanitary Protection in Czech Republic?\n * What are the major brands in Czech Republic?\n * What are the key new product launches in the sanitary protection market?\nReasons to Get this Report\n * Gain competitive intelligence about market leaders\n * Track key industry trends opportunities and threats\n * Inform your marketing brand strategy and market development sales and supply functions\nPartial Table of Contents:\nSANITARY PROTECTION IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC\nEuromonitor International\nJune 2015\nLIST OF CONTENTS AND TABLES\nHeadlines\nTrends\nCompetitive Landscape\nProspects\nCategory Data\nTable 1 Retail Sales of Sanitary Protection by Category: Value 2009-2014\nTable 2 Retail Sales of Sanitary Protection by Category: % Value Growth 2009-2014\nTable 3 Retail Sales of Tampons by Application Format: % Value 2009-2014\nTable 4 NBO Company Shares of Retail Sanitary Protection: % Value 2010-2014\nTable 5 LBN Brand Shares of Retail Sanitary Protection: % Value 2011-2014\nTable 6 Forecast Retail Sales of Sanitary Protection by Category: Value 2014-2019\nTable 7 Forecast Retail Sales of Sanitary Protection by Category: % Value Growth 2014-2019\nKimberly-Clark As in Tissue and Hygiene (czech Republic)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 1 Kimberly-Clark as: Key Facts\nCompany Background\nProduction\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 2 Kimberly-Clark as: Competitive Position 2014\nProcter & Gamble Czech Republic Sro in Tissue and Hygiene (czech Republic)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 3 Procter & Gamble Czech Republic sro: Key Facts\nCompany Background\nProduction\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 4 Procter & Gamble Czech Republic sro: Competitive Position 2014\nSCA Hygiene Products Sro in Tissue and Hygiene (czech Republic)\nStrategic Direction\nKey Facts\nSummary 5 SCA Hygiene Products sro: Key Facts\nCompany Background\nProduction\nCompetitive Positioning\nSummary 6 SCA Hygiene Products sro: Competitive Position 2014\nExecutive Summary\nDemand for Tissue and Hygiene Starts To Recover in 2014\nPrice Remains A Crucial Factor Within Tissue and Hygiene\nStrong Multinationals and Private Label Retailers Dominate Sales of Tissue and Hygiene\nHypermarkets Remains the Most Important Distribution Channel\nGood Prospects for Tissue and Hygiene\nKey Trends and Developments\nIncreased Willingness of Czechs To Spend Money\nDemographic Development and Changes in Lifestyle Remain Important Factors\nPrice Sensitivity of Czech Consumers Persists in 2014\nMarket Indicators\nTable 8 Birth Rates 2009-2014\nTable 9 Infant Population 2009-2014\nTable 10 Female Population by Age 2009-2014\nTable 11 Total Population by Age 2009-2014\nFull Table of Contents is available at:\n-- \nAbout Fast Market Research\nFast Market Research is a leading distributor of market research and business information.
