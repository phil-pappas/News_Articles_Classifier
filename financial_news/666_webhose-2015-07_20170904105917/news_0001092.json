Increasingly, they used borrowed money -- margin loans -- to buy stocks, which pushed prices even higher. \n\"Many investors seemed to think that they were staring at a lasting bull market and finally have an opportunity to capitalize on it after years of stagnant returns,\" said Denis Suslov, an analyst at research and consulting firm Kapronasia in Shanghai. \nIt all came crashing down last month. After surging 150% in one year, Chinese stocks plunged nearly 40% in a matter of weeks. The Chinese government was forced to step in and impose major trading restrictions to stop the free-fall in share prices. \nMust Read: The Fed Will Raise Interest Rates -- Are You Ready? Smart Moves to Make Now \nThe roller-coaster ride in China's market is similar in many ways to market frenzies in other countries, including the U.S. Still, the bubble has some unique Chinese characteristics and offers another reminder of the risks foreigners face when investing there. \nGambling is deeply embedded in Chinese culture. The Chinese have a passion for betting on anything and everything. \nMarket analysts say a thirst for quick money has extended beyond the casinos of Macau and Las Vegas and into investing. As a result, many Chinese view the stock market as just another way to play the odds and make a quick fortune. The safeguards common in other stock markets are missing here -- and there has been little concern among average investors for them. \nRule of law is also somewhat arbitrary. The government makes sudden changes in monetary policy on its own rather than through a parliament or public participation process. Health care costs are erratic, while annual inflation has varied from 1.26% to 6.58% over the past decade, adding to apprehension about financial stability. \nVirtually no one's assets were safe during the 1966 to 1976 Cultural Revolution, when youth groups bent on equalizing wealth in the name of Communism seized the assets of people believed to own more than average. Although much has changed in China since then, there was never a complete break between the government that stirred up that movement and the government in power today. \nAs wealth grew in China on the back of the booming economy, mainstream individual investors turned first to property speculation . But the government started imposing restrictions on real estate investing, so the Chinese turned to stocks about a year ago. \nThat started pushing up share prices. And the rapid gains just fueled even more buying with a me-too frenzy. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T14:04:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
