Photo by Professor Metze View all 20 photos \nDiane Tuckman was given a wonderful reception as she opened a new exhibition of her amazing artwork. In four years of covering her work the new and fresh ideas that she brings to her silk painting, sculpture, and photography is always an inspiration. Photo by Professor Metze \nArtists are a special blend of visionaries. They see things that others don’t. They create based on visions in their minds that others don’t. And that is why it is so important to see and reflect on the visions they create. Vincent Van Gogh was a genius. His paintings since his death on July 29, 1890, at the age of 37 from suicide. \nHe died after years of living a tortured life as he battled mental illness. Although in his lifetime he was frustrated that his artwork did not sell as well as he expect. However, after his death his works have sold for over a billion dollars. Yet, he cut off his ear in frustration in 1888, and shot himself in the chest with a hand gun in 1890 after years of creating some of the most beautiful art works the world has ever known; however, he was not appreciated for his genius in his lifetime. \nVincent Van Gogh did not know that after his death he would become the richest artist in history. Diane Tuckman is alive and although many people came out to appreciate her art work on July 9, 2015, she still has one request. “I want my artwork to be appreciated as fine art. It is fine art.” Her reference is the way those in the art world categorize her. \nAlthough she is an artist and photographer of the highest caliber, there are those who label her silk painting as a craft and not as fine art. Tuckman wants to change this image. Her fine art aficionados not only appreciate her; moreover, they feel that her artwork is such an incredible inspiration that it has changed their lives. \n“Silk art is an art form where you take an active part with the artist, the movement of the hand with the paint, you bring that paint to the silk then the fabric absorbs the paint and carries it as it goes along the fabric of the silk. The silk participates in the creation of the art. And I find that fascinating. So the artist has to let that go and allow the silk to participate in the making of the art. Silk art requires an artist who does not need to be in control, who can allow the art to grow and come and be who it wants to be,” the art lover said. \nThe very powerful statement on the work of Diane Tuckman comes from Susan Gunn. Being able to let go, not to control, a work of art or literature takes an artist with a sense of confidence in her work. It also takes a great dedication to fine art. Joan Van Blake also sees the genius in what Diane Tuckman creates. “I am always inspired by what Diane is able to do. She is able to take all those colors and combine them and then to put all those techniques into it and come up with beautiful pieces that you would love to wrap around you all the time,” Van Blake said. \nHaving been an aficionado of the work of Diane Tuckman for many years, Van Blake offers insight into Tuckman’s fine art from being both an art lover and longtime admirer of silk painting. “The thing about Diane and her silk painting is the way she combines colors that meld into each other. So when I think about Diane and the colors she uses and combines it inspires me to combine that same sort of thing. Actually Diane and I met around 2002 at the Montpelier Art Center. I was wearing a black and white quilted vest and she saw me. She commented on it. And then when she had a program with silk art at Montgomery College I helped her out there. And I got to know so much more about silk painting,” Van Blake said. \nAs people gathered around Artist Diane Tuckman from 6 pm until 10 pm on July 9, 2015, it was evident that her art work is very much appreciated by those who have attended her art exhibitions. “These people who of necessity had to devote most of their energies and attention to the importance of problems of existence did not neglect the aesthetic aspects of life. Evidence can be found everywhere of pronounced proclivities to artistic expression. Paintings, Sculptures, and carvings possess a delicate sensitivity and an appreciation of the beautiful that reflects a basic for the finer things of life, said John Hope Franklin on the importance of art. \nIf you have not attended an art gallery exhibition of Diane Tuckman artworks there is still time to see her fine art and to meet her. Unlike, Vincent Van Gogh, Diane Tuckman is alive and well. Her vibrant art and her warm and gentle personality can be experienced on August 10, 2015 at the closing reception of her current art exhibition at Joe’s Emporium in Mt. Rainier.
