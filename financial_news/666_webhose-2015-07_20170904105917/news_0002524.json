Rob Homer by Kyle Stock Ferrari is in a bit of a pickle as it prepares for an IPO .\nParent Fiat-Chrysler needs the cash and public investors will no doubt be keen on the shares, but Wall Street runs on growth. And growth is the kind of thing that can send a luxury brand like Ferrari spinning into a ditch.\nIn the IPO paperwork Fiat just filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company used the word \"exclusivity\" 64 times.\nIn short, if Ferraris are everywhere, they won't be worth nearly as much. Indeed, production has hovered somewhere around 7000 units for years and the company said manufacturing would creep up to only 9000 units by 2019.\nImagine how frustrating it would be for Apple to hit its massive expectations every quarter if it had to cap the number of iPhones it cranked out.\nThere are, however, some alternatives for Ferrari executives.\nThe IPO prospectus outlines four paths to more profit that don't involve more cars. If the Prancing Pony is going to survive on Wall Street, here's how it will have to do it:\n1. Lots and lots of swag Stamp it and sell it. There are 32 stores around the world selling a range of Ferrari licensed goods from surfboards ($US1389, $1887) to steering wheels ($US4550) and enough red leather to outfit a Fifty Shades of Grey- themed sex shop. Nine of the shops are owned by the company itself and then there's the web store, which boasts 400,000 registered shoppers. The best alternative to cranking out more $US480,000 super-cars, may be ramping up production on $US480 electric replicas for toddler drivers.\n2. Emerging markets Finding new territory has become a common way for luxury brands to sell more stuff without saturating markets. It's why Rolls-Royce opened a dealership in Vietnam last year. Ferrari has a lot of room to accelerate on this front. Most notably, only 9 per cent of its cars were shipped to China last year, even though many of its ultra-luxury rivals now sell almost one-third of their cars there.\n3. More exclusive models Ferrari recently collected somewhere around $US1.4 million for each of the 499 LaFerrari cars that it built and the speed-machine provided even better margins than standard models. It's a sweet bit of economic torque: low volume, high value. It's also a strategy that Ferrari can employ a little more often without making buyers feel that their limited-edition vehicles are somehow less special.\n4. Going bespoke Adding personalised touches to a Ferrari adds up. According to Thursday's IPO filing, adding an extra dash of carbon-fibre here and a cashmere arm-rest there adds, on average, 15 per cent to the price of a car. Ferrari calls it the \"tailor-made\" program and it's another page taken right out of the Rolls-Royce playbook. The more Ferraris that get the custom treatment, the more standard models the brand might be able to get away with making.\nBloomberg", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/luxury-sportscar-maker-ferrari-files-for-new-york-listing-20150723-gijeql.html"], "published": "2015-07-24T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:07:03.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
