Lake does “such a good job, that I’ve become unnecessary to be on all of them, and I can obviously go do other things.”\nLake, who is on the New York-based firm’s operating committee, is often mentioned as a possible successor for Dimon, who has said he wants to keep the top job another five years.\nDimon, 59, has made headlines for his outspoken opinions on regulators, competitors and economic policy. In an April 2012 conference call, the CEO dismissed reports that derivatives bets were distorting credit indexes, calling the controversy a “tempest in a teapot.” Those words came back to haunt him as that year’s losses from the so-called London Whale ballooned to $6.2 billion.\nAmong leaders of the five largest U.S. banks by assets, only Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein skips the quarterly call where analysts grill executives on results and guidance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T18:03:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
