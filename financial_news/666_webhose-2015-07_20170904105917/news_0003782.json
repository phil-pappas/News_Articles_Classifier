James Mooney Share on twitter by Phillip Coorey Premiers attending Wednesday's leaders retreat in Sydney will come armed with an independent report defending the distribution of GST revenue – just in case Western Australian Premier Colin Barnett tries to hijack the meeting with demands for a greater share for his home state.\nMr Barnett has previously refused to engage in GST negotiations – such as applying the tax to low-value imports bought online – until his state received a higher share of the GST revenue.\nAs a result of the royalties bounty from the mining boom, its share of the GST was set to fall from 38¢ in each dollar the state paid, to 30¢.\nWhile it will start increasing as the boom recedes, the federal government gave Western Australia a $500 million grant in May this year as an alternative to altering the funding formula, which is designed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission.\nMr Barnett has said he does not support lifting the GST to as high as 15 per cent, but is open to an increase to 12.5 per cent and he does support broadening the base. But he will also be pushing at the retreat changes to the funding formula as a condition of his support.\nExisting model promotes equity Anticipating such a push, South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill commissioned an analysis by Independent Economics, which defended the existing distribution model on the grounds it promoted equity.\n\"Higher natural endowments of mining resources and prime land provide a state with a clear fiscal advantage in collecting mining royalties, land tax and conveyancing duties,\" it said.\n \"Equalising for this fiscal advantage can be expected to promote both equity and efficiency. It promotes equity by making it possible for citizens of states with lower natural endowments to receive comparable government services and pay comparable taxes to citizens of states with higher natural endowments.\n\"It promotes efficiency by eliminating fiscally-induced migration caused by differences in natural endowments.\"\nThe report said the formula gives each state the same fiscal capacity to provide government services, meaning \"like individuals living in different states can be treated in the same way by the government\".\n﻿", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-21T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T18:49:57.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
