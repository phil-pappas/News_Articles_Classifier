HSBC is slashing close to 50,000 jobs - half of which will come from selling businesses in Brazil and Turkey, shutting down unprofitable units and shrinking the investment bank by a third. \nHis hiring is part of the bank's strategy to capture growth from Asian investors into Australia, HSBC said. \nBased in Sydney, Couzner will report to Jason Rynbeck, who oversees the bank's M&A offering in the Asia Pacific region, as well as Sean Henderson, head of capital financing in Australia.
