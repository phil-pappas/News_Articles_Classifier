It had shrunk 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter.\nThe private sector expanded 3.3 percent, slowing from 4.7 percent but staying robust as the retail and construction industries boomed.\nMonica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, said other recent data and a bullish mood in the private sector suggested first-quarter growth might well be revised higher.\nNevertheless, the kingdom may find it harder to sustain growth in coming quarters if oil prices stay below $70 a barrel.\nCheap oil has created a state budget deficit which the International Monetary Fund projects at 20 percent of GDP this year, equivalent to roughly $150 billion.\nSo far, the government has financed its spending -- including lavish handouts such as a two-month bonus payment for state employees to mark the accession of King Salman -- by drawing down foreign reserves at the central bank, which acts as a sovereign wealth fund.\nThis cannot continue indefinitely -- the central bank's net foreign assets have dropped $65 billion since August to $672 billion in May. The government may issue bonds, but economists also expect it to become more cautious about spending.\nMalik predicted the government would \"rationalise\" spending next year, continuing core economic development projects but trying to ease the burden by attracting private funding.\n\"Next year will probably see weaker growth,\" Malik said. \"We're unlikely to have the same growth in current government spending as this year.\"\nTuvey predicted GDP growth would slow to around 1.5 percent late this year and early next.\nThere are already some signs of spending cutbacks; state oil giant Saudi Aramco has curtailed some projects, while a plan to build 11 soccer stadiums around the country has largely been shelved, sources told Reuters last month.
