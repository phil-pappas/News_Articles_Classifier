EA produces many of them, including the annual “Madden NFL” franchise and the shooter game “Battlefield.” Motive will be based in Raymond’s home town of Montreal, sharing office space and collaborating with EA’s BioWare team, which is well known for the its “Mass Effect” franchise.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/07/13/ea-hires-former-assassins-creed-producer-to-run-two-studios/"], "published": "2015-07-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T05:03:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
