Their unity with other sections of society will signal the emergence of an important site of struggle.\" \nSimilarly, other theories say the MDC should ordinarily voice its disquiet in the forced evictions which threaten its urban powerbase. \nThe opposition, it is said, has risen into a formidable opposition to Zanu PF over the years through a protest campaign and finds political mileage in the vendors saga, itself a microcosm of a failed system.
