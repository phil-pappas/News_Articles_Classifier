He added ahead of her remarks that gold was \"vulnerable.\" Independent trader and publisher of elliottwavetrader.net Avi Gilburt said that although he was expecting a downside for gold, there is potential for a whipsaw upside move from this region as long as the market remains above $109. \nMust Read: 10 Stocks Carl Icahn Is Buying \n\"[B]elow 109, my target [is] 105 next. But, the correction is not done. We will be seeing lower levels, even if we get a whipsaw move up,\" he said. \n\"As long as the U.S. Dollar Index holds at 95.50, we are setting up to attack the 100-101.50 region next,\" he added. \"Ultimately, the dollar has higher to go. I am only questioning whether more consolidation will be seen before we reach the bigger 103 region target next.\" \nButton's comments on the dollar mirrored Gilburt's as he expects the greenback to move higher. \n\"I think the dollar is poised for an impressive run,\" Button said, adding that the U.S. dollar hit fresh highs against the Canadian, New Zealand and Australian dollar today, and it is only a matter of time before the yen and euro follow . \nOne market veteran agreed that the dollar will continue to rise, and looking at gold shares on a longer term basis, he added that gold investors are trading in a completely different market environment than they were back 2010. \n\"Five years ago, cash was king in most investors' minds,\" said George Gero, vice president and precious-metals strategist with RBC Capital Markets Global Futures. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T09:56:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
