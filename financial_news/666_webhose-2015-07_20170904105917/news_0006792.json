Share on twitter by Kate Cowling Self-managed super fund investors are increasingly handing over the reins to advisers in the midst of low cash rates and barriers to other defensive asset classes, a report shows.\nDespite carrying the label of \"DIY investors\", a growing cohort are relinquishing the control element â€“ which has been heavily marketed as a key tenet of self-managed super funds.\nThey are outsourcing part or all of the investment decision-making process to professionals, like financial planners and accountants, according to research by the SMSF Association and nabtrade.\nThe proportion of funds outsourcing their investments has more than doubled from 7.3 per cent in 2012 to 15 per cent in 2014, the research shows.\nMeanwhile, those seeking advice on how to invest from advisers has dropped from 54 per cent to 46 per cent.\nThe segment of self-managed fund investors who make their investment decision alone has stayed fairly static at just below 40 per cent.\nWhile most selfies still follow their own research process when deciding how to invest, the trend over three years shows the appetite for advice is on the rise.\nIn 2012, more than 61 per cent made their own calls when it came to asset allocation. That number now sits at 51 per cent.\n On the advice side, 39 per cent said they made their asset allocation decisions based on instruction from advisers last year, compared to 30 per cent in 2012.\nPart of the reason for the shift, according to the research, is the desire for advice around how to invest when cash rates are low.\nMore than two in five hold more than 10 per cent of their portfolio in cash, compared to around a third in 2013, with the key reason being they are \"waiting for a better investment option\".\nSwitch to alternative assets But the low cash rate is also driving reallocation to Australian equities and other non-traditional asset classes, with 49 per cent looking to alternatives to push up returns.\n\"There's a significant amount of interest in other investment opportunities. International equities is one, bonds and also infrastructure, which is one of the only things closed to one of the largest untapped sources of money in Australia,\" SMSFA chief executive Andrea Slattery said.\nShe said the SMSF Association is lobbying for the removal of entry barriers to infrastructure investment.\n\"This piece of research is showing loud and clear that there's a drop in Australian equities slightly, but a significant increase in commercial property and other areas, but particularly in bonds and international equities.\"\nBonds could be a major recipient of self-managed super fund investments, with 37 per cent investigating the opportunities in the fixed income market, compared to 19 per cent in 2012.\nThe proportion exploring global equities has grown at a similar rate, from 18 per cent in 2012 to 36.5 per cent last year.\nMs Slattery made the point that self-managed super fund holders are savvy investors and typically around 90 days ahead of the market in their decisions.\nAustralian equities exposure has grown from 37 per cent in 2012 to 43 per cent in 2014, the research showed.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kate_cowling"], "published": "2015-07-27T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T11:09:16.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
