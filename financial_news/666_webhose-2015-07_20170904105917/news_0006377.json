Jacky Ghossein by Katie Walsh Mercedes Ruehl From surrounding buildings, the glass mecca and sustainable pin-up that is One Bligh Street in Sydney looks just as striking as on the day of completion.\nAnd peering into some of the floors, it looks just as empty.\nClayton Utz, the building's key tenant and among the nation's biggest law firms, plans to sub-lease one of its levels in a bid to hive off unused space. It marks the third of its 15 floors that it has withdrawn from since it moved into the landmark five-star energy rated building in mid-2011: it handed two floors back to the lessor about a year ago.\nThe post-global financial crisis growth hoped for in the legal market has failed to eventuate and the reality for traditional top tier firms is contraction in size.\nClayton Utz is among the top tier firms that have dropped below the 200 partner mark in the past few years. In the latest AFR Partnership Survey , it took third spot with 178 partners.\nAdded to its woes in its original move was the departure of 14 partners to new entrant Allen & Overy in 2010, when the ink had already dried on plans for the space. Allen & Overy has since lost half of its original Sydney-based partners including David Wilkie and Sonia Goumenis who returned to Clayton Utz . Chris Robertson was the latest to go, defecting to King & Wood Mallesons this month.\nIts Sydney office houses 653 staff; down from 794 when it took tenancy at One Bligh Street. The reduction is largely due to natural attrition - just 4 per cent is due to redundancies.\nBest revenue growth in years Despite the downsizing, it is understood that Clayton Utz has had one of its best revenue growth performances in years and the office re-jig is intended to better use space.\nThe legal profession is rife with office shifts.\nRival firm Ashurst, which is down to 153 partners, will move this weekend from Grosvenor Place to the old \"Moneybox\" at 5 Martin Place: a homage to all things art deco and a marriage of modern and heritage that envelopes visitors in marble, with the odd brass embellishment.\nFormer home of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the old Prime Minister's office from the bank's public institution days remains intact – apart from a missing wall-bed, originally installed on expectations the occupants would work long hours. The firm has exclusive use of an open-air rooftop terrace, offering vast cityscape views that are a fair swap for its old harbour sites.\nPartners are keeping offices; unlike plans for the Barangaroo offices that will house Gilbert + Tobin next year . G+T managing partner Danny Gilbert said that \"flexibility and agility … must apply to every single person in the firm\".\nClifford Chance is openly looking for a new home in Sydney, its Sydney managing partner Mark Pistilli said that the firm is \"bursting at the seams\". It has taken an extra floor in its Perth site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:38:25.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
