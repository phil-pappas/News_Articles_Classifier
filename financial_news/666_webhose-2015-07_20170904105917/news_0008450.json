The FT and Germany's Der (Shenzhen: 002631.SZ - news ) Spiegel said the buyer was German media group Axel Springer. \nRecent media reports had suggested potential buyers could include Axel Springer, Thomson Reuters (Dusseldorf: TOC.DU - news ) and Bloomberg. \nIf concluded, the deal would bring an end to years of speculation as to whether the 171-year-old Pearson would sell the FT, a so-called \"trophy asset\" which was first printed on pink paper in 1893 in order to stand out from rival titles. \nMarjorie Scardino, who ran Pearson for 16 years, once said the FT would be sold \"over my dead body\". But a sale was seen more likely when John Fallon, who had no publishing experience, took over the top job in 2013. \nRecent media reports from other news organisations have put the price tag as high as 1 billion pounds but analysts believe that is too high. \nTROPHY ASSET \nWhile the FT has done a better job than most in adapting to the digital revolution, helped by a loyal customer base who will pay for access to the newspaper and website, analysts are not convinced it makes much of a profit. \nPearson does not break out the financial details of the newspapers. \n\"They've done a good job - probably better than anybody else from a UK newspaper perspective - in terms of transitioning to a model online, so I think you can see why that is attractive,\" said one analyst, who asked not to be named. \nFull-year results for 2014 showed the FT increased its circulation by 10 percent to a record high of nearly 720,000 in print and online. More than 500,000 were digital subscriptions, representing 70 percent of the FT's total paying readers. \nPearson, founded in 1844 as a small building firm in Yorkshire, northern England, was once one of the world's largest building contractors and has had a long list of varied interests from banking and publishing to owning theme parks and Madame Tussaud's waxworks. \nIt bought the FT in 1957. \nThe group though has moved to focus solely on education and has sold off other news interests such as Mergermarket Group and a company which included French business newspaper Les Echos in recent years. In 2012 it merged its Penguin book division with Random House. \nIt has endured a tough time of late, with weaker demand in the North American education arm. Analyst Ian Whittaker said Pearson would likely use any proceeds to pay down debt. \n\"If they could obtain a trophy asset price then it could look pretty good against the relatively modest profits that the FT generates,\" said Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at AXA Investment Managers, a shareholder in Pearson. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Pearson, which is due to report results on Friday, were up 2.2 percent in mid-morning trading. \n(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle, Sarah Young and Neil Maidment in London, Jennifer Saba in New York, Klaus Lauer and Erik Kirschbaum.; editing by William Schomberg and Giles Elgood)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:09:00.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
