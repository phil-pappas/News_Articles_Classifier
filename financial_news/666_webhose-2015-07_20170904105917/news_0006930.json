These include giving priority to those problems for which they have ready-made solutions; inflexibility, especially in the supply of personnel services; and excessive emphasis on installing new IT systems, which are frequently over-designed or otherwise locally inappropriate. \nFacilitating South-South Cooperation and supporting mentoring \nThe briefing also highlights growing South-South cooperation and how donors can support this. First, through 'triangular cooperation': whereby a richer nation provides the finance for a middle-income country to support tax capacity building in a poorer country. Second, donors could establish an independent fund devoted to financing South-South cooperation on a demand-led basis. \nMentoring is also key, as demonstrated by the example of Norwegian Tax Administration staff providing support to the Zambia Revenue Authority, working jointly with them, on specific problems and audit cases, and helping them to learn by doing. The briefing authors argue that this should be a large and growing component of capacity building support in the revenue field as it directly addresses the problem of internal scarcity of advanced professional skills in areas like accounting, IT and auditing. \nLooking beyond tax administrations \nFinally, the analysis suggests that donors need to look beyond their normal focus on the organisations that actually assess and collect taxes to other important institutions, including the legislative and court systems and tax policy units within ministries of finance. Donors seeking to improve tax capacity should start with an open mind about the organisations they might support. Measures to inform and empower parliamentarians, parliamentary committees and voters over taxation issues might also be an effective route to building sustainable long-term revenue collection capacity.
