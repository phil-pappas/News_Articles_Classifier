It is now time for the Executive to face the reality of the financial context and agree a way forward on the local implementation of welfare reform, protecting the most vulnerable without crippling public services. \n“We have an unsustainable budget position for 2015-16 and we must press ahead with the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement to ensure the delivery of public services to those who need them most. \n“While I welcome the reduction in the pace of welfare reform I have reservations that the changes to working tax credits have the potential to impact negatively on people entering the workplace.” \nArlene Foster concluded: “Despite the promising growth within the UK and local economy as a whole, the outlook for 2015-16 and beyond will continue to be challenging for public sector finances.” \nThere were a number of specific decisions taken by the Chancellor which will have an impact for many people in Northern Ireland. These included: Vehicle Excise Duty – Reform of Vehicle Excise Duty designed to target more expensive vehicles with the proceeds to support a roads fund in England. Engagement with devolved administrations on a similar scheme will take place. Fuel Duty – Fuel duty will remain frozen this year. Annual Investment Allowance – will be set at £200,000. Corporation Tax – The Dividend Tax System is to be reformed and Corporation Tax is to fall to 19% in 2017 and 18% in 2020. Welfare - £12 billion is to be found in the welfare system. This includes a number of changes that will have an impact on the welfare reform issue in Northern Ireland. Tax Free Personal Allowance – This will be raised to £11,000 next year. Tax Lock - There will be no changes in the main rates of income tax, National Insurance or VAT. Income Tax - In future, those working 30 hours a week on the National Minimum Wage will not pay income tax and the higher rate of tax will increase to £43,000 in 2016-17 National Living Wage – To be set at £7.20 in April 2016, to rise to £9 per hour by 2020. National Insurance Contributions – Small firms will be able to employ 4 people without having to pay National Insurance from 2016.
