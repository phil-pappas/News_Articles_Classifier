Polls suggest the 'Yes' and 'No' camps are neck-and-neck. \nTsipras's flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has accused Athens's creditors of \"terrorism\" for raising fears of a Greece exit from the eurozone -- a 'Grexit'. He and Tsipras point out that no legal mechanism exists to make it drop what is meant to be an \"irreversible\" monetary union. \nUnder clear sunny skies, young and old voters queued to have their say in schools and university buildings transformed into polling stations. Voting was to close at 7:00pm (1600 GMT), with results expected a couple of hours later. \nDimitris Halatsis, a teacher, said it was \"a crucial day\" and he was voting 'No' because \"it's the only chance the government and Greece have to apply pressure\" on the creditors. \n- 'Better for the country' - \nMichelis, an 80-year-old first through the doors of an elementary school being used for the vote in central Athens, said he too was saying 'No' \"because they (the creditors) will take us more seriously\". \nTheodora, 61, a retired journalist, said she was voting 'Yes' because \"it's a 'Yes' to the European Union\". \nIn the largely middle-class Pangrati neighbourhood, voter turnout was high, with even the very elderly making their way determinedly up a flight of forty steps to reach polling booths inside a school. \nSumming up the uncertainty felt by many Greeks, 56-year old Katerina had still not made up her mind which way to vote, even as she collected her ballot paper. \n\"It is very confusing, it's very hard, not at all easy to decide,\" she said, admitting that she had voted to elect Tsipras but was disappointed by his failure to strike a deal with the country's creditors. \n- Run on food - \nGreece was officially declared in default on Friday by the European Financial Stability Facility, which holds 144.6 billion euros ($160 billion) of Greek loans, days after becoming the first developed country to miss a debt payment to the IMF to the tune of 1.5 billion euros. \nAusterity-plagued Greeks were squeezed yet further this week after the government, scrabbling to stay afloat, imposed the credit controls. \nThe banks' liquidity was expected to dry up entirely in days unless the European Central Bank (ECB) -- a major creditor -- injected funds quickly. \nSupermarket shelves have been emptied in the days leading up to the referendum and imports of medicines have been affected by the controls, which prevent money transfers abroad. \n\"Most people are buying food now because they fear the worst,\" said Andreas Koutras, a 51-year-old Greek woman who works in finance in the capital. \nThe referendum is seen as so crucial that some Greeks living outside the country made the trip back to vote as no provisions had been made to permit ballots in embassies for the hastily called poll. \nBut financial analysts said they doubted a result either way would greatly change things. Many said they expected negotiations would resume in either case, though a 'No' could hasten a Grexit. \nSome of the world's top economists, however, said Greece's least-bad choice was to vote 'No,' accept a painful exit from the euro and claw its way back to economic stability through a devalued national currency. \n\"A 'No' vote would at least open the possibility that Greece... might grasp its destiny in its own hands\" and shape a future that \"though perhaps not as prosperous as the past, is far more hopeful than the unconscionable torture of the present,\" wrote Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics and professor at Columbia University in the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T13:09:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
