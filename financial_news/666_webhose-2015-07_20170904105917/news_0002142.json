Mohammed || The Economy Times \nDue to the precipitous depreciation in value of the Ghanaian local currency, the cedi, against all the major trading currencies (US dollar, euro and the pounds sterling) in recent years, there has been the dire need for effective and sustainable measures to help salvage the situation. \nThis has arisen out of several proposals and initiatives from some financial analysts and economists on how to fix the depreciating of the cedi, a major cause of the current economic crisis of the country. \nThe government has had hard times in the midst of the situation which forced it organize a forum (Senchi Forum) last year, drawing many known financial and development administration experts, economists and the private sector players to produce a home-based initiatives and policies (Senchi Consensus) to manage the devastating economic situation in the country. \nIn addition to already adopted measures by the government that is appreciating the cedi against the other foreign currencies in recent days, the Bank of Ghana with directives from the Ministry of Finance will now open its two-year domestic bond auctions to foreign investors this month. \nThis is to help attract more offshore funds and reduce the countryâ€™s heavily burdened borrowing costs. \nThe central bank is expected to announce the move officially this week. \nUntil now offshore investors have been only allowed to buy medium- and long-term government securities that have maturities of three years and above. \n\"We now have modalities in place to allow foreign investors to participate in our two-year auctions in line with the government's new debt management policy,\" confirmed a senior government official. \n\"The process should kick in later this month and it is intended to draw in more offshore funds and boost liquidity flows,\" said the senior official, who declined to be named. \nThis, according to financial analysts, could support the cedi currency, which fell 22 percent in the first half of this year and has only begun to recover due to adopted measures of the central bank to increase the interbank dollar sales from US$14 million a week to US$ 20 million a day. \nIn past few years, the country has been saddled with high public debt due in part to its reliance on costly domestic borrowing, a phenomenon that has raised concerns that it has entered a debt crisis. \nHowever, Ghana expects to receive up to US$4 billion in donor funds and loans during the second half of the year and this would significantly help to boost the country's reserves in support of the cedi. \nThe government also plans to introduce the concept of Book Runners to arrange domestic bond auctions occasionally to rally local participation with the aim of gradually driving down yields, a source close to the discussions told Reuters last week. \nGhana, which exports cocoa, oil and gold, has begun a three-year aid program with the International Monetary Fund to support its economy, dogged by slowing growth, a stubbornly high budget deficit and widening public debt. \nIts benchmark 91-day treasury bill attracted a yield of 25.1801 percent last week Friday, compared to 8.165 percent for a similar paper in Kenya.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:30:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
