Earnings in downstream more than doubled to $1.5 billion, while profits in chemicals rose 48.1 percent to $1.2 billion. \nAt Chevron, the upstream business suffered a loss of $2.2 billion following a large writedown on assets and charges related to project suspensions. This drag was partially offset by surging earnings in the downstream business. \nIn response to lower crude prices, oil companies have cut back on drilling, with ExxonMobil spending 12.5 percent less through the first half of 2015 at $16 billion compared with the 2014 period. \nOn Thursday, smaller US rival ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP - news ) announced it would cut its 2015 capital budget for the third time in eight months as it reported a loss of $179 million in the second quarter. \n\"We continue to deliver on our operational milestones while positioning the company for a period of lower, more volatile prices,\" said ConocoPhillips chief executive Ryan Lance. \nThe industry is also turning to job cuts. \nChevron said Friday that it was trimming 1,500 jobs, citing business pressures \"in light of the current market environment.\" On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell (Xetra: R6C1.DE - news ) , announced plans to slash its headcount by 6,500. \nThe downturn has also raised speculation that oil majors might cut their dividend, a route taken by US shale producer Chesapeake Energy (Other OTC: CHKDJ - news ) . \nA note from 24/7 Wall Street Friday questioned whether Chevron would be able to maintain its divided \"with such poor earnings.\" \nCredit Suisse (NYSE: CS - news ) , in a note previewing earnings, also spotlighted Chevron as a potential concern, but said the oil giant \"has the balance sheet to get to the other side\" of the industry downturn if it successfully ramps up a pair of major projects in Australia. \nIn morning trade, Chevron was down 4.3 percent at $89.07, while ExxonMobil stood at $79.38, down 4.4 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T23:16:04.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
