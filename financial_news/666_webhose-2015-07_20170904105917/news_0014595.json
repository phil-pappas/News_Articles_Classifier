Up to Thursday's close, the stock had fallen nearly 12 percent this year.($1 = C$1.30) (Reporting by Sneha Banerjee in Bengaluru and Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Ted Kerr )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T15:30:48.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
