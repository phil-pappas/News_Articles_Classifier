Photo: Reuters\nThere's no such thing as a typical Uber driver, the company said in a bid to fend off a group lawsuit seeking to elevate its staff from independent contractors to employees.\nUber Technologies is fighting a threat to its business model from drivers who want a guaranteed minimum wage, compensation for mileage and the right to pay into Social Security. How Uber's case plays out may help define the future of Internet-enabled companies that depend on casual labor to provide services from home cleaning to food delivery, and even helicopter trips.\nThe reality is that drivers use Uber on their own terms: they control their use of the app. It's why there's no typical driver.\nUber company statement The San Francisco on-demand ride sharing company is relying on the same lawyer who helped Wal-Mart Stores in 2011 defeat a class-action case brought on behalf of a million female workers. Just as attorney Ted Boutrous argued before the US Supreme Court in the retailer's case, he says it's bogus to assume the employment conditions for more than 100,000 Uber drivers in California are governed by common corporate practices.\nUber's argument is at odds with a ruling by California's labor commissioner last month that a driver who connects with customers through the company's app must be considered an employee. Uber, along with rivals Lyft and Sidecar Technologies, uses a model throughout the US that provides drivers with mobile-phone applications to pick up riders.\nTo respond to the handful of drivers who filed their lawsuit two years ago, Uber said in a court filing Thursday it has collected testimonials from 400 drivers who agreed to different ground rules and expectations when they signed up for the ride-hailing service.

The reality, however, is that defendants are involved in every aspect of the operation.\"\nUber has said it's appealing the decision.\nWhile the state agency's finding applies to only one driver, it may be influential in how courts rule on the contractor-employee dispute in cases affecting drivers statewide.\nA hearing on the Uber drivers' bid for class-action status is set for August 6 before US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco. Lyft faces a similar lawsuit before a different judge in the same court.\nBoth judges rejected early requests by the companies to dismiss the complaints, saying the legal questions would need to be resolved at jury trials. Class-action cases allow plaintiffs to pool resources and give them more leverage to negotiate settlements.\nBloomberg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:40:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
