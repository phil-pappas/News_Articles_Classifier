The grocer said that all of its pharmacies would be rebranded as LloydsPharmacy and 2,500 of the grocer's staff would be transferred to Celesio. \nSainsbury's, which this week reclaimed its title of Britain's second biggest supermarket, said that the deal would allow customers to \"benefit from an enhanced pharmacy service delivered from Sainsbury's stores\". \nMike Coupe , Sainsbury's chief executive, said: “Pharmacy services are incredibly popular with Sainsbury’s customers and we are delighted to be teaming up with LloydsPharmacy to develop our offer. \n\"Working together with a specialist operator like LloydsPharmacy will enable us to grow and extend our pharmacy services to customers, whilst realising value for shareholders today from the pharmacy business we have grown organically over the last 20 years.” \nLloyds has more than 1,600 stores in the UK \nLloyds is the second biggest pharmacy chain in the UK after Alliance Boots with more than 1,600 stores. \n“We are extremely pleased to be working with Sainsbury’s and look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to the LloydsPharmacy and Celesio family,\" said Marc Owen, chairman of the management board of Celesio. \n\"This is a very important milestone for us as we continue to invest in LloydsPharmacy and our collaboration with Sainsbury's will help to improve the health and wellness of our mutual customers.” \nLloyds missed out last year on the Co-operative Group's sale of 700 pharmacies to private cash-and-carry business Bestway (Shenzhen: 300008.SZ - news ) . Lloyds had battled it out with private equity firm Carlyle, the owner of the RAC (Taiwan OTC: 2237.TWO - news ) , to clinch a deal but lost out in a £620m deal to Bestway, which is run by Asian tycoon Sir Anwar Pervez . \nLloyds failed in a bidding war last year for the Co-op's pharmacies \nIt was thought at the time that the Co-op opted to sell the chain of pharmacies to Bestway to avoid inevitable job cuts that would come with selling to a rival or hitting regulatory hurdles. \nSainsbury's sale of pharmacies to Lloyds will also need regulatory approval and is expected to complete next February. \nLLoyds also competes with Superdrug, which has pharmacies in roughly one in four of its 800 stores and Rowlands, which owns more than 500 chemists. \nLast January, US drugs wholesaler McKesson failed in its $8.6bn takeover bid for Celesio following bitter resistance from Elliott Associates, the activist hedge fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:13:28.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
