He wants 'maximum plaid' speed as well. Bloomberg by Hannah Elliott On Friday Tesla mastermind Elon Musk announced a new \"Ludicrous Mode\" for his electric Model S sedan and the upcoming Model X SUV.\nHe promised that the new mode-a $US10,000 option-would push the car to 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds. He said it will get the SUV to 60mph in 3.3 seconds. That's serious speed, on par with supercars that are exponentially more expensive. If Musk can pull this off, it'll shoot him into the same stratosphere as Bugatti and Koenigsegg.\nWhat's more, Musk said he'll launch an all-new Roadster in four years. That one will have a \"maximum plaid\" speed mode-a reference to the cult favourite movie, Spaceballs. Who knows what max plaid is, but it sounds nuts.\nSo how does Telsa stack up against other top high-speed cars in the world, both in terms of 0-60 and price tag?\nTesla wants its Model S to compete with Bugatti and Lamborghini on speed.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-19T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T03:04:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
