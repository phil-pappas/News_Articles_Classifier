Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Michael Bleby Housing approvals fell at their fastest pace in almost a year in June, as local authorities signed off on fewer apartments, the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show.\nThe total of 17,868 marked an 8.2 per cent decline from May's 19458 and was the biggest decline since September last year, when the total dropped 12.8 per cent, in seasonally adjusted terms.\nApprovals of townhouses, semi-detached and apartments - which are volatile as the timing of individual projects can skew the overall picture - slipped 19.5 per cent to 8,105 from 10,070 in May.\nStandalone houses, meanwhile, increased 4 per cent to 9,763 in June from 9,388.\nAustralia will reach a net surplus of dwellings by 2018, consultancy BIS Shrapnel said last week, with Melbourne and Brisbane producing too many homes and Sydney still suffering from an undersupply. Others, such as MacroPlan Dimasi say continued population growth will continue to drive demand in cities outside Sydney.\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/+MichaelBleby/posts", "https://twitter.com/MichaelBleby"], "published": "2015-07-30T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:10:41.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
