IT stocks in particular had a good week with Infosys and TCS contributing a good measure to gains in the Sensex.\nMarkets next week may see volatility given that the results may see some major biggies including the likes of HDFC Bank, Infosys , Hindustan Unilever, Axis Bank, Wipro announce their results. \nIndividual stocks would not only move, but would also drive the indices since stocks like HDFC Bank and Infosys are index heavy stocks. \nWhile HDFC Bank has no reason to surprise, Infosys always tends to do so. The last time the results were a huge disappointment on account of cross currency headwinds, analysts are expecting more of a stable quarter this time. \nThe monsoon session of parliament would be another trigger that the markets would watch out for. Most analysts are expecting the same to be a washout, without major legislation like GST and the Land Acquisition Bill being passed. \nIf that happens expect the markets to see some mild reaction. Apart from this developments on the monsoon front are also expected to be a trigger for the markets. So far the month of July has been poor in terms of monsoon outlook. What happens further would be keenly watched. \nGoodReturns.in Other articles published on Jul 18, 2015 Write Comments Company Search Enter the first few characters of the company's name or the NSE symbol or BSE code and click 'Go' More Headlines", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T09:40:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
