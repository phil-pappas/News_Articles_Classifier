I don't believe that FIFA is living up to these standards.\"\nFIFA has been the subject of a series of allegations in the media and in books for many years. That came to a head in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives for a range of bribery-related offenses, including fraud, money laundering and racketeering.\nLast week, two other sponsors, Coke and McDonald's Corp , ratcheted up pressure on FIFA and made clear that they wanted change. A Coke spokeswoman said the soda maker had written to FIFA and asked it to support an independent commission for reforms.\nVisa reiterated that call: \"First, an independent, third-party commission led by one or more impartial leaders is critical to formulate reforms,\" Scharf said. \"Second, we believe no meaningful reform can be made under FIFA's existing leadership.\" (Reporting by Anjali Athavaley; Editing bySteve Orlofsky)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T01:50:54.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
