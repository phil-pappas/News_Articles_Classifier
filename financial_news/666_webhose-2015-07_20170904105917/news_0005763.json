However, the Indian stock market reversed direction and closed with marginal losses, proving that the medium term trend is an uptrend. The top gainers and losers on shares of major indices are given in the table below: Negative global cues emanating from China and Greece countered the positive sentiments surrounding the upcoming first quarter (Q1) results and led the 30-stock Sensex to close 114 points down on Thursday. The S&P BSE Sensex closed Thursday 114.06 points or 0.41% down after the day's trade. The Sensex touched a high of 27,798.13 points and a low of 27,540.60 points in the intra-day trade. The wider 50-scrip Nifty also closed in red. It was down 34.50 points or 0.41% at 8,328.55 points. Analysts said that after the opening session, markets remained range-bound. However, they soon slipped into negative territory, due to the heavy sell-off in information technology (IT) counters ahead of TCS (Tata Consultancy Services) results. Market observers also pointed out that the investor confidence was shaken a day after the barometer index lost 484 points due to fears of a Chinese stock markets meltdown and the stalemate in the Greek debt crisis. However, the positive bias is being cancelled-out by the negative international cues from China and Greece. Even the sharp fall in the light sweet crude oil of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures and options index on Wednesday, which pegged a barrel at $50, failed to cheer the markets. The India markets which depend on Brent crude oil index are also affected by the price movements of the WTI. On Friday, the major trigger for the markets will be the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) data. During Thursday's intra-day trade, healthy buying was observed in capital goods, healthcare and bank stocks. However, the IT, oil and gas, automobile, technology, entertainment and media (TECK) and fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) scrip came under intense selling pressure. The S&P BSE capital goods index augmented by 344.53 points, healthcare index extended-gains by 23.82 points and bank index rose by 21.32 points. The S&P BSE IT index plunged by 198.47 points, oil and gas index receded by 199.54 points, automobile index plummet by 105.96 points, TECK index was lower by 91.32 points and FMCG index was down by 44.87 points.
