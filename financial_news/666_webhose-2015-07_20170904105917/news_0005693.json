Solving these complex challenges starts with strategic design and fuses a human-centered method with innovative technology solutions delivered by multi-disciplinary teams of strategists, designers and engineers. With our acquisition of Designit, we will complement the capabilities of an established design leader with our engineering heritage and bring compelling value to our clients,” commented Rajan Kohli, Senior Vice President and Global Head, Wipro Digital.\nDesignit’s capabilities and proven record in strategic design, user experience (UX), interaction design (IxD) and product innovation result in meaningful product-service experiences that help people live smarter, healthier and more productive lives.\nDesignit’s expertise in experience-driven design complements Wipro Digital’s capabilities in technology, digital strategy, design, and digital architecture. Together, the two organizations become a comprehensive and scalable global digital transformation partner for the entire C-suite, helping to improve customer experience while radically digitizing business operations.\n“Designit offers a unique opportunity for us to bring together capabilities not often found in the design industry including scale and global reach, a Scandinavian heritage and innovative, award-winning client work. Designit has also developed a unique open, creative and collaborative culture that we intend to nurture and grow. We look forward to working with Designit’s multi-disciplinary teams that focus on creating a better and smarter future,” continued Kohli.\nSince its founding in 1991 in Aarhus, Denmark, Designit has become one of the world’s largest, privately-held design firms. Employing more than 300 people in nine offices globally, it delivers transformative product-service experiences for some of the world’s most innovative brands in healthcare, telecom, banking, automotive, and retail.\n“Design is no longer about beautification. It is about creating a strategic foundation, driving growth and change across industries. We have much of the technology needed, but we need to design the human experience in ways that make sense to us, and for the way we live and work. That’s why design today is so influential and strategic. There’s an endless market for products, services, and systems that need to be simplified and humanized. With Wipro Digital, we can deliver as big as we can dream,” said Mikal Hallstrup, Founder and Chief Visionary Officer, Designit.\nHallstrup went on to say, “In an age of rapidly changing technology and consumer behavior, organizations need to exceed user expectations continuously.

Together, we are building one of the world’s most impactful partners for clients ready to create the future.”\nThe acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to be closed in the current quarter.\n 11, 2015 7:50 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T04:47:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
