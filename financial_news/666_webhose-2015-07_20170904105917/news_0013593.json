Tim Pawlenty (R-Minn.) said Wednesday that re-implementing Glass-Steagall, a law designed to break up big banks is \"probably not realistic.\" \nThe head of the Financial Services Roundtable in Washington and a 2012 presidential contender's comments made his comments in response to former Gov. Rick Perry's (R-Texas) seeming support for implementing Glass-Steagall. ADVERTISEMENT \"Look, let's agree -- no more too big to fail, no more bailouts, no more subsidies, no more too big to jail, and if you don't think Dodd-Frank did it -- then what's your proposal?\n\"Let's see what [Perry] has to say in specifics. Going back to Glass-Steagall probably isn't realistic at this point,\" Pawlenty said on Fox Business Network's \"Cavuto Coast to Coast.\" \nGlass-Steagall is a Depression-era law that then-President Bill Clinton repealed in 1999. It would require banks to split their commercial and investment banking operations. It's popular amongst progressives, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), but has also been championed by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). \nPerry, who is running for the 2016 GOP nomination, said in New York earlier Wednesday that â€œwe could once again require banks to separate their traditional commercial lending and investment banking and related practices.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T06:09:19.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
