What are the hidden costs behind going all-inclusive? BRITONS planning to go on an all-inclusive holiday this summer risk paying hundreds of pounds extra in unexpected costs. PUBLISHED: 13:35, Sun, Jul 5, 2015 | UPDATED: 13:51, Sun, Jul 5, 2015 GETTY It's important to know the hidden costs of an all-inclusive holiday \nOne in three families is planning an all-in getaway but the total cost may come as a shock. More than two thirds of families spent £233 extra during their last all-inclusive trip in Europe, running up bills for meals, drinks and snacks away from their resort or incurred at their hotel for unexpected add-ons such as international drinks, because the deal paid only for local brands. Others paid extra for bottled water, wine and cocktails, with the additional charges adding up to 15 per cent to the total cost of their holiday. Andrew Brown, head of travel money at the Post Office, which commissioned the research, said: “European all-inclusive resorts offer less than holidaymakers expect so it is important to be aware what is included in your package to avoid getting caught out. If you have already booked, budget carefully and allow for extra costs.” All-inclusive trips can still be a great way to budget on your holiday, because they offer a fl at price per person for the flights, hotel, meals, snacks, drinks, gym and children’s clubs. Loella Pehrsson, a director at travel website Kayak.co.uk, says: “They are extremely popular among families who are happy to pay for a limitless amount of food and drink up front, plus lots of activities on site.” They are extremely popular among families who are happy to pay for a limitless amount of food and drink up front, plus lots of activities on site Loella Pehrsson, director at travel website Kayak.co.uk If you have not booked yet, there are still plenty of great all-inclusive deals available online in the run-up to the peak holiday season, Pehrsson says. The Palma Bay Resort Club in Majorca, Spain, currently charges £372 per person for a week, according to a search on Kayak. The Globales Costa Tropical resort in Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands charges £400 per person, and Koskinou on the Greek island of Rhodes charges £410. Prices include return flights and are based on two adults travelling from a London airport on Tuesday July 14 and returning one week later. A search on TravelSupermarket.com found Thomson holidays offering seven nights at the Club Viva Hotel in Marmaris, Turkey, with a garden view room, from £422 per person, departing from Gatwick, also on July 14. Remember, prices change all the time. Many travel websites allow you to search for specific activities, such as “beach”, “diving” or “spa” to find the right deal for you. You should also check out the hotel’s amenities carefully such as whether it is child friendly, has disabled access, and so on. It is also worth checking customer reviews on popular travel websites such as TripAdviser.co.uk. Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, says two out of five package holidays are now all-inclusive. “They have been operating for years through concepts such as Sandals in the Caribbean or Club Med, but it is only recently that the idea of an ‘all in’ break has become the norm.” This can also be a safe way for more cautious travellers to experience a country they have never visited before. When booking a package, always check to see what is included. Atkinson warns: “There can be a huge variation on food and drink, entertainment and activities. Many will exclude premium alcohol brands and some will offer only local brands of soft drinks.” Some hotels offer food at all times of the day, including self-service buffets and bar snacks and even ice creams, a freebie much loved by children. He says: “Others may be restricted to three meals a day, buffet style, with little variety.” Cheaper, lower standard hotels are more likely to offer bland buffets and a limited choice of things to do. The key is to check for extras such as water sports and child minding. He says: “The last thing you want is to find you need to pay for additional items that you had not budgeted for.” Even if you have booked an all-in deal, you should still take money for trips to experience life beyond your resort. “This can give you a break from your hotel regime and the chance to try local foods, do some sightseeing and meet the locals,” Atkinson says. Further afield, British Airways Holidays is offering a package from Heathrow to Cancun, Mexico, for £1,140 per person, departing on July 16. Atkinson says: “The Spanish Caribbean is a good way of keeping long-haul holiday costs down. Cuba, Cancun and the Dominican Republic offer great deals.” Goa, the Cape Verde islands, The Gambia, Thailand and the Maldives all offer good value for more adventurous travellers, he adds. Lasse School Hansen, a spokesman for travel website Momondo.co.uk, says that although all-inclusive can be good value, you can often put together a DIY holiday package for a similar price. “This gives you the added flexibility of choosing your preferred flight and hotel, instead of a pre-packaged trip.” Many travellers who choose all-inclusive deals miss out on the freedom to try out the local cuisine and different restaurants, he says. “It is a shame to pay extra to eat out when you have already paid for the hotel buffet.” Momondo’s research shows that food is an increasingly important part of holidays with six out of 10 travellers saying that bad food at a resort would ruin their trip. While your flights will be more expensive for destinations such as Sri Lanka, when you get there living costs can be much lower, Hansen says. “Food is far cheaper in street kitchens, for example, and public transportation such as cabs are often wildly cheaper.” But if you simply want to lounge by the pool sipping drinks and eating food, an all-inclusive deal is hard to beat.
