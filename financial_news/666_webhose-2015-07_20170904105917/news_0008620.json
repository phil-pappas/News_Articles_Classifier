More Living the dream in your self-build home \nThe Ambridge plot may be a work of fiction but it reflects the real-life trajectory of agricultural property values and the spectacular recent gains made by investors in the asset class. \nFarmland investment holds attractions not only for farmers but also for individual investors willing to let others do the spadework. Finding the right property, though, is seldom a simple matter — and traps lie in wait for novice buyers over issues such as location, productivity, tenancies and tax. \nFT Money looks at the pros and cons of putting your money into agricultural property. Land values \nFarmland was once an unexciting, albeit secure, asset. Its annual yields of between 1 and 2 per cent have changed little in the past two decades, and have tended to compare unfavourably with other income-producing assets. \nBut from the mid-2000s, its value as a capital asset commenced a steep rise that has continued, though checked by the financial crisis, until today. \nThe price of farmland in England now stands at around £8,000 an acre — a far cry from the £1,000 per acre rates typically paid in the early 1990s. For farmland of the greatest interest to investors — arable land in England in blocks of 1,000 acres or more — the price is higher still, at £12,500 an acre. \nThe “investment farmland” figures come from a new index produced by Knight Frank, the estate agent, which shows the prices of such property rose by 14 per cent in the past year and 228 per cent — more than trebling in value — over the past decade. Farmland’s gains over the decade outshone those of the FTSE 100 index and even prime London property . \nWhat has caused this hitherto unremarkable asset class to rocket skywards? The long-term factors include population growth, a finite supply of land and increasing global demand for meat, which requires more intensive use of land. But in the wake of the financial crisis, land was also seen as a stable and secure repository for capital at a time when the list of assets offering those qualities was shrinking fast. \nTom Raynham, head of agricultural investments for Knight Frank, says: “For some people it’s simply sheltering their wealth, knowing it’s not going to disappear overnight. It won’t lose you money and when you come back to it in 10 years' time it will have increased in capital value.” Farm factors \nYet there is great variation in the potential for capital growth. Wide differences in the prices paid for packages of land are masked by the average. Farmers are often willing to pay over the odds for contiguous holdings, reflecting the rural adage that the neighbour’s farm “will only come up once in a lifetime”. \nAndrew Shirley, head of rural research for Knight Frank, says: “On one farm we are selling in southern England the interest we have received for two blocks of land either side of a country lane suggests the market can vary by as much as £4,000 per acre within a matter of metres.” \nOther factors that feed into the value equation are the location and distribution of land, soil quality, crop yields and tenants’ rights. Even a hands-off investor should consider them in a purchase, since they may determine the attractiveness of a piece of farmland to a potential future buyer. \n“For a pure investor the location doesn’t matter — but they want to know they’re buying into a popular area so they’ll have an easier process when they want to sell it,” says Mr Raynham. \nHow is land quality judged? Grade 1 is the richest and most fertile soil, capable of growing nearly all crops and so prized that it is often held by the same families for generations. Grade 5 is the poorest, good for little more than rough grazing. \nIn the middle is Grade 3, the most common type of land accounting for half the farmland in England and Wales and most investment-quality land. It is less versatile than the higher grades but can be highly productive for cereals , oilseed rape or potatoes. \nAspiring buyers should look closely at crop yields. These will shift from year to year according to weather, seed quality, farm management and other factors but rules of thumb can help decide whether a farm is a good investment. With wheat , for example, a yield of around 3.5 tonnes per acre is a healthy starting point. \nWhere vendors present a farm and its land as separate lots, the sum may be greater than the parts. “If a property is lotted separately, I would often advise an investor to try and buy the whole thing. If you only bought the house you’re immediately almost devaluing the land as it wouldn’t have any farm buildings or property. You want to make sure you’re buying something you can rent out,” says Mr Raynham. \nDownload \nNovice investors may see all tenants as equal but there are huge differences in the rights they are accorded, depending on when their tenancy was granted, and this will have a big impact on value and income. Tenancies granted before 1984 are likely to carry statutory succession rights — enacted in a 1986 law — on death or retirement, meaning a close relative has the right to take it over. Such rights can last for two tenancies by succession — so three generations of a tenant’s family will have the right to work the land. \nIf a farm comes with tenants who hold succession rights, its value may be half the value of an equivalent farm without them. This is because such tenants may have rights constraining rent reviews and the level of rents that can be charged. \nIt also matters for tax reasons, a significant motivator for investors. For many farms with so-called “1986 Act tenants”, APR can only be claimed at 50 per cent. In tenancies granted after 1995, which are known as Farm Business Tenancies, landlords can claim agricultural property relief at 100 per cent. Boosting income \nWealthy investors may be primarily concerned with capital value and preserving their money, but farms offer opportunities to boost income beyond the revenue from crops or livestock. \nCash flow on the latter is notoriously difficult to manage, since crops or livestock take 12-24 months to grow or mature before harvest or sale at market, leaving a long period between investment and a return that may itself be subject to unpredictable external factors such as global wheat prices. So farmers have tried for many years to supplement their income from alternative sources. \nFarm shops are one option but bigger growth has come from renewable energy , after the government introduced a system of feed-in tariffs in 2010. \nJudy Pearson, a chartered surveyor at Berrys in Northamptonshire, says wind and solar are the most popular forms, since they reduce the costs of farming but can earn money for the property, even as the feed-in tariff rate has fallen. “Renewable energy is especially good for farms with high energy costs such as a dairy farm or a poultry unit with lights,” she says. \nOwners are looking again at income from farm buildings, after new planning rules were introduced in April last year easing the conversion of working farm buildings to residential use. \nMs Pearson said many of her clients were making use of the new rules, either by renting out property, selling it or using it to accommodate more family members working on the farm. “It’s a step change for values and investment because residential is the premium type of property. It’s about sweating your assets,” she said. Headwinds \nBut individual investors face competition to buy good farms from a number of directions: foreign investors are showing more interest in UK farmland, particularly from northern European countries such as Germany and Denmark where land can be anything up to twice as expensive. \nFarmers themselves are also making use of low interest rates to buy land and banks are keen to lend to them, since the loan will be held against a physical asset unlikely to drop in value. \nInstitutional investors such as pension funds — which were big owners of farmland in the 1980s but shifted into commercial property in the 1990s — are also showing signs of a renewal in interest , when they can find packages of land large enough to make a significant investment. \nLast August the Wellcome Trust bought the Cooperative Group’s farm operations, comprising 40,000 acres and 15 farms, for £249m. These it added to existing land holdings in Hinxton in Cambridgeshire, Kings Langley in Hertfordshire and Alpraham in Cheshire. \nFor farmland investors, the boom of the past 10 years begs the question: will the gains continue? After such dramatic rises, agricultural property experts are sceptical. \nKnight Frank says the investment farmland peak of £12,500 has flattened in the past three months and Mr Shirley is predicting steadier growth of around 5 per cent over the next year. But it is hard to find anyone willing to predict a crash in values in the long term. \nSteve Humphris, rural property consultant at Countryside Solutions, says the root reasons for demand remain in place. He says: “We have better global trade connections, an increasing population and land is a reducing commodity — we lose around 10,000 acres a year out of 20m in England and Wales.” \nDavid Archer chose to reject the £7.5m offer for Brookfield after realising how important it was for him to preserve his family’s connection with the land. For now, the question is on hold: but it may not be long before the Ambridge scriptwriters once again put temptation in his way. Farm for sale \nA house martin wheels overhead as Tom Raynham picks up a handful of earth and rubs it between his fingers. “If it stays together in clods it’s got quite a bit of clay. If not, there’s more sand in the soil,” he says. \nWith moderate clay content, the soil on this 339-acre holding at Toppesfield in Essex is perfect for a combination of cereals or oilseed rape, the crop that is ripening as we inspect the field. \nUK farmland returns more than Mayfair \nIn the fertile fens of north Cambridgeshire lies the 560-acre Rummers Farm where potatoes, sugar beet, cereals and oil seed rape are grown. The farm, which also has apple and pear orchards, sold in 2007 for about £2.75m. Eight years later, it is back on the market — but this time the price tag is £7m. \nContinue reading \n“Cereals like heavier soil as it retains water for longer, whereas vegetables prefer to have dry feet,” says Mr Raynham, head of agricultural investment at property agent Knight Frank, as he describes decision making process behind a farmland investment. \nThe owner of the land, who is marketing it through agent Brown & Co, is selling it with the 393-acre Hole Farm, located a few miles away near Finchingfield. Together the pair make a good size for investor-landlords: there should be enough land in a purchase to offset the costs of working it, and the larger the farm, the greater economies of scale it offers. \nThe Toppesfield land comes in four chunks, but they are close together, an important factor when buying. “Your cost of machinery, transport, fuel and maintenance all ratchets up the more travelling you have to do. It’s subjective because it comes down to what a farmer is prepared to take on but 10 to 15 miles is probably as far as you’d want to go in travelling from one block to another,” Mr Raynham says. \nFor buyers who intend to work the land themselves, a fragmented holding can be less attractive. But those buying for investment reasons might regard it more favourably since it offers a better opportunity to sell off lots individually in future. “If you’ve got one single block you don’t want to go selling off parts because it eats away at that one block,” says Mr Raynham. \nFarm size is not a straightforward indicator of value: smaller farms with higher-grade soil may be more productive than larger holdings elsewhere in the country. \nThe east of England has some of the richest soil in the country: parts of Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. Farms in Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire are particularly productive, since they are capable of supporting all kinds of crop including nutrient-hungry soft fruits, and therefore fetch a higher price. \nBut only if they reach the market. “Some of those farms are never sold — except for death, divorce or debt,” says Mr Raynham.
