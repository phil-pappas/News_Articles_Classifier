This indicates a possible uptrend in these stock prices. In contrast, oil drillers such as Diamond Offshore Drilling (DO) and coal mining firms such as Consol Energy (CNX) show the opposite trend in moving averages. CNX especially seems to be experiencing a downtrend. Relative strength index indicates refiners are probably overbought \nThe RSI (relative strength index) is a momentum indicator that helps determine when an asset is oversold or overbought. An asset is considered to be overbought when the RSI approaches 70. At this point, there’s a risk you may see a pullback from its overvalued state. Similarly, as the RSI approaches 30, the asset is probably oversold and could become undervalued, causing an eventual upward revision in its price. \nAs the above table shows, refiners Tesoro (TSO) and Valero (VLO) have RSI values exceeding 70, indicating the stocks may be overbought, particularly given their recent rise. These stocks may eventually experience a downward correction. In terms of leverage, refining and marketing firms in the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) have an average debt-to-total capital of 0.32x, lower than that of firms with coal operations. \nIn contrast, Consol Energy (CNX) and Noble Energy (NBL) have RSIs below 30, indicating the stocks may be oversold. Though an upward revision is possible for these stocks, the weak outlook for coal could in fact mean further losses for the likes of Consol Energy, as suggested in Part 4 of this series. \nAt the end of the day, although refiners are posting gains now, don’t expect this to continue over the long term. \nBrowse this series on Market Realist:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T18:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T18:20:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
