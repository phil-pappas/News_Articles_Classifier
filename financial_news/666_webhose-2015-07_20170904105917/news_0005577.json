Typically they do not require the bank to accept responsibility, instead settling the case with a payment and imposing monitors at the institution subject to the agreement. \nHowever, if the bank does agree to the DPA, it will only cover the bank rather than any individuals who worked for Barclays. \nIt is not the first time the bank has considered reaching such a deal with regulators. \nBarclays agreed to a non-prosecution agreement with US authorities over the Libor manipulation scandal in the summer of 2012. In that deal the bank admitted misconduct, paid $160m to the Department of Justice and agreed to help fraud investigators to the fullest extent possible in their probes into the bank. \nThe two-year agreement was extended last year in light of the looming foreign exchange benchmark investigations. \nThe SFO launched the probe in the summer of 2012 , looking into payments around the bank's £2bn fundraising in 2008. Barclays raised the money in the financial crisis to give it the extra financial firepower it needed to survive, while rivals Lloyds and RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) were bailed out by the taxpayer instead. \nThe deal was followed by a further £6.8bn fundraising in the Middle East, and fees totalling £300m caught the attention of the authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T16:36:28.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
