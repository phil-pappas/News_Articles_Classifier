For one month, those figures are not a problem - the numbers bounce around from month to month, as sample survey figures tend to do. But if it continues in that vein the monthly labour force estimates will start to produce some ugly figures. Steady employment growth of at least 20,000 a month is likely to be needed for the jobless rate to fall. Between January and May, employment grew by an average of 29,000 a month. At the same time, unemployment dropped from 6.3 per cent in January to 5.9 per cent in May. That neatly reversed the rise from 5.9 per cent to 6.3 per cent over the preceding eight months, from May 2014 to January 2015. Employment growth over that time averaged only 15,000 a month. And that's just what the bureau estimates the trend to be right now. That's not fast enough to reduce unemployment, and probably too slow to stop it rising again.
