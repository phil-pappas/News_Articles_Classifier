It's located in Washington, D.C. \nOf the roughly $1.3 trillion in student loans that are unpaid, just over $1 trillion were made by the federal government. While the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Department of Education are juggling a range of fiascos from the for-profit college crack-up to loan servicing and debt collection , borrowers still struggle in all 50 states. Meanwhile, state governments in Massachusetts, Illinois, California and elsewhere have tried to fill the gap by suing the industry’s bad actors. Federal regulators and elected officials have often followed their lead. \n”We don’t have to wait for congress to do something about student loans,\" said Matt Lesser, member of the Connecticut state House of Representatives and chair of the state banking committee. \n\"The new majority in (Federal) Congress doesn’t understand how important this is to our generation,” said the 29-year-old Lesser. “They’re trying to block efforts to give debt relief to victims of profit colleges out of their hard-earned money.” Lesser added that a half million people in Connecticut, which has a population of 3.6 million, have student loans. Connecticut is the first state to pass a student loan bill of rights and create a student loan ombudsman, similar to the one at the CFPB.
