Properties in the vicinity go up to $15M (in value). The area is very highly regarded in terms of prestige property buyers.” 6 Benson Avenue, Toorak in Melbourne was the most viewed property on realestate.com.au this past financial year. Source: Supplied\nMs Bradley said the most viewed property in the country was 6 Benson Avenue, Toorak in Victoria - whose features included Iris Crystal Bohemia chandeliers and a waterfall window. It sold on May 19 this year for an undisclosed sum though a previous sale price in 2013 was $2.8M.\nA former builder’s home at 8 Panorama Avenue, Lower Plenty , ran second nationally, with its “fresh air of the mountains, just a stroll from the Yarra”. Its sale price was not disclosed either but its fetched a previous sale price in 2007 of $1.1M.\nA property at 29 Fisher Pde, Ascot Vale - which sold on July 9 for $2.55M - was third.\nOriginally published as Queensland’s most clicked property ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/queenslands-most-clicked-property-did-so-well-it-made-national-top-10/story-fndbalka-1227452655242?sv=439201155a6c332ebbd90eec468541a1&h=Queensland%26%238217%3Bs+most+clicked+property", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-qld-fig+tree+pocket-118103927", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/queenslands-most-clicked-property-did-so-well-it-made-national-top-10/story-fnihpu6h-1227452655242", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Queensland%26%238217%3Bs+most+clicked+property&c=A+MULTI-MILLION+dollar+riverside+mortgagee+sale+was+the+most+viewed+Queensland+property+online+this+past+year%2C+landing+so+many+clicks+it+also+broke+into+the+national+top+10%2C+new+data+shows.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/queenslands-most-clicked-property-did-so-well-it-made-national-top-10/story-fndbalka-1227452655242?sv=439201155a6c332ebbd90eec468541a1", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/queenslands-most-clicked-property-did-so-well-it-made-national-top-10/story-fndbalka-1227452655242?sv=439201155a6c332ebbd90eec468541a1", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/queenslands-most-clicked-property-did-so-well-it-made-national-top-10/story-fndbalka-1227452655242?sv=439201155a6c332ebbd90eec468541a1&title=Queensland%26%238217%3Bs+most+clicked+property", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/queenslands-most-clicked-property-did-so-well-it-made-national-top-10/story-fndbalka-1227452655242?sv=439201155a6c332ebbd90eec468541a1&title=Queensland%26%238217%3Bs+most+clicked+property", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-vic-ascot+vale-120016925", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/queenslands-most-clicked-property-did-so-well-it-made-national-top-10/story-fndbalka-1227452655242?sv=439201155a6c332ebbd90eec468541a1", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-vic-lower+plenty-117661515", "http://www.realestate.com.au/property-house-vic-toorak-119155971"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:26:32.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
