The measure slid 4.2 percent last week. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1 percent to 19,967.18 on Monday as Japan’s currency pared early-morning gains. European leaders gave Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras three days to enact their main demands into Greek law in exchange for another bailout.\n“We didn’t see a full agreement in the Greece talks, but they didn’t end in the worst-case scenario, and it’s positive that they’re still exploring a third bailout,” said Shoji Hirakawa, chief equity strategist at Okasan Securities Co. “But risks remain in this and you never know what will happen.”\nThe Topix fell 5.7 percent from a 2007 high reached June 24 through last week as uncertainty over Greece’s future in the euro and the impact of China’s stock rout drove gauges of global equity volatility higher. A measure of expected price swings on the Nikkei 225 closed Friday at an almost six-month high.\nThe Government Pension Investment Fund reported its annual results on July 10, and released figures showing its asset mix is closing in on the targets outlined in a radical overhaul in October.\nThe world’s biggest pension fund delivered a 12 percent return in the year ended March 31, the most since its 2001 inception.
