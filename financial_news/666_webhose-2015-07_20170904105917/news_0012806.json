Photo: Edwina Pickles\nA Sydney restaurant owner says he advertised for staff at just $12 an hour because he feared other Korean businesses would sabotage him if he offered above the \"normal\" wage.\nChris Guon was investigated by the Fair Work Ombudsman after two employees at his franchise of the 678 Korean BBQ chain claimed they had been paid a flat rate of $11 to $13 an hour.\nFair Work inspectors found the pair, who were both on 417 working holiday visas, had been underpaid over $1300 between December 2013 and June 2014 at the Pitt Street restaurant.\nAn investigation uncovered that Mr Guon's KPG Au Group Pty Ltd had advertised for staff on Korean websites offering pay of $12 to $16 an hour.\nThe ombudsman's office said that when questioned about the advertisements, Mr Guon claimed there was pressure from other Korean businesses in Sydney not to offer more than the going rate.\nHe said businesses that did not comply feared having false claims about food hygiene made to local councils.\nMr Guon had not kept proper paperwork, which hampered the investigation, but the ombudsman ultimately ordered him to repay the workers, who have both returned to Korea, $661 and $642 in owed penalty rates.\nMr Guon also received a $1700 on-the-spot fine for not issuing payslips, and ordered to implement a workplace relations training program and to undergo an external audit of his workplace relations compliance.\nHis restaurant must also display notices in Korean and English detailing the breaches.\nOmbudsman Natalie James said her office had recently come across a number of Korean businesses recruiting and underpaying Korean nationals, and that 10 per cent of all requests for help from employees were coming from foreign nationals.\nMs James said her office had launched a pilot program to engage multicultural communities and help migrant workers and international students understand their rights at work.\n\"We take a dim view of any employer who seeks to profit by underpaying their staff, particularly vulnerable overseas workers,\" she said.\n\"Whether you're a business owner or an employee, workers that have come from overseas have the same rights as local workers and should be treated with dignity and respect.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:50:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
