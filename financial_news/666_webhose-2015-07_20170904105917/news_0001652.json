He said his point was \"just common sense\" and consistent with the sentiment of the Unites States' National Security Adviser Susan Rice.\n\"There is in politics often a sort of vocabulary of hyperbole, where there's never a problem, there's always a massive problem. There is never a threat, it's always the biggest threat you have ever countered. There tends to be a process of exaggeration,\" he said.\n\"However with the so-called Islamic State...they are seeking to recruit.\n\"One of the things they use is the image of triumph, the image of invincibility. They want people to believe that they are on the move, that they are conquering, that they are powerful, that they are frightening the west and so the bigger they can appear, the more successful they think they will be in their recruiting.\n\"So we have to be careful that we don't end up amplifying what they're doing by the way we talk about them. So I think we need to be very objective and very measured and very balanced.\"\nMr Turnbull's comments are likely to reignite the ruckus he created last week when, in a speech to the Sydney Institute, he took what was widely regarded as a swing at Tony Abbott's alarmist rhetoric regarding the domestic threat posed by Islamic State.\nMr Turnbull said Australia faced \"far greater threats\" than IS and cautioned against over-estimating or under-estimating the threat and said critics of the government's new national security measures should ot be denounced.\n Also on the 7.30 Report, Mr Turnbull lamented the \"pugilistic nature\" of today's political debate, contrasting it with the style of Liberal Party funder Robert Menzies.\n\"There seems in those debates to be much greater respect for the arguments, the perspectives of the people on the other side,\" he said.\n\"Menzies was very much a barrister. And he is a great believer that you should always be prepared to concede the validity of your opponent's argument and then say 'I concede, that's a fair point you're making, but it's mistaken for the following reasons', rather than slamming him or her in a sort of pugilistic way,\" he said.\n\"Pugilistic\" is a term commonly used to describe Mr Abbott's style.\nMr Turnbull had been scheduled to appear on the ABC's Q&A program but had to withdraw because of a boycott imposed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott following the appearance of Zaky Mallah.\nMr Turnbull said the banning of Barnaby Joyce appearing last week \"was news to me\" but he had subsequently discussed Mr Abbott the ongoing Coalition boycott of the show until it was moved to within the ABC's news division.\n\"He is not directing the ABC. He is putting pressure on the ABC,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PhillipCoorey"], "published": "2015-07-13T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T20:03:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
