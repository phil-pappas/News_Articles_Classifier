Most experts say you need enough to last you until a bit after you are statistically likely to die. Sometime in advanced old age. Somewhere in the misty future.\nFor those among us who have a clearer idea of when the grim reaper will visit, financial planning takes on a different complexion. Anyone diagnosed with a terminal illness faces a series of difficult choices, not least among them financial ones. And they and their immediate family need to be careful.\nAdvertisement The extension of the time limit the terminally ill have to access their super is very welcome, but there are potential traps.\nIn the May 2015 budget the government announced an extension of access of the terminally ill to their superannuation after lobbying by the Breast Cancer Network Australia and other organisations.\nPatients must have two doctors, including a specialist practicing in an area related to the illness or injury, certify that they are likely to die within 12 months before they can have unrestricted access to their superannuation savings.\nAs a consequence of the change announced in the budget, the relevant regulations have been changed so access to super is extended to life expectancy of two years. The change took effect from July 1 this year.\nThe early access provision due to terminal illness applies also to self-managed super funds.\nBut those planning to access their super early are encouraged to seek independent financial and legal advice.\nAs Annemarie Gambera, an insurance lawyer with Slater and Gordon, points out, early access to superannuation could risk losing life insurance cover.\nThose with terminal illnesses often suffer financial hardship as they typically stop working right when they need access to money to pay for their day-to-day expenses.\nNaturally, they may want access to their money as they experience financial burdens and want to make the most their time with their family.\nCancer patients, for example, can spend thousands of dollars a month on life-prolonging drugs not covered by Medicare.\nMost superannuation fund members have life and total and permanent disability insurance through their funds.\nIt is very important to realise that the terms of the insurance policies are not being changed due to the change in regulations extending access to two years.\nSomeone with a terminal illness who cashes out their super within two years of their life expectancy, but is expected to live for more than 12 months, could lose their insurance benefit under strict interpretation of the rules of the fund; though, fund trustees do have discretion over individual cases.\nYou would expect funds would point this out to fund members, but that cannot be assumed.\nAnd, with some funds, if the fund member stops working, the insurance cover is voided. That may be so even though the premium for the insurance continues to be paid from the savings in the super account.\nMany funds do have a grace period, where the insurance cover continues after the member has ceased working; typically 13 months.\nAnyone planning to take advantage of early access to superannuation is urged to check out the implications of doing so.\nThere is help to those who are financially strapped.\nFor example, Cancer Councils in NSW and in Victoria, run referral services to financial planners, lawyers and other professionals providing their services for free to those who qualify.\n @jcollett_money", "external_links": ["https://membercentre.fairfax.com.au/NewsletterSubscription.aspx", "http://twitter.com/@jcollett_money"], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T05:06:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
