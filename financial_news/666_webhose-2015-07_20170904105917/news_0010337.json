With low investment returns and soft insurance prices in many markets, analysts expect more deals to come. \nFollowing recent speculation, Switzerland-based Zurich, a 45 billion Swiss franc ($47 billion) firm offering a range of life and general insurance products, said it was looking at a bid. \n\"Zurich notes the recent market speculation in relation to RSA Insurance Group PLC and confirms that the company is evaluating a potential offer,\" it said on Tuesday. \n\"This announcement does not amount to a firm intention to make an offer and there can be no assurance that any offer will be made.\" \nRSA, which has a market capitalisation of 4.4 billion pounds ($6.9 billion) and is best known for its More Than home and motor insurance brand, said it had held no talks with Zurich and received no proposal, advising shareholders to take no action. \nThe Financial Times said Zurich was considering a bid valuing RSA at 5.5 billion pounds ($8.6 billion), or 550 pence a share. Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) analysts said Zurich had around $3 billion in surplus cash and could take on debt of up to $5 billion. \n\"RSA has many strengths that would complement our business,\" a Zurich spokesman told Reuters. \"RSA is very clearly strong in Britain but also in Scandinavia and Canada. And they have business in Latin America, a market which we want to expand.\" \nShares (Berlin: DI6.BE - news ) in RSA stormed as much as 15 percent higher to 504.5 pence before trimming gains on RSA's response. \nThey were trading at 496 pence at 1154 GMT, up 13.3 percent while Zurich shares were down 1.2 percent. \nAfter multiple profit warnings, triggered in part by an accounting scandal in Ireland (Other OTC: IRLD - news ) , RSA hired former RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) boss Stephen Hester last year to lead its recovery. The British general insurer swung into profit in 2014. \nRSA announced the appointment of Scott Egan, a former group financial controller at Zurich Financial Services, as its new chief financial officer earlier this month. \nIt also appointed former Zurich executive Steve Lewis as chief executive for UK and western Europe in January. \nDEAL VALUE \nA tie-up between Zurich and RSA would follow several big insurance deals. Swiss giant ACE bought upmarket property insurer Chubb Corp this month in a $28 billion deal to get access to wealthy clients who pay higher premiums, at a time when fierce competition has cut deeply into the industry's profit margins. \nZurich and RSA would be a good fit, analysts said, but there could be counter-offers. \n\"AXA (Paris: FR0000120628 - news ) or a number of other U.S. and European insurers could be interested,\" said Barrie Cornes at Panmure Gordon. \"RSA is now effectively in play.\" \nFrench insurer AXA told Reuters it did not comment on market rumours. \nIn its most recent results, RSA posted a 1 percent rise in net written premiums and said profits were ahead of plan, boosted by disposals. It was also weighing a possible sale of its Latin American business, a source told Reuters earlier this year. \nHowever, RSA is battling a competitive UK insurance market and has struggled to boost investment income in the current low-interest rate environment. \nThe firm's largest shareholder is activist investor Cevian Capital (Other OTC: CGHC - news ) , with a 13 percent stake. \nCanaccord Genuity (Other OTC: CCORF - news ) analysts said 550 pence a share would be a \"fair offer\", upgrading their recommendation on RSA to \"buy\" from \"sell\" and saying the purchase would give Zurich a leading position in Britain. RBC analysts said RSA's Scandinavian presence was particularly attractive. \nShore Capital analyst Eamonn Flanagan also upgraded his recommendation on RSA to \"buy\" from \"hold\". \nHe said the idea of an outright sale of RSA was preferable to speculation it could be broken up, given concern any partial sale could see money diverted to plug a pension deficit. \nBarclays analysts said RSA had a pension deficit of around 500 million pounds, while Zurich itself has a UK scheme deficit of around $2 billion, \"so Zurich has significant experience of managing UK pension issues,\" they said. \n($1 = 0.9624 Swiss francs) \n($1 = 0.6424 pounds) (Additional reporting by Paul Arnold in Zurich, Carolyn Cohn in London and Leigh Thomas in Paris; Editing by Sinead Cruise and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T15:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T15:25:35.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
