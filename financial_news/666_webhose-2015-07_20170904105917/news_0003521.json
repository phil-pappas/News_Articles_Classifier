Portfolio loans increased $115 million from March 31, 2015, representing a 9.8% annualized rate. Results for the second quarter included merger integration costs of $0.9 million, which primarily related to the systems conversion. Net loan charge-offs to average loans remained low at 0.11% for the second quarter of 2015 compared to 0.10% for the first quarter of 2015. S&T declared an $0.18 per share dividend compared to $0.17 in the same period a year ago. \n\"The growth initiatives that we have implemented over the past two years through our expansion into central Pennsylvania, Ohio, and western New York and our efforts in our core markets are making a big impact on our overall financial performance,\" said Todd Brice, president and chief executive officer of S&T. \"Our team members are successfully expanding opportunities with existing clients and developing new relationships. We are excited about how we are positioned moving forward.\" \nNet Interest Income \nNet interest income increased $8.6 million to $48.8 million compared to $40.2 million for the first quarter of 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the merger with Integrity Bancshares (the Merger) that occurred on March 4, 2015. Average loans increased by $642.2 million for the second quarter compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to the Merger and organic loan growth. Net interest income and net interest margin (NIM) on a fully taxable equivalent basis (FTE) were favorably impacted by $2.7 million of accretion from purchase accounting adjustments during the quarter. NIM increased to 3.67% compared to 3.48% for the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to the accretion of the purchase accounting adjustments. \nAsset Quality \nOverall asset quality remains well controlled. Total nonperforming assets were relatively unchanged at $19.9 million, or 0.32% of total assets, at June 30, 2015 and $19.4 million, or 0.33% of total assets, at March 31, 2015. Net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2015 were $1.3 million compared to net charge-offs of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2015.

The allowance for loan losses for originated loans was $48.8 million, or 1.23% of total originated loans, compared to $48.1 million, or 1.27% of total originated loans, at March 31, 2015. \nNoninterest Income and Expense \nNoninterest income increased $1.3 million to $13.4 million compared to $12.1 million for the first quarter of 2015. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to the Merger and higher loan related fees. Noninterest expense increased $1.8 million to $35.4 million compared to $33.6 million in the first quarter of 2015. The increase was mainly due to higher operating expenses resulting from the Merger offset by a decrease of $1.4 million of integration costs related to the Merger. \nFinancial Condition \nTotal assets increased $163 million to $6.1 billion at June 30, 2015 compared to $6.0 billion at March 31, 2015. Loan growth was strong for the quarter with an increase in total portfolio loans of $115 million, or a 9.8% annualized rate. Commercial loans increased $101 million during the quarter, or an 11.4% annualized rate, primarily due to growth in the commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios. In the consumer portfolio, home equity loans increased by $19 million, or a 17% annualized rate. Total deposits increased $31 million to $4.9 billion at June 30, 2015. S&T's risk based capital ratios decreased this quarter due to loan and commitment growth outpacing retained earnings. All capital ratios remain above the well-capitalized thresholds of federal bank regulatory agencies. \nDividend \nThe Board of Directors of S&T declared an $0.18 per share cash dividend at its regular meeting held on July 20, 2015.
