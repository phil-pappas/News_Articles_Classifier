Don't believe everything you see. Most of what the attackers are claiming is simply not true... The attackers are spreading a lot of lies about our company that is simply not true.\" \nHe also claimed the massive torrent file had malware in it. However, other hackers have since discredited his virus claims. \n\"We simply provide custom software solutions tailored to our customers' needs,\" Mr. Pozi insisted before either deleting or disabling his Twitter account. \nAn archive is of his tweet is available here. \nPREMIUM TIMES is monitoring the data leak and will bring more details as they emerge.
