The gains were the second in a row after US stocks suffered a five-day losing streak. \n\"The Fed statement was similar to the last and it was a very modest upgrade to previous language,\" said Raiko Shareef, a markets strategist at Bank of New Zealand in Wellington. \n- Samsung woes - \n\"That will make the two following employment reports we get more important, and strong results would support our view of a September liftoff,\" Shareef told Bloomberg News. \nAnd economist Chris Low of FTN Financial added that minor changes in the language showed only that \"the past six weeks data pushed the (policy committee) a little closer to raising rates\". \n\"But they are still waiting for more good news before they actually pull the trigger,\" he said. \nThe chances of an earlier rate rise lifted the dollar. In early Tokyo trade it fetched 124.18 yen, compared with 123.91 yen in New York. \nThe euro bought $1.0970 and 136.12 yen against $1.0990 and 136.19 yen in US trade. \nSeoul was dragged down by Samsung, which tumbled 2.85 percent in morning trade after releasing second-quarter earnings showing net profit dropped 8.0 percent owing to weak sales of its flagship S6 smartphone. \nThe firm has now seen its net profit decline for five straight quarters year-on-year, mainly due to heightened competition in an increasingly saturated smartphone market that it had dominated for years. \nIn oil trade US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery rose 18 cents to $48.97 and Brent crude for September jumped 34 cents to $53.72. \nPrices rallied Wednesday after data showed an unexpected weekly fall in US crude inventories. The figures provide some respite for dealers after a recent sell-off, although the black gold remains beaten down by fears over a global share glut, a strong dollar, an expected flood of Iranian crude at the end of the year and weak demand. \nGold fetched $1,096.88 an ounce compared with $1,096.20 late Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T06:39:14.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
