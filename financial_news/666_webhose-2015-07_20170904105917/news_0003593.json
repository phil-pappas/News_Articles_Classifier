It has long been fighting an expanding coalition of free marketeers, parliamentary souverainistes and anti-immigrant populists on the Right.\nAfter the scorched earth treatment of Greece over the past five months - culminating in the vindictive decision to impose yet harsher terms on this crushed nation just days after its cri de coeur in a referendum - it has now lost its remaining emotional hold on the Left.\nRiot police try to avoid petrol bombs thrown by anti-austerity protesters in Athens on Wednesday. Photo: AP\nThis has been coming for a long time. We conservatives have watched in disbelief as one Socialist party after another immolates itself on the altar of monetary union, defending a \"bankers' ramp\", as the old Left used to call it.\nWe have seen the Left apologise for 1930s' policies, and defend a pro-cyclical fiscal regime imposed on Europe by a handful of \"Ordoliberal\" reactionaries in the German finance ministry.\nBy a twist of fate, the Left has become the enforcer of an economic structure that has led to levels of unemployment once unthinkable for a post-war social democratic government with its own sovereign currency. It has found ways to justify a youth jobless rate still running at 42pc in Italy, 49pc in Spain and 50pc in Greece. It has acquiesced in the Long Slump of the past six years.\nIllustration Kerrie Leishman\nIt meekly endorsed the EU Fiscal Compact, knowing that it imposes a legal requirement on eurozone states to slash public debt - by 1.5pc of GDP in France, 2pc in Spain and 3.5pc in Italy and Portugal - every year for the next two decades. This is a formula for permanent depression. It outlaws Keynesian economics, and Classical economics. It is a doomsday construct.\nThis is what they have defended, because until now they dared not question the sanctity of EMU.\nAnd so the once mighty Dutch Labour Party has been reduced to a pitiful relic. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party has lost its Left wing to the rebel Podemos movement, freshly victorious in Barcelona. Support for France's socialist leader, Francois Hollande, has been cut to 24pc in the polls, as the French working class defects to the Front National.\nYet finally, events in Greece have broken the spell.\n\"Progressives should be appalled by the European Union's ruination of Greece,\" wrote Owen Jones in The Guardian. The new term \"Lexit\" is gaining currency.\nThe voices of the Left are uneasy. Their instincts are to oppose everything that Ukip stands for.\n\"At first, only a few dipped their toes in the water; then others, hesitantly, followed their lead, all the time looking at each other for reassurance,\" Mr Jones wrote.\nYet the cruelty on display in Brussels has trumped all. Mr Jones runs through the names.\n\"Everything good about the EU is in retreat; everything bad is on the rampage,\" says George Monbiot. The EU is being portrayed \"with some truth, as a cruel, fanatical and stupid institution\", says Nick Cohen.\nVariants of this debate are stirring across Europe. Luigi Zingales, an adviser to Italy's premier Matteo Renzi, has become a flaming eurosceptic.\n\"This European project is dead forever. If Europe is nothing but a bad version of the IMF, what is left of the European integration project?\" he wrote as Greece capitulated.\nWhether or not it was a \"coup\", as the Twitterati alleged, there is no doubt that Syriza was compelled by financial coercion to abandon its election promises. It must even repeal all \"fiscal\" laws passed since January.\nWithout rehearsing 15 years of Greek controversy, let me just say that the country's crisis is a collective responsibility of the creditors, the EMU elites, the Greek oligarchy and, ultimately, of a jejune Alexis Tsipras.\nThe Troika bail-out in 2010 was intended to save the euro and European banks at a time when there were no defences against contagion. Greece was not saved. It was sacrificed. The roots of the \"Greek Spring\" can be traced to this original sin.\nThe EMU creditors never acknowledged their own guilt. They never made an honest attempt to negotiate with Syriza, even on matters of common ground. They demanded that the austerity terms of the prior Memorandum be enforced to the letter, hiding behind Pharisaical talk of rules.\nLet us not forget that the European Central Bank brought about the final collapse by freezing emergency liquidity to the Greek banks, forcing Syriza to shut the lenders' doors, impose capital controls and halt imports.\nIt was a political decision - dressed up with technical flammery - and was arguably illegal. It is very hard to reconcile with the ECB's treaty duty to uphold financial stability. One plain fact is clear: technocrats brought an elected government to its knees.\nWe all know what the game was. Germany and its allies were determined to make an example of Syriza to discourage voters in any other country from daring to buck the system.\nI doubt that this will work, even on its own narrow terms. Podemos remains defiant. It has accused the EU institutions and the Spanish government of committing an \"act of terrorism\".\nIt is, in any case, a double-edged strategy. Costas Lapavitsas, a Syriza MP, said the salient message of the past five months is that no radical government can pursue sovereign policies as long as it is at the mercy of a central bank able to switch off liquidity.\n\"It is now perfectly clear that the only way out of this is to break free of monetary union,\" he said.\nAll Souls economist Kevin O'Rourke said the next Left-wing party that rises to challenge the EMU will not be as \"feckless\" as Mr Tsipras, and will not bargain from a position of such abject weakness.\nAs for the conduct of Germany, what can one politely say? It is deemed poor taste to mention that the allied powers agreed to wipe out half of Germany's external liabilities at the London Debt Agreement in February 1953.\nThis act of statesmanship came less than eight years after the end of the Second World War, when the horrors were still fresh in everybody's mind. It is roughly equivalent to the lapse in time today since the Lehman crisis.\nWhatever you think of Greece's behaviour - and it hasn't invaded anybody - can we not at least have a minimum of common sense?\nTelegraph, London", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:40:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
