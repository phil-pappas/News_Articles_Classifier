Photo: Sahlan Hayes\nA Taiwanese cafe chain has been caught paying its Australian workers as little as $12 an hour, prompting the workplace watchdog to warn foreign-owned businesses they must by abide local laws.\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman has ordered 85°C Bakery Cafe, which has five outlets across Sydney, to repay a total of $42,775 to four employees it underpaid between 2009 and October last year.\nThe company, which has 320 outlets across Asia and opened its first Australian branch in Sydney in 2006, was paying three Taiwanese on working holiday visas, who spoke little English, and a Chinese international student, as little as $12 an hour.\nAn 85°C Bakery Cafe director told the ombudsman that, while wage decisions were made at its head office in Taiwan, the company decided on the low wage after consulting friends and business associates to find Sydney's \"market rate\".\nOmbudsman Natalie James said it was not the first time her office had been given that excuse and called on employers to ensure they were familiar with local laws.\n\"There is no 'market rate' for Sydney, or any other capital city or regional centre ... and there is not one rate for overseas workers and another for Australian workers,\" Ms James said.\n\"Migrants, like everyone else establishing businesses in Australia, need to ensure they take the time to understand our workplace laws.\n\"Migrant employers cannot undercut the minimum lawful entitlements of their employees based on what they think the job may be worth or what it may pay in their country of origin.\"\nThe workers – a retail assistant, a cleaner and two packers – had been individually underpaid between $5663 and $16,586 when they contacted the ombudsman in October 2014.\nThe cleaner and packers should have been paid a base rate $21.69 an hour and up to $54.23 an hour on public holidays, while the retail assistant should have been paid $21.21 an hour and up to $36.99 on public holidays.\nThe cafe chain has written a formal apology to the exploited workers, paid them owed wages, made a $5000 donation to the Asian Women at Work support group and will undergo workplace relations training and hire external accountants to audit its practices.\nMs James said her office had launched a pilot program to engage multicultural communities and help migrant workers and international students understand their rights at work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T21:45:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
