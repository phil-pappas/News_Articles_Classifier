They are big players in Treasury bond auctions and act as market makers in the secondary market. \nThe pension fund said its \"expert economists\" observed wide gaps between when-issued and auction prices around December 2012, but that these gaps narrowed significantly as the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulators began probing alleged manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, a benchmark used to set interest rates for trillions of dollars worth of loans around the world. \n\"The only plausible explanation for the sharp break,\" the fund said, \"is that defendants felt the heat of the DOJ's ongoing investigation into Libor, and ceased their efforts to manipulate the Treasury securities market because defendants' Treasury traders feared that they too would be prosecuted.\" \nMedia reports last month said the Justice Department was also investigating possible collusion in Treasury auctions. \n\"The scheme harmed private investors who paid too much for Treasuries, and it harmed municipalities and corporations because the rates they paid on their own debt were also inflated by the manipulation,\" Michael Stocker, a partner at Labaton Sucharow, which represents State-Boston, said in an interview. \"Even a small manipulation in Treasury rates can result in enormous consequences.\" \nThe lawsuit seeks class-action status on behalf of investors in Treasury securities, including futures and options, from 2007 to 2012, and unspecified triple damages. \nSpokespeople for Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman, HSBC and UBS declined to comment. Other banks had no immediate comment or were not reached. \nThe case is State-Boston Retirement System v Bank of Nova Scotia et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-05794. \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler) \n--", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T04:48:39.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
