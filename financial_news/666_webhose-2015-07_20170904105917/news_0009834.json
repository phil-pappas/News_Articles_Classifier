By Kate Palmer | Telegraph – 15 hours ago 18.39 -1.23 \nTwo-minute briefing: after an industry crackdown on 'green' energy tariffs, we explain where your 'green' energy really comes from - and what it costs \nRenewable energy (NasdaqGS: REGI - news ) firms have reported a boom in customer numbers despite rock-bottom wholesale coal and gas prices, suggesting that householders are willing to pay a premium for so-called 'green' tariffs. \nThe tariffs, with their green credentials and good customer service records, have increased by around a third on last year, firms report. \nAnd new rules designed to shake up Britain’s rip-off energy market could prompt an unintended boom in similar tariffs. Renewable tariffs were popular a few years back but have shrunk after rules restricting suppliers to just four energy tariffs were introduced in 2010. \nNow (NYSE: DNOW - news ) , the Competition and Markets Authority says the policy has “stifled innovation” as none of the Big Six suppliers offer green tariffs to new customers. They can be still found at smaller firms such as Ovo, LoCO2, Ecotricity and Good Energy (LSE: GOOD.L - news ) . \n• Five reasons to be wary of green energy investments • Budget blow to investors in solar power \n= How much do they cost? = \nGreen tariffs are costlier than the cheapest deals on the market - yet still fall below the average price charged by the Big Six suppliers. \nGood Energy, which grew by 28pc last year in customer numbers, offers a market leading tariff of £1,100 to £1,200 for its dual fuel customer, based on typical use. The major firms - British Gas, SSE (LSE: SSE.L - news ) , Scottish Power, E.On, EDF (Swiss: EDF.SW - news ) and npower - charge £1,236 on average. \nIt could work out cheaper to opt for a firm with a greener-then-average energy mix. The Co-op, for example, supplies 68pc renewable energy, compared with 17pc across all suppliers, and is far cheaper at £944 for dual fuel. \n= Will I only use renewable energy? = \nIf you're on a green tariff, the energy you use in the home won’t be 100pc renewable. Power is still drawn from the National Grid (LSE: NG.L - news ) where just 17pc of energy is from renewable sources with the rest produced from coal (34pc), gas (26pc) or nuclear (22pc). \nHowever, the power pumped back into the nation's network by your energy firm will be renewable - including wind, solar, biomass or hydro energy - to match your energy use. \n= Are they as green as they seem? = \nConscientious householders may be disappointed to find out that their \"renewable\" or \"green\" energy tariff is unlikely to increase the amount of clean energy being generated or reduce carbon emissions. \nCustomers already pay around £40 a year for renewable energy costs as part of Britain's obligation to source 20pc of its energy from green sources by 2020. \nEnergy firms could simply assign some of the renewable energy they are already obliged to supply to you while reducing the green energy they supply for their other customers. \nBut a crackdown by the regulator, Ofgem, means that energy firms must clearly say if a green tariff fails to offer any environmental benefit other than those that customers already pay for. \n= Are there other ways to make my energy bills greener? = \nA lesser-known type of green tariff that provides \"social benefits\" could be about to launch on the energy market. \nOvo, the small energy supplier with 17,000 customers, has already announced plans to offer a tariff which funds improvements like tree planting, carbon offsetting and green urban spaces. \n>> The best of Telegraph Money: sign up to our weekly newsletter \n- kate.palmer@telegraph.co.uk", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T11:52:34.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
