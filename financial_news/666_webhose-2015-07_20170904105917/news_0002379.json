All of the sources wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. \nLSE declined to comment while CITIC did not respond to a request for comment. Financial News reported earlier this month that CITIC had emerged as frontrunner in a shortlist of bidders for Russell. \nThe Shanghai Composite Index has tumbled 28 percent since mid-June, ending a rally that had previously seen the market double from its June 2014 low. \nTowers Watson & Co (NasdaqGS: TW - news ) and China's Shanda Group, an investment holding group that started out as an online game company, also bid for Russell \nLast week insurance broker Willis Group signed an $18 billion agreement with Towers Watson & Co to combine the companies in an all-stock deal with an implied equity value of about $18 billion. That deal could make it difficult for Towers to proceed with an acquisition of Russell, one of the sources said. \nTowers Watson declined to comment. \nIf the deal is completed, it would end a long period of uncertainty for Seattle-based Russell Investments, which had $272 billion in assets under management at year-end. \nLSE bought Russell from insurer Northwestern Mutual last year for $2.7 billion, primarily for its large index business. The exchange operator prevailed over a number of interested buyers, including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (NYSE: CM - news ) and a handful of private equity firms, sources said at the time. \nLSE tapped JPMorgan Chase (Swiss: JPM.SW - news ) to sell Russell Investments earlier this year after having informal conversations with at least three interested buyers including CIBC.
