Shares in the FTSE 100 company jumped 3.1pc on expectations that IHG would now return the proceeds from both disposals to investors. \nHong Kong skyline \nThe Hong Kong sale does not end IHG’s involvement with the luxury hotel, however. As part of the deal, the company retains a management contract that could be extended to as long as 67 years. \nFees from the agreement will initially amount to about $8m each year, and will rise after the hotel’s new owner refurbishes the property. \nIHG has sold nearly 200 hotels over the past 12 years and returned more than $10bn in cash, as it moves away from owning sites to managing them. \nRichard Solomons, chief executive, said the latest deal “completes the disposals of our major owned assets”. \nThe company will announce its decision on cash returns following the Paris and Hong Kong transactions at its full-year results in February. Analysts at Citigroup (NYSE: C - news ) cautioned that IHG could decide to use the money for acquisitions instead. \nIndeed, speculation of M&A in the sector has been growing and there has been talk that IHG could merge with American giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T16:41:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
