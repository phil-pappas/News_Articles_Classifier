The intention is that other jurisdictions will fall in line. \nThe most recent FSB report comes on the heels of an earlier report published back in July 2014 by the OSSG, which laid out a number of recommendations. The Recommendations \nThe earlier report recommended: There should be a strengthening in existing IBORs and other reference rates based on unsecured bank funding costs by underpinning them to the greatest extent possible with transactions data. These enhanced rates are termed “IBOR+”. Steps should be taken to develop alternative RFRs, given that there are certain financial transactions, including many derivatives transactions, that are better suited to reference rates that are closer to risk-free. Progress \nAccording to the report released today, progress has been made in a number of areas, including: reviews of respective benchmark methodologies and definitions, data collection exercises and feasibility studies, consideration of transitional and legal issues, and broad consultations with submitting banks, users and other stakeholders. \nAs well as the three major “IBORs”, reforms are also being seen in other jurisdictions. \nAs well as the three major “IBORs”, reforms are also being seen in other jurisdictions. Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Mexico, Singapore and South Africa have all taken steps to reform their own existing rates. \nIn relation to the development and introduction of RFRs, the report notes additional progress. In particualar, “detailed data collection exercises have been undertaken in key markets, and work is now underway to identify potential RFRs, where these do not currently exist. In addition to authorities in the euro area, Japan, UK and US, several other OSSG members are also working with industry in local markets to develop RFRs in their respective currencies.” \nPundits can expect another update from the FSB regarding interest rate benchmark reforms in July 2016, as they continue to monitor progress. \nGot a news tip?
