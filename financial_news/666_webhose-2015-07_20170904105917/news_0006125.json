But the proposal he should adopt is the one he made in 2011 about income taxes rather than the one he is making now about the GST.\nOn Monday, Baird proposed raising the GST to 15 percent from 10 percent.\nBut back at the Federal Tax Summit in 2011 Baird had a different and better solution which was to give the states a guaranteed share of income tax.\n\"In order to better share the income tax base, the Commonwealth should quarantine a proportion of income tax which would then be discretionary funding for states to use to meet service requirements,\" NSW Treasury then suggested.\"\nPrime Minister Tony Abbott and NSW Premier Mike Baird on Monday. Ben Rushton Now no one likes paying income tax.\nBut then no one likes paying GST either and according to a recent paper by Patricia Apps, professor of public economics at the University of Sydney, filling the gap in state government health funding by lifting income tax would provide better incentives for work and be better for women than raising the GST.\nThat is certainly not the government's view. Joe Hockey has argued that raising income tax rates is bad for the economy because it discourages people from working harder. On the other hand, the GST taxes consumption rather than income which removes that disincentive.\nMost criticism of the GST is on the grounds that it is regressive, which means that it hits the poor hardest. Baird's offer of wide compensation solves that problem.\n The NSW premier wants full compensation for households on incomes up to $100,000 and part compensation for households up to $150,000. Only the rich will pay more. It is hardly the plan of a Liberal politician.\nBut Apps argues that the problem with Baird's plan for the GST is that it could have a far worse deterrent effect on hard work, especially for women, than an equivalent rise in income tax.\nThe compensation problem The reason is not the rise in the GST itself but the likely structure of the compensation package that Baird proposes with it.\nThe problem is that a large part of the compensation will come in the form not of tax cuts but of increases to benefits. The carbon tax compensation package in 2012 included $8 billion of tax cuts but $5 billion of benefit increases.\nThose benefits such as parenting and family benefits are means tested against household income which means the payments reduce by up to 60¢ for every dollar that anyone in the household earns.\nThat is a punitive effective marginal tax rate. The impact on workforce participation is probably more significant than a rise of a few percentage points of the marginal income tax rate across the board.\nWomen who are part-time employed or thinking of returning to work are often the worst affected. After losing half of their benefit and paying childcare, travel and other expenses, it just doesn't make economic sense. Because the compensation package extends the people receiving benefits it also means more people face the trap of losing them when they start to work more.\nProfessor Apps in a paper this year titled \"The central role of the income tax in the modern economy\" argued that promoters of GST are ignoring the deterrent to work from the structure of means-tested compensation packages.\n\"Compensation for those on low income for a rise in the GST requires cash transfers which if income tested will raise effective tax rates for low income earners known to have responsive labour supplies.\"\nEven Federal Treasury in its \"Re:think\" tax discussion paper this year said income tax if rightly done was a fairly good tax. \"Individuals income tax is usually considered to have a comparatively moderate impact on the behaviour of most people, and relatively minor adverse impacts on economic growth and living standards.\"\nRaising income tax could be achieved by lifting marginal tax rates, perhaps a modified version of the Victorian proposal for a flat Medicare style levy, or by reducing the various tax breaks such as superannuation or negative gearing.\nBaird should go back to his starting point in 2011.", "external_links": ["https://taxpolicy.crawford.anu.edu.au/files/uploads/taxstudies_crawford_anu_edu_au/2015-07/patricia_apps_final_paper_27-28_april_2015.pdf", "https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/sasha-project/afr-prod/2015/07jul/gst_fundinggap_hype/index.html", "https://sasha-project.s3.amazonaws.com/afr-prod/archive/responsiveJSV2/pym.min.js"], "published": "2015-07-22T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:58:07.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
