FT Money has looked at the tensions that can bubble to the surface with a disparity in earnings and responsibilities. Avoiding burnout \nRegardless of their earning status, eight of 10 married females do more chores than their spouses, according to the IPPR study. \nAnd any salary gap tilted in the woman’s favour is a source of significant tension between 22 per cent of couples in their twenties and 14 per cent of those in their thirties, a study of 2,000 people by UK investment manager Nutmeg found. \nThe US-based Family Wealth Advisors Council (FWAC), in a new study of female breadwinners from around the world, finds they take on 75 per cent of financial planning responsibilities, while making 90 per cent of consumer spending decisions. \nSome female higher earners have been able to make their lives work without burning out or heading to the divorce courts . Ms Greil Castro and her husband, a part-time software engineer, have forged roles with which they are comfortable. One important lesson cited by many female earners is to resist the urge to take control of the domestic issues, including, most importantly, the family finances. \nThis seeming reversal of roles, the study concludes, “can cause conflict in the household itself”. \nMs Griel Castro says she ensures her husband takes an equal role in financial decisions, even though she brings in the money. \n“I very much want to include him,” in meetings with a financial adviser, she says. “Just because he doesn’t earn the money doesn’t mean he doesn’t have any brains. I very much value his contribution and his opinions. He has valuable insights that greatly differ from mine.” \nJanet Thornton is founder and managing director of Inspired Energy, an energy consultancy based in Lancashire. She says she is careful to make sure her husband Matthew, who is also on her company’s board of directors, is an equal partner in every aspect of their home life. That includes financial planning. \nThe approach they take, Ms Thornton says, is to “have Matthew take the lead on our finances, although we also have a central pool,” for wages and assets. While their salaries are not the same, they put their earnings into a joint account. ©Asadour Guzelian/Guzelian \n“There is no accounting to each other,” on individual spending, says Ms Thornton, although the couple have agreed broadly on “what we can and can’t spend” and will consult each other on big purchases, such as cars. \nFarnoosh Torabi, a US-based personal finance commentator and author of When She Makes More , strongly advises that female breadwinners build as much equality into the family finances as possible. \n“I think the healthiest structure is to divide the earnings into three clear channels: what’s yours, what’s mine, and what’s ours,” she writes. \n“No matter how much money the man makes, he needs his own financial autonomy,” she says. “Plan for him to carve out 10 to 15 per cent of his paycheck every month into his own personal account”. The author also suggests couples establish shared accounts for day-to-day expenses and for joint goals, with each contributing an amount they can afford. Tip #1 for female breadwinners \n1) Share the wealth management load. Playing an equal or even a dominant role in the family finances gives male partners, who may have given up their professional status to stay at home and raise a family, the intellectually challenging task of shaping and building a portfolio of investments \nThis equality model can be crucial for making female breadwinners’ partnerships work, says Eileen O’Connell, co-founder of Washington-based financial adviser Hemington Wealth Management. \n“Half of my job is marriage counselling,” she says. When advising affluent women, the demographic group targeted by her firm, she makes sure to “suggest bringing along and including the husband”. This not only relieves the women of doing the lion’s share of the financial planning, it enables the couple “to jointly figure out what works for them, so that money does not become a reason for divorce”. \nSome of her clients take extreme measures to avoid letting their bigger salaries rankle with their husbands, Ms O’Connell says. When managing one couple’s Individual Retirement Accounts (US savings plans with tax breaks), she was asked not to put names on the paperwork, “so it was IRA number one and IRA number two”. \nOther female breadwinners choose sometimes to hide their status on the grounds that discretion is an easier way to handle the situation. \nJo Haigh is both the chief executive of corporate finance house FDS and a regular speaker at the UK’s Institute of Directors, where she lectures mostly male audiences on how to conduct mergers and acquisitions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T05:37:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
