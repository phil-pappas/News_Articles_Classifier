Read on to know why. \nWhat better time than this to invest in Pune? The large number of unsold flats in Pune has been valued to be worth more than INR 48,500 crore. In the last one year, the number of unsold homes has risen from over 2.34 lakh homes to over 2.8 lakh home this year. Though prices have not gone down, the good news for home buyers is the prices are flat. The ever cautious home buyer is expecting it to break through this holding line and dip further to make the purchase. \nHowever, the large number of unsold apartments in Pune is not an indictment of the city and its environs which continue to be the second most popular city for home buyers, according to a recent survey. That Pune continued to hold this position since the earlier survey in 2009 speaks volumes about the livability of this city which has a lot to offer. \nLocation: \nManjri like many of the areas in Pune has witnessed a lot of demand from home owners. There are many reasons why the demand is high in this area. The first reason is the location; Manjri is located near the National Highway 9 which connects Pune to Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Machilipatnam. It is also located near areas such as Viman Nagar, Magarpatta, Hadapsar and Kharadi, all within an 8 km radius, which are popular with the young professionals employed in the Information Technology (IT) industry. \nThe area is also close to the international airport as well as the railway station. Manjri has a good social infrastructure of hospitals, schools, retail and restaurants. \nThe IT Connect: \nManjri is located close to IT hubs such as Magarpatta and Kharadi which makes it a popular choice among the IT professionals. The proximity to IT hubs will also ensure that there will be a high demand for rentals. Real estate sources say that homes which are smaller, more compact are in demand these days. People are also opting for smaller homes as domestic help is hard to come by. Surveys revealed that the highest demand was for 2 bedroom, hall, kitchen (bhk) units, a category which constitutes more than 50% of the total supply. \nAffordability: \nThe prices in Manjri have been appreciating over the past one year. During the period April to June 2015 the prices for apartments in Manjri stood at INR 5100 per sq ft on average. As a comparison, just check the prices in posh localities such as Boat Club Road, the average prices here are about INR 16,000 per sq ft. \nWhatever be the current market scenario, the fact remains that Pune is a wise investment decision. Just 150 km from India’s financial capital Mumbai, Pune is not just the second largest city in Maharashtra but also the eighth largest urban agglomeration in the country. The opening of the Mumbai- Pune Expressway opened up the city like nothing else did. Though the city has always been a centre of manufacturing, the second major boom for real estate was the advent of the IT industry. The migration of highly skilled labour and professionals ensure that there will always be a high demand for rentals too. \nSince there has been a general slowdown in the real estate market across the country, some experts feel that this is a good time to invest in real estate. However, it is also the time to drive a hard bargain as most builders would want to get some return on their own investments. \nNina Varghese for IndiaProperty.com \nImage: “Mumbai-PuneExpressway” by Mouleesha – Own work.
