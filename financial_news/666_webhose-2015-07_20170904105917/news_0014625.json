Right: Desmond Homard's Tudor Oyster Prince and original watch check logbook. by Bani McSpedden Tudor, long known as Rolex's junior sibling, has been breaking out of the conservative cast with a rash of adventurous models inspired by the past. The latest is the North Flag , a watch that can trace its beginnings to a true torture test. In 2014 Major Desmond \"Roy\" Homard​, who, before his death in May was one of the last surviving members of the 1952-54 British North Greenland expedition, rediscovered his official issue Tudor Oyster Prince after having mislaid it for half a century. Little did he know it, but at the same time finishing touches were being made to a new model that would bring to mind the feats his watch had endured.\nWe'll get to that, but first things first. Homard found his Tudor at the back of a drawer in the kitchen of a house he'd lived in since 1961, some 60 years after his return from arduous months in Greenland. The watch was still wearing the extended strap designed for fitting over arctic overalls. His find came to the attention of Tudor, and the watch now resides in much upgraded surrounds - the brand's museum.\nHomard explained how the mystery unfolded: \"My wife wore the Tudor while I was away on the Antarctic expedition [in 1956] – and then it vanished. One day five months ago, I noticed the box was still in my writing bureau, but the watch wasn't in it. So I searched everywhere and looked in all my drawers, but I couldn't find it and couldn't imagine what had happened to it. It bothered me and I went through every drawer in the house, and there it was - in the back of a kitchen drawer of all places, hidden among things that must have been there for years.\"\nGiven the ruggedness of the expedition, it's remarkable the watch survived at all. But there was no forgetting its legacy, and the watch that perpetuates it is Tudor's fittingly named North Flag, released this year.\nA tribute is apt. The North Greenland mission involved endurance, exploration and living for an extended period in some of the harshest conditions on Earth, not helped by record low temperatures and seasons of 24 hours darkness and 24 hours daylight. Its aim was to investigate and record the terrain and geology of the North Greenland ice cap, with 26 scientists, military and medical experts working together to carry out seismic and gravitational research.\nAccurate timekeeping was essential, and each member of the team was issued with a Tudor Oyster Prince, a watch launched just that year (1952) and built for tough pursuits. It was waterproof, self-winding, and the brand was anxious to prove its credentials. It was agreed that team members would log the performance of their watches. Bear in mind that Tudor had been operational for only half a dozen years at that point, set up by Hans Wilsdorf​, the founder of Rolex, to meet a particular niche: a watch that \"could sell at a more modest price than a Rolex [but] one that would attain the standard of dependability for which Rolex is famous\".\nTesting times And put to the test it was. The first challenge the Greenland expedition faced was getting the team and their equipment to the various camps, staging posts and observation stations involved. A dedicated supply ship, the Tottan​, carried the heavy equipment as well as the dog teams, and initial airdrops by the RAF were followed by on-going air support. Once on the ground, transport involved large packs of huskies and sleds, tracked vehicles. Reconnoitres were carried out by foot to determine safe passages.\n According to contemporary accounts drama was rarely absent. Reaching the main base, named North Ice, was a 370 kilometre trek. To supply the base, the RAF had developed a technique of \"free dropping\" non-fragile items, without parachutes. Flying at around 15 metres across the frozen terrain, crates and supplies were jettisoned, their angle and height calculated to hit the soft snow, roll, bounce and stop without damage.\nThis was effective but dangerous; on one such mission a Halifax aircraft flying at a mere 10 metres above ground was caught in a white out, and a wing tip touched the snow causing a pancake landing. The crew was forced to camp out in the fuselage of the wrecked plane, using parachutes four deep for protection from the elements.\nAt the heart of the scientific agenda were enquiries into specifics of the region, such as the rate at which the ice sheet grows in winter and retreats in summer. There was also a planned program to determine human endurance and performance under the harsh conditions of the Arctic. One of the outcomes was confirmation that eight hours sleep is on average the amount demanded by the body. For one month, the explorers were allowed to sleep at any time they wanted during the 24 hour nights of the Arctic winter. They averaged 7.9 hours a day.\nOur hero Major Homard joined the expedition in 1953 with the job of maintaining - and often coaxing back to life - the tracked vehicles used by the expedition to navigate the ice cap. These were Studebaker Weasels, a Second World War personnel carrier designed for use in snow. The expedition used eight, which because of their weight could not be airlifted in, but had to be landed by ship 320 kilometres to the south then driven to the expedition site - after a delay to allow the intervening sea to freeze.\nSome of the narrowest escapes of the expedition occurred when the specially modified vehicles fell into crevasses and gullys. Just as climbers rope together, so did the convoys, which saved the lives of two expedition members whose vehicle plummeted 12 metres into a crevasse before stopping, taking their two fully loaded trailers with it.\nIt was in these conditions that members of the expedition were required to keep logs of the performance of their Tudors, recording their accuracy against radio signals broadcast by the BBC. One expedition member, Captain JD Walker of the Royal Engineers, felt moved to write to Tudor after his experience: \"Having recently returned to England after 13 months with the British North Greenland expedition, I should like to express my extreme admiration for the Rolex Tudor Oyster Prince which I wore on my wrist throughout my tour with the expedition. My duties necessitated many varied activities, from stores humping and hut building to driving Weasels and dog sledging on the ice cap. Temperatures varied from 70 degrees Fahrenheit to -50 degrees, and on many occasions during the thaw period the watch was unavoidably immersed in water.\n\"Despite these trials, occasional time signals broadcast from England proved that my Rolex Tudor Prince watch was maintaining a remarkable accuracy. On no occasion did it require to be wound by hand. When on the ice cap away from base for several weeks at a time, it was of inestimable value to have on my wrist a watch whose accuracy could be depended upon at all times.\"\nWith accolades like that it's no wonder the brand took to an advertising campaign in magazines, extolling the values of \"the watch that roughs it in Greenland\".", "external_links": ["http://www.tudorwatch.com/en/north-flag/"], "published": "2015-07-30T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:14:58.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
