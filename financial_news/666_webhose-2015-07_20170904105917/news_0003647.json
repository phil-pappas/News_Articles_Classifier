Photo: Rob Homer\nBHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group are certain to meet, and are a good chance to beat their iron ore export guidance for the 2015 financial year, in another gloomy portent for junior miners trying to survive in an over-supplied iron ore market.\nShipping data compiled by the operator of Port Hedland suggests the stormy weather that slowed Rio Tinto's exports from Cape Lambert over recent months was less of a problem 226 kilometres to the east, where BHP and Fortescue's port operations are based.\nExactly 111,745,388 tonnes of iron ore left Port Hedland during the June quarter, and with port tenant Atlas Iron known to have reduced its exports during the period as it worked through a survival plan, the vast majority of the shipments belonged to Fortescue and BHP.\nThe two miners needed to ship 37 million tonnes and 62 million tonnes respectively during the June quarter to meet export guidance, and with Atlas Iron certain to have shipped less than 7 million tonnes, it is clear at least one of BHP or Fortescue, if not both, have beaten their export guidance.\nAdvertisement The analysis of Port Hedland data fits with expectations from the major investment banks.\nUBS analyst Glyn Lawcockâ€‹ estimated earlier this month that Fortescue had exported 42.3 million tonnes in the June quarter; enough to beat the top end of its export guidance at 165.3 million tonnes for the year.\nAnother analyst, RBC's Chris Drew said FMG would go close to the \"top end\" of its guidance at 164 million tonnes for the year, while Mr Drew predicted BHP would beat annual guidance at 251 million tonnes.\nIron ore remains the biggest money-spinner for both BHP and Fortescue, and confirmation of the strong export numbers next week should provide some consolation for shareholders amid weak prices for the bulk commodity.\nBHP and FMG will publish their production and shipping numbers for the 2015 financial year on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, and the event shapes as an awkward one for Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest, whose company will likely be confirmed as Australia's fastest growing exporter of iron ore.\nMr Forrest has criticised BHP and Rio for flooding the market with iron ore in recent months, yet Fortescue's 33 per cent export growth over the past year will be shown to be significantly higher than BHP's 12 per cent export growth and Rio's 11 per cent export growth.\nFortescue's export growth is likely to be greater in terms of actual tonnes as well.\nThe two companies, and particularly FMG, will be judged as much on their cost of production as their export performance, as shareholders increasingly look for investments that can survive in a lower price environment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:54:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
