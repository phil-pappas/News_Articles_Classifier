More Regional airports outpace southeast hubs \nThe proposals follow a review published in January in which the FCA said the UK’s £700bn savings account market gave consumers a poor deal by not providing enough clear and simple information about how to access better rates. \nIn 2013, for example, £160bn was held in “easy access” savings accounts that earned only 0.5 per cent interest — the Bank of England base rate. \n“In a good market, providers should be competing to offer the best possible deal,” said Christopher Woolard, the FCA’s director of strategy and competition. “Consumers should expect the information they need to shop around to be clear and easy to understand. When they wish to move accounts, they should be able to do so with the minimum of fuss. \n“Our package of measures are all about giving consumers the information they need to make an informed decision about what to do with their savings, and the ability to act on it quickly.” \nMeasures include forcing providers to remove complex jargon and help customers understand their options; being clear on what interest consumers are getting and when the rate might change; and quicker and easier switching between products. \nThe FCA said it would also publish information on which groups pay the lowest rates, particularly to longstanding customers. \nMartin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said it was “staggering that it has taken this long before someone finally tells banks they need to clearly tell customers what interest rate they’re getting on their statement”. \nBut he cautioned that clarity would leave people “shocked about the . . . low rates they are achieving”. \n“The only way to earn real savings interest is to be a savings tart — chucking what you’ve got where it pays best and disloyally moving your money again and again to ride the wave of best buys. Do that right now and interest as high as 6 per cent is possible, not the paltry sub-1 per cent rates most people are earning.” \nRachel Springall, finance expert at the Moneyfacts consumer website, said the seven-day switching guarantee for Isas would help savers, but cautioned that it alone would not change the market. \n“Implementing any changes to speed up the switching process and make it easier is encouraging, but the fundamental reason why people lack the incentive to chase down a better deal is due to the poor rates on offer.” \nConsumers and the industry have until October 12 to comment on the proposals, after which the FCA will decide whether to amend them. A spokeswoman said any new rules would likely to come into effect in the middle of next year. \nThis is the latest in a series of tough measures unveiled by the FCA, which gained a reputation for fearlessness towards the banking sector under outgoing chief executive Martin Wheatley . \nMr Wheatley, who was forced to step down after the increasingly business-friendly Treasury decided not to renew his place on the regulator’s board next year, said on Wednesday he was “disappointed to be moving on” and “did so with a sense of unfinished business”. \nAdditional reporting by Adam Palin Related Topics Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.
