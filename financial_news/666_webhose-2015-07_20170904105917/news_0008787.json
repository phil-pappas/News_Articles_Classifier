At 0905 BST, the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 and France's CAC 40 were flat, while Germany's DAX was 0.1% lower. \n\"Yet more disappointing earnings from the US and a slip in China's Manufacturing PMI has traders concerned that all is not well with the global economy,\" said Jonathan Sudaria, night dealer at London Capital Group . \nStocks in Asia fell after the preliminary China Caixin purchasing managers index for July came in weaker than expected. It dropped to a 15-month low of 48.2, missing analysts' expectations for a reading of 49.7 and below the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion. \nEarnings were in focus again as worries about Greece faded into the background - for now at least - with Athens due to resume talks with creditors over its third bailout. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Air France (Paris: FR 31122 - news ) - KLM (Shanghai: 600686.SS - news ) surged as investors welcomed revenue growth and news that it was still on track with its cost-cutting plans, despite the company reporting a fall in operating profit for the second quarter. \nFrench defence company Thales (Paris: FR0000121329 - news ) rose sharply after its first-half profit beat expectations. \nIn London, publisher Pearson , which announced on Thursday that it has sold the Financial Times newspaper group to Nikkei for Â£844m, was in the black after raising its dividend. \nVodafone was also on the front foot after saying it has made a good start to the year, with organic service revenue up 0.8% in the quarter ended 30 June as the European businesses return to growth and customer demand for 4G and data takes off. \nOn the downside, German chemicals company BASF dropped into the red after its second-quarter earnings fell short of market expectations. \nShares in temporary power provider Aggreko (LSE: AGK.L - news ) tumbled after it said its interim and full-year results are likely to miss market expectations, as a result of ongoing security challenges in Yemen and a further slowdown in its North American oil and gas related business.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T14:05:05.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
