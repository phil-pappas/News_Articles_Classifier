Yes there is,\" former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson says. James Alcock Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Matthew Cranston Former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson has joined the chorus of top economists concerned about problems with Sydney's heated housing market but has told political leaders not to talk down prices.\n\"Is there an issue of house prices in Sydney? Yes there is,\" Mr Parkinson told a QUT Business Leaders Forum in Brisbane.\n\"Do we have a bubble? I think that is the wrong question to be asking. We should be asking why house prices are so high and there are two reasons: first Sydney is becoming an international city and there has been an inability of state governments to take a sufficient forward view of what is needed to be done for land release,\" he added.\nDr Parkinson's comments follow current Treasury secretary John Fraser's airing of house price concerns. He told a budget estimates hearing in June that Sydney was \"unequivocally\" experiencing a house price bubble .\nReserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens has said Sydney house prices were \"crazy\" and the issue has been bubbling up in national political debates with Prime Minister Tony Abbott having accused Opposition Leader Bill Shorten of talking down house prices .\nDr Parkinson said it was wrong to even consider talking down prices despite concerns with affordability.\n\"I don't see that there is a role for national level politicians trying to talk down house prices rather the role for politicians should be to put in place structural reforms that lead to an increase in housing supply,\" he said.\n\"If you don't do anything to increase housing supply and you simply talk down prices what's the point? You won't get anywhere.\n \"The only way you will get house prices to grow more slowly or to fall is by expanding supply. Supply is the problem.\"\nNow read about the six signs of a Sydney housing slowdown .", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/102874628957085545973/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/mcranston1"], "published": "2015-07-14T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:06:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
