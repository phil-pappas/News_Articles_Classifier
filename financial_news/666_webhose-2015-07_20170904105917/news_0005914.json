A changeover at the top is a traditional time to raise capital, and Mr Jenkins himself undertook a £5.8bn rights issue in 2013 , within a year of taking over at the bank. \nOne way to improve the bank’s capital position is to run down its non-core units, including some investment bank trading positions. Mr McFarlane may accelerate this process, but Bernstein’s Chirantan Barua believes this will take two to three years, and the bank needs capital sooner than that. \nOn the day his appointment as executive chairman was announced, Mr McFarlane said he had “no plans to raise equity” and would instead bolster the capital position through internal changes. But Mr Barua thinks this plan may be pushed off course. \n“The regulator the last time around seemed to have given the bank five years to beef up capital,” said Mr Barua, noting the bank’s core capital ratio of 10.6pc is the lowest among the UK’s largest banks. \n“But given the risk on the balance sheet, the potential liquidity and credit risk in the markets, it throws up a significant chance of the bank being pushed to beef up in the next 12 months.” \nHe added that the pressure could grow on Barclays to raise more funds if Standard Chartered’s new boss, Bill Winters , goes ahead with a rights issue, as it would make Barclays’ capital position look worse in comparison. \nBarclays' chief Antony Jenkins was sacked this month, after less than three years in the job (Credit: Bloomberg) \nMr Barua also predicts a slowdown in the investment banking market, hitting Barclays’ earnings in the coming years, as well as increased competition hurting growth in Barclaycard, a unit which has been a star performer in recent years. \nHowever, other analysts have a more positive view of the bank. Nomura’s analysts have a \"Buy\" rating on the stock, arguing that Mr McFarlane’s faster reforms to the investment bank should be positive. \nJoseph Dickerson, from Jefferies, also views the bank favourably. He expects Mr McFarlane to accelerate the rundown of the non-core investment bank units, which is made up of those parts which Mr Jenkins had already pledged to cut . Mr Dickerson also predicts a shift in the investment bank away from the capital-intensive trading units and into the more profitable business of underwriting equity and debt fundraisings for corporate clients. \n“Cutting back on trading assets and redeploying the capital savings into higher return advisory and underwriting businesses could lift the investment bank's earnings by 15pc,” he said. \nBarclays declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T19:31:05.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
