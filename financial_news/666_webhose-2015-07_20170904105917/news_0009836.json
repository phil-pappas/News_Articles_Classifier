With a large amount of space offered by Medibank Private leased over the quarter, the information sector has over taken finance & insurance as the largest provider of availability.\nStrengthening demand for office space with flexible sizing options has underpinned a lease deal at Hickson Road in the Sydney CBD.\nCBRE Office Services Associate Director Ben Cohen said tenants were increasingly attracted to buildings that offered them the ability to expand their floor space to support future head count growth.\n \"Some landlords are providing flexibility for growth by allowing tenants to have first right of refusal over additional space in office buildings,\" Mr Cohen said.\nAt 36 Hickson Road in the Sydney CBD, international design firm Gensler was granted first right of refusal on the 130 square metre office space above its current tenancy.\n\"Due to Gensler's strong covenant and brand profile, the landlord provided further flexibility by agreeing to a shorter than usual initial term of two years, with a one year option,\" Mr Cohen said.\nHe added the rise of communal meeting spaces was another emerging trend, with tenants opting to pay on a per-use basis opposed to having internal space within their tenancy.\n\"Serviced office companies have been the traditional space solution providers for tenants with future growth plans and have been able to offer shorter term leases, as well as additional pay-per-use meeting space,\" Mr Cohen explained, citing new co-working start-up in the USA WeWork as an offshore example.\n\"This is being seen as the new 'Uber' of office space, where tenants become members to utilise office facilities and also take advantage of the community atmosphere and networking opportunities.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T22:22:52.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
