Getty Images by BEN ROTHENBERG World-class croquet lacks the surrealism of the Queen of Hearts' game in Disney's animated film \"Alice in Wonderland,\" as playing cards are replaced by rigid hoops often barely wide enough for a ball to pass through. Competitive croquet also does not include the tactical spitefulness of stepping on one ball while sending an opponent's ball flying into the backyard shrubbery, as in the 1988 dark comedy \"Heathers.\"\nWhat top-flight croquet does have, albeit less captivating, are talented players often reeling off perfect shot after perfect shot without much interruption.\nThough now synonymous with tennis, Wimbledon's grass courts were born from croquet. One of the first sports that allowed men and women to play on equal terms, croquet surged in popularity in Victorian England, and in 1868 the All England Croquet Club was founded.\n\"Croquet began to take off, and it became quite popular among the more landed gentry,\" said Chris Williams, the archivist for the Croquet Association, the sport's governing body in England. \"But it was never really a spectator sport. It was more a sport for playing. Tennis effectively pushed croquet out.\"\nAccording to a 2014 survey by Sport England, the number of people who played tennis at least once a month was 779,200, while the number playing croquet was 11,900. If the game of mallets and hoops (often called wickets in the United States) was on its way out, the courts were here to stay. Croquet's flat, closely shorn lawns proved perfect for the trendy new game of lawn tennis, and two tennis courts could fit into one croquet court (the current dimensions of tennis courts come in large part from the regulations for croquet play).\nNine years after it was founded, the All England Croquet Club held its first tennis championships, and the name was amended to the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club. Croquet was removed from the name within five years before being restored in 1899 to the name that endures today: the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, or the All England Club.\nIn the early 1920s, the club moved 1 mile from its home near the Wimbledon train station to its current location, but croquet did not follow. Croquet was part of the club only in name until 1953, when the sport was reintroduced to commemorate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The lone croquet lawn was removed in 2007 to make way for the new No. 2 Court. A year later, three croquet courts were added to an adjacent property owned by the club. But tennis is still king here, particularly during Wimbledon, when the croquet lawns are converted to practice tennis courts.\n\"We have a lot of tennis players practicing and doing a bit of physical aggression to our wonderful croquet lawns,\" said Michael Hann, the honorary secretary of the club's croquet section. \"It was founded as a croquet club, but tennis is far more exciting. People dashing around and sweating, all this sort of stuff. We are a club which is 99.9 percent lawn tennis and 0.1 percent croquet. But we still enjoy it.\"\n 'We're not all old fuddy-duddies' Hann said most croquet players at the All England Club were former tennis enthusiasts like himself who were no longer able to actively play and found croquet to be physically less demanding. He said only about 25 of the roughly 350 Wimbledon members participated in croquet.\n\"I'm sorry to tell you the section is not increasing by that much,\" Hann, 77, said. \"We're not all old fuddy-duddies; we have some younger people that play, but they have lives to lead and tennis to play.\"\nLiving on in England Croquet is similarly dwarfed across England. According to a 2014 survey by Sport England, the number of people who played tennis at least once a month was 779,200, while the number playing croquet was 11,900.\nThe All England Club does not field croquet teams in larger interclub competitions, instead limiting itself to eight exhibitions a year - four away from the club while its lawns are being used for tennis, and four at home after the tennis world packs up and moves on.\n\"It's a pleasure to bring these people to the club and show them around,\" Hann said. \"We play in the morning, then we have lunch in the main clubhouse, and then we play in the afternoon, we have tea, and we all go home.\"\nBut croquet is not just a way to occupy time between lunch and tea. About 6 miles southwest of Wimbledon, the Surbiton Croquet Club is the site of this year's British Open Championships, one of the world's top croquet tournaments. The 50 participants (48 men and two women) traveled from four continents to compete for honor, if not fame or fortune.\nBen Rothman, 31, of Oakland, California, is the top-ranked player in the United States. He wore a stars-and-stripes ensemble on the Fourth of July, the first day of play, testing the all-white dress code that croquet maintains (albeit less rigidly than Wimbledon does).\nRothman said a croquet publication once listed him as the world's leader in prize money won; he had earned $4,500. But he has found rare full-time work in the sport as a croquet pro at the Mission Hills Country Club near Palm Springs, California, during the six cooler months of the year, which are the peak season for the desert resort. An easy explanation of what he does for a living proves elusive.\n\"Most people wonder if that's a thing, if you can actually be a professional croquet player,\" said Rothman, who first picked up the sport at his uncle's home in Bar Harbor, Maine. \"The introduction to it is usually I have to see if people have ever played backyard croquet, and sometimes people are familiar because they play on the Fourth of July or Memorial Day with their family, and dust off their old croquet set in the garage. And if they're not familiar with that, then I have to ask if they've ever seen 'Alice in Wonderland' and go over that description, explaining that we don't use flamingos or hedgehogs.\"\nTV tedium? Rothman said he thought there could be a TV audience for croquet - if it were packaged properly.\n\"You could edit it creatively, with good commentary, to actually make something very watchable,\" he said. \"Like the World Series of Poker, where 20 hours of poker has them throw away the 19 1/2 hours of folded hands.\"\nWhile the appeal of the game in its Victorian origins and in its backyard varieties has long involved its playful social aspects, the elite levels of the game can verge toward tedious. Excellent, steady croquet is often devoid of the more difficult, breathtaking shots necessitated by less proficient play.\nDoug Grimsley, 65, a retired furniture salesman from Vienna, Virginia, who is also participating in the British Open, was once reminded of this in backhanded fashion by Robert Fulford, a Briton whom Grimsley called the Babe Ruth of croquet.\n\"Robert Fulford told me I was a much more exciting player than he was,\" Grimsley said. \"And it wasn't a compliment.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:08:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
