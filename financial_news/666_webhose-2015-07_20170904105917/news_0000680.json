Once the boost ran out and growth faltered, debt levels rose quickly.\nIreland, Portugal, Cyprus and Greece have received international bailouts since the start of the euro zone debt crisis and growth across the bloc is expected to be muted for years to come.\n\"There is some evidence of divergence among the early adopters of the euro, given that over 15 years a number of relatively low-income countries have maintained (Spain and Portugal) or even increased (Greece) their income gaps with respect to the average,\" it added.\n\"Moreover, Italy, initially a higher-income country, recorded the worst performance, suggesting substantial divergence from the high-income group,\" it added.\nGovernments also kept in place rigid and protected product and labour market structures with little ability to flexibly adjust wages, exacerbating the effect of the crisis as currency devaluation could no longer be used to reestablish competitiveness.\nWith capital allocated to low productivity sectors, part of the protectionist framework, even relatively high productivity sectors suffered, weighing on overall growth.\nMeanwhile, late jointers Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia have recorded the highest degree of convergence among the EU countries, the ECB added.", "external_links": ["https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/eb201505_article01.en.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-30T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T14:45:12.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
