Fittingly, the buyers are \" Middle Eastern royalty .\" \nThe comedian bought the home in 1988 and lived there until her death in September of last year, as we reported when it hit the market earlier this year. \nShe'd listed it in 2009 and then again in 2012-2013 but apparently wasn't terribly serious about it; she'd told the New York Times that she just wanted to \"placate my business manager\" and that any buyer would \"have to come in with a bag full of money, otherwise we're not going to do it.\" \nRivers' daughter, Melissa, took over her late mother's affairs and relisted the penthouse at 1 East 62nd Street in February. Despite its earlier trouble selling -- and in defiance of one expert's 2012 prediction that any serious listing effort would require someone to \" get a decorator in there and make it sort of bland,” because \"people have no imagination, and to get past Joan Rivers’s stuff, you’ve got to have a lot of imagination\" -- the penthouse this time around attracted multiple offers and is thought to have sold for all cash. \nThe home clocks in at about 5,000 square feet and occupies the top three floors of a seven-story mansion built in 1903. The building was converted to condos in the 1930s. \nRivers' unit has four bedrooms and five bathrooms plus a two-bedroom guest apartment. There are two terraces, one of them overlooking Central Park. \nHer private office included a cheetah rug and pillows embroidered with homilies (\"Life is uncertain, eat dessert first\") and her own coinage: \" Don't expect praise without envy--until you're dead.\" \nThe entryway to Joan Rivers' home is up these stairs. It's likely that a neighbor or two scoffed as they went by during various phases of her feuds with them. \nAs board \nThe entryway to Joan Rivers' home is up these stairs.
