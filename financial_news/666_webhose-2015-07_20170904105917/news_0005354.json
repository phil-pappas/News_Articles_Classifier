The goods news is they are now the outliers.\nThe second piece of good news is that several have publicly said they are about to rectify the situation. The bad news is that they needed to be badgered into doing it.\nIn years gone by, the number of gender offenders was large enough that all could hide or at least find comfort in the size of the pack.\nHowever, if after years of being pushed by numerous bodies including the ASX and the Institute of Company Directors, they still haven't got the message, their inertia on gender thus far suggests they have a positive bias against even a token element of diversity.\nKerry Stokes has no women on the Seven board.

Photo: Simon Alekna\nThe latest salvo being launched at member companies of the men-only directors club is coming from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which represents owners of about 10 per cent of the shares in the top 200. It is threatening to use its voting power against diversity-devoid companies and has written to the boards of companies with none or only one female director, seeking an explanation and news on any plans to rectify the situation.\n\"We are seeking tangible commitments and evidence from these companies that they have strategies for achieving gender diversity at board level in the near term, rather than the sometimes surprisingly vague statements often made to comply with ASX Corporate Governance Principles,\" ACSI chief executive Louise Davidson said.\nIt would be fascinating to delve deeper into the psychology of the gentlemen who comprise these 32 boards, particularly their chairman. Are they older than the average director? Do they come primarily from male-dominated industries such as mining? The list of 32 has has an (albeit only small) disproportionate skew to resource companies.\nLet's name a few. Evolution Mining, Karoon Gas, Mineral Resources, Northern Star Resources, and Syrah Resources.\nPerhaps a more telling theme among many of the group is their ownership structure of a dominant individual or family legacy shareholding. Names such as Kerry Stokes' Seven Group Holdings, Chris Corrigan's Qube Holdings, Len Ainsworth's Ainsworth Game Technology, David Teoh's TPG, the former Kermode family-dominated Cabcharge, the Anderson family's Technology One, the Hosking family's Karoon Gas, and founder and chief executive Silvu Itescu who has a 21 per cent stake in Mesoblast – they all make the hit list.\nThe clear takeout from this list is these companies have more a private-company culture – one that pays less attention to modern-day corporate governance principles.\nThe dominance of one shareholder has to date enabled them to escape or ignore broader pressure from minority shareholders on issues such as diversity.\nAll the 32 companies represented on the list seem to have also turned a blind eye to the weighty studies containing clear evidence that diversity enhances financial performance.\n\"There is growing evidence of links between gender diversity and financial performance in companies, which suggests that in more-difficult economic climates, boards that do not have more0diverse make-ups and skills to draw on may well suffer.\"\nThe most regularly cited report on the subject was undertaken recently by Credit Suisse, The CS Gender 3000: Women in Senior Management, which found that: \"Greater diversity in boards and management are empirically associated with higher returns on equity, higher price/book valuations and superior stock price performance\".\nSouth Australian senator Nick Xenophon also used the Credit Suisse analysis to support his recent bill that aimed to introduce a 40 per cent quota on female membership of government boards.\nWhile ACSI's focus this week has been on those among the 200 companies with no female directors, it has a broader objective of pushing for 30 per cent representation across this group by 2017.\nOne of the world's largest investors, BlackRock, is another powerful organisation that is chiming into the debate. It recently released a report, saying while the initiatives seeking 30 per cent women on boards should be achievable within the next few years, the gap between women in the boardroom and women in executive ranks remains high.\nIf there are insufficient numbers of women coming up through the management ranks, the talent pool from which to choose appropriately skilled female talent may ultimately be compromised.\nThe statistics show the larger companies are more aware of the diversity needs – all the top 100 companies now have at least one female director and a couple, Mirvac and Medibank Private, are 50 per cent or above.\nBut on average only 25 per cent of the directors among the top 200 are women.\nFor those boards that suggest they could not find any suitable female candidates, they could think about hiring the same headhunters used by the 35 top 200 companies that have managed already to get to 30 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T07:42:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
