The increasing complexity of the market has often been blamed for the technological glitches that appear to be occurring with some frequency on the country&apos;s stock exchanges.\nOn Wednesday, the New York Stock Exchange halted trading for three and a half hours to fix a computer malfunction. While NYSE is one of the biggest U.S. stock-trading venues, it is still just one of 11 exchanges and more than 50 private venues where American equities change hands. As Bloomberg News reported , while todayâ€™s issue affected transactions on NYSE&apos;s main market, and indexes derived from prices generated by that venue, investors could still buy and sell stock elsewhere.\nIn other words, all that stock market complexity has a silver lining . If one trading venue goes down, there will (hopefully) be plenty of alternatives still working.\nHere&apos;s a chart, published by Credit Suisse in 2013, illustrating the rising complexity of America&apos;s stock markets. The red dates show the advent of new stock trading venues, while blue indicates technological milestones and gray new regulation.\nSource: Credit Suisse (Not shown is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&apos;s recent effort to \"strengthen the technology infrastructure\" of the country&apos;s stock market.)", "external_links": ["http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370543496356\\", "http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-07-08/don-t-panic-market-fragmentation-will-save-you-\\", "http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iaGeyb77xZmU/v1/460x260.jpg\\"], "published": "2015-07-09T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T23:15:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
