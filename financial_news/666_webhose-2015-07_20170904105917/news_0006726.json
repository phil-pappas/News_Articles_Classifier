To take note of, over the weekend analysts at Charles Stanley (LSE: CAY.L - news ) issued a very critical note regarding Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's apparent indication on 16 July that Bank Rate should perhaps rise sooner than financial markets were then expecting - out towards the middle of 2016. \nIn their opinion the Governor was incurring in another bout of 'Carnese', to the further detriment of his history for making accurate predictions. \nwading into the debate of when Bank Rate will first rise, analysts at Citi wrote to clients that the UK is not a satellite of the US, however \"at present, we do expect the MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) will start to hike a quarter or two after the Fed, reflecting (1) lower 2015-16 inflation outlook for the UK; (2) less weight on financial stability arguments for tightening in the UK; (3) greater sensitivity at the BoE (Shenzhen: 000725.SZ - news ) to risks that early tightening could produce an undesirably sharp FX appreciation.\" Yields on benchmark on US Treasury notes of a similar maturity advanced by two basis points to end the day at 2.37%. \nBunds were flat with their yield holding at 0.76%. \nJudging the risk of Grexit to have receded, JP Morgan decided to recommend investors sell eight-year German Bunds and switch into Spanish instruments of the same maturity. \n\"We see upside for these trades from a positive macroeconomic backdrop and ECB QE support,\" Jan Loeys, chief market strategist at JPMorgan (LSE: JPIU.L - news ) said in a research note sent to clients. \nSpanish 10-year bond yields were one basis point lower to 1.94% by the end of trading, alongside a retreat in Italian bond yields to a seven-week low of 1.91%. \nIn two research reports sent to clients on 17 July analysts at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) mentioned the possibility that the European Central Bank might yet extend its debt purchase programme past the current expected end date of September 2016. \nThe French Treasury got off €7.04bn in bills of various maturities, slightly less than the €7.4bn which had been targeted. \nAn afternoon sale of $48bn in Treasury bills maturing in three and six months saw bid-to-cover ratios slip versus the last time around. \nEconomic data was sparse on the ground on Monday. \nFactory gate prices in Germany slipped by 0.10% month-on-month in June, after a flat reading in the month before, the Federal Office of Statistics said. Analysts had been expecting a reading of -0.10%. \nIn comparison to a year ago producer prices were up by 1.4%. \nHome prices in the UK edged higher by one tenth of a percentage of a point in July when compared to the month before, for a year-on-year gain of 5.1%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T07:23:31.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
