Despite a new pole being erected in the drive within a week and a cable being run to the outside of our property we still don’t have the services. \nI have rung TalkTalk more than 12 times and the call centre has promised to escalate the matter. It has given me three different dates when an engineer will call. No one has arrived. \nI run my own building company and have spent extra money on mobile phone calls and internet charges in order to keep contact with my business. BF, Worcs \nSoon after I spoke to TalkTalk your telecommunications were, at last, reconnected. \nTalkTalk tells me your situation demonstrates the pitfalls of depending on a residential account while running a business from the premises. It says that, in such circumstances, it prioritises business accounts which have a better service level agreement. \nYou naturally remain disillusioned and are considering moving to another provider at the end of your contract. To say sorry, TalkTalk has provided three months’ free internet access and calls. \n• If you want to contact Jessica, click here \n• TalkTalk complainer toolkit: all the contact details you need to get your complaint resolved", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T14:07:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
