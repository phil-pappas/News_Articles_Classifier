Now we're told we can't build the most sophisticated equipment on the face of the planet.\" Alex Ellinghausen by John Kerin Spending $50 billion on foreign built submarines could trigger electoral woe for the Abbott governmnent which goes far beyond losing seats in South Australia at the next federal election, the State's Labor Premier Jay Weatherill has warned.\nSpeaking following an address to the National Press Club in Canberra Mr Weatherill said he believed if Mr Abbott spent \"$50 billion in someone else's country\" it would trigger a broader national debate about the type of smart manufacturing Australia aspires to and what constituted jobs in the \"new economy\".\nSome South Australian Liberal backbenchers broke ranks on Tuesday to warn the State was facing an electoral wipeout at the next federal election unless the Prime Minister commits to building the replacement class for the Collins submarines in Adelaide.\nThe Liberal's claimed Matt Williams seat of Hindmarsh, Christopher Pyne's seat of Sturt and Andrew Southcott's seat of Boothby were all under threat.\nTo soothe concerns Mr Abbott said he would give an \"absolute guarantee\" there would be more submarine jobs in South Australia no matter which bidder triumphs in a competitive evaluation process.\n\"I think the federal government will not only suffer dramatic losses in South Australia if they don't keep their promise [to build the subs in South Australia]...it will become a national economic issue.\n\"This is a hot button issue and if the Commonwealth government makes the wrong decision about this it will be a central issue at the next federal election...across the nation,\" Mr Weatherill said.\n\"We're told in South Australia we can't make cars. Now we're told we can't build the most sophisticated equipment on the face of the planet [submarines].\n \"What does it say about the ambitions for a nation that's not prepared to back itself in to have the talent, the skills and capacity to have an industry of this sort,\" Mr Weatherill said.\nMr Abbott has maintained there will be 500 extra jobs in Adelaide no matter which submarine is chosen.\nBut South Australian Liberal MPs fear there will be fewer jobs with a Japanese submarine given the French and Germans have both offered to build the bulk of the fleet in Adelaide and have experience in joint ventures with other countries.\nThe acquisition process has come in for heavy criticism from the opposition and analysts who allege it was put together to give the appearance of competition to cover a preference for a Japanese submarine as part of a strengthening of strategic ties between the two countries.\nJapan would not have accepted an open tender given sensitivities surrounding its decision to abandon its postwar pacifist stance and embark on arms exports.\nThe 4200-tonne Japanese Soryu-class submarine, German firm TKMS' Type 216 and French firm DCNS' non-nuclear version of its 4700-tonne Barracuda submarine are being examined as part of the 10-month competitive evaluation process.\nAll three builders have been asked to put options for an offshore build, a hybrid build and an Australian build.\nIt was reported on Wednesday that Japan and Sweden's Saab may make a joint bid for the project though the Swedes were excluded from the Competitive Evaluation Process.\nBut a defence spokesman said there \"have been no changes to the Competitive Evaluation Process\".\n\"[However] the Japanese, French and Germans are free to work with third parties,\" the spokesman said.\nSaab Kockums makes the propulsion systems for the Soryu class so some sort of sub-contracting tieup is possible between the two as part of the project.\nThe Japanese government threw Mr Abbottt a lifeline in January when Tokyo indicated for the first time it was willing to enter in to a joint build of the Soryu with Australia which would preserve some jobs in Adelaide.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:55:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
