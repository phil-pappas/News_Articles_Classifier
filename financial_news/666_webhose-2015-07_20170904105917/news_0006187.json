That sent revenues in the trading division down 28pc year-on-year, an even sharper decline than those suffered by rivals JP Morgan, Jefferies and Bank of America Merrill Lynch . \nHowever, the investment banking arm performed well, thanks to rising advisory fees, while the investment management division also brought in higher revenues. This largely offset the weak performancein the trading division, leaving the bank's overall revenues for the quarter at $9.1bn - 0.6pc lower than last year. \nProfits, however, fell 49pc to $1.1bn, as the bank set aside funds to cover legal bills. Shares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Goldman Sachs dipped 1pc on the news. \nChief executive and chairman Lloyd Blankfein said he was happy with the bank's underlying trading . \n“We are pleased with our performance for the quarter,” he said. “While uncertainty in the EU weighed on investors’ level of conviction, many of our businesses continued to benefit from generally improving economic conditions and healthy client activity.” \nMeanwhile, Goldman's rival Citigroup reported healthier numbers. \nProfits increased 2pc to $4.8bn, the highest quarterly figure in eight years, as the bank chopped back costs and its legal bills dropped sharply . In part, those savings came from lower staff numbers - headcount at Citi has fallen 3pc to 237,000 over the past 12 months. \nThe improvement is also a sign that the bank's lengthy internal reforms are coming to an end. Restructuring costs tumbled 85pc to just $61m in the second quarter, from $397m in the same period last year. \nCitigroup's chief Michael Corbat has led a lengthy restructuring of the sprawling banking group (Credit: Bloomberg) \nCiti's private bank experienced good growth, with revenues up 13pc to $746m, while costs associated with bad loans dropped 9pc. \nThe bank even avoided much of the pain in the fixed income trading market, reporting revenues of $3.1bn, down just 1pc. \nHowever, the investment banking business did not perform as well as Goldman's. A 34pc rise in advisory revenues failed to offset a 3pc fall in debt underwriting revenue and a 24pc plunge in equity underwriting. That left divisional revenues 4pc lower at $1.3bn. \n“Our results for the quarter show very balanced performance across our business lines,\" said chief executive Michael Corbat. \"Through active expense and balance sheet discipline, we are on track to reach our financial targets for the year.” \nCiti's shares rose 2.55pc in early trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T19:25:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
