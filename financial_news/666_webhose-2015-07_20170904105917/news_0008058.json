It’s the latest sign of how divorced the nation’s $7.5 trillion market has become from economic fundamentals amid unprecedented government intervention to prop up share prices.\n“There is a clear detachment between fundamentals and the movement of stocks on the mainland,” said Gerry Alfonso, a sales trader at Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co. in Shanghai. “The poor factory data should have had a bigger impact.”\nProspects for economic expansion and corporate earnings have become almost irrelevant to Chinese equity investors after policy makers ordered government-linked funds to buy shares and gave a state-run finance firm access to more than $480 billion to support the market.
