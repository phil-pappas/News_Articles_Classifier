Jay Inslee set to sign new two-year state budget; partial government shutdown averted \nBy RACHEL LA CORTE Published: 6/30/15 9:48   9:50 pm EDT \nOLYMPIA, Washington â€” Gov. Jay Inslee was expected to sign Tuesday a $38.2 billion two-year state operating budget that cuts tuition for college students and puts more money toward the state's K-12 education system. \nInslee was initially set to sign the measure Tuesday afternoon, but delayed the signing as lawmakers continued their work to get a state construction budget to the floor and voted on. The House passed the $3.9 billion budget that pays for local projects across the state on a 96-2 vote, and the Senate was expected to vote on it later in the evening. \nInlsee's office said that the operating budget would be signed later in the evening, hours ahead of the current two-year fiscal cycle. Lawmakers had moved swiftly to pass the budget Monday night in order to avoid a partial government shutdown that would have started Wednesday. \nThe bipartisan budget agreement spends an estimated $1.3 billion on K-12 basic education, and it phases in tuition cuts at the state's universities, as well as community and technical colleges. \nBy the end of the second year of the budget, the state will reduce the cost of tuition at the University of Washington and Washington State University by 15 percent, students at the remaining four-year universities will see a 20 percent cut, and tuition at community and technical colleges the state's colleges and universities and community colleges will get a 5 percent cut. \nThe budget also fully pays for collective bargaining agreements for state employees and raises for teachers, and it puts more money into the state's mental health system and other social service programs. Lawmakers also took action addressing a voter-approved initiative to reduce class sizes that would cost $2 billion over the next two years if implemented. \nThe House voted late Monday night 72-26 to delay that measure for four years, but the Senate hadn't yet taken a vote on it by Tuesday evening because of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans in that chamber over a bill that Senate Democrats want that would temporarily eliminate the need to pass a science test to graduate from high school. \nThe House had also been expected to take a vote Tuesday on a $16.1 billion transportation revenue bill that includes an 11.9 cent incremental increase in the gas tax, but by Tuesday evening it wasn't clear whether they had the votes to bring it to the floor. The Senate passed the 16-year plan Monday night. \nAlso Tuesday, Inslee signed into law a measure that makes several changes to the state's new recreational marijuana market, including eliminating the three-tier tax structure and replacing it with a single excise tax of 37 percent at the point of sale. To encourage more cities and counties to allow marijuana businesses, the bill directs the state to share pot revenue with jurisdictions that do so. It would also allow them to adopt more flexible zoning for where pot grows and stores can be located. Sen.
