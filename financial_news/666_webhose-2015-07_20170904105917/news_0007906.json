The objective of the Directive is to provide for a regulatory framework for the operation of the mortgage credit market which is harmonised in a number of areas and which Member States will be required to comply with in order to protect consumers. In particular, the Directive aims to develop a more transparent, efficient and competitive internal market by implementing strong protections for consumers when seeking mortgage credit, while promoting sustainable lending and borrowing. \n\nThe Directive, however, contains a number of discretions for Member States in the context of its transposition into domestic law and these discretions were the subject of a public consultation process in the latter part of last year. Nine responses were received from consumer and industry stakeholders. These submissions were taken into account in the decisions that have now been made on each of the national discretions. These decisions, together with the public consultation submissions received, are now set out below. The Department of Finance, in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland other relevant public bodies, will now proceed with the drafting and other work required to transpose the Directive by 21 March 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:31:08.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
