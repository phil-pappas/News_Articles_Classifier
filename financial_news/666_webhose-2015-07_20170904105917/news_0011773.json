Commodities markets summary AAP â€“ 1 hour 0 minutes ago Recommend \nA summary of trading in key commodities markets overseas: \nENERGY \nOil prices have changed little, a day after precipitous falls, as traders worried about a global glut and the first rise in the US oil-rig count this year. \nOn Thursday, the last session of the week because of a US holiday on Friday, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for August delivery slipped three cents to $US56.93 ($A74.48) a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, sticking to its lowest level in more than two months. \nBrent North Sea crude for August, the global benchmark, inched up to $US62.07 a barrel in London, a gain of six cents from Wednesday's settlement. \nPRECIOUS METALS \nGold rebounded slightly from an earlier three-and-a-half-month low after data showed the US labour market was weaker in June than expected, indicating that the Federal Reserve may hold off from raising interest rates in September. \nUS job growth slowed in June, with 223,000 jobs added to the economy - less than the 233,000 expected. \nSpot gold slid one per cent to $US1,156.85 an ounce, the lowest since March 18, before the US data and was trading down 0.4 per cent at $US1,163.61 by 2.41 pm ET (0441 AEST). \nUS gold futures for August delivery settled down $US5.80 at $US1,163.50 per ounce. \nSilver rose 0.3 per cent to $US15.58 an ounce after dropping 1.3 per cent in the previous session. Palladium was down 0.8 per cent at $US690.75, and platinum fell 0.2 per cent to $US1,077.49. \nBASE METALS \nCopper prices are higher, buoyed by signs of healthier growth prospects for the metal's top consumer China and a sliding US dollar after weak US monthly jobs data. \nLME three-month copper closed up at $US5,795 a tonne from $US5,775 at the close on Wednesday. \nNickel rose to $US12,200 from $US12,025. \nTin ended lower, at $US14,450 down from $US14,545 a tonne. \nAluminium, constrained by oversupply, closed down at $US1,724 from $US1,727 a tonne. \nLead closed up at $US1,792 a tonne, rising from $US1,784 and zinc fell to $US2,022 from $US2,046 a tonne. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T02:01:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
