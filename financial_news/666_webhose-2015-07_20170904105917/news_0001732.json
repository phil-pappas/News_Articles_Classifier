The Index showed a 57 percent increase in sales made on mobile devices in June. Smartphones saw double the amount of purchases compared with tablets. \nThe figures revealed a growing gap between online-only retailers, and multichannel retailers with a physical and web-based presence. \nOnline-only retailers saw 13 percent year-on-year growth in June, while multichannel retailers saw 21 percent. \nSteve Hewett, head of retail customer engagement and loyalty at Capgemini, explained that this divide in retailers is down to how they offer services to customers. \n\"I'm particularly interested to see the impact that click-and-collect services have had on the performance of multichannel retailers compared with their online-only counterparts,\" he said. \n\"Capturing their customers' delivery needs has helped build a stronger connection between retailer and consumer, which is ultimately being reflected at the cash register. \n\"It will be key for the online community to capitalise on the current consumer confidence and find a way to build the same level of connection.\" \nHewett was also positive about the outlook for online retail for the second half of 2015. \"The significant growth in the market will be very reassuring to UK retailers who have thus far experienced a fairly turbulent 2015,\" he said. \n\"With a relatively settled post-election economy, consumer confidence should remain high and we can look forward to a solid [second half of the year].\" \nApple Pay is now available in the UK , making it even more likely that purchases in the physical world will be conducted thorough smartphones.
