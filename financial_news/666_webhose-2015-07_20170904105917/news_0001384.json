This is evidenced by the increasing number of homes selling in the $500,000 to $1 million price band since the GFC.”\nCoreLogic RP Data senior research analyst Cameron Kusher said mortgage rates were expected to remain low over the next 12 months.\nWith prices at record highs in southern states, more affordable parts of the country, including “certain pockets” of Brisbane and the Gold and Sunshine Coasts could see a lift in activity.\n“We would expect the dramatic differential in affordability in these areas relative to Sydney and Melbourne will drive more buyers to these areas,” he said.\nMr Carfi said the Brisbane market was expected to keep growing regardless of what occurred down south because it “remains significantly more affordable than Sydney and Melbourne”.\n“A huge drawcard to this location is the lifestyle that comes with it. You can live in a peaceful pocket of outer Brisbane yet have all the amenities you need right on your doorstep.”\nMirvac has just added the Queensland suburb Bridgeman Downs to its list of residential communities, with a flood of interest registered for its 26 Darien St blocks.\nLatest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show dwelling approvals were at high levels, with 19,414 approvals across the country in May, up 2.4 per cent over April and 17.6 per cent year-on-year.\nMr Kusher said the annual number of dwelling approvals had now gone to a record high in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.\n“These three capital cities accounted for 74.2 per cent of all capital city dwelling approvals over the past year. The data indicates that the heightened level of housing construction is persisting which is good news as the economy transitions away from mining investment. Housing construction has a significant multiplier effect throughout the economy.”\nOriginally published as Outer rim is luring Brisbane families ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Outer+rim+is+luring+Brisbane+families&c=BRISBANE%26%238217%3BS+outer+rim+is+seeing+an+influx+of+families+opting+for+wide+open+spaces.+Where+are+the+growing+communities%3F&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-outer-rim-is-drawing-families-who-are-on-the-hunt-for-wide-open-spaces/story-fndbalka-1227434817841?sv=bea7d5313592b4d181a9e4c6726ef507", "http://www.couriermail.com.au/realestate/news/brisbanes-outer-rim-is-drawing-families-who-are-on-the-hunt-for-wide-open-spaces/story-fnihpu6h-1227434817841", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-outer-rim-is-drawing-families-who-are-on-the-hunt-for-wide-open-spaces/story-fndbalka-1227434817841?sv=bea7d5313592b4d181a9e4c6726ef507", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-outer-rim-is-drawing-families-who-are-on-the-hunt-for-wide-open-spaces/story-fndbalka-1227434817841?sv=bea7d5313592b4d181a9e4c6726ef507&title=Outer+rim+is+luring+Brisbane+families", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-outer-rim-is-drawing-families-who-are-on-the-hunt-for-wide-open-spaces/story-fndbalka-1227434817841?sv=bea7d5313592b4d181a9e4c6726ef507&title=Outer+rim+is+luring+Brisbane+families", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-outer-rim-is-drawing-families-who-are-on-the-hunt-for-wide-open-spaces/story-fndbalka-1227434817841?sv=bea7d5313592b4d181a9e4c6726ef507", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/real-estate/brisbanes-outer-rim-is-drawing-families-who-are-on-the-hunt-for-wide-open-spaces/story-fndbalka-1227434817841?sv=bea7d5313592b4d181a9e4c6726ef507&h=Outer+rim+is+luring+Brisbane+families"], "published": "2015-07-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T08:30:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
