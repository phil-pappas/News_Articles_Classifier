The result, which excludes third-party purchases and operations at a venture with BHP Billiton Plc, topped the 82.5 million-ton average of eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe Rio de Janeiro-based company is expanding supply to a record 340 million metric tons this year while seeking to replace low-quality ore with premium products to improve profits. The expansion by Vale and its main rivals BHP and Rio Tinto Group coincides with an unexpected decline in demand from China, the biggest iron-ore buyer, prompting Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to forecast weaker prices in incoming quarters.\nVale, also the worldâ€™s largest nickel producer, said output of the industrial metal rose more than 8 percent to 67,100 tons, compared with a 73,900-ton average forecast by seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:02:39.435+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
