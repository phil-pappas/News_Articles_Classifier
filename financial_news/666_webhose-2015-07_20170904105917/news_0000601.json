Analysts expect the company to report earnings of 47 cents a share and revenue of $216.5 million for the third quarter. \nThe 3D printing company pulled its full year 2015 guidance citing \"limited visibility regarding the timing of improvements in growth.\" \n\"We believe our industry is transitioning through a period of slower growth, as users digest their investments in 3D printing and expand the utilization of recently acquired capacity,\" Stratasys CEO David Reis said in a statement. \nFor the second quarter Stratasys reports earnings of 15 cents a share, in line with analysts' estimates. Revenue grew 2.2% year over year to $182.32 million for the second quarter, in line with analysts' estimates. \nAbout 3.7 million shares of Stratasys were traded by 11:07 a.m. Thursday, above the company's average trading volume of about 1.5 million shares a day. \nTheStreet Ratings team rates STRATASYS LTD as a Sell with a ratings score of D. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation: \n\"We rate STRATASYS LTD (SSYS) a SELL. This is driven by a number of negative factors, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity, weak operating cash flow, generally disappointing historical performance in the stock itself and feeble growth in its earnings per share.\" \nYou can view the full analysis from the report here: SSYS Ratings Report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T18:26:55.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
