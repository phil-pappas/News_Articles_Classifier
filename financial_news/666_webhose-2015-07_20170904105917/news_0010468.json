His appointment is part of a routine reshuffle and is not expected to bring about a shift in Japan's currency policy.\nThe new vice finance minister for international affairs is likely to stick with the G7 and G20 commitment to market-set exchange rates and a policy that does not target currencies. Asakawa currently chairs the OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs, dealing with an anti-tax avoidance action plan known as the anti-BEPS (Base Erosion, Profit Shifting) directive.\nAsakawa is close to Finance Minister Taro Aso, having served as executive secretary when Aso was premier in 2008-2009, and as executive assistant when he became finance minister in 2012.\nAsakawa joined the ministry in 1981. His previous posts include director of the foreign exchange division for two years from July 2004. He also served as deputy vice minister for policy planning and coordination in 2013-14, liaising with the Bank of Japan.\nJapan last intervened in the markets in November 2011 to stem a strong yen. In 1998, it bought the yen to support the currency, when the country was grappling with the Asian financial crisis and its own banking crisis.\nAnalysts say yen-buying intervention is unlikely unless the dollar spikes to 130 yen. The Japanese currency is now trading around 122.6 yen to the dollar.
