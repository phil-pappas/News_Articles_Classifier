The UK benchmark closed out 1.14% lower at 6505 but today financial spreadbetters expect it to bounce back to a certain extent and open around 24 points to the good. The story of Chinese stock chaos has been a constant in recent weeks as investors could only look on to see the value of their shareholdings tumble - something seemingly they thought could never happen. Disappointing Chinese economic data on Friday contributed to yesterday's fall but the main catalyst was the fear of a withdrawal of the support measures which have been in place for about three weeks now. The IMF has also expressed its wish for China to allow market forces to sort things out. Investors around the globe will be watching Chinese markets again today. On Wall Street the Dow Jones lost 128 points to 17441 and the Nasdaq and S&P500 also lost ground as the Chinese effect rubbed off along with a clutch of disappointing company earnings data in recent days. Today sees the return of big company news with several reporting. Oil titan BP (LON:BP.) reports interims ahead  of a busy week for black stuff news which sees Royal Dutch Shell and BG also reporting. Some analysts are expecting BP's profits to fall 50% to 1.8bn due to the weak oil price. Meanwhile High Street favourite Next will deliver a second quarter trading statement after reporting solid first quarter growth. Next's shares fell after it reported its full-year results in March but have since rebounded strongly and reached record levels last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T19:36:00.702+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
