At least for now, it appears to be a foregone conclusion the film will deliver, he added. \n\"No matter how good or bad you think the film is, it was always going to open with $150 million or more,\" he told CNBC. \"Nothing's going to stop that when you put these two comic legends on the screen together.\" \nHow audiences respond to Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, is the biggest X-factor for Warner, Bock said. The character is pivotal to DC's shared universe and its \"Justice League\" film, Warner's answer to the Avengers. If fans reject Affleck, the studio may have to put another actor under the cowl, he said. Not just for 'comic nerds' anymore <p>A big year of change at Comic-Con</p> <p>CNBC&#039;s Jane Wells reports from San Diego&#039;s Comic-Con.</p> \nWarner will not only face casting scrutiny but heightened competition in the superhero genre. The battle for consumer dollars is intensifying, with ticket sales in decline and growth in foreign markets moderating, according to Cowen and Co . \nCowen analyst Doug Creutz said in a recent note that there's still an appetite for comic book adaptations and noted that their quality is on the upswing. \nHowever, the number of superhero releases per year will double in 2016, and history shows—most recently in the animated segment—that saturation leads to smaller box office hauls across the board. \nReliance on superhero films reflects a broader trend in which studios invest primarily in expensive franchises, he wrote. Creutz sees the lack of diversity increasing risk throughout the industry because big-budget sequels make for costly mistakes. In a crowded field, some are sure to fall short of expectations. \nRead More This gaming genre so tough to break into, Superman couldn't conquer it \nWhile Warner has traditionally had one of the more diverse release schedules, it is coalescing around marquee franchises such as DC Comics, Lego and Harry Potter franchises next year, said Creutz. \n\"We think Warner's track record over the last 15 or so years with franchise films has generally been best-in-class, but we also think that the gluts in the superhero and animation genres make their DC and Lego bets relatively high risk,\" he wrote. \nCrockett said it's unfair to lump all comic book adaptations together under the umbrella of superhero movies. Still, he warned it was imperative that Warner finds its niche this time around. \n\"It's very, very big business. It's very important for these companies,\" Crockett said. \"It's not just a plaything for our comic book nerds anymore.\" Tom DiChristopher Web and TV producer Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T18:57:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
