Glenn Hunt by Robert Harley As regulators try to cool the property market and banks make investor loans more expensive , it's worth reflecting on what can happen to off-the-plan apartment buyers when when housing markets turn.\nNothing illustrates the dangers more than the experience of those who bought off-the-plan apartments in high priced towers on the Gold Coast last decade.\nBuyers of off-the-plan apartments lock themselves into purchases that are not due to be completed for several years.\nSo far, in this boom, the experience has pretty good. The buyer has put down a 10 per cent deposit and then prices have risen 10 per cent. Essentially they have just made a 100 per cent profit on the initial investment.\nBut like all leverage in real estate, it can go very badly wrong when the market changes.\nFinance can change. Rates can go up and banks can change criteria like the loan to valuation ratio.\nInvestment returns can change. If many apartments are completed at the same time, tenants will have more choice, vacancy will increase and rents weaken.\nUltimately prices can weaken.\n On the Gold Coast last decade buyers were caught in the double whammy. Prices did fall, and the banks did tighten their loan to valuation ratio.\nA buyer who had committed to a $2 million off-the-plan unit, felt very comfortable with a $500,000 deposit in expectation that the bank would fund 75 per cent of the purchase price.\nBut when time came to settle, the value was less and the bank loan to valuation ratio was much lower. The buyer needed far more deposit to make the $2 million sale. Many simply did not have it.\nThen prices started to spiral down further as quick exits were made and the administrators stepped in.\nAustralia's current off-the-plan apartment boom may end far more benignly. But it is backed by an unprecedented number of offshore buyers and no one knows how they might react to negative market movements, on of offshore. So far all the movement, in currency and pricing has been in their favour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:03:54.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
