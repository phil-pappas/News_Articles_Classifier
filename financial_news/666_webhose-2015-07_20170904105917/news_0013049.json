Oil drillers and other energy companies fell sharply as the price of oil sank 4.7 percent. \nThe market declines were not as bad as many had feared, something analysts are crediting to the resignation of the Greek finance minister, which might help bailout talks resume. \nIn Sunday's referendum on creditor proposals, 61 percent of Greeks voted \"no,\" a much higher proportion than anticipated. Many in the markets fear that the decision has pushed Greece one step closer to leaving the euro. Greece's banks may soon run out of money and the country could be forced to issue its own currency. \nA so-called \"Grexit\" from the euro is considered to be one of the biggest risks facing the global economy. \n\"The prospects of Greece remaining in the eurozone have suffered a setback,\" said Bill O'Neill, head of the U.K. Investment Office at UBS Wealth Management. \"A deal to keep Greece in the eurozone remains possible, but the odds against a successful conclusion have now lengthened.\" \nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 71 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,660 as of 10:19 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gave up six points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,070. The Nasdaq composite fell 14 points, also 0.3 percent, to 4,994. \nThe U.S. market is coming off its sharpest weekly decline in three months. \nIn Europe, Germany's DAX fell 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France fell 1.9 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.7 percent lower. \nThere was little evidence Greece's troubles might affect other eurozone countries imminently. Government borrowing rates for Italy and Spain rose only marginally. \nOil prices took a big hit. The benchmark U.S. contract tumbled $2.75 to $54.21 a barrel in New York. \nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.33 percent from 2.39 percent late Thursday. U.S. markets were close Friday for Independence Day. \nThe U.S. market is coming off its sharpest weekly decline in three months. \nWith Greek banks still shuttered and the European Central Bank under pressure to stop its emergency liquidity measures, Greece may not have long to secure a deal with creditors. A meeting of the eurozone's 19 leaders has been called for Tuesday. \nSome hopes for progress in the talks grew Monday after Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis quit. His replacement, who has yet to be announced, may help unblock discussions with peers in the eurozone. Finance ministers also meet on Tuesday. \nOver months of negotiations, Varoufakis' relations with his peers in the 19-country eurozone had deteriorated significantly. \n\"The fact that Varoufakis has resigned hints that the Greek government may at least be offering an olive branch given his reputation for using aggressive terms such as 'water-boarding' to describe the creditors' actions,\" said Jane Foley, a senior currency analyst at Rabobank International. \nThe euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.1043. The dollar slipped 0.1 percent to 122.77 Japanese yen. \nEarlier in Asia, China's benchmark, the Shanghai Composite index, rebounded from last week's heavy losses after regulators and the securities industry intervened to prop up the markets, closing 2.4 percent higher. \nElsewhere, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index dropped 2.1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng sank 3.2 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 2.4 percent. \nIn the U.S., Aetna sank $5.84, or 5 percent, to $119.69 in early trading. The company agreed last week to buy rival health insurer Humana for $35 billion. \nPylas reported from London.
