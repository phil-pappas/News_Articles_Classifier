Source: Supplied\nAfter high school he worked full time and studied at night for four years, obtaining a Bachelor of Business before trying his hand at property investment. He then built a $3 million portfolio of properties and founded Dream Design Property to guide clients to begin their investment journey.\n“The first steps an individual takes as they embark on their career can be nerve-racking and anxiety inducing,” Ameer says.\n“As someone who never achieved high grades at school, yet persevered and started a successful business from scratch, I know that emotions and nerves can sometimes get the better of aspiring millionaires.”\nHere are his tips for turning your bad grades into a winning career.\n1. LOVE IT\n“Aspiring entrepreneurs figure out exactly what it is they love doing,” he says. “When an individual does what they love for a living, an 18-hour work day won’t really feel like work. It is this passion that helps me leap out of bed every morning.”\n2. WORK WHILE MAKING PLANS\n“Once an individual knows what they want to spend their life working on, it is crucial to develop a strategy that will make this a reality,” Ameer says. “The best time to do this is while working another full-time job to keep a consistent cash flow. Speaking from my own early experiences, a full-time job allowed me to plan for future success and keep a roof over my head.” Be patient ... Becoming a self-made millionaire won’t happen overnight.

SELL AND NETWORK\n“Aspiring self-made millionaires need to know how to sell,” he says. “Working in jobs based on performance and sales commissions strengthen these skills in formative years, and also provide valuable opportunities for networking. Your network is indicative of your net wealth, and maintaining a network of reliable contacts keeps doors open for future growth.”\n4. SELF-EDUCATE\n“Many self-made millionaires do not possess tertiary educational qualifications and have carved a successful path for themselves through self-education,” Ameer says. “I found that the simple habits like spending at least 15 minutes reading a book daily or attending business seminars gave me the opportunity to interact with similar-minded people and learn from the experiences of others who have already succeeded.”\n5. LOOK THE PART\n“Millionaires (do not make others privy to) how much money they make,” he says. “Instead, we place more value on how our accomplishments have contributed to overall net worth. The way an individual dresses, speaks and acts all contribute to this sense of worth and accomplishment. Before an individual begins making money, aspiring millionaires need to demonstrate they are confident and capable through their appearance.”\n6. BE PATIENT\n“Above all else, it is important to note that becoming a self-made millionaire will not happen overnight,” Ameer says. “If the above steps are followed, it may take at least five years to finally come to fruition but taking these steps into consideration will ensure aspiring millionaires find their passion and build a successful business around it.”\nPICK A JOB: www.careerone.com.au\nSTART EARLY: Schoolboys earning six-figures\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/six-steps-to-go-from-getting-d-grades-to-being-a-millionaire/story-fnkgbb3b-1227465072022?sv=e40d5367bdd86226ea69ef64ecb71824&h=From+school+dunce+to+millionaire", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/six-steps-to-go-from-getting-d-grades-to-being-a-millionaire/story-fnkgbb3b-1227465072022?sv=e40d5367bdd86226ea69ef64ecb71824", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/six-steps-to-go-from-getting-d-grades-to-being-a-millionaire/story-fnkgbb3b-1227465072022?sv=e40d5367bdd86226ea69ef64ecb71824", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/six-steps-to-go-from-getting-d-grades-to-being-a-millionaire/story-fnkgbb3b-1227465072022?sv=e40d5367bdd86226ea69ef64ecb71824&title=From+school+dunce+to+millionaire", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/six-steps-to-go-from-getting-d-grades-to-being-a-millionaire/story-fnkgbb3b-1227465072022?sv=e40d5367bdd86226ea69ef64ecb71824&title=From+school+dunce+to+millionaire", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=From+school+dunce+to+millionaire&c=ZAKI+Ameer+was+a+troublemaker+at+school+and+his+grades+were+disastrous%2C+but+now+he%26%238217%3Bs+a+property+millionaire.+Here%26%238217%3Bs+how+he+did+it.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/six-steps-to-go-from-getting-d-grades-to-being-a-millionaire/story-fnkgbb3b-1227465072022?sv=e40d5367bdd86226ea69ef64ecb71824"], "published": "2015-07-31T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T15:42:43.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
