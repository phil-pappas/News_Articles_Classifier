Today could have been the end of hope, but now we are starting a new chapter of hope.\" \nPresident Barack Obama said that the deal will mean that Iran would destroy 98% of its stock pile of weapons grade uranium, adding that it currently has enough for 10 warheads. \nHe said that it meant that \"all of Iran's pathways to a nuclear weapon (are) cut off\" as a result of it. \nAnd he added that it was a deal \"not built on trust\" like previous agreements, but \"built on verification\" that had the \"full backing of the international community\". \nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a long-standing critic of the talks, described the deal as a bad mistake of historic proportions. \nHe said: \"Iran is going to receive a sure path to nuclear weapons. Many of the restrictions that were supposed to prevent it from getting there will be lifted. \n\"Iran will get a jackpot, a cash bonanza of hundreds of billions of dollars, which will enable it to continue to pursue its aggression and terror in the region and in the world,\" he added. \nThe deal will include: \n:: UN inspectors can request visits to Iranian military sites as part of their monitoring duties, but not have an automatic right to visit whenever they choose. \n:: In the event that Iran refuses a request to visit, an arbitration board composed of Iran and the six world powers will have to decide on whether a visit should go ahead. \n:: Analysts say that the lack of an automatic right to visit is likely to be seized upon by critics, as it could give Tehran time to cover up any non-compliance by the time a visit takes place. \n:: Missile sanctions will not be lifted for another eight years and a general weapons embargo will remain in place for another five years. \n:: During the five years deliveries of arms to Iran would be possible if the UN Security Council approves the import. \n:: Iran will slash by around two-thirds the number of centrifuges from around 19,000 to 6,104 and will stick at this number for 10 years. \n:: In the event that Iran breaches the agreement, a 'snapback' clause is in place that will allow sanctions to be reinstated within 65 days of Iranian non-compliance. \n:: A roadmap has been drawn up to tackle remaining issues, which will be resolved by the end of 2015, including the issue of access to the Parchin military base. \nMany other countries welcomed the deal, hopeful that it could unlock trade after years of being unable to do business with Iran because of international sanctions. \nThe West has long been concerned that Iran holds ambitions to build a nuclear bomb. Tehran says its nuclear programme is purely to generate energy for civilian purposes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T14:28:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
