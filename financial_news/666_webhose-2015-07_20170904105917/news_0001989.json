Glenn Hunt by Tess Ingram and Angela Macdonald-Smith Macmahon Holdings's new chief executive Sybrandt van Dyk says the company \"definitely needs to win new work\" and his focus will be firmly on growth as he takes the helm of the struggling mining services group.\nMacmahon appointed Mr van Dyk as its new CEO and managing director on Monday, more than six months after former boss Ross Carroll resigned.\nMr van Dyk, who has been the company's chief financial officer since April 2014 and was previously an executive with Kerry Stokes' mining group WesTrac, said his initial goals were to continue repairing the company's balance sheet and grow the business.\n\"That has obviously been the missing event so far in the last few months – that is growth – and that will form a critical part of my focus in the short to medium term, how we grow the business both organically and maybe through acquisitions or bolt-ons,\" Mr van Dyk told The Australian Financial Review .\nMacmahon has been hit by a slowdown in the mining services sector and the loss of major contracts, including a $1.8 billion contract to work on Fortescue's Christmas Creek project, worth $260 million a year.\n'Any job is a good job' Mr van Dyk said organic growth would be a priority. The company is currently bidding for about $2.2 billion of work. He conceded that in the past, Macmahon may have given short shrift to smaller jobs, but in the current environment \"any job right now is a good job, if we can get it for the right margin\", noting the contractor continues to experience pricing pressure due to the ongoing volatility in commodity prices.\n\"Most of the clients we work with know what the commodity prices are and would have forward projected them off a lower base going forward so I feel quite comfortable that tender opportunity won't reduce overnight,\" he said.\n Meanwhile, the slide in iron ore prices has wiped out bidder interest in McAleese's half-owned Heavy Haulage Australia, the mining sector trucking company that was placed in administration last month and will now be wound up with the loss of more than 70 jobs.\nA \"promising\" level of initial interest from bidders dissipated amid the continuing fall in iron ore prices and the resulting pressures on the Australian mining sector, said voluntary administrator Brendan Richards of Ferrier Hodgson, who is predicting more pain to come for companies exposed to the decline in the industry.\nA Ferrier Hodgson spokeswoman said after two serious bidders in the running to take over HHA as a going concern dropped out, a third party expressed interested in buying a substantial part of the business but that potential deal fell through on Friday morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T10:42:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
