Photo: Jim Rice\nLiquidators have been appointed to Australian Securities Exchange-listed Shanghai gaming business Sino Strategic International, after the company failed to file company accounts over four years.\nOn Monday the Federal Court appointed liquidators from Pitcher Partners to rake over Sino Strategic's affairs.\nThe affairs of Sino Strategic have not been properly managed for some time and the assets of the company were at risk.\nASIC The court order follows an investigation by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission into the company over \"multiple\" breaches of the Corporations Act.\nASIC has also won a freezing order over a bank account held by Sino Strategic that has $115,300.\n Sino Strategic was listed in 1987 and its shares have been suspended since 2010.\nASIC found that along with failing to file accounts for 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, Sino Strategic had not held an annual meeting since 2010.\n\"The affairs of Sino Strategic have not been properly managed for some time and the assets of the company were at risk,\" ASIC said.\n\"Sino Strategic's continued failure to comply with the basic regulatory requirements of a listed company is contrary to the interests of the company's shareholders,\" the regulator added.\nThe company was fined $18,000 in November 2014 for failing to hold annual meetings and lodge financial reports with ASIC.\n\"ASIC is targeting poor corporate culture and poor governance practices in listed companies to ensure investors have confidence in the Australian market,\" ASIC commissioner John Price said.\n\"Failure to report to members and file accounts is unacceptable. ASIC will seek to wind up companies that disregard important legal obligations which exist to protect investors.\"\nIt's not the first time the company, which last traded at 28Â¢ a share, has courted controversy.\nIn 2012 its former executive chairman Theodore Cheng Chee-tock, 63, was found guilty of fraud offences in Hong Kong, newspaper reports said. No other current Sino Strategic board members or executives were accused of any wrongdoing in the fraud case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T13:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T09:48:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
