Irina Danilova Share on twitter by Jennifer Hewett Senator Eric Abetz is not known for his sense of nuance. Redefining marriage according to the latest fad would be opening a Pandora's box of potential possibilities, he suggests. A box that might even contain (gasp) polyamory.\nNaturally, I had to look that word up to be sure of the exact meaning. Perhaps I had missed some explanation as to why the minister suggests having more than one partner would be more common in same-sex marriages than heterosexual marriages. I am still no clearer. Nor do I think it's a lack of imagination on my part.\nBut Senator Abetz is convinced that public opinion will turn \"when the community is informed on the actual impact\" same-sex marriage is having in other countries.\nThe main problem, according to Abetz, is that Australians are being fed a completely unbalanced view by the media and non-government politicians. So he wants to know why the vote against gay marriage in the Austrian legislature got less attention than the US Supreme court's ruling in favour of a constitutional right to marry someone of the same sex, for example. Presumably he believes the coverage given to the Irish referendum was also unfair.\nIt's hard to know where to start with this. I do admit to a personal bias. After all, I had 26 years of usually happy, sometimes snappy and always funny marriage to my late husband, Peter Ruehl. Three children later, I remain addicted to the concept of marriage. I still do love a church wedding (hint to offspring).\nBut I was also delighted when my daughter's American gay godfather was finally able to marry his long-term partner in Washington DC in a civil ceremony, due to the application of federal laws in the US capital.\nYes, fathers and mothers do tend to have different approaches to child rearing along with many other issues in life. It's also why my husband's favourite saying was \"women are crazy, men are stupid\". That doesn't mean all marriages between men and women are an automatically superior way of raising children. Just look at the divorce statistics for heterosexual couples. Or the welfare statistics for single mothers. Why isn't Abetz, leader of the government in the Senate, equally agitated about this Pandora's box?\nChange is inevitable Admittedly, I am part of the media that Senator Abetz is accusing of overplaying the issue. But until now I have resisted writing about it because I think change is inevitable and because there far more difficult issues and contentious challenges for this country to face. Senator Abetz's ministerial area of responsibility, industrial relations, would certainly count as one of them. (Unfortunately his official role is more like Minister without Portfolio. This is partly due to the government's refusal to even discuss most possible industrial relations reforms. It is also due to the Senate's refusal to contemplate modest and sensible changes, such as a return of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. As usual, the Labor Party is too dependent on the unions, the Greens are too busy being greenish and who would know with the independents? The Abbott government has other legislative priorities to negotiate through the Senate and seems too spooked about the political legacy of Work Choices to make the case for change. Clearly, Senator Abetz feels no such hesitancy on the subject of same-sex marriage.)\nYet a growing majority of Australians now favour the idea and the trend appears irreversible. I only wish the media still had the power to influence the public in one direction as Senator Abetz believes. Instead, the polls reflect a major cultural shift that has occurred quite quickly over the past few years, for a whole range of reasons. Even Abbott says he is the only one in his own family who doesn't back same-sex marriage.\nCertainly, many others remain strongly opposed – just as many are passionately in favour. Some of the more vehement opponents are in Parliament – with a greater proportion of them in Coalition ranks.\nAbbott is careful to say it's an important issue and all views should be respected. But he certainly doesn't want to alienate his own conservative support base that helped him survive the leadership vote last February. Nor does he want a distracting political brawl playing out in public.\n\"My point is the government will remain absolutely focused on the things we were elected for – to produce more jobs, get economic growth up and secure our nation,\" he insisted on Thursday.\nYet the majority of voters seem to fit comfortably in the middle on this issue. Such reform makes little difference to them but seems like a reasonable – even traditional – aspiration for others. Concerns this could be forced on churches or people who disagreed could be legally accommodated.\nLet's move on So why waste any more time arguing? Why not just do it and get on with other things? And why should the government waste limited political capital fighting the move for a conscience vote when it just sets the issue up for Labor and the Greens to portray Abbott as out of touch with modern social values? This logic suggested it would be just a matter of time before momentum overwhelmed the government – despite party divisions and Tony Abbott's personal views.\nCertainly some Coalition MPs thought so. Two of them have been quietly negotiating with Labor and the Greens to introduce a cross-party bill into the Parliament when it returns next month. That is likely to lead to a move in Abbott's party room to formally consider the idea of a conscience vote. Now watch how hard Senator Abetz and some of his colleagues fight back. He even makes the politically absurd suggestion ministers who support same-sex marriage should resign. Perhaps it's his version of monogamy.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/jennifer_hewett"], "published": "2015-07-02T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:10:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
