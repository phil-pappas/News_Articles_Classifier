Photo: Fiona Morris\nThe $40 billion company behind US discounter TJ Maxx has snapped up the Trade Secret chain from Gazal Corp and is hoping to take advantage of hundreds of brands seeking new distribution channels after being dumped by Myer and David Jones .\nTJX Companies Inc, the largest off-price apparel and homewares retailer in the US, has agreed to pay Gazal $80 million for Trade Secret, which has 35 stores selling national and international apparel, footwear, accessories and homewares brands at discounts as high as 60 per cent off retail prices.\nThe acquisition, which is expected to be completed by the end of calendar 2015, gives TJX a sizeable foothold in the discount apparel and homewares sector, which is dominated by outlets such as DFO and chains such as Kmart, Target, BIG W and The Reject Shop.\nTrade Secret had sales of $165 million in the year ending June. TJX's sales grew 6 per cent to $US29.1 billion ($39.7 billion) in the year ending January 2015 and the company reported a net profit of $US2.2 billion.\nIt is understood that TJX plans to open as many as 10 stores a year in Australia in the next 10 years, lifting its footprint to more than 100 stores, increasing competition for retailers such as Myer, David Jones, BIG W and Target.\n\"When the world leader comes to any market it's going to change the landscape,\" said Myer's deputy chief executive, Daniel Bracken.\nTJX operates more than 3440 stores in seven countries under the TJ Maxx and TK Maxx brands as well as Marshalls, Winners, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post. It sources merchandise from more than 17,000 vendors in more than 100 countries, buying new and old season stock directly from brand owners and from other retailers.\nThe company represents a viable alternative distribution channel for brands that have excess stock or have been deleted by big retailers such as Myer and David Jones.\nAs reported by Fairfax Media on Wednesday , Myer is culling another 100 brands and David Jones has cut 180 brands from its portfolio of more than 2400 brands in recent months to make room for new labels.\nTJX chairman and chief executive Carol Meyrowitz said the deal underscored the strength of the group's international growth opportunities.\n\"TJX is one of the few major US retailers to have expanded successfully in international markets, including Canada and Europe, which gives us confidence in our potential growth in Australia,\" Ms Meyrowitz said.\n\"With consumer demographics similar to Canada, we see Trade Secret as a strong platform to grow in Australia similar to how we entered Canada with our acquisition of Winners in 1990 and grew that business into a leading Canadian retailer,\" she said.\n\"We believe TJX can further develop Trade Secret by leveraging our international leadership experience, buying scale, vendor universe, marketing, and other capabilities.\n\"We view Trade Secret as a good fit with our own corporate culture and are looking forward to growing this business for the future.\"\nGazal Corp plans to return about $40 million of the sale proceeds to shareholders after reducing debt and paying capital gains tax.\nCBRE, which is understood to be advising TJ Maxx on its store network plan, declined to comment on the deal.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/myer-clears-out-private-labels-as-part-of-brand-cull-20150729-gimzin"], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:06:02.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
