UBS' prediction comes as the Aussie trades around 74.20 US cents on Monday morning, down from 74.69 cents on Friday, but up from last week's six-year low of 73.92 US cents amid bad economic news from Greece and China. The dollar plummeted last week following three weeks of turmoil on the Chinese stock market, which has lost almost 40 per cent, or more than $US3 trillion ($A4 trillion) in value. Meanwhile in Europe, the stalemate between cash strapped Greece and its creditors drags on. UBS said that if the Australian dollar did move lower, it could contribute to a recovery in the economy's non-mining sector where business investment has remained weak. The Reserve Bank has previously said it would prefer the local currency to be around 75 US cents, but some economists believe it will have to fall closer to 70 US cents to boost growth.
