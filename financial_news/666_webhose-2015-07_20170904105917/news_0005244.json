Blue/Bloomberg Frank Bisignano, chief executive officer of First Data Corp., speaks during a Bloomberg… more The private equity giant KKR & Co. plans to take its First Data Corp. public in a bid to pay off its debt. First Data, a payment technology and services company that's based in Atlanta but has offices in lower Manhattan in the old World Financial Center complex, filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of its common stock. The number of shares to be offered, the price range and the stock exchange listing for the offering have not yet been determined. The listing is expected to take place after Labor Day. First Data wants to use the net proceeds from the IPO to pay off debt. The company was purchased eight years ago by KKR for $29 billion, and analysts see the bid to take First Data as a move by KKR to at least break even on its investment. \"The key question is could it be worth anything more than what KKR paid for it,\" Kathleen Smith , principal wtih Renaissance Capital, told Bloomberg Television (watch the video above for more). \"That will be the challenge with the company. They’ve got over $20 billion in debt and all the proceeds will be used to pay down debt.” In May, First Data \\reported a net loss of $63 million for the first quarter of 2015, but it showed improvement after reductions in interest expense and income taxes and an increase in other income. The company serves 6 million businesses and 4,000 financial institutions in 118 countries around the world. \nWant New York Technology news in your inbox? Sign up for our free email newsletters.
