The blow to stocks made bonds look more attractive in comparison and nudged Treasury yields lower, in turn weighing on the greenback.\nThe dollar eased 0.2 percent to 123.67 yen, slipping further away from Tuesday's high of 124.48 yen set on Tuesday, the greenback's highest level in about six weeks.\nOn Tuesday, comments from Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda had helped weigh on the dollar versus the yen. Kuroda said he expected inflation to accelerate considerably in the coming months due to a tight labour market and brushed off the idea of needing more quantitative easing.\nKuroda's comments suggest that the BOJ has little desire to add to its monetary stimulus, said Masafumi Yamamoto, senior strategist for retail financial service provider Monex, Inc. in Tokyo.\n\"It reinforces the view that fresh yen-selling factors are unlikely to emerge from Japan,\" Yamamoto said.\nAlthough the dollar could gain if the market starts to fully price in the possibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates twice by year-end, the greenback may struggle to rise to levels above 125.00 yen in the next month or two, he added.\nThe euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.0940, having pulled up from a three-month low of $1.0808 set on Monday.\nThe Australian dollar held steady at $0.7416, staying above a six-year low of $0.7328 set on Monday.\nAustralia's benign inflation figures on Wednesday reinforced belief that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has room to lower interest rates further if needed.\nRBA Governor Glenn Stevens said, however, that too much easing could lead to longer-term dangers through risk-taking and excessive borrowing, in effect setting the bar pretty high for any rate cuts.
