That notwithstanding, it has become dormant due to government's inability to pay suppliers. \nAs a result, most farmers are downbeat about recovery of the programme despite assurance by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture that it has concluded discussions with the rest of companies, and that distribution of fertiliser under the subsidy programme has resumed. \nThe farmers have in recent times been complaining about infrequent support from government under the programme; a situation that they say has been resulting in low yields. \nThe National Farmers and Fishermen Award Winners Association of Ghana (NFFAWAG) sometime last month appealed for government to release fertiliser subsidies to fertiliser distributors. \nMany of the companies had stopped supplying subsidised fertiliser to farmers due to the delay in releasing subsidy amounts to them. \nThe Chairman of NFFAWAG, Davies Korboe, said the situation has forced farmers to buy fertilisers at high prices on the open market. \nHe said farmers in the southern and middle belts of Ghana are likely to record low yields because of the weather, compared to what they were getting previously. \nWith the current situation, farmers are compelled to buy fertiliser at between È»120 and È»130 on the open market. \n\"As members of the NFFAWAG, we cannot fold our arms and allow our women, peasant and smallholder farmers to go through the pain of buying fertiliser at such prices when, indeed, the government has given them hope of getting it at a subsidised rate,\" he said. \nAccording to the group, any further delay in resolving the problem could jeorpardise quantities supplied under the programme. \nThe target groups under the fertiliser subsidy programme are primarily smallholder farmers and women cultivating maize, rice, sorghum and millet. \nMr. Korboe said other fertiliser distributors - including Cherice Ghana Limited, Afcott Ghana Limited, AMG West Africa Limited, Louis Dreyfus Commodities Limited and ETC Ghana Limited - \"are battling with issues concerning exchange rate differentials with the Ministry of Finance\". \nIt is the Ministry of Food and Agriculture's expectation that the present application rate of 12kg per hectare will increase to 20kg/ha, as projected in the Abuja declaration of fertiliser use by the African Green Revolution. \nAccording to the sector minister, Fiifi Kwetey , fixing the price will make it unattractive to smuggle the facility to our neighbouring countries. \nThe programme's introduction has been a contributory factor to improved food production in the country lately, compared to the pre-fertiliser subsidy period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T15:31:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
