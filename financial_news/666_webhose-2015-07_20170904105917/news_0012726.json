Sixty per cent of the mortgages created using false documents were part of its “Accelerator” line of insured mortgage products. \n“The investigation determined that falsification of income information had occurred but that there was no evidence of falsification of credit scores or property values,” the company said. \nA total of 53 brokers were suspended during September 2014 to March 2015, of about 4,000 total brokers in Home Capital’s network. The company noted, however, that over 300 new brokers were added over the same period. \nThe brokers that were cut off over the false documents were responsible for the creation of nearly $1 billion worth of single-family residential mortgages in 2014 — roughly 12 per cent of all new mortgages created that year. The mortgages represent 5.3 per cent of outstanding loans on the company’s balance sheet. \nHome Capital disclosed the information after it said the Ontario Securities Commission requested it do so. Regulators halted the company’s stock pending news at the end of trading Wednesday afternoon. \n“Everyone had their ideas about what transpired in the past six months, this corroborates some suspicions but dispels some others,” said analyst Shubha Khan, of National Bank Financial, in a phone interview. “It’s good we have the facts now, but there are still some questions.” \nKhan said further questions include whether the insured mortgages will continue to be insured since they were created using falsified income. He also said investors will want clarity about whether management thinks this is an isolated problem, rather than a broader industry issue in the Canadian housing market. Falsifying income was widespread in the U.S. subprime mortgage market prior to the housing crash in that country. \nManagement is expected to respond when it holds a conference call for investors and analysts Thursday at 10:30 a.m. EST. \nHome Capital made it clear Wednesday it does not see the mortgages leading to credit losses. It also said it has made recent “staffing changes” and improved income verification. \n“The Company continues to actively monitor the subject mortgages and there have been no unusual credit issues,” it said in a statement. \nHome Capital said the drop in originations led to a two per cent fall in profit in the second quarter. Diluted earnings came in as expected for the period, at $1.03 per share. That was down, however, from $1.05 during the same period last year. Related Home Capital Group shares sink after analyst downgrades \nThe company’s stock was up four per cent Wednesday, or $1.10, to $28.40, before the halt. However, it is still 34 per cent below where it was a month ago, as questions around the irregular documentation have been attracting a wide variety of negative attention to the company, including a number of U.S. short sellers. \nHome Capital’s stock this week became the second-most shorted in Canada, surpassing Quebecor Inc., with 28.4 per cent of shares on loan for short selling, according to Markit. That is significantly up from the roughly 18 per cent of shares shorted on July 10, when the company first revealed that it had discovered problematic issues with brokers. \nShort positions are near the historic peak of just under 33 per cent seen in June 2013, back when veteran investor Steve Eisman, who correctly called and shorted the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis in 2007, predicted a Canadian housing correction that year. \nHome Capital, which operates through Home Trust Co., has 40,000 uninsured mortgages on its books and an additional 25,000 insured mortgages, some of which are securitized and sold. The company has a footprint in Canada’s hottest housing markets, including cities in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T04:05:31.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
