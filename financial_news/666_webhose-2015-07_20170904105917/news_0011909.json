So much so, he fights any requests to pick favourites and \"top 5\" lists arguing the \"olympic race of food\" just wouldn't work.\nDespite the protests Perry leads us along through the winding, grimey and narrow streets of the city's Soho district, home to a expatriate and local mix of nightlife near Central on the main island, to a more casual dining venue for the chef. A note for the ladies: the steep, almost 45 degree angled streets are a disaster for high heels.\nA waiter serves the roast duck (left) as Neil Perry enjoys Hong Kong's best dumplings (right) at Lung King Heen. Callaghan Walsh For Perry, Ho Lee Fook , shows the \"hipster, young\" segment of the city's booming restaurant industry that is inspired by Chinese food, but also other cultures as well. He knows the chef Jowett Yu, who worked at Ms Gs and Mr Wong in Sydney before moving to Hong Kong, and enjoys the mix of Asian flavours he delivers.\n\"What I love is the fact there's a whole lot of Cantonese influence and there's a whole lot of other influence and it's really modern food,\" Perry says.\nAs a key player in the changing face of Hong Kong's restaurant scene, it seems appropriate the restaurant's walls are hung with comic interpretations of the city's famous Central Market .\nThe locals lament the 75-year-old wet market will soon disappear as the government modernises the city and a new development made up of supermarkets, restaurants and retailers will replace the brightly-coloured stalls of fresh produce.\n The markets are full of inspiration for Perry who has been visiting them for years because he can spot his favourite bamboo clams and fresh vegetables just not found Down Under. During a quick visit on this trip, he notes the outdoor butcher where pigs hang outside in Hong Kong's sweaty humid day.\n\"In Australia we over-sanitise everything, and what happens? Everyone gets sick,\" he says.\nHo Lee Fook opened in June 2014 and is one of nine restaurants parent company Black Sheep Restaurants has opened in just three years - a feat that impresses Perry. Co-Founder Christopher Mark says their niche offerings, which range from Italian bars to Hanoi's street food culture, are meeting a growing demand for \"approachable dining\".\n\"Hong Kong has always been a fine-dining hot spot. Unfortunately, mid-range concepts have been thin on the ground,\" he says.\nPerry loves the aromatic wagyu steak tartare, but also wouldn't skip the roast goose and while our host sips red wine, the recommended sparkling sake is a must-try to keep in true spirit and ultra-hip vibe this funky restaurant.\nFor those seeking a more traditional, fine dining venue, which Hong Kong is so famous for, then Lung King Heen in the Four Seasons Hotel is a must.\nBreaking his own 'no-favourites' rules, Perry dubs these gold-plated, ever-so delicate dumplings \"the best in the city\". This is also where he'd go for a business lunch - selecting a mix of yumcha and mains.\nHe's greeted by Lung King Heen's head chef Chan Yan-tak like an old friend - not surprising since they've worked together in the past - then treated like a guest of honour.\nPerry talked up Lung King Heen's \"amazing\" Peking Duck for several days before we found ourselves seated in a private room with floor-to-ceiling windows that show off Hong Kong's harbour. The excitement on his face speaks more than words as the team carefully carve the duck in front of us for delicate, crunchy pancakes.\nThe crispy spring roll with crab meat and black truffle with crispy, thin pastry was also a winner. (Served with baked abolne puff with diced chicken in photograph).\nIn true three-star michelin style, it's all served with a 'Taste of Asia' wine list that includes Taiwanese Lychee Honey Wufeng Farmer's Association wine and several Chinese wines that show off China's young but growing wine industry.\nThe Chateau Bolongbao Reserve from Beijing, appears to impress Qantas' new wine selector, so perhaps we can expect some tastes from China on flights.\nAfter Lung King Heen's six-course lunch and another round of food at the funky Mott 32 (including the must-have char sui, which is a Cantonese way of preparing barbequed pork) it was understandable why Perry suggested skipping breakfast.\nBut the early 1900s decor of the Peninsula Hotel's lobby with it's high ceilings and precious detail meant I had to sample the breakfast menu. After all, it's not just the tourists that enjoy this place, with locals lined up from 11am waiting for the High Tea.\nA cheeky taste of granola, served with a bowl of fresh blueberries, in delicate crockery meant my stomach was well stretched for the next installment of the tour; yumcha at Yung Kee followed by Perry's own creations in Hong Kong's business lounge ahead of our 8:30pm overnight flight on QF128 to Sydney.\nPerry's eating and drinking tips for Hong Kong Spring Moon - You can do a dumpling making session here, but make sure you also dine and try the perfectly crispy fish cakes and the classic yumcha pork buns.
