This comes as banks are under pressure from regulators to keep a lid on investor lending growth.\nIn 2005, Westpac decided to point owner-occupier and investor loans to a single rate, which has been preventing the nation's largest lender to landlords from increasing the standard variable interest rate for property investors without also hitting owner-occupiers.\nThis is costing the bank around $1 million a day in forgone interest income, as The Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday . Westpac's multi-brand strategy has created the extra complexity and prevented fast action on raising rates.\nAdvertisement \"Whilst the headline number of $1 million per day sounds impressive, it is less so in the context of a bank that made $7.6 billion for the 2014 financial year. I would think that few institutional shareholders would be overly concerned about this systems issue that I am sure will be fixed as quickly as possible,\" said Hugh Dive, a senior portfolio manager at Aurora Funds Management, which holds Westpac shares.\n\"What is of greater interest is that the banks, including Westpac, are repricing their loan book upwards. In the context of a loan book of $622 billion, changes to Westpac's net interest margin, or even maintaining their NIM as they did in the first half 2015, is of much greater importance to shareholders and bank profitability than $1 million per day in foregone interest income.\"\nWestpac shares fell 0.4 per cent on Tuesday to $34.21, the heaviest loss among the big four, which were mixed. ANZ Banking Group and Commonwealth Bank of Australia last week raised rates for property investors while reducing rates for owner-occupiers , while National Australia Bank on Monday announced higher rates for interest-only loans for both categories of borrowers .\nIt is understood NAB also uses a single \"reference rate\" that is preventing it from charging different interest rates to investors and owner-occupiers .\nMassive IT effort for minor changes Darryl Carlton, the research director at global IT research company Gartner, said the complexity of bank IT systems can make seemingly simple changes to interest rates challenging.\n\"The systems at Westpac are quite old and it does take an enormous amount of work to change systems because they have grown slowly over time and have hundreds, if not thousands, of interfaces over various applications,\" he said.\n\"Even minor changes can take a massive effort.\"\nWestpac is understood to be moving cautiously on lifting investor rates due to concerns that owner-occupiers and investors might not be properly identified, because some customers borrow as investors but then become owner-occupiers – or visa versa – and may have multiple loans.\nMr Carlton said this would be an issue for all the banks. \"The question for the other banks is are they capturing that change in relationship – they may not have recognised the problem, whereas Westpac has.\"\nRodney Gedda, a senior analyst at IT advisory firm Telsyte, said bank IT systems can be more rigid than banks would like. \"They are like spaghetti, where different systems talk to each other and do different things,\" he said. \"Banks in general have to deal with lots of different silos in technology and always have because in the past, they have deployed a technology stack for each product.\"\nWestpac is currently building a \"customer hub\" to allow its systems to see all the interactions its customers are having with the bank.\nMr Carlton said modern banks are essentially IT companies. \"Banks are now just a big computer,\" he said. \"All behaviours and products are encoded in core systems and the personality of the bank is driven by how efficient their core systems are.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/interest-rate-computer-glitch-costs-westpac-over-1m-a-day-20150728-gilh37", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/cba-joins-anz-in-raising-investor-interest-rates-by-027-percentage-points-20150724-gijihx", "http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/nab-raises-rates-on-interestonly-home-loans-20150727-gildox"], "published": "2015-07-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T06:48:22.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
