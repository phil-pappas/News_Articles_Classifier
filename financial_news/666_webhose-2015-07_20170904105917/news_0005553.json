The office has not taken any formal actions, she said. \nWhen it comes to access, the National Federation of the Blind of California accused Uber in a lawsuit last year of discrimination by refusing to transport guide dogs. A San Francisco federal judge has said the case can proceed. \nUber said it regularly speaks with advocates and policy makers about making Uber accessible to riders and drivers with disabilities. \n\"We have teams dedicated to continuing to expand that access further for the disabled community in Massachusetts and nationwide,\" the company said in a statement. \nA Lyft representative could not be immediately be reached for comment. \nUber is a well known sharing-economy company operating in 57 countries with an estimated value of more than $40 billion. Lyft's valuation is about $2.5 billion. \nBoth companies are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on a range of subjects, including whether their drivers should be treated as employees rather than contractors. \nIn a blog post this month, Uber said it has a partnership with the National Federation of the Blind to obtain feedback from the visually impaired community. \nIn Texas, Jennifer McPhail sued Lyft last year, accusing the company of not having a wheelchair accessible vehicle operating in Austin. \nThe case is currently pending and Lyft has asked that it be sent to arbitration, according to the Travis County court clerk's office. \nThis week, Uber announced a new option called uberASSIST, which is designed to provide additional assistance to seniors and people with disabilities. \nDrivers are specifically trained to assist riders into vehicles and can accommodate folding wheelchairs and scooters, the company said in a blog post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T09:21:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
