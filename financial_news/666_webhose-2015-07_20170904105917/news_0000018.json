The governor's office did not reply to a request for clarification.\nThe plan calls for linking LaGuardia's new Central Terminal to Delta's Terminals C and D.\n\"We look forward to working in partnership with the governor's design commission on a comprehensive and complementary redevelopment plan that realizes our mutual goals and benefits all New York passengers,\" Delta's President Ed Bastian said in a news release.\nThe long-awaited overhaul of LaGuardia's Central Terminal took a leap forward in May when officials selected a Swedish builder consortium, Skanska AB's LaGuardia Gateway Partners, to design, build, operate and maintain the project.\nEight miles from midtown Manhattan, the closest airport to New York City handled nearly 27 million passengers in 2014, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs it.
