The weaker investment outlook is a reflection of weak global economic growth, the unwinding of the massive experiment in central banks' quantitative easing, and record-low interest rates in Australia.\n\"I will be very surprised if we can deliver similar returns over the coming three years, but taking on more risk is not the answer,\" Mr Delaney said.\nAustralianSuper has $92 billion in assets under management and manages retirement savings on behalf of more than 10 per cent of working Australians.\nMr Delaney said the 16.9 per cent depreciation in the Australian dollar boosted the annual return on AustralianSuper's balanced fund by 12.5 per cent.\n\"The Aussie has already fallen a lot, but it could still depreciate significantly more in the year ahead if export commodity prices continue to come under pressure and the Reserve Bank cuts rates again. Long term, I think the currency will settle somewhere in the US60¢ range\".\nMr Delaney said AustralianSuper completed its annual asset allocation review four weeks ago, and plans to make no significant changes.\n\"At the margins we have shifted a little bit of money out of shares and put that into property, infrastructure and cash.\"\nThe fund is maintaining its strategic asset allocation despite an expectation of lower returns.\nThe total return to members in the AustralianSuper balanced option over the past five years has been 62.5 per cent, or an average of 10.2 per cent a year. In the years ahead returns are tipped to fall below the 10 year average of 7.3 per cent a year.\nMr Delaney plans to continue bringing more funds management capabilities in-house in a bid to offset lower returns with reduced costs.\nWhen AustralianSuper members get their statement this month it will list an investment management fee of 57 basis points, down from 59 basis points the previous year.\nOver the past year AustralianSuper poured more than $2 billion into direct foreign property investments, buying stakes in office buildings in Boston, Washington DC, and Honolulu and the King's Cross redevelopment project in London.\nThe combined property portfolio posted a return of 10.3 per cent in the year ended June 30, 2015; the infrastructure portfolio delivered 9.7 per cent.\nIn the equities portfolio Japanese stocks were the star, returning 35.7 per cent. European equities returned 7.6 per cent, US equities 7.4 per cent, and Australian equities 5.6 per cent.", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/warning-super-funds-likely-to-miss-longterm-return-targets-20150703-gi270a"], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:09:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
