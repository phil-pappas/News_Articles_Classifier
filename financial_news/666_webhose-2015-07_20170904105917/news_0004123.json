Peter Braig by Matthew Stevens Boral has won rare access to confidential evidence gathered under compulsory examination powers of the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission after a Victorian Supreme Court resisted objections to disclosure offered by the regulator in uncomfortable coalition with the building industry union .\nIf the landmark decision by Justice Kevin Bell stands, then evidence gathered by ACCC from witnesses under threat of criminal sanction will be used by a third party in a civil case before it is used in proceedings being pursued by the regulator.\nMike Kane's Boral is pursuing discovery to inform its damage claim against the CFMEU for the union's failure to comply with Supreme Court orders that require an end to the concrete black ban. Boral is seeking $23 million plus costs and that proposition is set down for hearing in August.\nThe ACCC resisted access on the basis that it posed an unprecedented threat to the integrity of its examination process that risked abuse of the compulsory powers that support it. The regulator argued that disclosure would undermine its ability to effectively investigate and litigate current and future breaches of the competition law.\nWhile accepting broadly the legitimacy of the ACCC position on third party discovery, Justice Bell concluded that it would be \"unjust to deprive Boral\" of access to the documents sought.\nThe interviews targeted for discovery by the concrete maker sit central to the ACCC's allegations that the Victorian branch of the CFMEU's construction division has operated an illegal secondary boycott against Boral's products at building sites in Melbourne CBD and suburbs.\nThe ACCC matter was due to be heard in November but the coincidence of the hearing date with the 25th wedding anniversary celebrations of one of the union officials targeted in the regulator's statement of claim meant the date was pushed out until March next year. Go figure.\nAnyway, as matters stand, the CFMEU has until 4pm on Monday to deliver Boral with documents generated by ACCC inquiries. They include interviews with 12 named individuals, most of whom are employees of contractors that locked their gates to Boral deliveries. The orders also call for the union to hand over ACCC-generated interviews with anyone involved in Boral concrete deliveries to 16 nominated Melbourne sites and with \"any person\" involved in \"communication of the 'black ban' against Boral\".\n So why is the CFMEU supposed to hand this stuff over rather than the ACCC?\nWell, because Boral is only entitled to discovery of evidence that has relevance to its Supreme Court case. As it turns out, that covers a whole lot of territory that includes, according to Justice Bell, evidence that the union secured in preparing the defence of the ACCC allegations.\nIn fulfilling its routine discovery obligations, the ACCC provided the union with all of the evidence now targeted by Boral. Plainly, neither side of that Federal Court argument ever imagined that Boral might make a pitch for those documents, let alone secure access to them.\nI mean, had the ACCC had imagined this outcome, then it might well have made a more robust defence of the integrity of its compulsory examination powers in the first place.\nThe most immediate question for the regulator is whether it throws more of its limited financial resources at pursuing this matter of principle to appeal. And this decision might not be the lay down misere that we imagined last week.\nThe tricky issue there is going to be identification of a point of legal failing in a judgment that openly acknowledges the standing of the ACCC objection but rejects it as a matter of judgment.\nBut the regulator might yet take comfort in the fact that this judgment might be a precedent hard to follow, first, because the court conceded on the logics of the ACCC's objections to discovery, and second, because this circumstance of overlapping cases in overlapping jurisdictions is rare in the regulatory experience.\nBHP's pudding BHP Billiton has signalled material production slippages in the year ahead across three of the four commodity corners of its now massively simplified operational universe. But, sadly for Andrew Forrest and Fortescue Metals, iron ore will be the exception to this more general strategic retreat.\nWhile BHP will surrender output in copper, petroleum and coal over the coming production year, its numbers in iron ore will progress as flagged in April.\nIn its FY15 full-year production report released on Wednesday morning, the Global Australian affirmed its long-standing commitment to run its expanded Pilbara production machinery at its capacity.\nBHP, which has spent $US25 billion on a decade's worth of iron ore expansion, confirmed that Pilbara production for the current financial year would run to schedule, which means hitting 270 million tonnes this year.\nBeyond 2016, BHP's Pilbara production will float gently up to 290mtpa through a series of capital-lite tweaks of its system.\nThis progress to targeted production was supposed to happen in one big step through a $US500 million \"debottlenecking\" of the logistics at BHP's share of Port Hedland. But that was canned in late April , with BHP signalling that it was not prepared to allocate that level of capital to the long-planned expansion. Instead the new tonnes will be secured by identifying and then pulling a collection of more discrete operational levers.\nIt must be noted that this adjustment to the growth schedule stands one of two concessions made by Pilbara majors to iron ore's mean reversion.\nThe other shift in approach was made by Rio Tinto, which has twice postponed progress of the $US1 billion Silvergrass mine. This project sits pivotal to Rio's ability to sustain production at its targeted peak of 360mtpa. So as long as Silvergrass sits on the drawing board then Rio's ability to hit that peak is constrained.\nThere is irony in this, of course. The Pilbara's Third Force has condemned its competitors for talking down the iron ore market while force-feeding a market sliding into oversupply. But Fortescue's production remains unscathed. Indeed, there is speculation that it ran its machines at a record monthly rate of 15 million tonnes through June.\nThis was ever going to be the challenging paradox of BHP's post-boom, post-South32 life.\nChief executive Andrew Mackenzie was delivered his job in anticipation of this new normal in commodities markets. And he has delivered on his design. Capital spending has been aggressively contained. A laser focus continues to extract a new world of productivity gains from a largely mature fleet of operations that are now producing more with less. And now the demerger of South32 has made BHP a more transparent, digestible business for analysts, investors and media alike.\nBut this new clarity makes it ever harder to disguise the potential of the current coincidence of foreshadowed production cuts and the new normal of global commodities markets. The chill in bulk minerals, terminal-traded metals and petroleum prices is made too apparent in a table relatively new to BHP's public data.\nBHP's average prices deck shows, for example, that oil prices fell by nearly 40 per cent over the first and second halves of FY15. Through that period copper prices fell 12 per cent, coals thermal and coking by 8 and 10 per cent respectively and iron ore by 24 per cent.\nThe pricing conundrums of the second half were mitigated, to some degree, by long-planned and heavily funded production increases. Iron ore production rose 14 per cent, metcoal was up 13 per cent and petroleum output crept ahead by 4 per cent largely as the result of the US onshore rollout.\nBut that output mitigation will not persist through FY16. Copper will fall by 12 per cent to 1.5 million tonnes essentially because the long-dated reconfiguration of BHP's Escondida mine in Chile will not start driving higher grades until FY17. Petroleum production is expected to fall by 7 per cent to 237 million barrels because BHP has more than halved is capital allocation for the US shale business. And total coal production will fall about 3 per cent largely because of the closure of the Crinum mine in the Bowen Basin, which will happen some time before September.\nThese numbers and more indicate that FY16 will be the toughest so far of the Mackenzie era and that the pressure on his heavily pruned, handpicked management team to drive productivity and protect margins will be at its most intense. The next 12 months, good or bad, will stand as proof of the Mackenzie pudding.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:03:58.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
