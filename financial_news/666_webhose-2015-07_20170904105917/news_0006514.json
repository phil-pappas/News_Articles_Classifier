By Peter Spence | Telegraph – 22 minutes ago \nThree catalysts could explain the Shanghai Composite's largest one-day fall in eight years \nChina's main stock market, the Shanghai Composite, has endured its worst fall in eight years. \nThe index dropped by 8.5pc during its Monday trading session , as a rout in Chinese equities continues. The drop is the most severe one-day fall recorded since February 2007, and the second largest since 2000. \nMonday's tumble seems to be a continuation of an earlier sell-off , which had followed a mega-rally in equities. That downturn was met with a broadside of interventions by the Chinese authorities, and things seemed to have cooled down. \nSo why has the slump resumed? The proximate cause isn't all that obvious, but analysts aren't short of theories. Here are three. \n= The economy has come off the rails = \nOne of the most obvious explanations is the disappointing economic data released on Monday. \nChinese industrial profits fell by 0.3pc in June compared with the same month a year earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That fall follows a 0.6pc year-on-year increase in May, and a 2.6pc jump in April. \nPart of the fall is to be expected. China's companies are themselves big players in the stock market and their profits will have been affected by the recent slump in stocks. \nBut the industrial profits data follows on from other nasty readings. Friday saw a key survey of the country's manufacturing sector at its weakest in 15 months. \nZhu Guangyao says that China's economic fundamentals are \"very solid\" (Photo: Reuters/Stefan Wermuth) \nAll of this contributes to growing fears that China's pace of growth cannot be sustained. Zhu Guangyao, China’s vice finance minister, has told the Telegraph that the country is moving from “very high growth to relatively high growth”. \nBut some China watchers are worried that things could be slowing down more quickly than the Government would like. Fears of a big slowdown have knocked confidence - hence the stock market fall. \n= The authorities won't keep supporting the market = \nMonday's plunge is the first fall greater than 5pc since July 8, when the Chinese authorities started to intervene. \nAfter the rout on July 8, the country's central bank boosted its support for the market: new IPOs were suspended; state-run companies promised to invest in the market; and over 1,400 companies were given permission to suspend trading in their shares. \nThose measures seemed to have stabilised the market, with the Shanghai Composite up by 16pc since that low point. So why have these measures stopped working now? \nOne idea is that China's authorities have reduced support to see if the market has firmed up. \nIt may be that state-buying in the market has been put on hold; according to the WSJ , local brokerages believe that state-owned China Securities has \"spent hundreds of billions of yuan\" in an effort to keep stocks up. \nBut if the Chinese government is testing to see if the bicycle works just fine without its stabiliser wheels, then the bike just fell over rather spectacularly. \n= Or perhaps authorities can't keep supporting the market = \nAlternatively, investors are just becoming worried that even though assistance is being maintained for now, that doesn't mean it will be around forever. \nDavid Cui, of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said: \"We believe that the government will struggle to hold up the market beyond a few months, unless it is prepared to let go some of its other policy objectives including renminbi credibility.\" \nThe prospect of government support being pulled away may have contributed to Monday's sell-off. The IMF has already begun leaning on China to curtail its interventions, according to Bloomberg . \nAn anonymous source told Bloomberg that the IMF believed that while short-term measures can be appropriate to prevent major disorder, prices should eventually be allowed to settle. \nChina may heed the warning. The IMF is also responsible for determining whether the renminbi will be included in the fund's Special Drawing Rights Basket - and that's a status China's government desperately wants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T15:23:49.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
