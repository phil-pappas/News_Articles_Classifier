BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) declined as it trimmed its production guidance for 2016 in the face of waning prices and warned its underlying profits will be hit by a charge of between $350m to $650m from impairments and redundancies at its copper business. \nRandgold, Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) and Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) were also among the stocks in the mining sector that took a dip on the FTSE. \nLater on Wednesday the Bank of England will release minutes of its 8-9 July rate setting meeting, with investors and traders watching to see how Monetary Policy Committee members voted and the tone of talks. \nAhead of the minutes, Governor Mark Carney has lately been indicating that interest rates could rise at the turn of this year. \nHowever, Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, argued that Carney's words were misconstrued. The Item Club's quarterly report has predicted interest rates are unlikely to rise until autumn 2016. The economic forecasters see interest rates rising 1% by the end of 2016 and climbing 1.75% in 2017. \nIn Europe, the new bailout negotiations between Greece and its creditors are expected to begin today after a parliamentary vote in Athens on the remaining reforms signed by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \n\"There has been a suggestion that the talks should be concluded by 20 August but given the snail's pace seen so far by Europe's bureaucrats, this might be wishful thinking,\" said Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets UK . \nOn the company front, Easyjet (Other OTC: ESYJY - news ) soared after the company said second half sales would spur a gain in full year earnings. \nTate & Lyle (LSE: TATE.L - news ) gained after after Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS-PB - news ) upgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'sell' and raised its price target to 470p from 460p following its recent underperformance. \nLand Securities (LSE: LAND.L - news ) was a high riser after saying it has had a solid start to the year and is maintaining good momentum, with healthy take-up in London, low vacancy rates and rental values rising. \nARM Holdings (LSE: ARM.L - news ) , on the other hand, dropped after the chip maker reported second quarter earnings that fell short of expectations. \nBarclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) slipped as the bank denied receiving an offer from the Serious Fraud Office, relating to an investigation into its multi-billion pound fundraisings during the 2008 financial crisis. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,175.51 -0.62% FTSE 100 6,706.25 -0.93% FTSE 250 17,700.59 -0.31% FTSE 100 - Risers easyJet (EZJ) 1,741.00p +4.50% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (LSE: TUI.L - news ) ) 1,108.00p +0.82% Sage Group (LSE: SGE.L - news ) (SGE) 538.50p +0.56% International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 563.50p +0.54% Dixons Carphone (LSE: DC.L - news ) (DC.) 470.00p +0.49% Shire Plc (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) (SHP) 5,460.00p +0.46% Sky (LSE: SKY.L - news ) (SKY (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) ) 1,141.00p +0.35% Sports Direct International (LSE: SPD.L - news ) (SPD) 779.00p +0.32% Land Securities Group (LAND) 1,309.00p +0.31% Persimmon (PSN) 1,951.00p +0.31% FTSE 100 - Fallers Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 1,001.00p -4.03% ARM Holdings (ARM) 1,004.00p -3.37% BHP Billiton (BLT) 1,209.50p -3.36% Rio Tinto (RIO) 2,527.50p -2.68% Anglo American (AAL) 838.70p -2.67% Weir Group (WEIR) 1,613.00p -2.66% Glencore (GLEN) 234.65p -2.66% Antofagasta (LSE: ANTO.L - news ) (ANTO) 632.00p -2.47% Fresnillo (FRES) 637.00p -2.30% Babcock International Group (BAB (Other OTC: BABB - news ) ) 1,078.00p -2.09% FTSE 250 - Risers Mitchells & Butlers (LSE: MAB.L - news ) (MAB) 394.50p +2.71% Tate & Lyle (TATE) 523.50p +2.45% Morgan Advanced Materials (MGAM) 339.50p +2.26% Premier Oil (LSE: PMO.L - news ) (PMO) 144.90p +2.26% Betfair Group (LSE: BET.L - news ) (BET) 2,651.00p +2.24% Card Factory (LSE: CARD.L - news ) (CARD) 329.10p +1.98% Marston's (MARS) 157.70p +1.68% Aldermore Group (LSE: ALD.L - news ) (ALD) 264.30p +1.50% Halfords Group (LSE: HFD.L - news ) (HFD) 544.50p +1.30% PayPoint (PAY) 1,028.00p +1.28% FTSE 250 - Fallers TalkTalk Telecom Group (TALK) 363.70p -6.86% Acacia Mining (Other OTC: ABGLF - news ) (ACA) 232.90p -3.20% Evraz (EVR) 113.50p -3.07% Jimmy Choo (LSE: CHOO.L - news ) (CHOO) 162.20p -2.87% Kaz Minerals (LSE: KAZ.L - news ) (KAZ) 189.60p -2.47% Ophir Energy (Other OTC: OPGYF - news ) (OPHR) 111.70p -2.36% Rentokil Initial (LSE: RTO.L - news ) (RTO) 148.20p -2.24% Petrofac Ltd.
