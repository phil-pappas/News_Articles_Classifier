Such a move had not previously been expected until May or later. \nSterling was 0.1 percent lower on Thursday against a dollar boosted by Yellen's comments at $1.5622. Against the euro, the pound was 0.2 percent up at 69.795 pence, having earlier hit 69.695 pence, its strongest since November 2007. \n\"The market is starting to turn back to fundamentals as the situation in Greece stabilises, and to the dichotomy in views between the ECB and the BoE,\" said Nikolaos Sgouropoulos, a G10 currency strategist at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) in London. \nThe pound's gains against the euro helped it reach its strongest since March 2008 against the BoE's trade-weighted basket of currencies, at 94.1. \nCarney's comments earlier in the week followed an uncharacteristically hawkish message from the BoE's monetary policy committee (MPC (KOSDAQ: 050540.KQ - news ) ) member David Miles, who said the idea the BoE had to wait for the Fed to raise rates was \"daft\". \nBut some strategists reckon that whatever is said in public, the BoE will not risk tightening policy, and potentially stifling growth, before U.S. rates have started to increase. \n\"If the market firms up expectations of a 2015 Fed lift-off, it can also bring forward expectations of the first UK MPC hike,\" wrote Societe Generale (Paris: FR0000130809 - news ) strategists in a research note. \n\"MPC members are sending a clear message that the time for hikes is approaching and there's less in the UK rate curve than the U.S. one.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T12:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T12:53:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
