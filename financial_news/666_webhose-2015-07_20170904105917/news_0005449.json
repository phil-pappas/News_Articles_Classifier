The current deal \"is by no means a comprehensive, detailed agreement,\" the official said. \nPolitical analysts questioned why the strongly-worded report appeared not to have been taken into account in the agreement. \nTsipras has been forced to turn to pro-European opposition parties to get the reform measures through parliament after a rebellion by some 30 rebel lawmakers in his own party. \nThe embattled premier said he took \"full responsibility\" for signing an accord he did \"not believe in.\" He said he agreed to it \"to avoid disaster\" as the country teetered on the brink of economic collapse. \n\"A prime minister must fight, speak the truth, take decisions and not run away,\" Tsipras said in an interview on Greek public television on Tuesday, when asked whether he would resign if the reforms fail to pass or he loses his parliamentary majority. \nSyriza's hardline leftists, lead by Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, were reported by Greek media as braced to vote against the measures while calling for a return to the drachma. \nLafazanis himself insisted \"several MPs including myself\" would not approve the measures, but nevertheless insisted the cohesion of the party and the government would not be jeopardised. \nPolls published late Tuesday by Kapa Research found 72 percent of Greeks surveyed thought the deal was necessary if tough, but many nevertheless saw it as a humiliating climbdown for a country still reeling from years of painful austerity. \nSmall anti-austerity protests were held in Athens and Thessaloniki, with police in riot gear closing off roads around parliament ahead of a large-scale demonstration expected late Wednesday. A strike by civil servants against the deal was disrupting travel. \nDespite the turmoil, 68 percent of people said that if the political fallout from the vote should result in a new coalition, it should be led by Tsipras. \n- More payments due - \nUnder the deal, Greek assets for privatisation will be parked in a special fund worth up to 50 billion euros, with some 25 billion euros of the money earmarked to recapitalise Greece's banks. \nTsipras said Greeks' savings were safe, but the reopening of the banks -- which have been closed since the end of last month -- depended on the finalising of the deal, which could take a month. The finance ministry said they would remain closed until at least Thursday. \nThe European Central Bank has been keeping Greek banks afloat with emergency liquidity, but it could be forced to cut off that aid if Greece misses a huge debt repayment due on Monday. \nEuropean governments are meanwhile divided over options to help Greece meet its short-term cash needs while it waits for the eurozone bailout deal to be finalised, which will likely to take at least four weeks. \nThe European Commission on Wednesday formally backed a controversial proposal to use an EU-wide crisis fund to cover Greece's short-term cash needs, officials said, setting up a clash with Britain and Germany. \nIn a sign of the concern about the fallout of the crisis, US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew will travel to Germany and France on Wednesday and Thursday for talks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T20:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T20:29:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
