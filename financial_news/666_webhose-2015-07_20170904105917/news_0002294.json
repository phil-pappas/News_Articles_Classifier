Dominic Lorrimer by Shai Oster To hear venture capitalists tell it, the Chinese stock market selloff that at one point wiped out almost $5.4 trillion of value may be a boon for those angling to get into cash-strapped technology startups.\nPressure remains on public company valuations as the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses gyrate. Yet the selloff has deflated capital-raising exuberance and wrenched valuations back down to earth, prompting prudence and encouraging investors to look anew at private firms.\nStartups like Uber Technologies Inc's Chinese arm and rival Didi Kuaidi are among those said to seek some $US4 billion ($5.42 billion) in funds in the midst of the most volatile markets in years. With the government freezing initial public offerings as part of a raft of measures intended to prop up markets, backers looking to recoup money through a listing are being thwarted.\nNow, the power is shifting to venture capitalists and private equity with money to invest.\n\"The suspension of domestic IPOs may leave some companies in need of cash and open up investment opportunities for PE firms that would have been unavailable otherwise at very advantageous terms,\" said Ken Xu, a partner at Shanghai-based Gobi Partners. \"Investors are going to be more cautious, taking a closer look and increasing oversight over their investments.\"\nInvestors who get into startups in their initial phases however have multiyear horizons; by then, the IPO train may have resumed. In the meantime, there are other ways to realise returns, such as through an outright sale to acquisitive Internet firms like Alibaba Group Holding or Tencent Holdings.\nCash pile\n Both have been involved in acquisitions and investments worth at least $US8.3 billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thomas Tsao, co-founder of Gobi, says Chinese corporations are sitting on at least $US65 billion in cash they can use for acquisitions.\n\"The pricing in the venture capital and buyout market was getting ridiculous,\" said Christopher Hunter, managing director of the China office for investment adviser Cambridge Associates. \"Prices coming down throws out more buying opportunities, not just for venture capital, but for companies that need financing, from private equity.\"\nAnalysts at Arete Research this week said the suspension of IPOs and slump in valuations will have a \"chilling effect\" on investment into the internet sector.\nMarkets aside, the growth of China's middle class remains an enticing prospect to many investors buying chunks of car-hailing applications, home rental websites, and group discount sellers.\nUber is seeking to raise as much as $US1 billion to fund its China business as it battles domestic rivals, people familiar with the matter said this month. While unverified reports have circulated on the web that the car booking company is struggling to attract a top-tier investor, they focused on specific issues such as fake rides and huge losses.\nThe company said last week it had seen \"greater than expected'' interest in its Chinese fundraising. Uber declined to comment this week on the specifics of funding.\nOthers are forging ahead. Didi Kuaidi, backed by Alibaba and Tencent, said last week it was seeking to raise more money in a funding round that has already pooled $US2 billion from investors despite the falling market.\nMeituan.com, a Chinese startup offering group discounts, is planning to raise more than $US1 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company declined to comment.\nAnd home rental company Xiaozhu.com said last week it raised $US60 million from four private equity funds including Morningside Group and Citic Capital Holdings.\nThe situation is more complicated for the investors who backed at least 23 Chinese companies, including Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd., that are pulling out of the US stock market at a record pace to cash in on higher valuations back home.\nThey remain effectively in limbo as long as IPOs are suspended and are trading at an average discount of 13 per cent to their buyout offers, from an average 8.1 per cent when the proposals were announced.\nIf and when IPOs resume in China, debutants could get better treatment on the domestic market then they do overseas, said Mingchen Xia, a principal in Hong Kong for private equity asset management firm Hamilton Lane Advisors LLC.\nShanghai and Shenzhen stocks are still trading at 19.4 and more than 50 times earnings as of Wednesday, respectively, outpacing the S&P 500's 18.6 times.\n\"The valuation gap is still quite big between the two markets even after the slump,\" Xia said. \"From a long term perspective it wouldn't eliminate these types of transactions if there are good rationales behind them.\"\n- with assistance from Lulu Yilun Chen in Hong Kong", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T10:04:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
