It’s the second straight month of declines and a sharp reversal from May, when sales of those notes surged to the highest in more than two years.\nChina’s stock routs have startled Japanese investors since June amid fears that a 30 percent cull of the Shanghai Composite Index’s value would prove contagious. After an almost two-decade high on June 24, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell about 5 percent over two weeks. Investor panic spiked on July 8 when a gauge of stock volatility surged the most since last August.\n“Concerns over Greece at the end of June and China’s precipitous stock market drop earlier this month have made Japanese retail investors more risk averse,” said Tomoyuki Sasai, the Tokyo-based head of equity derivatives at Credit Suisse Group AG’s Japan unit.\nThe sales slump has been worsened by a significant drop in early redemptions of structured notes amid falling stock prices, said Sasai. Issuance may continue to decline next month as investors head out for summer vacations, he predicts.\nWhile most equity-linked uridashi bonds are tied to the performance of the local share market, global volatility will still affect the securities’ prices and demand, according to Tokyo-based Akihiro Igarashi, Nomura Securities Co.’s joint head of international debt syndicate.\nSales Slowdown Some $19 billion of uridashi bonds have been sold since Dec. 31, the slowest such period since 2009. Of this year’s notes, the returns of 53 percent are linked to equities or share indexes, with 35 percent linked to interest rates.\nMost notes tied to rates are denominated in overseas currencies, and their June issuance was aided by reinvestments of bonds that were redeemed, said Yujiro Goto, a currency strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in London. He said there should be more demand this month.\n“July issuances may be bigger than redemptions, the first time in nine months, suggesting some recovery in popularity of foreign-currency denominated uridashi bonds,” said Goto.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T03:04:45.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
