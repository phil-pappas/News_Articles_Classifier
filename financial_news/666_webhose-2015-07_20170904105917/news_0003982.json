Headline inflation is expected to breach the upper end of the target range during the first two quarters of next year, while upside risks posed by the exchange rate have increased.\"\n\"The inflation forecast of the Bank has changed marginally since the previous meeting of the MPC, with headline inflation now expected to average 5.0 percent in 2015, up from 4.9 percent previously.\"\n\"The forecast for the first two quarters of next year has also been revised up by 0.1 percentage points to 6.9 percent and 6.1 per cent respectively, with a return to within the target range by the third quarter.\n\"However, the forecast average inflation for both 2016 and 2017 is unchanged at 6.1 percent and 5.7 percent.\"\nGROWTH\n\"The domestic growth outlook remains subdued amid continued electricity supply constrains and weak business and consumer confidence.\"\n\"The bank's forecast for growth in each year of the forecast period has been revised down marginally, to 2.0 percent in 2015 and 2.1 percent in 2016, and rising to 2.6 percent in 2017 when some easing of the electricity supply constraint is assumed.\" (Reporting by Johannesburg newsroom; Editing by Ed Cropley )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:39:56.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
