Mr Hockey also rang Goodsir’s boss, Fairfax chief executive Greg Hywood.\nThe Herald was forced to apologise for a mistake in the story about the Treasurer and the campaign fundraising body North Sydney Forum.\n“They have a f ... ing hide,’’ Goodsir texted his Fairfax colleague, The Age editor-in-chief Andrew Holden.\nHolden advised Goodsir to “dig” into the fundraising body (NSF) and “in that story you can run Hockey’s claim he knew nothing ... beyond that, f. him”.\nThat day, Goodsir instructed Herald state political editor Sean Nicholls to “drop all other work and be full time digging into NSF”.\nAfter receiving an update on Mr Nicholls’ work on March 27, Quote: : ‘F ... ing brilliant! ... Given what Andrew and I endured last week with Hockey, I want to have this nailed to the cross in more ways that one.’’\nThe article, published May 5 on the front page of the Herald and The Age , said that in return for annual fees of up to $22,000, NSF members were rewarded with “VIP” meetings with Mr Hockey.\nFairfax has argued the article contained correct factual material and the company did not intend to infer Mr Hockey was corrupt.\nMr Hockey has claimed he was devastated by the suggestion he was corrupt. He was seeking a damages payout of potentially more than $1 million.\nDefamation payouts are capped at $366,000 per matter, but aggravated damages can go higher.\nUnder cross-examination, Mr Goodsir said he formulated the ‘Treasurer for Sale’ headline the day before the story was printed, before the Treasurer had a chance to respond to or refute 13 implicit questions sent to his office about allegations he was offering privileged access to business leaders at a substantial cost.\nBut he denied the headline implied Mr Hockey was corrupt.\n“So you chose to write the words -Treasurer for sale’’ without knowing how my client would respond to those questions?’’ Mr Hockey’s counsel Bruce McClintock asked.\nMr Goodsir: “That’s fair.’’ Mr McClintock: “Did it occur to you that you should raise such serious allegations with my client?’’\nMr Goodsir: “No, it did not.” He later acknowledged that he thought the headline was “fair” and “truthful”, although admitted the words could be taken as claiming the Treasurer could be bought.\nMr McClintock: “Treasurer for sale equates to treasurer can be bought. And Treasurer can be bought equates to Treasure is corrupt, doesn’t it?’’\nMr Goodsir: “I do not agree with that.”\nMr Goodsir conceded he was “mildly irritated” at Mr Hockey for complaining directly to Fairfax Media’s CEO and seeking an apology before coming to him first, but said he was not motivated by revenge.\nOriginally published as Hockey’s $200,000 payday from Fairfax ", "external_links": ["http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/treasurer-joe-hockey-wins-200k-in-defamation-case-against-fairfax-media/story-fni6uok5-1227421995510", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/treasurer-joe-hockey-wins-200k-in-defamation-case-against-fairfax-media/story-fnki1jcy-1227422005824?sv=85b97c9ba66fe35e252b3be5f7556354&title=Hockey%26%238217%3Bs+%24200%2C000+payday+from+Fairfax", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/treasurer-joe-hockey-wins-200k-in-defamation-case-against-fairfax-media/story-fnki1jcy-1227422005824?sv=85b97c9ba66fe35e252b3be5f7556354&title=Hockey%26%238217%3Bs+%24200%2C000+payday+from+Fairfax", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/treasurer-joe-hockey-wins-200k-in-defamation-case-against-fairfax-media/story-fnki1jcy-1227422005824?sv=85b97c9ba66fe35e252b3be5f7556354&h=Hockey%26%238217%3Bs+%24200%2C000+payday+from+Fairfax", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/treasurer-joe-hockey-wins-200k-in-defamation-case-against-fairfax-media/story-fnki1jcy-1227422005824?sv=85b97c9ba66fe35e252b3be5f7556354", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=Hockey%26%238217%3Bs+%24200%2C000+payday+from+Fairfax&c=TREASURER+Joe+Hockey+has+won+%24200%2C000+in+a+defamation+case+against+Fairfax+Media+for+an+article+which+implied+he+was+%26%238220%3Bfor+sale%26%238221%3B.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/treasurer-joe-hockey-wins-200k-in-defamation-case-against-fairfax-media/story-fnki1jcy-1227422005824?sv=85b97c9ba66fe35e252b3be5f7556354", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/treasurer-joe-hockey-wins-200k-in-defamation-case-against-fairfax-media/story-fnki1jcy-1227422005824?sv=85b97c9ba66fe35e252b3be5f7556354"], "published": "2015-06-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:40:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
