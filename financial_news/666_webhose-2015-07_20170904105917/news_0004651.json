Philip Gostelow by Jonathan Barrett ﻿ The West Australian government is set to cash in on an estimated $1.5 billion in royalties should the Woodside-led Browse project go ahead, after the discovery of tiny rocky outcrops gave the state majority ownership over the lucrative Torosa gas field, at the expense of the Commonwealth.\nThe state government executed a deed of agreement with the Commonwealth on Wednesday, whereby Western Australia has secured 65.4 per cent ownership of Torosa and the federal government 34.6 per cent.\nPrior to the discovery of the rocks – which are on top of the gas field and have redefined maritime borders in the state's favour – it was thought Western Australia would receive a stake in Torosa of as little as 5 per cent.\nWest Australian Minister for Mines and Petroleum, Bill Marmion, said on Wednesday that the \"lovely discovery of the rocks\" took some pain out of the decision by the Woodside-led project partners to pursue offshore processing technology to develop the gas reserves, rather than construct an onshore processing hub.\n\"It does take away some of the pain when you know you are getting some return from what happens in the middle of the ocean,\" Mr Marmion said.\nColin Barnett's Liberal government had long argued that an onshore gas-processing hub would create more economic benefits for the state, but the project partners said it was not commercial.\nThe Browse joint venture – Woodside (30.6 per cent ownership), Shell Australia (27 per cent), BP Developments (17.33 per cent), Japan Australia (14.4 per cent) and PetroChina International (10.67 per cent) – is designed to commercialise the Brecknock, Calliance and Torosa fields in the Indian Ocean.\nBut last year's dramatic drop in the oil price, which impacts gas prices, has added to market concerns about the profitability and timing of the Woodside-led venture. The Perth headquartered company is scheduled to make a final investment decision in the second half of next year.\n Mr Marmion said he expected the Torosa field to generate about $1.5 billion in gas royalties over the life of the project.\nThis is less than some previous estimates, where the state thought it might receive $2.5 billion, which is due to two competing parliamentary acts used to calculate the share of gas royalties.\n\"It's like getting a lotto win and finding out we have to share the prize with another winner,\" Mr Marmion said.\nIf the project goes ahead, the timing of the royalties to the state will depend on what order the gas fields are developed.\nFederal Minister for Industry and Science, Ian Macfarlane, said on Wednesday that he recognised that there was still much work to be done by the joint venture partners to make the project viable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:54:26.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
