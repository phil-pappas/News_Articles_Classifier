I wasn't expecting it at all, but I know with God all things are possible.' \nHe said the award would motivate him and the Sasso team to work harder to satisfy their clients. \n'I feel motivated to do more for my country in terms of producing best quality products, more job creation for the youth; and do whatever it takes to put up a production plant for our products,' he said. \nGNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T07:34:12.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
