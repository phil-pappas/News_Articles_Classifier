It is the Commission's view that such a process may be concluded within 2 years as there are indications from the relevant government departments that plans are underway to introduce and implement relevant policy,\" said the Commission. \nIn addition, the Commission stipulated that Vodacom should within five financial years following the approval date of the merger commit to a R10bn investment in fixed network, data and connectivity infrastructure. \nThis commitment \"will include all capital investments and long-term commitments, additions and upgrades in transmission, national long distance fibre, backhaul, connectivity and in the development of value adding services\". \nThe Commission added that \"at least 50% of the committed investment amount will specifically comprise investments in all fixed network elements required to enhance services to homes and enterprises in South Africa, including the development of value adding services\". \nMeanwhile, within 24 months of the approval date, Vodacom is also tasked with ensuring that its share capital held by Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) shareholders will increase by an amount of R1.4bn. \nVodacom may also not retrench any of Neotel's employees as a result of the merger, the Commission said. \nSource: Fin24", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T11:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T14:37:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
