But amid all the tumult, it’s all too easy to fall into financial traps. AdviceIQ Network member Wendy Spencer, president of Spencer Capital Strategies Inc., an independent Money Concepts contractor in Arvada, Colo., spells out the pitfalls:\nAttorneys say that if both you and your ex-spouse feel like you came out of your divorce thinking you gave up a lot, your settlement was probably fair. Maybe, but often your settlement’s results appear only after you live with them for a while.\nHere are five settlement pitfalls to watch for.\n1. House poor. People don’t like being uprooted and often hesitate to inflict change on children who may already be upset from the divorce. Others are seriously attached to their house and likely invested a lot of work in it over the years. Nevertheless, many of the recently divorced ultimately find house payments difficult and the house itself difficult to maintain alone.\nYour house may also suddenly be too large. And depending on the situation, the real estate can produce a huge and unexpected taxable event such as capital gains when you sell it.\n2. Short-sightedness. All too often divorcing people focus on short-term issues and benefits rather than considering long-term effects of financial decisions. Some are so eager to end the marriage that they don’t even want to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of decisions.\nMoney decisions amid emotional turmoil almost always come with obvious plusses and hidden, eventual minuses. For example, if you take – and quickly spend – the cash from selling your home, you risk missing out on investment-return gains in your retirement accounts. If you put the sale money in your retirement accounts you may run into cash-flow problems, essentially having traded retirement savings for, perhaps, equity in your home.\nAlways consider the long-term and the likely what-ifs.\nPage 1 / 3 Continue", "external_links": ["http://www.moneyconcepts.com/Wealth-Management/Independent-Financial-Advisor/wspencer#/", "http://www.adviceiq.com/"], "published": "2015-07-16T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T20:06:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
