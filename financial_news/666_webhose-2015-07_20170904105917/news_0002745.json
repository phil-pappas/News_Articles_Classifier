Global sales volumes of its sodas rose 1 percent in the second quarter, helped by growing demand for Coke Zero, Sprite and Fanta.\nSales volumes of still beverages were up 5 percent, with increases in ready-to-drink tea and packaged water offsetting declines in juice and juice drinks.\nFor the second straight quarter, sales rose in North America, which accounts for nearly half of the total. Prices there increased 4 percent in the quarter, while volume was up 2 percent.\nCoke effectively raised prices by switching to smaller-sized packaging, and it boosted ad spending for its brands.\nExpanded distribution of energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp's products in North America contributed to the increase. The company bought a stake in Monster last year as a way to diversify into faster-growing beverage categories.\nCoke's net revenue fell 3 percent to $12.16 billion, but it would have increased 4 percent without the impact of the strong dollar, acquisitions and divestitures. Analysts on average were expecting $12.06 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet income attributable to shareholders rose nearly 20 percent to $3.11 billion, or 71 cents per share.\nThe company said it would buy back shares worth up to $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion this year. Earlier, it had earmarked $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\"We looked at where we were for the first half of the year, and we looked at cash, particularly because of the currency getting worse in the back half and just tightened the range,\" Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller said on a conference call.\nCowen and Co analyst Vivien Azer said in a note that the tighter range seemed \"consistent with the share repurchase revision that we saw last October, where the company narrowed their outlook for buybacks.\"\nCoke's shares were down 0.3 percent at $41.05 in midday trading. At Tuesday's close, they had fallen 2.5 percent this year.\n(Reporting by Anjali Athavaley in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T19:13:24.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
