Mr Fyfe, who established Fyfe in the 1980s but has exited from the firm which employs 300 staff and has annual revenues of $80 million-plus, was chairman of the surveying and mapping arm of the Surveyors Board of South Australia.\nMr Fyfe rejects suggestions surveying was lumped in with accountancy as one of the more boring and mundane professions by bright high school students assessing their university options, who generally opted for other courses such as law, medicine and information technology.\nMarketing overhaul needed But he accepted that surveying needed a marketing overhaul to give it more pizzazz and a true picture of the hi-tech nature of the profession.\n \"It just hasn't been marketed particularly well over the past decade,\" he said.\nAustralia had about 2600 licensed and registered surveyors in Australia helped by another 8500 technicians, mappers and spatial engineers who can work under a licensed professional.\nA report by BIS Shrapnel in January 2015 projected there would be a shortage of 1816 surveyors across Australia in 2020-21 and that number would hover around 1400 for each of the five years to 2023-2024.\nThe BIS Shrapnel study forecast that on current trends there would be an average of 130 graduates a year in Australia over the next 10 years, with about 65 new technicians.\nMr Fyfe said advanced maths and physics are at the core of surveying and that had put some people off in the past, with some choosing to pursue the technician route through TAFE courses.\n\"I think there are too many soft options,\" Mr Fyfe said, referring to the broad trends in Australia education where the numbers of students studying maths and physics were dropping.\nThe Surveyors Board of South Australia was taking matters into its own hands, and has provided funds to underwrite a Master of Surveying higher degree at the University of South Australia since 2010, the only Masters degree offered in Australia in surveying.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-22T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T12:07:32.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
