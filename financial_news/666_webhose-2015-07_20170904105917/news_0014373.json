But I can see why a company doesn't want to lose hundreds of millions over a flag,\" Childress said.\nDavid Fraley, 54, of New Port Richey, a tennis court contractor, said he thinks NASCAR is in a difficult position.\n\"NASCAR's selling a product. How can it be held responsible for what its customers believe in?\" Fraley said.
