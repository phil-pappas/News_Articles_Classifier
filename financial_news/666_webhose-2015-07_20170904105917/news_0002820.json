There have been European activists who have been forced changes, but the U.S. style of pushing board changes publicly have been few and far between. \n“I’ll take credit for being the most successful American activist in Europe,” Mr. Ader says today, adding he’d be open to trying more. \nAfter several months of fighting last summer, in which Mr. Ader was critical of bwin’s management and performance, the sides settled on the eve of the vote to give Daniel Silvers, the president of his fund SpringOwl Asset Management, a seat at the board. \nMr. Ader says he developed a strong relationship with bwin chairman Philip Yea and urged 888 to get a seat at the table when bwin was running a sales process. \nGoing forward, Mr. Ader says he’ll look to acquire as much 888 stock as he can in the deal and let other shareholders take cash as he believes the combined company will have a chance to challenge online-gaming giant Amaya.
