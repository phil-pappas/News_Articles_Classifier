Share prices plunged as traders began unwinding positions, and the Shanghai Composite index is down more than 25% from its June high. But for U.S. fund investors, things may not be as bad as they seem. Here’s what they should know. \n#1: U.S. Funds Have Little Exposure to China’s Domestic Markets \nMost U.S.-based funds and ETFs don’t invest in the uber-volatile A-shares listed on China’s mainland exchanges. Instead, they typically hold Hong Kong-listed shares of mainland companies, which have generally been less volatile, and some U.S.-listed Chinese companies. The biggest of the handful of U.S.-listed ETFs that do focus on A-shares: the $567 million Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR). \n#2: Year-to-Date Performance Isn’t Awful \nAs scary as the recent drops have been, most U.S. funds that invest in China haven’t performed too badly so far this year, as a result of strong gains earlier on. The largest China-focused ETF, the $6.6 billion iShares China Large-Cap (FXI), was down 1.5% as of Tuesday, after being up more than 25% as of late April, according to Morningstar. The Deutsche X-trackers A-shares fund was up 7.3% for 2015 as of Tuesday—after having been up nearly 50% at one point last month. \n#3: China Funds Have Delivered for Longer-Term Holders as Well \nInvestors who’ve endured the churns of China’s markets over the years have done well. iShares China Large-Cap has returned an average of 9.3% a year over the past 10 years, according to Morningstar. \n#4: Over Time, There Will Be More A-Shares in U.S.-Listed Funds \nMost international-stock indexes don’t currently include A-shares. But that is changing. FTSE Group has added A-shares to two emerging-market indexes, and Vanguard Group funds that track FTSE indexes will begin adding A-shares later this year. Other index firms are likely to follow suit over time. That suggests that A-shares will become more common in both index and actively managed funds, and the performance of mainland and Hong Kong-listed shares may become more similar. \n#5: Like Other Volatile Holdings, These Should Be Small Positions Only \nNo one doubts that there’s more volatility ahead for China’s markets, which have historically been more volatile than other emerging markets. Moderate-risk investors with a 60% stock/40% bond index-fund portfolio should have about 1% of their portfolio in China, suggests Patricia Oey, a senior analyst at Morningstar.
