Photo: Tamara Voninski\nThe Commonwealth Bank of Australia will increase interest rates for housing investors by 0.27 percentage points, joining ANZ Banking Group in pushing up credit costs to slow its growth in lending to landlords.\nThe country's biggest bank on Friday said its standard variable interest rate for investor loans would rise to 5.72 per cent and fixed rates for property investors would also rise.\nThe change mirrors ANZ's move to also lift investor rates by 0.27 percentage points on Thursday.\nIt came as analysts predicted the four major banks' combined profits could be boosted by about $850 million if they all raised investor interest rates by 0.27 percentage points.\nAdvertisement Both CBA and ANZ have said the changes are aimed at complying with a 10 per cent a year cap on lending to landlords .\n\"As Australia's largest home lender, we support the prudential regulator's actions to ensure lending practices remain sustainable and we have been actively managing our investment home loan portfolio to remain below the 10 per cent growth limit,\" CBA's group executive for retail banking services, Mat Comyn, said in a statement.\n\"Despite making a range of changes to our investor lending policies in the past few months, we have witnessed ongoing investor lending growth, and at an industry level, investor lending approvals remain 22 per cent higher than 12 months ago.\"\nAmid fears Sydney and Melbourne's housing markets are overheating , banks are being forced to slow the growth in their housing investor loan portfolios to less than 10 per cent a year.\nThis has prompted them to tighten lending conditions and raise rates for new investor borrowers, but now ANZ and CBA are raising rates for all existing customers.\nA report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Andrew Hill said other banks were also likely to \"re-price\" their loan books to some degree in response to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's 10 per cent speed limit on investor lending.\n\"Whether peers also re-price investor loans remains to be seen but we note that NAB remains above APRA's 10 per cent speed limit (c.14 per cent as of May),\" the report said.\n\"Presumably though, if peers do not follow ANZ's lead, they will likely gain more share and once again exceed the 10 per cent speed limit.\"\nAs well, raising interest rates will make lending more profitable at a time when margins are being squeezed by tougher competition and rules forcing big banks to hold larger buffers to shield against bad loans .\nMr Hill wrote that over a full year, ANZ's move would lift net profit after tax by $124 million, while CBA's profits would benefit by $244 million.\nIf National Australia Bank made the same move, its profits would be lifted by $127 million and Westpac's would increase by $296 million, the report said.\nAs a share of total profits, raising rates on investor loans would be most profitable for Westpac, lifting earnings by 3.8 per cent, it said.\nRegional lenders also stand to gain significantly. Bank of Queensland's bottom line would be enhanced by 6.5 per cent, or $23 million, while Bendigo and Adelaide Bank's profits would rise by 5.5 per cent, or $24 million.\nPrevious moves by banks to raise interest rates for owner-occupiers independently of the Reserve Bank of Australia have sparked political anger and risked a backlash from customers.\nHowever, CBA equities analyst Victor German said APRA's lending cap removed some of the \"downside risk\" of \"out-of-cycle\" interest rate hikes.\n\"While in a normal competitive environment reâ€‘pricing changes of this nature may potentially lead to customer attrition, in this instance we believe the regulator has essentially removed that risk,\" Mr German said in a note to clients.\n\"Given that APRA has restricted the banks' ability to grow their investor lending books we don't expect the major peers to target ANZ's customers and expect the industry to follow ANZ's pricing lead (either in the form of a higher base rate or further reductions in discount available to investors).\"", "external_links": ["http://www.afr.com/real-estate/residential/median-house-price-in-sydney-tops-1-million-for-first-time-20150723-gihqjk"], "published": "2015-07-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T10:35:24.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
