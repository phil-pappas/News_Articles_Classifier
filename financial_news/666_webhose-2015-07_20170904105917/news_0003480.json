The Bank of Japan recently highlighted an alternative gauge to its benchmark index while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand conceded that its forecasts have consistently overestimated inflation.\nIn Korea, price gains have trailed the BOK’s 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent band since 2012, and a new range to be applied from 2016 will be released later this year.\n“This target is too high,” Moon, one of seven policy makers who vote on interest-rate decisions, said in an interview at his office on July 23. “Given that we spent 3 years seeing our inflation rate below the target, I think not only the board members but also BOK officials will agree on the need to lower it.”\nMoon, 55, a dissenting voice on each of the last four occasions when the central bank lowered borrowing costs, taught international economics and finance at Seoul National University before joining the board in 2012.\nHe said he would prefer a wider inflation band to give more room for the BOK to fulfill its two mandates -- maintaining financial stability and price stability.\nMoon said he sees South Korea’s potential growth rate at a little above 3 percent.\nGrowth Potential Moon’s estimate is different to what the central bank actually expects Korea to achieve this year, with the most recent forecast for gross domestic product to expand by 2.8 percent in 2015.\nThe spread of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome hurt consumer spending in the second quarter and exports have declined every month this year.\n“If export performance in the second half of 2015 is more disappointing than I had expected in the first part of this year, then obviously, growth may be lower than the current estimate of 2.8 percent.”\nThe recent weakness of the won will be temporary and currency strength looms as a key concern to Moon when he looks beyond an expected increase in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n“In the long term, it is very likely that the won will show a tendency of appreciation,” he said, citing the impact of Korea’s current account surplus.\nThe BOK expects the current account surplus to reach $98 billion this year, before narrowing to $88 billion in 2016.\nOil Reserves Taking advantage of lower oil prices to import more of the fuel and stockpile it is one measure Korea could consider to ease the pressure on the current account, said Moon.\nThe won has fallen 4.5 percent against the dollar so far this quarter, the biggest loss among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. In the past twelve months, the won appreciated 7.2 percent against the Japanese yen and 8.2 percent versus the euro, hurting the competitiveness of Korean exporters.\n“Vis-a-vis Japan, the automobile sector is the most fragile,” said Moon. “The electronics sector is a little bit different. For example, Samsung Electronics had enough competitiveness and the impact of yen depreciation on Korean electronics companies was limited.”\nRates Outlook Moon indicated he doesn’t see a need to lower the benchmark interest rate that’s now 1.5 percent and said the last four cuts were “a little bit beyond my expectations.”\nThe property market doesn’t need further stimulation and reducing borrowing costs any more would encourage greater household debt, which is hard to bring down, he said.\nMoon’s term on the board ends in April 2016, along with with three other members.", "external_links": ["http://www.bok.or.kr/broadcast.action?menuNaviId=1612\\"], "published": "2015-07-27T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T02:45:28.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
