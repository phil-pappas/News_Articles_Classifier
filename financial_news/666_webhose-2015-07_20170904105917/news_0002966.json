Tony Feder by Simon Evans A warrant was issued on Monday for the arrest of former coal billionaire Nathan Tinkler after he failed to appear in person in the Supreme Court of South Australia, as liquidator Tony Matthews pushes to find out whether there's enough assets to pursue fresh legal action on behalf of creditors.\nMr Matthews, the liquidator of one of Mr Tinkler's horse farm companies, said late on Monday that he wants to closely examine in court what assets Mr Tinkler may have elsewhere.\nIt's part of deciding whether to launch legal action to try and recover funds on behalf of creditors.\n\"That would be part of the process, what assets might be available,\" Mr Matthews said late on Monday.\nHe also wants to examine whether there had been any insolvent trading as part of his investigations.\nThe arrest warrant comes 2Â½ years after the financial collapse of Patinack Farm on the Gold Coast hinterland which left creditors owed more than $5.5 million in unpaid debts.\nMr Tinkler, who started off as an electrician, and then built up a business empire worth more than $1 billion between 2006 and 2012 as coal prices soared, is a passionate horseracing fan who at one point built Patinack Farm into one of the biggest thoroughbred businesses in Australia with more than 1000 horses.\nMr Matthews said Mr Tinkler should have turned up to the Supreme Court in Adelaide on Monday as scheduled.\n \"In my view he should have been there,\" he said.\nMr Tinkler told reporters on Monday that he had informed the liquidators that he could not attend the hearing on Monday.\n\"I'm not running from anything, I wasn't there because I thought this had all been resolved,\" he told News Ltd.\n\"I'd been liaising with these guys [Anthony Matthews and Associates] all last week, I'd offered them security, it was all fine, and then they refused to return my calls this morning and then made that action. They knew full well that I wasn't able to be in Adelaide, I'd offered them security for that reason.\"\nTalks were continuing late on Monday between solicitors for Mr Matthews and Mr Tinkler about the next steps and whether an application would be made by Mr Tinkler to have the arrest warrant order amended.\nMr Matthews was officially appointed as liquidator of the Patinack Farm Administration Pty Ltd entity on November 21, 2012 and said it had been a very frustrating process dealing with Mr Tinkler.\n\"Frustrating is the right word,\" he said.\nA claim by WorkCover SA for $16,977.56 in unpaid levies was the catalyst for the liquidation. The Australian Tax Office is another substantial creditor.\nJustice Steve Roder made the order earlier on Monday for the arrest of Nathan Leslie Tinkler following an application by Mark Douglas, on behalf of Mr Matthews.\nMr Douglas said Mr Tinkler had shown a flagrant disregard for the court in not attending.\nwith Peter Ker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T22:50:04.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
