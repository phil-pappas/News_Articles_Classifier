What's happening globally can't be totally ignored.\" \nOn currency markets the dollar eased to 123.44 yen from 123.56 yen in New York, while the euro changed hands at $1.1073 and 136.78 yen against $1.1058 and 136.64 yen. \nOil prices continue to fall on worries about the global economy as well as a global supply glut. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell four cents to $47.94 and Brent crude for September declined nine cents to $53.21 in morning Asian trade. \nGold fetched $1,096.18 an ounce compared with $1,091.80 late Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T05:52:10.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
