This is Territorial Bancorp Inc.’s 22nd consecutive quarterly dividend. \nHONOLULU, July 30, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Territorial Bancorp Inc. (NASDAQ: TBNK ) (the “Company”), headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii, the holding company parent of Territorial Savings Bank, announced net income of $3.84 million or $0.41 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $3.72 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2014. \nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase in its quarterly cash dividend from $0.16 to $0.17 per share. The dividend is expected to be paid on August 27, 2015 to stockholders of record as of August 13, 2015. \nAllan Kitagawa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our loan portfolio grew by 14.7% during the first six months of 2015, while net interest income rose by 4.9% for the first six months of 2015 as compared to the first six months of 2014. Our strong performance has allowed us to increase our dividend. Our next dividend, which will be paid on August 27, 2015, represents our 22nd consecutive quarterly dividend payment.” \nInterest Income \nNet interest income after provision for loan losses increased to $13.96 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from $13.21 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Total interest and dividend income was $15.61 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $14.88 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The $729,000 growth in interest and dividend income was primarily due to a $1.51 million increase in interest earned on loans which occurred primarily because of the increase in loans receivable. The increase in interest income on loans was offset by an $812,000 decline in interest income from investment securities due to a net decline in our investment securities portfolio from repayments and sales that exceeded securities purchased. \nInterest Expense and Provision for Loan Losses \nTotal interest expense increased to $1.55 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from $1.51 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. During the quarter, interest expense on deposits rose by $51,000 due to an increase in total deposits. Interest expenses on advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank rose by $91,000 due to an increase in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Interest expense on securities sold under agreements to repurchase declined by $100,000 because of a decrease in these borrowings. During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the provision for loan losses was $101,000 compared to a $156,000 provision for the three months ended June 30, 2014. \nNoninterest Income \nNoninterest income was $1.25 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.28 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The reduction in noninterest income was primarily due to a $69,000 decrease in the gain on sale of investment securities that occurred because of a reduction in the amount of securities sold. \nNoninterest Expense \nNoninterest expense was $8.84 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $8.75 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. An increase in equipment and other general and administrative expenses was offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits. \nAssets and Equity \nTotal assets increased to $1.743 billion at June 30, 2015 from $1.692 billion at December 31, 2014. Loans receivable grew by $142.02 million or 14.7% to $1.111 billion at June 30, 2015 from $969.26 million at December 31, 2014 as residential mortgage loan originations exceeded loan repayments and sales. The growth in loans receivable was funded primarily by a $13.70 million increase in deposits, a $38.81 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents, $47.21 million received from repayments and sales of investment securities and a $42.00 million increase in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased to $60.0 million at June 30, 2015 from $72.0 million at December 31, 2014. Deposits increased to $1.373 billion at June 30, 2015 from $1.360 billion at December 31, 2014. Total stockholders’ equity increased to $218.36 million at June 30, 2015 from $216.38 million at December 31, 2014. The increase in stockholders’ equity occurred as the Company’s net income for the year exceeded share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders. Through June 30, 2015, the Company has repurchased 2,949,253 shares of stock or 24.1% of the shares issued in its initial public offering in 2009. \nAsset Quality \nTotal delinquent loans 90 days or more past due and not accruing totaled $1,805,000 (5 loans) at June 30, 2015, compared to $758,000 (4 loans) at December 31, 2014. Non-performing assets totaled $5.40 million at June 30, 2015 compared to $4.45 million at December 31, 2014.
