The Ministry of Finance will sell 2.5 trillion yen ($20 billion) of five-year JGBs at the auction.\nThe JGB market showed little reaction to the well-anticipated decision by the Bank of Japan to stand pat on monetary policy.\nJGBs also took in stride the BOJ's decision to cut its growth forecast for the year ending in March 2016 to a 1.7 percent increase from the 2.0 percent expansion it forecast in April, as the move had been widely reported beforehand.\n($1 = 123.3900 yen) (Reporting by Tokyo markets team; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T08:33:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
