Historical 30-day volatility in the ETF surged to 96.75 percent on Thursday as the fund dropped 3 percent to $39.83 in New York.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index has lost 28 percent from a June 12 high despite government support measures that include arming a state-run financing agency with more than $480 billion to bolster the market. While policy makers are trying to rekindle enthusiasm for equities among China’s 90 million investors, those efforts may have little influence on foreign investors, according to Ankur Patel, the chief investment officer at R-Squared Macro Management.\nThe volatility in the ETF reflects the behavior of “developed market investors more than anything else,” Patel said by phone Thursday. “Foreign investors are spooked by the interventionist efforts that the Chinese government has made, they are saying at this point that they would rather take the risk outside of China, see what happens and then reposition later on.\"\n‘Manipulated Market’ Chinese stocks fell suddenly in the last hour of local trading on Thursday, after rising as much as 1.5 percent, leaving investors in the dark about reasons for the moves. Trading volumes in Shanghai have halved from their peaks in June, while margin debt, which had fueled a world-beating rally for China’s stocks, declined to a four-month low.\nThe government had halted initial public offerings, banned sales by some major shareholders and restricted short selling, helping drive a rally of as much as 18 percent in the Shanghai Composite since July 8. The benchmark gauge tumbled 8.5 percent on Monday, its sixth one-day decline of more than 5 percent since reaching a seven-year high in June.\n“When you get a manipulated market like this, you may well get some volatility,” Geoffrey Dennis, head of global emerging market strategy at UBS Securities, said by phone Thursday.\nA Bloomberg index tracking the most-traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. was unchanged on Thursday while the iShares China Large-Cap ETF tracking Hong Kong stocks slumped 1.5 percent to $40.65.\nVolatility will stay elevated as investors try to protect themselves from the price swings in the mainland market, Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, said.\n“People are very fearful of investing in the Chinese market,” Jacobsen said by phone on Thursday. “If we see slightly stronger Chinese economic data coupled with continued verbal support from Chinese policy makers, that could do a lot to calm the Chinese market.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T04:19:52.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
