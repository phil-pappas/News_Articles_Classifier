(PRWEB) July 08, 2015\nLumen21, an award-winning global technology firm specializing in compliance and technology, announced today that Lumen21 Compliant Cloud Computing Service, a comprehensive cloud computing infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is supported on Microsoft Azure. The Compliant Cloud Computing Service by Lumen21 makes it possible to be fully compliant with an organization’s specific regulatory requirements.\nLumen21 Compliant Cloud Computing follows the CSF (Common Security Framework) of HITRUST, which is a certifiable framework used by organizations. HITRUST CSF provides organizations with a comprehensive, flexible, efficient and certifiable approach to regulatory compliance and risk management.\nLumen21’s solution is compliant out-of-the-box. An organization can take its application to the cloud with the confidence that its infrastructure is fully compliant with industry regulations from a single vendor. It is the ideal IaaS solution for healthcare organizations, financial services firms, retailers or any enterprise needing a security-enhanced cloud environment. Lumen21 Compliant Cloud Computing offers a distinct advantage because Lumen21 understands the intricacies of compliance and has taken the extra steps to achieve certifications specific to the industries it serves.\n“Our goal with the Lumen21 Compliant Cloud Computing was to develop an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) service model for implementing, managing and taking care of all compliancy issues while taking advantage of all the benefits of a private cloud,” said Eduardo Don Jr., President of Lumen21. “Failure to meet HIPAA and other compliancy laws can have devastating consequences for an organization. Our HITRUST CSF-compliant solution is one less thing an organization has to worry about. Couple our service with Azure and its robust multi location offering, Azure ExpressRoute, Azure Virtual Machines and Storage, Load Balancer, and integration into the Microsoft Product Suite and you have a tremendous solution.”\n“We recognize the numerous issues clients in regulated industries face particularly as they seek to leverage technology. Solutions providers like Lumen21 are pivotal in the effort in facilitating the cloud transformation that clients are looking to achieve,” said Venkat Gattamneni, Group Product Marketing Manager, Microsoft Azure. “We are pleased to see Lumen21 using the power of Azure to provide customers in regulated industries solutions for their compliance needs.”\nLumen21 Compliant Cloud Computing includes:\n Proven Redundant, Compliant and Certifiable Cloud Infrastructure Managed IT Services Managed Security Services Integrated Professional Services Documented Processes\nLearn more about Compliant Cloud Computing by visiting: http://compliantcloud.lumen21.com\nAbout HITRUST CSF Certification\nHITRUST CSF rationalizes healthcare-relevant regulations and standards into a single overarching security framework. Because the HITRUST CSF is both risk- and compliance-based, organizations can tailor the security control baselines based on a variety of factors including organization type, size, systems and regulatory requirements. By continuing to improve and update the CSF, the HITRUST CSF has become the most widely-adopted security framework in the U.S. healthcare industry.\nAbout Lumen21\nLumen21 is an award-winning global technology firm focused on delivering the highest quality IT services to its clients and resellers.
