Thanks to LinkedIn, for instance, I recently connected with Barry Werner of “ Better Baltimore Bed and Breakfasts .” B&Bs are a subject “near and dear” to my heart—and particularly, my wife’s heart—as we enjoy taking trips to various parts of the country where we stay at…yes, a B&B. \nI wondered, how does one going about promoting one’s B&B? How do you stand out from the competition—and who is the competition, anyway? Other B&Bs? Hotels, motels, hostels, all of the above? So this week, I decided to approach Barry for his insights… \nFirst, tell us a little about yourself, your role with Better Baltimore Bed and Breakfasts and your own B&B, Scarborough Fair Bed and Breakfast . \nI was inspired to become an innkeeper by my grandmother. She and I would play B&B when I was about five years old or so and I would use my markers and crayons to make little brochures about the rooms, post menus and pretend to check my grandma into her room.I shared my desire for this career with my husband and in January of 2007 we started educating ourselves and seeking help in navigating the road to becoming innkeepers. Thanks to some great leadership and educators, we were checking guests into our B&B only 6 months later.The same great people who were the educators and exemplified a great nurturing and lively spirit for the innkeeping industry who put us on the right track asked me to join the leadership committee and then elected me to the executive board of the newly formed Association of Independent Hospitality Professionals (AIHP) and am honored to serve with a group who have the largest accumulated knowledge of any board in our industry.I was once the president and vice president of the Federal Hill Business association but gave that up to focus more in the hospitality realm. I am also the president of the Better Baltimore Bed & Breakfasts.Scarborough Fair B&B is the most award winning B&B in the city of Baltimore. It has been featured on international television, on best of lists in publications around the world and ranked highly for our cleanliness, hospitality and uniqueness. We are widely known for our homemade breakfasts, complimentary seasonal drinks, and homemade afternoon snack & treats for our guests. If you love food and whimsical ambiance, you will love our property. Many of the rooms are inspired by the life and works of authors, such as Edgar Allan Poe, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the Brothers Grimm. \nYou're trying to raise awareness about the B&B business in Baltimore and the impact of the recent riots--why? \nUnfortunately most of the media has given the impression that Baltimore is exactly as seen on the show \"The Wire\". And for most of the city, it is more like the TV show \"Ace of Cakes\" meaning highly creative, full of energy, quirky, fun, sweet and really tasty. The riot made the fictionalized world of the wire come alive to an extent and many do not understand that the rioting was fairly confined and that the city is now looking better than even before the riots and that there is an even higher sense of pride of place by the resident of Baltimore.B&Bs are the original cottage industry, quite literally. We are the little guys and many of us get into this industry not to make millions but because we adore people. We like helping them. We love learning from them and sharing stories. Better Baltimore Bed and Breakfasts decided to help out the best way we can with by trying to help the youth who feel so very disenfranchised with their future in the city and helping the local businesses to keep neighborhoods thriving.There is also no better way to authentically experience a new place than at a Bed and Breakfast because most of the time they are someone's home. Someone is welcoming you into their own residence and sharing it with you. You get a feel for the local culture, the pace of life, and learn from those who own and work there where the best places to eat and explore really are found. \nWho have you targeted with your message about Baltimore B&Bs? Are you using social media, traditional media, and if so, in what ways? \nWe have targeted those within Baltimore, the suburbs, and far beyond. Our business is divided in to three main categories: those traveling to visit their friends and family who live in the city, those who are tourists, and those who are traveling for business. To hit all three you have to be far reaching and broad in scope while occasionally focusing a message directed at just one sub-segment of one of those categories, like families with children or those business coming for a particular convention. \nWe do use social media, (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), neighborhood newsletters, and reach out to online blogs and news organizations.For social we use smaller \"pops\" of info usually with an image or photo. For traditional media, bloggers and local newsletters we use rich, content filled press releases that are nearly fully written stories themselves. \nWhat plans/tactics/strategies do you have in mind to help \"bring people back to Baltimore,\" to visit Baltimore and stay at B&Bs? \nThe first part is to get people to recognize that Baltimore is still a thriving and mostly happy and fun place to explore. We are doing that with \"Good News\" stories, events postings, and photos showing the breadth of the great experiences to be had in the charm city. Photos of great food, people enjoying the inner harbor, news on charitable work, business expansions, and the like.Next we are putting our dollars where are mouths are with donations and savings to attract potential guests who want to support the good that still exists in Baltimore City with our Making Baltimore Better campaign. (see press release sent to you)Lastly we are reminding travelers that the very best way to authentically experience the city is at a B&B. Innkeepers can make suggestions on where to go, what to do, and where to eat. You are most commonly a guest in someone's personal home, so there is a feeling of relaxed comfort that you do not get in a sterile hotel. I always say Hotels are not sterile enough where they should be and too sterile where they shouldn't be, meaning at a B&B the stay is guest-central and the rooms are clean because the owners inspect them themselves and often do the cleaning too. If you stay at a Marriott property, you certainly are not going to ever meet anyone in the Marriott family, but you are very likely to meet and interact with the owners of a Bed & Breakfast. Another bonus of a B&B stay is the value of it all. Most include beverages, homemade snacks, homemade breakfasts, some offer parking, wifi is almost always included in the rate and more. And the food is not just homemade because they can do so, it is really exceptional food because most B&Bs enjoy food and drink a great deal.This is why business travelers are slowly starting to choose Bed & Breakfasts over traditional hotels because they can sell their supervisors on the value and it allows them to feel more relaxed and like the business trip is a bit more of a vacation where they are cared for rather than slogging their bags into yet another nondescript hotel where all beverages and snacks cost a lot extra and the breakfast, if included, is of questionable quality at best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T02:08:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
