It also assumes a 12% annual return. \nThe simplest starting point is to invest in your employer’s 401(k) plan, points out Ramit Sethi in his New York Times bestseller, “ I Will Teach You To Be Rich .” Next, he says, consider contributing money towards a Roth IRA or traditional IRA, individual retirement accounts with different contribution limits and tax structures. \nWhile the numbers in the chart below are not exact (for simplicity, it does not take into account the impact of taxes, and 12% is a high rate of return), they give you a good idea of how coming up with a couple of extra dollars each day can make an enormous difference in the long run, particularly if you start saving at a young age. \nNext time you consider running to Starbucks for a $4 latté , think about this chart and consider redirecting that coffee cash to your savings: Mike Nudelman/Business Insider \nThis article originally appeared on Business Insider \nMore from Business Insider:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T22:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T00:57:23.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
