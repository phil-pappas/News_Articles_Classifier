In April-June, they added 3,037 machines. \nAll state-owned banks taken together had 1,28,827 ATMs as of June 30, 2015. According to Finance Ministry data, Canara Bank had earlier planned to install 250 such machines in 2015-16, but has now revised the target upwards to 1,000. \nIn the first quarter, it installed 506 ATMs, taking its total ATMs to 9,039. However, Bank of India has reduced its target to only 729 for the current fiscal from the earlier 2,229. \nIt installed 708 ATMs in the first quarter and is just 21 short of the new year-end target. As of March 31, 2015, it had 6,771 ATMs. The country's largest lender, State Bank of India, is looking to install 2,000 ATMs in the current fiscal. \nThe addition will take its total ATMs to 44,317 by March 2016-end. In the first three months, it added 227 such machines. \nBharatiya Mahila Bank is working on a blueprint to add 110 ATMs to take the total to 165 during the fiscal. As part of its financial inclusion initiative, the government has been pushing state-owned banks to deepen ATM presence. \nPTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-26T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T12:02:51.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
