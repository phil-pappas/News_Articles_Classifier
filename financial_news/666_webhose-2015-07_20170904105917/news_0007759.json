Photo: Graham Denholm\nAustralian fashion designers are not the only losers in Myer's brand cull. Myer is clearing private label brands such as Piper, Regatta and Basque to make room for new labels in a reversal of the retailer's profit growth strategy over the past few years.\nAfter revealing on Tuesday that it had deleted about 100 domestic and international brands from its 67 stores, Australia's largest department store chain started a \"massive spring clean sale\" on Wednesday, less than a week after wrapping up its mid-year clearance sale. Myer's website crashed around 6 pm as customers flocked to the site, lured by discounts of 30 to 50 per cent.\nMyer's private label brands, including Piper, Basque, Regatta, Chloe and Lola, Trent Nathan, Wayne by Wayne Cooper, Charlie Brown, Howard Showers, Miss Shop and L Liso Ho, featured in the list of heavily discounted apparel and footwear brands.\nThe private label brands, or MEBs, have helped Myer differentiate its offer from David Jones and Target and have been a key driver of sales and margin growth over the past few years, with sales reaching $638 million, or 20 per cent of group sales, in 2014. The retailer owns or stocks 66 MEBs after buying several distressed brands, such as Trent Nathan and Charlie Brown, and developing in-house labels.\nAdvertisement However, Myer's new chief executive Richard Umbers and deputy chief executive and chief merchandise and marketing officer Daniel Bracken believe the private label range has grown too fast and occupies too much space in Myer's stores.\nAs part of its turnaround plan, Myer plans to \"condense\" its private label offer and introduce on-trend brands including Aje, Jack and Jones and Calvin Klein White Label, which better reflect the fashion aspirations of its customers.\n\"It's fair to say that our brand reduction is across all our product categories and across all our channels to market, whether they are wholesale, whether they be a hybrid concession, whether they be private label,\" Mr Bracken told Fairfax Media.\nClear focus \"We have a very clear focus on who the most valuable customer is to our business and that's what is driving us to put these new brands into our business,\" he said.\n\"Piper is a good private label brand but we may have extended it into too many sub-categories [and] the same could be said of Basque.\"\nMyer did not have a sales mix target for private label and national brands, Mr Bracken said.\n\"We'll focus on what is the right offer for our customers and how much real estate do they need and what productivity levels are needed to drive the right outcome for Myer.\"\nGazal Corp chief executive Patrick Robinson welcomed Myer's new strategy, saying it represented a growth opportunity for some of the brands in Gazal's joint venture with PVH Inc, especially Calvin Klein White Label.\n\"We see good growth for those brands in this market. They are globally positioned, they have a great design team and great scale ... we think we're well positioned with those brands as we move forward,\" Mr Robinson said.\nIn a move that is set to shake up the discount retail sector, Gazal has agreed to sell its 35 Trade Secret stores to global off-price retail giant TJX Companies Inc for $80 million to focus on the PVH brands.\nClean-out welcomed Another brand owner, who did not wish to be named, also welcomed Myer's brand clean-out.\n\"They have a lot of brands in their stable that just don't resonate with their customers,\" he said. \"It's very similar to what David Jones went through and our brands in David Jones have had fantastic growth since then.\"\nDavid Jones has culled about 180 brands from its portfolio of more than 2500 brands over the past six months, including 80 in womenswear alone, clearing floor space for brands such as Seed, FCUK, Marcs, Country Road, Trenery and Witchery and private labels Studio W and Re:.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T01:00:38.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
