The Google vehicle was not at fault in any of those incidents, the company said.\nGoogle had mentioned the incident in a blog post on Thursday, without details on injuries.\n\"Our self-driving cars are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers who are distracted and not paying attention to the road,\" wrote Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project, in the blog post. \"The clear theme is human error and inattention\" in those incidents.\nGoogle is testing a fleet of 23 specially equipped Lexus prototypes, and said it has logged more than 1 million test miles. Last month, the company began testing tiny, bubble-shaped self-driving prototype vehicles of its own design on public roads around Mountain View.\nThe company has also started testing self-driving prototypes in Austin, Texas.\nGoogle and other automotive manufacturers and suppliers have said the technology to build self-driving cars should be ready by 2020.\nUrmson has said the company does not want to build its own self-driving cars, but would prefer to find a development and production partner.\nBut most major multinational automakers are developing their own so-called automated vehicles that are designed to control major functions such as steering, brakes and throttle, without human effort.\nThe Google self-driving cars have humans on board who can assume manual control of the vehicles if necessary.
