According to MBA Renewables graduate Kareem Abu Eid, “this programme is a specialised MBA that enhances students’ professional development!” Investing in efficiency is essential to increase competitiveness and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. ERE International - with a focus on energy and resource efficiency in energy supply, industry, commerce and the built environment - shows how to deal with the challenges of resource allocation both in the public and private sectors. The on-campus times provide excellent networking opportunities combined with practical, hands-on training and site visits to real installations. In this way, students coming from the whole world not only put their knowledge into practice, but also establish direct contacts with other students and the industry. “I hope there will be more chances similar to this”, 2015 on-campus time participant Ömer Muhtaroglu said. “From the content of the course to the on-site visits, everything was perfect”. The Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin offers more than 72 accredited programmes in engineering, sciences and economics.
