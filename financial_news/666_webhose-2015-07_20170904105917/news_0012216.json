Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Paul Smith An ambitious Australian consumer technology group with plans to take on the likes of Apple and Samsung, with a range of wearable technology, mobile devices and electronic gadgets, will list on the ASX after raising capital ahead of a product push.\nThe company, IoT Group, has only one tech device available in the market now, a smartwatch that sells at selected Coles stores for $99, but it has plans to unveil a range of more than 20 products, including more smartwatches, a potentially revolutionary universal computing device, an augmented-reality heads-up display, and a drone for taking selfies from up to 25 metres away.\nSimon Kantor, chief executive of the company and the brains behind its products, said most of IoT Group's products fit under the broad banner of the so-called internet of things (IoT), where disparate devices are connected to, and controlled by the internet. He said the company was planning to go public in December, or in the first quarter of next year, depending on how rapidly it can build momentum in its planned assault on the market.\nShould it gain traction, IoT Group could represent the main opportunity for local investors to buy into the boom in mobile devices and gadgets, with most other locally listed tech players being either services, social media, financial services or telecommunications-related. The company is positioning itself as an affordable, mass-market consumer electronics supplier, with most of its devices slated to cost well under $300.\nRoam's flagship product is a univeral computing device, known as the Roam Freedom, which is still at the prototype phase. As well as Mr Kantor, the company has some well-known figures involved. Former Virgin Entertainment Group CEO and Sony marketing executive Ian Duffell is a director and is responsible for business strategy. Meanwhile Australian tech industry veteran Sean Neylon, who founded Australia's first listed internet media company LibertyOne, is also a director with responsibility strategic business development.\nThe company will be an amalgamation of three currently separately operated businesses, which can now be executed following the completion of a $2 million capital raising, managed by Foster Stockbroking. The companies are the OK Watch business, Mr Kantor's Roam wearables business and InnovativePTV (IPTV), an internet-based TV network with a focus on ethnic communities within Australia and New Zealand.\nAs well as having an ongoing relationship with Coles, Woolworths will also shortly begin to sell the company's next-generation smartwatch at newly created manned mobile kiosks in its stores. IoT Group has also secured a deal with the world's largest wireless distribution company, Brightstar, which will handle most of its logistics. Mr Kantor said the initial smartwatches, which were manufactured in China, sold out within days; its expanded range would be more widely available and in good supply.\n\"We did the market test with Coles in its 82 mobile-enabled stores; but it has over 700 stores, and the plan is to roll out watches to all of their stores over the next three months at their service desks,\" Mr Kantor said.\n Retail deals \"In addition to Coles and Woolworths, the plan is to be in about 10 retail chains by Christmas, including JB HiFi, Harvey Norman and Dick Smith's. The production side of things is definitely sorted; we have the capability to produce about 10,000 units a week.\"\nThe company is planning to initially launch three new product lines, which will come from the Roam business. They will include a sports smartwatch, and a watch known as the Trademaster, which will be water-resistant, durable and designed for tradies, with features including a laser tape measure. It will also initially sell a Focus Head Up Display (HUD), which provides a real time view of data on a screen, which can either be mounted on a vehicle or on the visor of a helmet.\nWhereas the Skully helmet can now be pre-ordered to provide an augmented reality view as a motorcyclist, Mr Kantor said HUD would simply add a transparent screen to an existing helmet's visor.\n\"We thought Skully was a great product, but we wanted to create something like Google Glass, but make it more user-friendly and not such a flop, and this will let you use a heads-up display in a user-friendly way,\" he said.\n\"So you can put whatever data you want from your phone or standalone and have it in your field of view. From us, this is going to be a $149-to-$199 retail product, as opposed to about $2000, which is what the current Skully is retailing for.\"\nThe third product will be a drone, which will be controlled by a smartphone app, with the primary purpose of taking selfies. Mr Kantor and his team have designed software that will make the drone focus on certain features, and be able to follow a subject from up to 25 metres away. He said he expected to tap into the huge market that had splashed out on selfie sticks in 2014, and charge $149 for the drones.\nA new kind of mobile device Roam's flagship product is a universal computing device, known as the Roam Freedom, which is still at the prototype phase. Mr Kantor however said he has high hopes of creating a new brand category, having worked on the device with a small team for four years.\nHe said the Freedom is an amalgamation of a smartphone, tablet, laptop and desktop computer. The size of a standard smartphone, it packs 128GB of solid-state internal storage space and has multiple processors. The 5.5-inch cell phone has three screens, which can be unfolded to form a 10-inch tablet; it also has an inbuilt laser to project a full size keyboard onto any surface, meaning it could feasibly serve as a full PC, and can run Windows 10 natively.\n\"Personally I would love to get it to CES [in Las Vegas in January], but obviously building the foundation of a strong company here comes first, so realistically it will be a bit later next year,\" Mr Kantor said. \"Once we can build some traction and brand awareness, I think we will have a better chance of taking on that new segment.\"\nThe manufacture of the company's products is a global operation, with most components made under detailed instructions in China. Mr Kantor said much of the company's revenue growth was also likely to also come across Asia and in other emerging markets.\nGlobal ambition He said Apple's pricing and focus on developed markets left a hole to be filled by smaller players in many countries, and that India also represented a great opportunity for companies targeting an emerging consumer mobile market with affordable, good-quality products. The company is pitching itself to investors as following a \"good, better, best\" model, where the likes of Apple and Samsung represent \"best\" with their high-priced top-end products, and IoT Group represents \"better\" by being in the $99-to-$199 range.\n\"We don't really want to compete with the big guys like Apple at all, but that being said, I think that eventually everybody ends up competing with them as they are so big,\" Mr Kantor said.\n\"I think ultimately the big companies like Apple and Samsung will be picked apart by smaller start-ups. The availability of cost-effective manufacturing these days, and the amount of talent that can now pursue VC funding in the US, is going to create a variety of smaller companies that are more responsive and have better technology than the large ones.\"", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SaysSmithy", "http://www.skully.com/#smartest-helmet"], "published": "2015-07-05T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T12:06:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
