M20 Junctions 11 to 12 no longer closed but delays likely. Check with operator if heading to Channel Tunnel as services disrupted.\" \nThe Highways Agency announced that the M20 heading towards Dover was closed between junctions eight and nine due to an \"incident\" but added it was expected to re-open from noon. \nFerry services are reported to be operating as normal at the Port of Dover. \nMore than 3,000 hauliers were parked on the M20 earlier this week after the closure of the Port of Calais crippled Channel sailings. \nThe chaos was sparked after MyFerryLink workers began a strike on Monday in protest at expected job cuts. \nSome 3,000 migrants are currently camped out around Calais and are trying to cross the Channel into Britain. \nFrance and Britain agreed in September to create a fund of €5m (£3.5m) per year to help Calais cope with the influx of migrants by reinforcing security around the port and the Channel Tunnel entrance. \nVolunteers from the charity L'Auberge des Migrants say up to 50 new migrants were arriving every day at the camp, and there were not enough tents, blankets or food. \nBritish travellers have been advised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to keep vehicle doors locked in traffic and when unattended in Calais.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T11:35:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
