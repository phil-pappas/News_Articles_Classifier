SoFi Chief Financial Officer Nino Fanlo said his firm has issued about two-thirds of the rated transactions from such lenders so far.\n“SoFi continues to have a leadership role in getting transactions to the capital markets,” he said in an interview.\nDBRS expects the underlying loans in SoFi’s deal to default a bit more in a “base case” scenario than those backing bonds sold last month by the lender that it ranked a level lower. Still, the ratings firm has grown more comfortable with the lender’s business, analyst Jon Riber said. Of the $2.3 billion in student loans it’s originated, only five have been charged off, with borrowers dying in most of those cases, he said.\n‘Impressive’ Record “That’s a very impressive track record so far, so we took that into account,” Riber said.\nMoody’s Investors Service is offering ratings on the securities receiving top grades from DBRS that are two levels lower.\nThe separate capital financing being sought by San Francisco-based SoFi, which focuses on refinancing government-backed student loans into private debt, may value it at about $3 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this week.\nSoFi started as a so-called peer-to-peer lending company -- matching borrowers with retail investors, rather than a bank -- for Stanford University students and graduates. Riber said that he wouldn’t use the peer-to-peer label to describe the company anymore. Fanlo said he prefers “fintech” for the firm and its peers, because it’s “a financial company that uses technology to implement its strategy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T00:42:16.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
