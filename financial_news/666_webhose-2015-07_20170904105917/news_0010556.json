Athens' stock exchange is set to re-open with restrictions after the ECB granted a request from the ministry of finance. \nGreece is slowly returning back to normalcy following nearly a month of capital controls. \nDomestic credit card holders will be allowed to carry out foreign transactions for the first time since limits on transactions were imposed on June 29. \nNegotiations over a third-bail for the country resumed this week. \n• Explosive Varoufakis parallel currency revealed \nHeads of the \"Troika\" - made up of the International Monetary Fund, European Commission and European Central Bank - will convene in the Greek capital after mid-ranking officials started talks on Monday. \nAthens says it expects technical talks to be completed by the end of the week, paving the way for the release of fresh funds to the country by the second week of August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T22:23:52.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
