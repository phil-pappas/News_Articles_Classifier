In the end, the Internet would only be as free as the world's least free place,\" it added. \nGoogle said it had evaluated and processed more than a quarter of a million requests to delist links to more than a million web pages since the ECJ's ruling. \nThe overwhelming majority of French internet users -- 97 percent -- accessed Google via a European version of the site, Fleischer added. \n- 'Respectfully disagree' - \nFollowing several hundred requests from French users, CNIL told Google in June it should apply the ruling globally and remove links from the whole of its network -- not just from google.fr and other European sites. \n\"As a matter of principle... we respectfully disagree with the CNIL's assertion of global authority on this issue and we have asked the CNIL to withdraw its Formal Notice,\" Google said. \nGoogle has become a lightning rod for critics in Europe on a broad range of issues from privacy to the protection of national publishers. \nThe Wikipedia information website has described the European ruling as creating \"memory holes\" in the Internet, while critics of the US Internet giant have said such standards are necessary to protect the privacy of citizens. \nContacted by AFP, CNIL confirmed it had received Google's response, which came a day before a month-long deadline it had given the search giant to make changes in adherence with the law. \n\"We are going to look at the arguments and we will respond to this submission within two months,\" a CNIL representative said, refusing to rule out possible financial sanctions. \nGoogle could face a fine of up 150,000 euros ($164,000), a figure that is dwarfed however by the firm's $66 billion in worldwide revenues last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T05:45:38.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
