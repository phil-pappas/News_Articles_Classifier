But a lot also depends on the monsoon,\" he added.\n\nThe four public sector general insurers have recorded a growth rate of 11.9 per cent in the first three months and thus have scored over their private sector peers who grew a tad lower at 11.4 per cent.\n\nState-owned general insurers collected Rs 12,430 crore premium, while the private sector earned a premium of Rs 9,733 crore in the reporting period.\n\n\"It's definitely a much better than the previous year and even the preceding quarter. I hope the trend will continue as the economy is picking up and rates have gone up in certain areas like fire (10 per cent) and health insurance. Auto sales have also shown good pick-up,\" New India Assurance chairman and managing director G Srinivasan said.\n\n\"While there is some improvement on the front of corporate insurance, we have also seen good growth in the retail segment too,\" he added.\n\nThe industry has termed the growth in the first quarter as an early sign of revival.\n\n\"It is an early sign that the industry has come back onto the revival path and I do hope that the industry will be able to rebound. We are dependent on several factors like distributors' role and improvement in the economy for growth,\" ICICI Lombard's Sanjay Datta said.\n\nSBI General Insurance grew by 30 per cent, which was well above the industry average of 12.5 per cent, during the period.\n\n\"At SBI General, we have grown by 30 per cent, primarily from health insurance and fire,\" SBI General Insurance managing director and chief executive Bhaskar J Sarma said, adding he is hopeful that the year could clip at 40-50 per cent. Retail, which accounts for 65-70 per cent of its portfolio now, will continue to be the focus, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T06:58:04.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
