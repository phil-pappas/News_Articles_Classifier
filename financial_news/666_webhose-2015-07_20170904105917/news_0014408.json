While they’re ready to hear Greece out, ministers are skeptical about Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’s bid for a two-year deal, according to three officials with knowledge of the call.\n“To move ahead, former pledges have to be held and it has been agreed earlier what these pledges should be,” Estonian Finance Minister Sven Sester said in an interview after the call. Sester said ministers will use Wednesday’s call to take stock and won’t make decisions without meeting in person.\nFormal talks may have to wait until after Greek voters go to the polls on July 5. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday that “we’ll negotiate about absolutely nothing” with the Greek government before its referendum on bailout terms.\nTsipras has asked euro-area finance ministers to extend his nation’s existing program -- which was set to expires at midnight on Tuesday -- for a few days to negotiate follow-on arrangements. He’s also requested debt relief and a two-year loan from the bailout fund.\n“The situation in Greece is deteriorating rapidly as a consequence of their own political choices,” Dijsselbloem told reporters.\nNew Program “A new program takes time and will have to contain tough measures and payments will have to be done,” Dijsselbloem said. “Greece is part of the euro zone and part of the ESM and is able to do such a request and we’re going to discuss that.”\nOn first look, the plan appeared to be a non-starter, according to three officials. In an effort to get talks on track, Greece has agreed to offer more information and signaled that Tsipras’s government might change its referendum terms and recommendation, another official said.\nFor a third bailout to go forward, Tsipras’s government would need to ask Greek citizens to vote “yes” if it goes forward with a Sunday referendum on bailout terms, one of the officials said. Euro-area nations have asked Greece whether it will recommend a “yes” vote or suspend the referendum entirely, and also whether Greece would embrace the list of “prior actions” in a June 26 offer from creditors.\nFinnish Finance Minister Alexander Stubb said it’s too soon for the ministers to discuss debt relief, as Tsipras requested.\n“Euro countries stand ready to support Greece in the renewal of its economy and rebuilding of prerequisites for growth,” Stubb said in a statement. A new bailout program “is only possible if Greece shows strong commitment to concrete measures to restore the health of its economy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T01:34:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
