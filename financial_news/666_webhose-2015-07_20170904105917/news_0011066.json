PUBLISHED: 07:06, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 | UPDATED: 07:23, Thu, Jul 30, 2015 GETTY Shell is making billions of pounds of cuts this year – and Centrica has seen profits slump \nShell said it was cutting 6,500 jobs as it takes action amid a slump in oil prices. \nThe firm added that it was \"planning for a prolonged downturn\" as it slashed costs for the year by £2.6 billion. \nInvestment for the year is being pared by £4.5 billion and further cost-cutting is expected in 2016. \nChief executive Ben van Beurden said: \"We have to be resilient in a world where oil prices remain low for some time, whilst keeping an eye on recovery.\" \nMeanwhile gas giant Centrica is to axe thousands of jobs after a strategic review which will see its workforce cut by 10 per cent. \nThe owner of British Gas said it will reduce its headcount by 6,000 across the group, not all in the UK. \nThe company will create 2,000 other jobs, so the net effect will be 4,000 job losses.
