We are very pleased to now be drilling these targets.”\n\nDesert Dragon Central's VMS potential was previously highlighted through the results of the 2012 reconnaissance drilling completed by BHP Billiton Nickel West as part of the previous Project Dragon farm-in arrangement.\n\nAssays will be highly anticipated.\n \nProactive Investors Australia is the market leader in producing news articles and research reports on ASX emerging companies with distribution in Australia UK North America and Hong Kong / China.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T13:23:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
