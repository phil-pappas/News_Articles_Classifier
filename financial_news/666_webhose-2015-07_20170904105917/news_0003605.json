More telling is that many of these business owners could be considerably wealthier if they were better networkers and selectively applied advanced planning strategies.\nWhile celebrities might get the limelight, the real engines of personal wealth creation are privately held companies. About a quarter of business-owning households had annual incomes of $200,000 or more according to the Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances . In contrast, only about six percent of non-business owner households were earning $200,000 a year. At the same time, about ten percent of business-owning households had annual incomes of $500,000 or more compared to less than two percent of non-business owning households.\nWhen it comes to net worth, nearly two out of five business-owning households had a net worth of $1 million or more. Slightly more than ten percent of non-business owner households had a similar net worth.\n“Owning a business in itself is rarely sufficient to become wealthy. The owners have to be motivated to succeed. They also need to have the skills that translate into personal wealth,” explains Carlo Scissura, CEO and President of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and author of Maximizing Personal Wealth: An Advanced Planning Primer for Successful Business Owners . “The ability to skillfully network with other business owners , for example, is often essential in creating opportunities for their businesses and themselves. For many entrepreneurs becoming incrementally more proficient networkers can make them appreciably more successful and wealthier.”\nAnother way for business owners to become more affluent is to legitimately minimize the amount of money they need to hand over to the tax authorities. According to Frank Seneco, President of Seneco & Associates, an advanced planning boutique , “Many small and mid-sized firms fail to take advantage of all the ways available to them to legally lower their tax bills. Considering the number of entrepreneurs, relatively few of them are benefiting from various advanced planning strategies. A simple and all too common example of not taking advantage of what is available is qualified retirement plans. For some small and mid-sized business, defined benefit plans are vastly superior to 401(k) plans especially where it’s possible to direct most of the benefits from these plans to the owners while taking sizable tax deductions. The problem is that few entrepreneurs are shown anything but 401(k) plans and that’s because most advisors don’t know about other types of plans.”\n“For most business owners, advanced planning can prove very effective in helping them increase their wealth as well as protect that wealth from unfounded and frivolous lawsuits,” says Scissura. “The complication is that many advisors to these business owners are not very proficient when it comes to advanced planning.", "external_links": ["http://www.fa-mag.com/book--maximizing-personal-wealth"], "published": "2015-07-07T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:37:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
