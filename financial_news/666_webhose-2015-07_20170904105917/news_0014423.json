This is the largest deal in Israel's corporate history and aims to give Teva greater economies of scale, crucial in the low-margin generic drugs business.\nTeva on Thursday reiterated that it recorded quarterly earnings of $1.43 per diluted share excluding one-off items, up from $1.25 a year earlier and well above analysts' estimates of $1.31 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue in the quarter slipped 2 percent to $4.97 billion but rose 6 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations and the sale of U.S. over-the-counter plants.\nTeva declared a quarterly dividend of 34 cents a share.\nIt raised its 2015 earnings per share estimate to $5.15-$5.40 from $5.00-$5.30 but maintained a revenue forecast of $19.0-$19.4 billion.\nTeva's shares were down 1.8 percent late trading in Tel Aviv on Thursday after hitting an historic closing high of 271.10 shekels ($71.66) on Wednesday. In premarket trading in New York, the stock was down 0.7 percent at $70.37.\n($1 = 3.7830 shekels) (Reporting by Steven Scheer.
