Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! BENGALURU: Private equity firm Saif Partners has appointed Alok Goel, former CEO of FreeCharge and among India's top executives in consumer internet sector, as managing director. Goel will look after early stage investing at the firm which has $4 billion of assets under management. \"I'll be looking at how we do more early stage deals,\" said Goel. Earlier this year, Saif raised $350 million for an India-focused fund to ramp up investments in technology focused businesses, ET reported on March 4. Goel's appointment is the latest in a series of recruitments of senior executives by Indian venture capital firms as they try to bring in deeper domain knowledge into venture investing. \"Beyond a point of time, money becomes a commodity and people with operations background can be helpful as investors look to differentiate,\" said Goel, who has been a top executive at redBus and FreeCharge. The two companies that Goel previously worked with were acquired in deals billed as the largest in the domestic consumer internet business at the time. redBus was acquired for over $100 million by South African media conglomerate Naspers in 2013. FreeCharge was acquired by Snapdeal for an estimated $400 million in cash and stock. \"Having built and scaled up successful internet companies, his experience will be very vital to our firm,\" said Ravi Adusumalli, managing partner at Saif Partners, which is looking to make more early stage deals in the range of Rs 6-10 crore. Goel, 37, will focus on companies that are building solutions in areas such as mobile and software as a service (SaaS). \"Indian talent can play a big role in the global SaaS market,\" said Goel. The PE firm has been investing in Indian companies since 2001, making it one of the earliest in the country. Its portfolio includes ecommerce firm Paytm , which is now valued at over $3.7 billion, online ticket booking site Book-MyShow and JustDial, one of the few venture backed technology companies to go public in India. As competition to invest in Indian startups increases, venture capital firms that were earlier focused on growth stage investments have also started investing at earlier stages. They have also been hiring senior executives with operational experience to lead investments and close deals quickly. Alok Goyal, former chief operating officer of SAP India who was hired by Helion Venture Partners in 2013 said, \"Prior experience helps in understanding the business and the space quickly and allows us to respond quickly to the entrepreneur. Last thing they want is a VC spending a month to learn the industry at their expense and then letting them know that they are not interested.\" Bengaluru-based seed stage investor AngelPrime recently appointed Amit Somani, former chief product officer at MakeMy-Trip as a managing partner.
