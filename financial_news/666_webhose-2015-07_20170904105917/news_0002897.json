Desperate Greeks scour UK for jobs to escape debt crisis By Lauren Davidson | Telegraph – 27 minutes ago Print \nRecent developments in the debt crisis have exacerbated raging unemployment in the stricken country and prompted a rush in online searches for jobs in the UK \nThe number of Greeks looking for jobs in the UK has soared in the last two weeks as the debt crisis comes to a head, placing further pressure on the country's crippling unemployment levels . \nCV-Library, the UK's largest jobs board, said that traffic to its website from Greece reached a record high in July, eclipsing June's searches after only two weeks. \nProjections from the recruitment site show that the number of visitors in July is on track to double last month's traffic, as Greek people grasp at employment opportunities overseas. \nGreece has been in the clutches of a job crisis for years as it struggles to recover from the global financial meltdown. It has the highest unemployment and underemployment rates in Europe at 26.5pc and 72.1pc respectively. \nBut the situation has worsened in recent weeks after the country failed to meet a deadline at the end of June to repay €1.6bn worth of debt to the IMF. \nThe country's leftist Syriza-led government has since imposed capital controls , closing banks and limiting daily withdrawals from ATMs and pension funds. It has accepted even tougher bail-out measures despite the Greek public voting overwhelmingly to reject creditors' demands that more austerity measures be introduced. \n\"It’s alarming but not surprising that interest from Greek workers looking for jobs in the UK is increasing so rapidly,\" said Lee Biggins, managing director of CV-Library. \"There is clearly an interest amongst Greek workers to look for work outside of Greece, in anticipation of what lies ahead.\" \nGreek web traffic to CV-Library over each of the last two weeks has surpassed the year's previous peak in late January. \n\"Historically, job searches start to slow [at the start of] summer, so the fact that these numbers have exceeded the highest number in January, the busiest time of year, shows that this movement is clearly related to the current situation in Greece ,\" Mr Biggins said. \nAlmost half 46.25pc of CV-Library's Greek visitors are between the ages of 25 and 34, according to the website's analytics. Greece's youth unemployment crisis is particularly pronounced, with 52.4pc of those aged 15 to 24 out of work, giving Greece the second-highest youth unemployment rate in Europe, behind Spain. \nCV-Library has 8.9 million registered jobseekers, making it the UK's largest jobs board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T09:29:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
