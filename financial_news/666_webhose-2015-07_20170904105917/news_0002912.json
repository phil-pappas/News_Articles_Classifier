Novartis dropped 2.1 percent after the Swiss drugmaker reported a weak performance by its eyecare division in the second quarter. \nWhile the euro rallied on Tuesday, Novartis saw its results hit by strong dollar last quarter, which traders said could hurt earnings in general as investors anticipate an interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve. \n\"The move in Novartis today is largely down to a strengthening dollar. Some of it was priced in, but it's going to have a continuing effect moving forward,\" said Mark Foulds, sales trader at ETX Capital. \nThe FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.1 percent at 1,596.34 points by the close after rising to a six-week high in the previous session. \nGold prices stabilised on Tuesday just above a five-year low, with precious metal miner Fresnillo up 3.7 percent, the top FTSEurofirst 300 riser. \nThe price of gold had also been hit by a strong dollar. It fell as much as 4 percent on Monday, wiping more than $8 billion off the combined market value of global gold-mining companies. \n\"Much more action has been taking place in precious metals ... should the slump in commodities persist and intensify, many will ask themselves if this is the precursor to another dip in global growth,\" Markus Huber, senior analyst at Peregrine & Black, said. \nThe Greek stock market remained closed, with capital controls still in place. The Greek government submitted legislation to parliament on Tuesday required by its lenders to start talks on a multi-billion euro rescue package. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has until Wednesday night to get those measures adopted in parliament. \nSwedish entertainment broadcasting group MTG rose 5.9 percent, the biggest gainer on the broader STOXX Europe 600 , after it reported a smaller than expected drop in second-quarter core earnings. \nFinnish paper producer Stora Enso (Xetra: ENUR.DE - news ) fell 8.3 percent after it reported weaker-than-expected quarterly profit due to production problems and higher costs. \nEurope bourses in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/pap87v \nAsset performance in 2015: http://link.reuters.com/gap87v \nToday's European research round-up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T19:37:14.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
