A survey by IDC said Windows was expected to capture just 3.2 percent of the global smartphone market this year. \n\"I am committed to our first-party devices including phones. However, we need to focus our phone efforts in the near term while driving reinvention,\" chief executive Satya Nadella said in a memo to staff. \n\"We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem that includes our first-party device family.\" \nMicrosoft had about 118,000 employees worldwide at the end of March, according to its website, with about half in the United States. \nMicrosoft plans to start rolling out Windows 10 in late July, introducing a new operating system which can be used to power not only personal computers but a range of mobile devices. \nWhile it still dominates the market for personal computers, Microsoft has struggled in the market for mobile devices, the majority of which are powered by the Google Android system or Apple (NasdaqGS: AAPL - news ) 's iOS. \nLast month, Microsoft announced a shakeup of top management including the departure of Stephen Elop, the former Nokia chief who came on board with the US giant's acquisition of the Finnish firm's handset unit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T18:11:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
