Earlier reports by Bloomberg, citing Skai TV, said that Greek parliament would vote on these proposals on Friday. \nA Eurogroup meeting is scheduled for Saturday, and on Sunday all 28 European Union members will convene a summit. \nThe Eurogroup is comprised only of the 19 finance ministers from euro-using members of the EU. \nAt this point it's unclear exactly what Greece's new plan entails, and this post will be updated as we find out new details. \nThe reality is, however, that Greece needs some sort of plan to get approved. Reports in recent days have indicated that Greek banks — which have been closed for over a week and will remain closed until Monday — may only have enough cash to last 4 more days. Capital controls have also been in place over the same period limiting the amount of cash that can be taken out of ATMs by Greeks to 60 euros per day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T00:13:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
