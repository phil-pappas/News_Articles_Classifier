The firm, which is seeking a regulatory license, will be chaired by Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family who’s on the emirate’s supreme council and chairman of its Department of Transport.\n“The Middle East is going to play an increasingly important role in the global business landscape going forward,” Doshi said. “There’s a meaningful opportunity for a well-connected firm like ours to provide high-quality advice and make targeted private-equity investments,” he said.\nHe’s not the first to strike out on his own in Dubai as banks from Credit Suisse Group AG to UBS Group AG cut jobs after the financial crisis and Deutsche Bank itself grapples with missed profitability targets and a lagging share performance. Doshi, who says he left Deutsche Bank on good terms, argues the network and experience of those backing the new firm will help differentiate his business from the competition.\n“Doing business in the region is mostly about having the relationships that matter,” he said. “This is a people’s business at the end of the day and our strength is that we have access to some of the top names in the region.”\nNew Board The new board includes two vice chairmen. Saeed Mubarak Al-Hajeri is chairman of Abu Dhabi National Energy, known as Taqa, and has a senior IT role at Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Mubarak Hamad Al Muhairi is former managing director of the Tourism Development and Investment Corporation of Abu Dhabi. Both are also founding members and key investors in the firm, which plans to add more board members soon. Doshi will be a managing partner and sit on the board.\nSenior bankers who’ve also decided to strike out alone include Samer Katerji and Rody Yared, two former investment bankers from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. who started Trussbridge Advisory DIFC Ltd to tap appetite for deals in the U.S. and Canada. Albert Momdjian, who handled UBS Group AG’s wealthiest clients in the Middle East, quit last year to start an investment company in Dubai.\nViswanathan Shankar, the Dubai-based former CEO of Standard Chartered Plc for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Americas, left the London-based bank to set up a $1 billion private-equity firm focused on Africa, Middle East and Asia.\nBusiness Model Aramis will offer corporate advisory services to small and medium-sized enterprises in the Middle East and also seek to make private-equity investments across different sectors. Aramis also plans to offer asset-management services, Doshi said.\nLarge banks operating in the region have largely shunned local small and mid-sized entities, which Doshi says are growingly rapidly, creating a “huge gap for quality advice.”\nThe firm is yet to decide on the structure of its private-equity business, he said, but will do both growth capital and leveraged buyout deals if required.\n“We already have a number of very interesting transactions that we are reviewing, and will be executing some of these as soon as we are licensed and operational,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T17:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T13:23:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
