However, Managing Director Nilesh Gupta said none of the concerns were \"serious\" and the company had responded to the FDA.\nHe separately warned the pace of U.S. drug approvals would remain modest in the September quarter, but would pick up through the rest of the year. The company is expecting \"material\" U.S. approvals of so-called controlled substance products acquired through the GAVIS acquisition, he said.\nThe deal will give Lupin access to dermatology drugs, big-selling controlled substance products that can only be dispensed with a doctor's prescription and other speciality generics, it said. Lupin will also gain a portfolio of 66 generic drugs for which the New Jersey-based drugmaker has sought regulatory approval, with a potential market value of $9 billion, it said.\nLupin's U.S. sales fell 31 percent to $180 million in April-June, leading to a 16 percent drop in its net profit to 5.25 billion rupees ($82.35 million), it said on Thursday.\n\"In general, we see Lupin in a challenging phase, because they don't have any speciality products,\" said Nimish Mehta, founder and director at Research Delta Advisors. \"They really need this acquisition.\"\nSome analysts, however, expressed concern about Lupin paying nine times GAVIS's sales, but Lupin said that was in line with similar deals.\nThe Indian drugmaker expects GAVIS to contribute to earnings in the first full year after purchase, and the deal to close in the December quarter.\nGAVIS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe deal follows three other acquisitions this year by Lupin, aimed at building its presence in Latin America and Russia. It plans to look for more businesses in the speciality generics space in the United States, CEO Gupta said.\nLupin shares closed 5.3 percent lower, compared with a 0.5 percent fall in the broader market.\n($1 = 63.7500 Indian rupees) (Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Mark Potter )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T18:55:38.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
