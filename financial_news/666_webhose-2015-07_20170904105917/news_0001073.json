The Lula Institute is certain of the transparency and legality of ex-president Lula's activities,\" spokesman Jose Chrispiniano said. \nProsecutors announced in May that they were considering the probe. \nAccording to the prosecutor's office, the alleged influence peddling took place between 2011 and 2014, after Lula left office, having been replaced by his hand-picked successor from the Workers' Party, Dilma Rousseff. \nAs an ex-president, Lula retained his status as a major world figure and the face of commodity-rich Brazil's rise to economic power. \nProsecutors allege that he used that clout to land billion-dollar deals for Odebrecht in Latin America and Africa. He is also alleged to have helped persuade the state-owned development bank BNDES to finance the foreign projects. \nBrazil's political and elite business circles have been thrown into commotion by a growing probe into a bribes-and-kickbacks network that saw companies including Odebrecht bribing politically connected executives at state oil giant Petrobras to grant inflated contracts. \nSome of the money allegedly went into the Workers' Party campaign coffers. \nRousseff, chairwoman of Petrobras for seven years, has not been directly implicated in the scandal but there are mounting calls for her resignation or impeachment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T22:56:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
