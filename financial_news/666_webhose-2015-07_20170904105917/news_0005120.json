What happens to the other 50 per cent is important. If that is just brown coal then we're still in trouble,\" he said.\nThe ALP national conference will be held in Melbourne from Friday to Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://us4.campaign-archive1.com/?u=afd7d419b8ad8bf6117ea1def&id=9cf16663fe", "https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://theconversation.com/how-will-the-reduced-renewable-energy-target-affect-investment-41505", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-22T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T03:59:31.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
