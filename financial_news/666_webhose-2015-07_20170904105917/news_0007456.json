(Demand) is not on any consideration of value,\" said Mark Ostwald, strategist at ADM Investor Services. \nCiti, Lloyds Banking Group, RBC (Other OTC: RBCI - news ) and RBS (LSE: RBS.L - news ) acted as joint bookrunners for the sale. \nIn the cash market, the 2068 gilt outperformed other very long-dated gilt maturities. The bond's yield was up around a basis point on the day, compared with around 2 basis points for the benchmark 30-year gilt. \n\"(The 2068 gilt) has just been unwinding some of the concession that was built in (before the sale). I don't think that's a reflection of anything other than that it had a concession in the first place,\" said Ostwald. \nThe benchmark 10-year gilt yield was last up around 2 basis points on the day at 2.09 percent.
