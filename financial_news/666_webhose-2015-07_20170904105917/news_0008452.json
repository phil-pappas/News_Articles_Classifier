Caterpillar's revenues and profits fall on difficult market conditions By Jessica Fino | Sharecast â€“ 53 minutes ago 6.663 -0.005 \n  Construction and mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT - news ) fell on Thursday after reporting a decline in profits and revenues during the second quarter of the year. The group said its profits per share declined to $1.16 from $1.57 in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding restructuring costs, profit per share was $1.27, down from $1.69 same time last year. \nSales and revenues also decreased 13% to $12.3bn due to difficult conditions in several of its key industries. \nThe decline in profits and revenues were due to severe weakness in mining, lower construction-related sales in China and Brazil and a fall in new orders for oil-related applications, the company said. \n\"Our focus during these challenging times is on operational execution and customer success through efforts like Lean Management and our Across the Table initiative with dealers, while also investing in tomorrow through new technologies, innovation and data analytics,\" said chairman and chief executive Doug Oberhelman. \nLooking ahead, Oberhelman said it expects full-year revenues to be about $49bn, $1bn down from previous forecasts, following currency impacts from a strong US dollar which is hurting sales. \nCaterpillar's boss added many of the key industries are believed to remain weak for the rest of the year as the group has not seen any signs of improvement. \nWeak commodity prices, economic weakness in China and Brazil and the uncertainty in the Eurozone are also hurting confidence. \n\"We are committed to controlling costs as we manage through this downturn, and that will position Caterpillar for better results when conditions improve,\" he added. \nThe company also announced it plans to repurchase $1.5bn of its common stock during the third quarter in a bid to return capital to stockholders. It also raised its dividend 10% in June. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in Caterpillar were down 2.81% to 79.74 cents on Thursday before opening bell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T18:32:46.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
