We don't want to be slaves,\" Niki Kalomiri, one of many residents who voted no, said.\nThe Greeks in essence have called the bluff of E.U. leaders, who warned that a no vote would mean they'd be bounced out of the European Union.\nThe referendum may have given Greece a stronger hand to negotiate more favorable terms or it could mean its departure from the E.U. -- a move many say will bring about the collapse of its banking system and a return to its national currency, the drachma.\nFrench President Francoise Holland said he will bend over backwards to keep Greece in. Still, following the referendum the future is unclear.\nGreek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis resigned after Sunday's vote. He told George Stephanopolous on ABC's \"This Week\" the U.S. should watch the results of the referendum carefully.\n\"I think the United States have [sic] a great interest in seeing that the austerity drive that started here in Greece -- end. And see that we have a rational economic policy, not just for the sake of Europe, but for the sake of the global economy,\" Varoufakis said.\nE.U. leaders now may have to backtrack on their threats to throw Greece out of the E.U. or deal with the fallout.\nMartin Schulz, president of the E.U. parliament, warned a no vote meant Greece would be out. But after the no vote, he seemed to change his tune.\n\"It's now up to the Greek government to make proposals which could convince the 18 other member states of the eurozone and the institutions in Brussels that it is necessary, possible and even effective to renegotiate,\" Schulz said.\nAnd talks are underway. Polls show most Greeks want to remain part of the European Union. Still, there's concern that anti-E.U. sentiment could spread amidst the fear and political turmoil.\n\"I would have voted no because we are slaves to Germany,\" Rome resident Federica Aspetti said. \"Enough, we should really follow Greece's example.\"\nThe European Central Bank will decide if the emergency stimulus for Greece can be extended.\nIf it doesn't get an emergency injection of cash, the country will run out of cash in the coming days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T15:58:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
