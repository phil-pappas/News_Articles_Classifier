Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Elise Shaw Bell Potter has a \"buy\" recommendation on Dacian Gold, with a risk rating of \"speculative\" and a raised price target of 59¢. \"DCN has released an increased mineral resource for the Jupiter prospect at their 100 per cent owned Mt Morgans gold project near Laverton in Western Australia. The Jupiter prospect now consolidates the Jupiter, Heffernan's and Doublejay Resources. We continue to expect more resource additions, with an infill and extension drilling program currently underway at Westralia likely to deliver an increased resource there, in our view. We anticipate this being a material positive catalyst. Furthermore, we note that over 75 per cent of the resource at Jupiter is within 200m of surface for an endowment of over 4300 ounces per vertical metre. We maintain our 'buy' (speculative) recommendation for DCN based on a blended NPV/Resource ounce valuation (75:25) for a target price of $0.59 a share. Our target price increases 3.5 per cent from $0.57 a share as a result of incorporating the updated resource into our valuation. In our view, DCN remains very good value relative to peers, has excellent prospects for further resource growth across multiple deposits and a management team with a proven track record of value creation at similar assets.\"\nRBC Capital Markets has an \"outperform\" recommendation on copper and gold miner Sandfire Resources and raised its price target to $6.20 from $5.90 previously. \"Another consistent quarter of production and costs result at DeGrussa, however, higher than anticipated development capex for both FY16 and FY17 will frustrate some investors since previous forecasts indicated 2015 as the peak for development, which has now been pushed out to 2016, negatively impacting free cash flows. We remain optimistic that ongoing drilling could yield further strong copper and gold results within this newly found discovery (Springfield project). We expect the market to continue to trade strongly around news for this drilling and believe further positive results are potentially still to come, creating positive catalysts for the share price in the near term.\" Hartleys has a \"buy\" on Sandfire with a 12-month price target at $7.64.\nDeutsche Bank has a \"hold\" on Senex Energy and a target price of 25¢. \"Senex reported JunQ15 production of 0.32mmboe, in line with our forecasts (0.32mmboe). Production decreased 3 per cent from MarQ15, primarily on natural field decline across its Cooper oil fields. This brings FY15 production to 1.39mmboe, within guidance of 1.36-1.41mmboe. JunQ15 revenue of $23.6m (DB $22.3m) was 6 per cent ahead of our forecasts on a higher realised oil price. Senex's cash balance decreased by $14 million during the quarter to $49 million, which Senex partly attributed to working capital movements. With $20 million in cash received from QGC in DecH15 to fund CSG plugging and abandonment obligations which are yet to begin, this suggests net cash available to Senex of $29 million (pre-debt drawdown).\"\nDeutsche Bank retains a \"hold\" on Bendigo and Adelaide Bank with a price target of $13.35. \"We have updated our BEN earnings forecasts to reflect faster than expected house price growth in the six months to June 30 but slower loan growth. 2H15 upgrades reflect our expectation of record Homesafe property revaluation income. However, our FY16 and FY17 forecasts have fallen, driven by below-system housing growth and poor business lending growth. Advanced accreditation offers some upside to EPS longer term; however, in the meantime we think BEN's underlying growth trends will remain weak.\"\nBroker Watch: Iluka Resources, Saracen Minerals, Northern Star, Corporate Travel Broker Watch: Navitas, OrotonGroup, Elysium Resources, insurance Broker Watch: Evolution Mining, Steadfast Group, Sims Metal, Energy Developments Broker Watch: Austbrokers, Fortescue Metals Group, Carnavale Resources, Valence Industries Broker Watch: Macquarie Group, BHP Billiton, South32, resources sector Broker Watch: Western Areas, Oil Search, Telstra, Evolution Mining Broker Watch: Saracen Minerals, Austal, Sonic Healthcare, Arrium Broker Watch: Decmil, Paladin Energy, Regis Resources, Universal Coal Broker Watch: Macquarie Group, Beadell Resources, Ramelius, Whitehaven Coal Broker Watch: Primary Health Care, Challenger, Mount Gibson Iron, Perpetual Broker Watch: BHP Billiton, Sedgman, Newcrest Mining, APA Group Broker Watch: Rio Tinto, Horizon Oil, Greencross, SEEK Broker Watch: CSR, Aristocrat Leisure, Northern Star Broker Watch: Iron ore majors, Aurelia Metals, Alcoa, Gryphon Minerals Broker Watch: Gold stocks, insurance sector, Incitec Pivot Broker Watch: Crown Resorts, Aurelia Metals, Orica, Amcor Broker Watch: Asciano, BlueScope Steel, James Hardie, Cue Energy Broker Watch: Energy sector picks, REA, PacBrands, Treasury Wine Broker Watch: James Hardie, Brambles, Recall Holdings, GPT Group Broker Watch: Air New Zealand, Scentre, Aurizon, Transurban Group Broker Watch: Wesfarmers, Myer, Sandfire Resources, Sydney Airport Broker Watch: Brambles, Arrium, Tabcorp, Monadelphous Group Broker Watch: Origin Energy, Flight Centre, iSelect, Dexus Property Group Broker Watch: Fletcher Building, IAG, BT Investment Management, CSR Broker Watch: Woolworths, CSL Ltd, Metcash, Scentre Group Broker Watch: Sydney Airport, Resmed, Challenger Financial, Arrium Broker Watch: TFS Corporation, Western Areas, NAB, Spark Infrastructure Group Broker Watch: Primary Health Care, Metcash, Ten Network, Sonic Healthcare Broker Watch: Cover-More, SCA Property Group, Telstra, Boral Broker Watch: Federation Centres, Rio Tinto, CBA, Alexium International Broker Watch: Goodman Group, QBE, Adelaide Brighton, Seven Group Holdings Broker Watch: Eclipx, Independence, Alumina, ANZ Banking Broker Watch: ERA, Mirvac, Qube, DUET Broker Watch: QBE, Goodman, Seven, TPG Broker Watch: Greencross, Qantas, South32, Woolworths Broker Watch: Mesoblast, APA Group, Recall, Iluka Broker Watch: AGL, AWE, Qube, Nine Broker Watch: Metcash, Fleetwood, Otto Energy, McPherson's Broker Watch: BHP, Newcrest, Yowie, REA Broker Watch: Virtus Health, CSL, Spotless, Crown Broker Watch: Slater & Gordon, UGL, Flight Centre, Sirtex Broker Watch: Ardent, BWP Trust, Domino's, DUET Broker Watch: AGL, ALS, Ramsay, DuluxGroup Broker Watch: Woodside, Adelaide Brighton, Programmed, Brambles Broker Watch: BHP Billiton, WorleyParsons, Telstra, St Barbara Broker Watch: Ramsay Health Care, WOW, Dulux, Spark ​ ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/104280172644175237870", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/Washseile"], "published": "2015-07-31T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T00:09:47.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
