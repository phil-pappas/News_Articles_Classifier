Japan also has floating offshore wind projects. \n\"In Europe, the French offshore tender would be the first of this size,\" Monnier told Reuters. \nFEE is not sure what level of feed-in tariff subsidies the government will offer for floating offshore, but FEE president Frederic Lanoe said this would logically be more than the approximately 200 euros per MW for fixed-foundation offshore. \nThe projects will also received a combined 150 million euro investment subsidy. \nFour areas on French shores have already been identified for offshore wind development, including Leucate, Brescou and Fos-sur-Mer on the Riviera, which has year-round strong winds and where the Mediterranean sea floor slopes steeply. A fourth area is around the island of Ile de Groix, off southern Brittany. \n\"We expect the tender in coming days,\" Lanoe said, adding that FEE had had discussion with the government about the issue. \nThe French energy and environment ministry was not immediately available for comment. The government has talked about a possible launch in June. \nThe tender is expected to test several offshore wind technologies, possibly including turbines with a vertical rotor axis, as opposed to the horizontal axis common in most machines. \nFrench firm Nenuphar - in partnership with EDF Energies Nouvelles, nuclear group Areva (Paris: FR0011027143 - news ) and oil industry engineering group Technip (Swiss: TEC.SW - news ) - is developing a 2 MW vertical-axis turbine. \nAnother French firm, Ideol, has developed a floating platform for offshore wind turbines which it says is competitive with bottom-fixed turbine foundations at depths from 35 meters. \nIn Portugal, utility EDP Renewables has run its prototype WindFloat turbine on a three-legged floating platform for several years. \nIn Norway, oil group Statoil (Xetra: 675213 - news ) has pioneered a turbine mounted on a ballasted vertical steel cylinder that floats upright. It has plans to float several of the turbines in in Scotland. u (Reporting by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Andrew Callus)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T14:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T16:38:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
