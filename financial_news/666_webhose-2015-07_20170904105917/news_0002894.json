The new level is the highest since last October.\n\nThis photo taken June 4, 2015, shows a sold sign at a new home development in Nashville, Tenn.

That matched its high for the year set last month.\nInvestors recently had been seeking safety in U.S. Treasury bonds amid economic tumult in China and Greece. Greece's agreement this week with its European partners on a rescue package has calmed investors and brought some retreat from Treasurys, pushing interest rates higher.\nThe Greek Parliament approved early Thursday a pension overhaul, tax increases and other measures demanded by bailout lenders.\nBond yields for Treasurys have been pushed higher by the decline in bond prices. The yield on the key 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.36 per cent Wednesday from 2.20 per cent a week earlier. Mortgage rates often follow the yield on the 10-year note. It traded at 2.39 per cent Thursday morning.\nTo calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country at the beginning of each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 per cent of the loan amount.\nThe average fee for a 30-year mortgage was unchanged from last week at 0.6 point. The fee for a 15-year loan rose to 0.6 point from 0.5 point.\nThe average rate on five-year adjustable-rate mortgages increased to 2.96 per cent from 2.93 per cent; the fee rose to 0.5 point from 0.4 point. The average rate on one-year ARMs was unchanged at 2.50 per cent; the fee remained at 0.3 point.\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T00:26:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
