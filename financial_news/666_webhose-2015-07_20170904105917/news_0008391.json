Peter Braig PBR Share on twitter by Joanna Mather The family that owns beef exporter Teys Australia is worried it will be targeted by criminals on the basis of \"perceived wealth\" if details of its tax affairs are made public.\nTeys has urged federal parliament to block plans to publish the taxable income and tax paid by privately held Australian companies .\nIt cites concerns about privacy, the personal security of family members and the release of commercially sensitive information.\nFamily members could become the \"subject of serious criminal activity as a result of disclosed personal information being used to target individuals on the basis of perceived wealth\".\nThe Australian Taxation Office is preparing to publish details of taxable income and tax paid by 2300 companies with annual turnovers of $100 million in accordance with a law brought in by the previous Labor government.\nThe ATO report is due out in November or December. The Tax Office has always had access to the information involved; it is just that the details will be made public.\nThe Abbott government has put forward draft legislation to exempt around 1000 private Australian companies from the disclosure measure.\nBut the exemption has to get through the Senate and it is unclear whether the government will manage to halt the report process.\n The government may have of four of the six cross-bench senators it needs to get legislation passed.\nBob Day, David Leyonhjelm, Dio Wang and John Madigan have indicated they will support the government's exemption.\nIn a submission on the draft exemption legislation, Teys Australia says confidentiality is a central feature of the tax system and \"mandated disclosure of privately held company taxation information is totally inconsistent with this principle\".\nFear law won't pass Of the 17 submissions received by Treasury, five are confidential.\nTreasury has allowed the publication of a submission by a fictitious company calling itself \"Private Co\" to protect the identity of whoever wrote it.\nPrivate Co was created at some point in the 1900s, is involved in \"secondary industries both locally and internationally\" and employs 700 people.\nThe submission says \"special interest groups\" without a good understanding of how income tax could misconstrue the information published.\nThe laws require publication of the name and ABN of a company, total income, taxable income and income tax payable.\n\"We are also concerned that hte information to be disclosed would only provide a snapshot of hte position of Private Co,\" it says.\n\"The disclosure may mislead and be misinterpreted by the public and this may result in reputational damage.\n\"For example, our taxable income as a percentage of turnover is affected by factors such as depreciation and capital allowances of significant capital investment undertaken by Private Co, as well as competitive pressures on our markets.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JoannaMather"], "published": "2015-07-23T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:03:20.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
