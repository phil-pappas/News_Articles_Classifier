Anthony Johnson by Ruth Liew The news that Peter Harmer would become Insurance Australia Group’s new chief digital officer surprised many insurance industry observers.\nHarmer, one of Australia’s most senior insurance executives, left his role as chief executive of the $12.5 billion company’s commercial arm and went from leading a business with 4500 staff to one with four direct reports and a new mandate: to lead IAG’s digital strategy.\nInnovation is the job Before he joined IAG, Harmer was CEO of Aon UK. Now, innovation – including finding non-traditional insurance partners and winning new business in this rapidly evolving market – is part of his job description.\n“In this environment, we need to have much more contemporary approaches to how we make investments,” Harmer says in his first interview since taking on the role in March.\nHarmer, who was instrumental in improving the insurer’s previously underperforming commercial arm, has been travelling to Silicon Valley to meet with boundary-pushing fintech and digital firms and with the aim of importing some of their innovation into IAG.\nHe is most interested in tech advancements originating from Tel Aviv and Shanghai and has spent time with Peter Weill, the Australian computer scientist and professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, to find out about opportunities.\nTech talent scout Combing for tech partners that complement the business is also part of Harmer’s mandate. IAG, the owner of brands CGU and NRMA, has an exclusive arrangement with LinkedIn whereby the insurer can use the networking site’s search capabilities to find sales opportunities for its brokers. “We’re trying to give them a warm lead, rather than let them go doorknocking,” he says.\nThe group also has a partnership with Xero, the world’s fastest-growing accounting software company. “We’re working with them on how we might embed SME [small and medium enterprise] insurance into their accounting package,” Harmer says.\nFour pillars IAG’s digital strategy will be built on four tech-driven pillars. The first three involve seeking ways to optimise IAG’s current systems as more competition arrives in the insurance sector. This includes asking where IAG needs to be a strong digital player, encouraging its workforce to embrace change, and building or simplifying current business platforms.\nThe fourth requires pure digital innovation. “It’s about how do we innovate the businesses of tomorrow, and that’s where we have some commercially sensitive things going on.”\nLike Boss on Facebook .
