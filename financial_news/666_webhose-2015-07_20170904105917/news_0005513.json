That tends to dent demand and, in turn, pull prices lower. \nPrices were hit Friday by news that China's official gold reserves rose almost 60 percent over the past six years, according to the first official data on the subject since 2009. \nThe central People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988.HK - news ) (PBoC) said bullion holdings rose 57 percent to 1,658 tonnes as of the end of June, from 1,054 tonnes in April 2009, the last time a figure was released. \n\"Markets have commenced the week with an unexpected start following a spectacular drop in gold during the Asian session that sent the yellow metal to a new milestone five-year low,\" added analyst Jameel Ahmad at traders FXTM on Monday. \n\"Gold dropping so sharply is a surprise and while the reports that China gold reserves were half the expected level might have inspired additional selling pressure, it is the repeated comments of commitment from the Federal Reserve that they will begin raising US interest rates at some point this year that have continuously pressured gold in recent months.\" \nOther precious metals also forged multi-year lows on Monday. \nSilver (Shenzhen: 300221.SZ - news ) dived to $14.54 per ounce, the lowest level in nearly six years. \nPlatinum sank to a six-year trough at $946.25 an ounce, while sister metal palladium slid to $603.95 per ounce -- last witnessed on November 11, 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-20T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-20T14:23:04.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
