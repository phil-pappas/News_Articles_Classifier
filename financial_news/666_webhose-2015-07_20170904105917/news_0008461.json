The Financial Times itself had reported that its parent company was in advanced talks to sell the newspaper group to Axel Springer, Germany’s biggest newspaper company. The Financial Times Group is made up of the newspaper, a number of related titles and a 50% stake in the Economist Group, publisher of the Economist magazine. The Economist stake is not included in the transaction, nor is the FT’s headquarters at Southwark Bridge in London. \nMeanwhile, a new Pearson chief financial officer is slated to take the helm on Aug. 1. Coram Williams is currently CFO at the publishing joint venture Penguin Random House. Williams, who is not a chartered accountant, began his professional career at Autocar, a British motoring magazine, as a reporter and road tester. He then joined Arthur Andersen, the global public accounting firm that collapsed as the result of the bankruptcy of Enron, one of its clients. Williams joined Pearson in 2005 before moving to Penguin, then a wholly owned subsidiary. Williams is replacing Robin Freestone , who has been Pearson’s CFO for eight years. Freestone worked as a chartered accountant with Touche Ross (acquired in 1989 by the firm that became Deloitte) before joining Pearson in 2004. \nThe European Commission, the bloc’s top antitrust authority, has filed formal charges against Disney DIS, -0.44% Comcast CMCSA, -2.86% unit NBCUniversal, Paramount Pictures VIA, -0.77% , Sony Pictures SNE, +2.77% Entertainment Inc., Twentieth Century Fox FOXA, -1.76% and Warner Bros. Entertainment TWX, -1.21% and U.K. pay-TV broadcaster Sky UK Ltd., according a Wall Street Journal report on Thursday. The regulator said contracts between Sky and the six studios may have prevented Sky from offering its U.K. and Irish pay-TV services to consumers elsewhere in the EU. The charges are part of a broader initiative by the EU to eliminate so-called geoblocking, where firms block access to films or other online content outside a particular licensed territory. \nMeanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice closed its investigation into AT&T’s T, -0.98% proposed $48 billion acquisition of satellite-based programming provider DirecTV DTV, -0.53% , paving the way for FCC approval. “After an extensive investigation, we concluded that the combination of AT&T’s land-based internet and video business with DirecTV’s satellite-based video business does not pose a significant risk to competition,” said Bill Baer, assistant attorney general in the DOJ’s antitrust division. The transaction, as MarketWatch has reported , will make AT&T the largest U.S. pay-television provider in addition to the second biggest wireless carrier. \nBank of America Corp. BAC, -1.65% announced that its chief financial officer, Bruce Thompson, will leave the bank, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Regulators admonished the bank’s leadership in recent months for sending substandard “stress test” submissions, a new Dodd-Frank requirement. Thompson was one of the senior executives who oversaw the bank’s response to the Fed’s requirements. The Journal reports that CEO Brian Moynihan asked Thompson to stand up at last year’s shareholder meeting and answer questions from investors about the stress-test difficulties. Bank of America has had trouble with the tests three times in the past five years, most recently in March when the bank only received conditional approval from the Fed. Banks generally must pass the Fed stress tests or be precluded from paying or increasing dividends or buying back shares. A successor to Thompson has not been named. \nThe New York Department of Financial Services, the state’s top banking regulator, has asked an instant-messaging software company to explain more about plans for deletion and encryption of data, according to the Wall Street Journal . The company, Symphony Communication Services LLC, has received funding from banks regulated by NYDFS — Bank of New York Mellon BK, -0.64% , Credit Suisse CS, +5.63% Deutsche Bank DB, +1.14% and Goldman Sachs GS, -1.07% Many of the same banks and others have been investigated or charged in alleged interest-rate- and currency-rate-fixing scandals that made extensive use of instant messaging to collude in the manipulation of key rate benchmarks. In a letter sent to the company Wednesday, NYDFS asked Symphony for details about data retention and deletion, encryption services and open-source features. Symphony had supposedly touted “guaranteed data deletion” and “100%” secrecy of data via encryption in promotional materials. Such technology could frustrate investigations by regulators and internal compliance monitoring.
