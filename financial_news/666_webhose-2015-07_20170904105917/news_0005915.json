That's because they are paying about a dollar less a gallon for jet fuel this summer - savings that totalled nearly $US1 billion ($A1.36 billion) for United compared with last northern summer. \nSouthwest Airlines Co earned a record $US608 million ($A826.65 million) in the second quarter - a 31 per cent increase from a year ago, and the airline's ninth straight record-profit quarter. United Continental Holdings Inc posted a record $US1.2 billion profit. \nBoth airlines announced they were passing some of the gains to investors by buying back some of their own stock, which makes the remaining shares more valuable. United announced a $US3 billion buyback plan, while Southwest said it would spend up to $US500 million. \nBoth carriers also reported that passengers are seeing slightly lower fares. \nGovernment figures indicate that US airfares have risen faster than inflation for five straight years, but that string might end in 2015. \nSouthwest said its average one-way fare for the first part of the northern summer was down 3.0 per cent from last summer, a savings of more than $US5. Partly that's because of Dallas, where a change in federal law has led to a boom in new flights and ignited a fare war. \nUnited didn't report its average fare, but it noted that revenue for every seat flown one mile - a proxy for ticket prices - dropped 5.6 per cent. United executives blamed weakness in Houston, an energy centre that has been hurt by lower oil prices, and in Chicago and Dallas. \nAirfares were rising when airlines held the supply of flights and seats nearly unchanged despite a steadily growing economy. In June, the Justice Department began investigating whether United, Southwest, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines worked together to limit seats, a potential violation of antitrust laws. The airlines deny wrongdoing. \nSouthwest is growing now. It expects to increase passenger-carrying capacity about 7.0 per cent this year and five to six per cent next year. \n\"We have not grown Southwest Airlines in three or four years,\" but now \"we have opportunities to grow like we haven't had in years,\" CEO Gary Kelly said, citing Dallas and Houston. \n\"We absolutely will grow this airline.\" \nThat growth worries investors because it could further erode prices. United expects revenue per seat mile to decline between five and seven per cent in the third quarter; Delta predicted a drop of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent, while Southwest is less bearish, predicting a one per cent decline. \nAnalysts like Jim Corridore of S&P Capital IQ said they expect airlines will cut flights to shore up prices. \nDallas-based Southwest reported that a second-quarter profit, excluding one-time items like bonuses for employees who ratified union contracts, that slightly beat a forecast from analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose just two per cent to $US5.11 billion, but Southwest saved $US420 million or 29 per cent on jet fuel. \nUnited's revenue fell four per cent to $US9.91 billion and was less than analysts predicted. Still, thanks to those fuel savings the Chicago-based company reported a 51 per cent increase in profit that beat expectations. \nAlaska Air Group Inc, the parent of Alaska Airlines, reported net income rose 42 per cent to $US234 million. Excluding one-time amounts, the adjusted profit of $US230 million was a record for the Seattle-based company. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Hamish McLennan steps down from Ten AAP \nHamish McLennan has stepped down as chief executive and executive chairman of Ten Network after less than two-and-a-half …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-27T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T04:15:01.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
