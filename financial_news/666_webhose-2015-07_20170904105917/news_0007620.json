Rob Homer Share on twitter by Vesna Poljak A deep ending rout in iron ore prices just as record volumes are being loaded onto ships poses a troubling sign for the resources sector after commodity prices recorded a torrid start to the new financial year.\nFund managers say the one advantage Australian miners have right now is that the large resources stocks have been caught up in the chase for yield and their dividends are protecting share prices from the downturn in commodity valuations.\nIron ore fell for a ninth-straight day based on the price of ore delivered to Qingdao, China . After a 5.4 per cent drop on Monday to $US52.28 a tonne it posted further losses in trading on Tuesday. Oil rebounded after a 7.7 per cent fall on Monday; it rose back to $US53.06 a barrel.\nAnd yet BHP Billiton was up 24¢ to $26.25 and Rio Tinto was up 58¢ to $51.74 . Fortescue Metals Group added 7¢ to $1.79. The S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.9 per cent to close at 5581.4 points, sealing a strong session.\n\"The most troubling issue for Australia has been the demise of the iron ore price,\" said Chris Baker, a portfolio manager at Lithos Resources, part of the Caledonia group.\n\"Now we've seen the current month looking quite strong in terms of volumes coming out of Australia … there's a degree of anticipation around Roy Hill,\" he added.\n\"It's tonnes that the market really doesn't want and more worrying is [Brazil's] Vale, they're steadily getting their act together. This is the real threat for Australian iron ore.\"\nPort Hedland shipped record volumes of iron ore during June, according to Goldman Sachs, moving 38.3mt, which is up 14 per cent year-on-year.\n Goldman Sachs equity strategist Matthew Ross, who has an underweight view on the sector, said consensus forecasts for miners risk being too optimistic. \"We don't think there is going to be as quick and as marked an uptick as consensus does,\" he said.\n\"Cost out will work to lower the cost curve for commodity prices,\" referring to savings measures that make it cheaper to produce. \"While the consensus view is that this will support margins, we see it as more likely to put ongoing downward pressure on commodity prices.\n\"It's hard to argue that they have any pricing power when we can sit here and say commodity prices have fallen 40 or 50 per cent. It seems pretty obvious there isn't any pricing power there.\"\nMeanwhile, the most important consumer of iron ore, China, is a source of growing concern. Chinese authorities are stumbling in their attempt to assert control over the equity market , which is in bear territory after a spectacular run up in prices. On the weekend, several measures were enacted including institutional buying to try and support stock prices and around 700 listed companies have been suspended from trading to halt price declines.\nChina's policy settings are still reasonably supportive of long-term demand for iron ore, but as Mr Ross says, \"nowhere near as favourable as the post-GFC period\".\nYet valuations for mining stocks are stretched. At 16.5 times forecast earnings for the sector on current prices – down from 19 times before the latest sell-off – the mainstream view remains that a rebound in earnings is on the way.\nDeltec cemented its bearish view of commodities on Monday with the addition of a short position on mining. Chief investment officer Atul Lele said that in the Australian market, the high price-to-earnings (PE) ratios were equally a reflection of depressed earnings as they were of investor optimism.\n\"We think the market is missing two things,\" Mr Lele said.\n\"The earnings have further downside, which will leave the PE ratios even higher in a few months time, absent of any share price declines.\n\"The sector will trade off commodity prices. It is a momentum sector, so valuations don't really matter. To put it simply – if commodity prices are going down, it doesn't matter what the valuations are – share prices won't be heading up.\"\nMr Lele's negative view of commodities was informed by weak growth in emerging markets, including China, slowing US dollar liquidity growth and the rising greenback.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens in his July monetary policy update on Tuesday, repeated the same line on commodity prices as last month , declining to betray any concerns. \"The global economy is expanding at a moderate pace but some key commodity prices are much lower than a year ago,\" the statement read. \"This trend appears largely to reflect increased supply, including from Australia. Australia's terms of trade are falling nonetheless.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/@Tim_ber_wolf"], "published": "2015-07-07T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T18:11:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
