Can you blame him? Peter Stoop Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Will Glasgow It has become as much a fixture of rugby league as the State of Origin or some player from the Canberra Raiders taking a racy photo with a dog. We speak of speculation that NRL boss Dave Smith will soon leave the code.\nIt's well known that the NRL head of football Todd Greenberg would like the job if he gets the nod over former South Sydney chief executive Shane Richardson .\nCould you blame Smith if he did leave?\nBefore being responsible for Australia's most infamous code , he was at Deutsche Bank, UBS and finally the chief executive of Lloyds International. We gather Smith took a major pay cut when he left finance for tattooed beefcakes in late 2012 .\nCartoon: Rod Clement Not to say he's a pauper. We understand he's still on a couple of times – plus some – the $500,000 plus on offer for the media and strategy gig that we mentioned the other week and which the NRL's still trying to fill.\nNow in his third season running the code, all the talk is that the former Rugby Union player wants out on the other side of the NRL's $2 billion (or just about) broadcasting deal .\nThat's the deal Smith brought forward – and the same one that has existential significance for David Gyngell 's Nine Entertainment Co in a tussle with Tim Worner 's Seven, Hamish McLennan 's Ten and, we better not forget, Patrick Delany 's Fox Sports.\nIt's said that Smith is hanging around for a few hundred thousand dollars' worth of bonus that would follow the deal. Which has a certain logic.\n But don't discount that Smith wants more proof that the code is in better shape than when he arrived. Something to add to changing the executive team, pulling the clubs into line – or trying to – and cosying up to touch football.\nThen he'll get back to the big bucks, and out of the intense media scrutiny that comes with the code. He's apparently been stunned by its ferocity.\nWe can believe it.\nSome of the bosses of Australia's investment banks just don't seem to appreciate how rarefied is the world they occupy – nor just how rare it is that they deal with the media on anything but their own terms.\nHave a chat to Smith if you don't believe us.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/south-sydney-rabbitohs/shane-richardson-stands-down-as-south-sydney-ceo-20150120-12uqgp.html", "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/lloyds-boss-appointed-ceo-of-nrl-20121122-29x5s#ixzz2Mi0TOpZu", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/1/113771037534783751083/posts", "https://twitter.com/http://twitter.com/wmdglasgow", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/nrl-head-of-football-todd-greenberg-confident-his-position-is-safe/story-fnp0lyn3-1227193719137"], "published": "2015-07-26T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-27T00:04:32.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
