Fiona Morris Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Mercedes Ruehl What's a lazy $2.45 billion compared with the more than $5 billion the fourth largest sovereign wealth fund has already invested in global real estate this year?\nThe Australian Financial Review first reported on Monday night that the one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, China Investment Corporation International, had won the Investa Property Group portfolio of office towers with a bid just shy of $2.5 billion . It is the biggest direct real estate transaction in Australia to date.\nBut CIC, which was set up in 2007 to manage China's foreign exchange reserves, has been making headlines all year for its property prowess.\nOnly a couple of weeks ago CIC made its largest European real estate acquisition to date. It paid CBRE Global Investors an eye-popping €1.3 billion ($1.98 billion) for a portfolio of 10 French and Belgian shopping malls. That price exceeded the vendor's asking price of about $1.2 billion.\nIn January the wealth fund acquired a London office park, Chiswick Park, from private equity giant The Blackstone Group for £800 ($1.7 billion). In February it teamed up with US-based LaSalle Investment Management to buy the Meguro Gajoen commercial complex in Tokyo for ¥140 billion ($1.56 billion.)\nCoincidently, CIC is also a big investor with Morgan Stanley, which sold the Investa portfolio. It is one of the key backers of MSREFVIII, the latest fund run by Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing, the property arm of the US bank.\nThese are just the investments that have been publicly confirmed this year. Real estate only makes up a small part of the more than $US220 billion fund, which has more than $US650 million in assets under management. Early on, it focused on stakes in financial institutions such as Blackstone and Morgan Stanley but after suffering losses in the wake of the financial crisis, CIC started to focus on mining, energy and other commodities. The firm is also targeting infrastructure in emerging countries. It has flagged plans to build new container ports in Kenya and Tanzania in Africa.\nDing Xuedong, chairman of CIC, said in an interview in March that it was stepping up direct investment in long-term global assets. That doesn't mean just real estate. The chairman said in an opinion piece last year that CIC was planning to invest more in agriculture and food supplies.\n No stranger to Australia CIC is no stranger to Australia either, even if the Investa portfolio is its biggest direct real estate acquisition to date. In 2009 it stepped in at the bottom of the market to support troubled industrial business Goodman Group. It's done very well out of that investment, with its 10 per cent stake in Goodman now worth $1.13 billion. That is even after mandating Goldman Sachs to offload a $519 million stake a couple of years ago.\nIts first direct property purchase in Australia was its $305 million acquisition of Centennial Plaza in late 2013 from none other than Investa, who co-owned it with Australian Unity Office Property Fund.\nStill, CIC has a patchy record in terms of offshore investments. Last year losses incurred on its overseas holdings were blamed on mismanagement and dereliction of duty.\nOther past investments include stakes in London's Heathrow Airport.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/114522070827507984683/posts", "https://twitter.com/mjruehl"], "published": "2015-07-28T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T05:05:11.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
