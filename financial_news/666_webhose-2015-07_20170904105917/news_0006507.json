It signed a definitive agreement to buy real estate business services portal DotLoop, both companies revealed in separate press releases Wednesday. \nThe price and terms of the purchase were not disclosed. \nIn its press release announcing the deal, Zillow described DotLoop as a enterprise that \"simplifies real estate transactions by enabling brokerages, real estate agents, and their clients to share, edit, sign and store documents digitally.\" \nDotLoop, based in Cincinnati with an office in San Francisco, opened for business in 2009. According to Zillow, roughly 500,000 people sign real estate documents in DotLoop's system every month. \nThe company currently employs 124 people. Its founder, Austin Allison, will continue to serve as general manager, reporting to Zillow management. \nDotLoop said that with the sale to Zillow, it \"will benefit from being a part of a larger company with greater resources to invest in product innovation and customer experience.\" The company stressed that having a new owner will not affect its arrangements with clients. \nZillow touted the synergistic effects of the acquisition. It quoted its CEO Spencer Rascoff as saying that it will \"[result] in a smoother and more efficient transaction process for everyone.\" \nSo far, 2015 has been a very up-and-down year for Zillow. The Trulia buy was a triumph, but the departure of CFO Chad Cohen earlier this month was a loss. \nSpeaking of losses, the company has been well in the red lately, posting a nearly $60 million shortfall in its most recently reported quarter. So, it's no surprise that the stock price has shed over 50% from its year-to-date peak. \nInvestors shouldn't get discouraged, though. This is an extremely ambitious young company on the go, and as such, it's spending plenty to stay on top of its market. \nYes, DotLoop will drain resources to acquire, but it's a very complimentary business that will almost surely make its would-be owner more competitive. This is a smart and sensible move on Zillow's part. \nThis $19 trillion industry could destroy the Internet One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed -- and if you act soon, it could make you rich.
