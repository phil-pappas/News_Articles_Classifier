Sam Bennett Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Sally Patten Financial planners are required to act in the best interest of their clients thanks to a raft of changes to financial advice laws.\nAnyone in the business of recommending savers to establish do-it-yourself schemes, of which there are more than 500,000 already, was given a wake-up call on Thursday by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\nASIC outlined details of exactly what that best interest pledge entails when it comes to costs and risks.\nHere are the ten rules your adviser must follow:\n1. Ideally self-managed funds should have more than $200,000. ASIC will take a dim view on funds with less than that, where the costs and risks of doing so are not properly explained.\n2. Costs of establishment, operating and winding up must be properly laid out. The regulator will \"look more closely\" at any recommendations that don't do so.\n3. Advisers should re-assess on an ongoing basis whether the fund continues to be suitable for a client.\n4. Investors must be warned they have no access to statutory compensation in the event of theft or fraud.\n 5. Clients will not be able to gain access to certain dispute resolution mechanisms.\n6. Advisers must consider carefully the appropriate governance structure of a fund.\n7. The time, skills and obligations associated with running a self-managed superannuation fund must be explained.\n8. Advisers must ensure clients have an appropriate investment strategy.\n9. Self-managed super fund clients must be made aware of the mechanism and costs of winding up their SMSF.\n10. Any advice to switch to an SMSF must clearly set out considerations, in addition to the costs, relevant to setting up, operating and winding up a self-managed fund.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/106598404524016074873/about", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/sallympatten"], "published": "2015-07-23T14:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T16:39:30.111+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
