The impact on monetary policy should be neutral, “not tightening or loosening,” he said.\nTechnical studies will seek to “find out what is the single, short-term interest rate that would allow us to maintain the same monetary policy stance we have now,” Basci said. The current rates framework, which uses three separate interest rates ranging from 7.25 percent to 10.75 percent, was introduced to allow the central bank greater flexibility to respond to economic uncertainty, Basci said.\nA change to that framework would come before a likely interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Basci said. The Fed is seeking to gradually normalize monetary policy after keeping rates near zero for five years. Turkey has “no need to fear” a U.S. rate increase, which could come in September, Basci said.\nThe lira pared losses of as much as 0.7 percent on Thursday to trade little changed at 2.7670 against the dollar. The currency had weakened earlier in the day to 2.7855 per dollar, a record low on a closing basis.\nBasci’s remarks were “lira positive since these signal a return to orthodox policies,” Isik Okte, a strategist at TEB Invest in Istanbul, said by e-mail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T13:14:22.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
