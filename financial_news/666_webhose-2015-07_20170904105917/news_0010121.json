Doing their “national service” by purchasing shares to support the market may hit brokers’ earnings and balance sheets, Cui said in a note Monday.\nInterference by policy makers may put the industry’s business model into question even as it lends short-term support to brokers’ shares in the mainland, China International Capital Corp. said.\nChinese brokerage Guolian Securities Co. plummeted 37 percent in morning trading in the worst major Hong Kong debut this year. Citic Securities Co., the industry giant, declined as much as 10 percent in Hong Kong, where Haitong Securities Co. plunged 10.5 percent in morning trading, heading for its biggest decline since January.\nTwenty-one leading brokerages have pledged 120 billion yuan ($19 billion) for a stock-purchasing fund and the central bank may provide liquidity for the industry. Initial public offerings are on hold -- robbing brokers of revenue.\nChinese officials are struggling to prevent a market meltdown that could derail the economy as millions of individual investors lose money on leveraged stock purchases.\n“The end result of the market stabilization fund is for brokers to take on many over-valued stocks on their book and potentially damage their earnings and balance sheets down the road,” said Cui.\nStabilization Fund Excluding banks, the Shanghai Composite Index is trading at 31 times trailing earnings.\nThe largest securities firms will use 15 percent of their net capital to establish the market stabilization fund. In addition, they have pledged to refrain from selling their own holdings until the Shanghai Composite Index exceeds 4,500. It was at 3,766 as of the morning trading break on Monday.\nThe benchmark index surged over 150 percent in the 12 months through June 12, turbo-charging a securities industry that was making a comeback after years of torpor. Now the risk is a repeat of the market bust of 2007 and 2008 that sent brokerages into the doldrums.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T07:58:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
