Louise Douvis The iron ore price could be headed below $US50 a tonne again, after falling 5.4 per cent overnight Monday to $US52. Miners had been granted some reprieve, with prices hovering around $US60, since hitting a 10-year nadir of $US47 a tonne in early April. But last week the gains started to fall away.\nPush polling, first developed in the United States, involves questions designed to promote policies, or to sledge opponents. It is understood at least 800 residents - the general size for a state poll - have been contacted on behalf of YIPA.\nThe polling is understood to have finished, and the results could be used for lobbying, or as part of a broader national campaign.\nIn the calls, WA residents have been asked whether BHP and Rio have too much influence over the State Government and the Commonwealth Government, and whether they pay enough money in royalties and tax. Respondents are given options - for example - whether BHP and Rio - pay too much, too little, or the right amount of tax. Residents are also asked about the two majors' supply strategies - whether the level of supply they are putting into the market is too great.\n The iron ore price could be headed below $US50 a tonne again, after falling 5.4 per cent overnight Monday to $US52. Bloomberg Details around gender, age, highest level of education obtained, who they voted for in the last State election and who they intend on voting for in the next State election are also understood to have been asked.\nYIGA's other members include Radar Iron, Cazaly Resources and Mindax. Its member base exports a combined 17 million tonnes a year from the Yilgarn region, which is about 1000 kilometres south of the Pilbara iron ore district.\nThe Fortescue Metals Group camp, led by Andrew Forrest, have also adopted a grassroots approach, after failing in a very public campaign to get a Federal iron ore inquiry up earlier this year. The miner is trying to build support more slowly - and quietly - from the ground up this time. Its grassroots campaign, called Our Iron Ore, is still alive. Some people who were polled were under the impression Mr Forrest was involved but Fairfax Media has since learnt that YIPA has commissioned it.\nMr Forrest, and a growing contingent of the local junior sector, blame Rio and BHP for the collapse in the iron ore price - which has lost about 60 per cent of its value since January last year.\nFortescue's Twiggy Forrest is understood not to be a part of the push polling but has been a critic of the big miners. Geoff Jones Two months ago, US miner Cliffs Natural Resources - a YIPA member - said the seaborne supply of iron ore to China is a \"doomed, horrible business\", and declared it can't wait to finish mining in WA. Speaking after a decision to cut jobs and close one of its three iron ore pits in Western Australia, Cliffs chief executive Lourenco Goncalves said big miners like BHP and Rio were trying to scare the iron ore market into pessimism with their expansion plans, but could no longer afford those expansions.\nAt current prices of about $US52 a tonne, most of the iron ore sector outside of the big four producers is underwater.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T08:07:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
