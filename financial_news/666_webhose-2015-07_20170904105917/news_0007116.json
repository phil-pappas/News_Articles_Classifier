The couple in their early 30s live in a small condominium. They don't own a car. They also buy used when they can and generally try to spend as little as possible.\nIt's been a successful formula for saving money so far -- especially since Emma started working full time this year, earning about $40,000 annually.\n\nPhil Hossack / Winnipeg Free Press \n\"We live well within our budget now,\" says Alex, who works part time for the federal government earning about $21,000 a year.\nWith monthly expenses of about $2,500 and take-home pay of about $3,750 a month, they have plenty of money left over to save. At the moment, they've been paying extra on their mortgage -- $200 a month -- to eliminate the $53,000 balance as fast as possible.\n\"It'd be great to be mortgage-free in about five years,\" Alex says.\n\nEliminating their only source of debt is an important part of their long-term plan, which besides saving for retirement includes reducing their work hours so they can spend more time on other pursuits.\n\"Our financial goals are basically to work as little as possible, not just when we retire in 30 years, but right now,\" says Emma. \"We're hoping it might be possible to get by working three days a week, spending the rest of our time volunteering, doing activism, exercising, cooking and hanging out with friends and family.\"\nWhile they believe they can do it once the mortgage is paid, which would reduce their monthly budget to less than $2,000, they recognize the need to save for retirement.\nAlex has a pension -- which will be of limited value if he continues working part time -- while Emma's work does not offer a plan. Consequently, they will be depending on savings. With this in mind, most of their savings are going into RRSPs, invested in a socially responsible Canadian equity mutual fund.\nBut they want help developing a strategy to maximize their money, Alex says.\n\"How can we use what we're earning right now most efficiently and effectively so we have money down the road?\"\nWinnipeg investment adviser with Cambrian Credit Union Richard Kostycz says Alex and Emma are certainly taking the right steps to achieve their goal, mainly because they live within their means. But their plan will depend on their ability to endure living on an even tighter budget than they are now because they will need to maintain a very high rate of savings to fund their retirement properly.\n\"The whole thing is dependent on them continuing to live on their austerity program, and it seems that they can manage it, so I have got them continuing on this spending path for the next 30 years,\" says Kostycz, also a certified general accountant.\nOne of his first recommendations is to stop the additional payments on their mortgage because they can get a better return investing it in the markets.\nMoreover, their accelerated repayment plan will not achieve their goal of paying off their mortgage in five years. Even with the additional payments, it would take about a decade to pay off the mortgage.\nBy diverting this extra money into their investments, this will increase their monthly saving contributions to more than $1,065, which can continue to grow during the next five years.\n\"Then, after five years, they will take $46,591 from their investments and pay off the remaining balance on the mortgage,\" he says. \"They can then scale back to part-time work and continue on saving for their retirement at age 60.\"\nWith their mortgage paid, they will still have about $91,000 in savings. If they can continue setting aside $1,065 a month for the next 25 years, while earning about six per cent a year, they will have accumulated more than $1.1 million in savings. While that's only about $500,000 in today's dollars, accounting for the effects of inflation, they will still have CPP, OAS and possibly work pensions to build a retirement income that likely exceeds what they earn today.\n\"The big advantage they have for their plan is time,\" he says. \"The ability to compound their money over 25 years is huge.\"\nBut it's important they also choose an investment strategy mostly focused on equities rather than fixed income.\n\"This is not a strategy that would involve investing in GICs earning two per cent.\"\nKostycz suggests they lean heavily on dividend-yielding stocks that offer both income and capital growth. These investments tend to be less volatile than growth stocks, which instead of paying out a portion of profits as dividends, reinvest earnings into their business to expand market share.\n\"Over time, dividend producers have proven to provide a better return than growth stocks,\" he says. \"That's because they increase their dividend almost annually while growing their share price, too.\"\nFor example, RBC stock purchased about a decade ago would now have an effective dividend yield of close to eight per cent today based on the original purchase price of about $38.\nEmma and Alex should also consider expanding their investment horizon beyond Canada, because our market relies on energy, mining and banking.\n\"Furthermore, we only represent about 1.84 per cent of the world's total wealth,\" he says.\n\"If you're only investing in Canada, then in this light, you can see the potential problems down the road.\"\nWhile they're limited in their choices of socially responsible investments, some Canadian mutual fund providers have international equity funds that use this filter to pick their holdings.\nEqually important to their long-term plan is that they must stop contributing to RRSPs and instead put their savings toward maximizing TFSAs.\n\"When they draw money out of TFSAs, there are no taxes owing, whereas if they load up their RRSPs and start drawing money out of those, these sums are fully taxable at their marginal rate,\" he says.\nIn addition, RRSP contributions are generally more advantageous for high-income earners who in retirement will be earning less income than they were while working. As a result, withdrawals in retirement likely will be taxed at a lower rate than the tax rate that would have been applicable on RRSP contributions made while working.\nBecause Emma and Alex are earning so little income today, it's unlikely they would be drawing money from their RRSPs in retirement at a lower rate.\nBut if they build up their TFSA savings, they will be able to draw on money tax-free in retirement, which would make their savings go further.\nKostycz says savings over and above TFSA contributions should be made to non-registered accounts. Here, too, they should favour Canadian stocks paying dividends because the tax rates applicable to dividend income from publicly traded Canadian companies is very favourable. At today's tax rates, Alex and Emma could pay between about four per cent and 6.5 per cent on dividend income based on their income today and once retired.\nEmma and Alex can likely have their cake and eat it, too. They can work part time and still save for a comfortable retirement. But it's highly dependent on earning six per cent annually on their investments over time while sticking to their budget, which will become even tighter once they reduce their work hours.\n\"For me, it's a bit austere,\" Kostycz says. \"But based on the hard number-crunching alone, it's doable, and certainly not a pie-in-the-sky dream.\"\njoelschles@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T13:55:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
