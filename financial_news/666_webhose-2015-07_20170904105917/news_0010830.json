They also form the backbone of the country’s welfare safety net.\nLenders want faster elimination of early retirement rights, across-the-board cuts in yearly expenditure and the phasing out of a top-up fund for low-earners.\nThe government made late concessions before the talks collapsed and is likely to follow with even deeper cuts if a new agreement is reached.\nProtesters participate in a pro-euro demonstration in front of the parliament building in Athens.

Athens worried that demands to slap additional tax on hotels and catering would hit its vital tourism industry, while ending tax exemptions for Greek islands would help tap money spent in busy holiday resorts but hurt others in remote island areas where goods are already expensive and state services are rudimentary.\nGreece and creditors were close to agreement on Athens’ proposal to simplify existing rates to 6, 13, and 23 per cent.\n“We were very close to agreement on this. That’s why we were disappointed the way the referendum was called,” a European official said hours after the talks broke up.\nBUSINESS TAX: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras left-wing government was elected on a pledge to relieve pensioners and wage-earners from austerity taxes that pushed hundreds of thousands of people into poverty. Tsipras wanted to shift the tax burden to profitable companies, but was forced to extend emergency the taxes, while the IMF demanded more modest business tax increased, arguing high levies would hurt chances of recovery.\nIn a state TV interview late Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Giannis Dragasakis conceded the government was “obliged to take more painful measures” but would keeping working to make the burden of austerity fairer.\nGreek voters will decide in a referendum next Sunday on whether their government should accept an economic reform package put forth by Greece's creditors.

Creditors have a long list of other demands that include doubling proposed annual defence spending cuts to 400 million euros ($450 million) per year — a demand the country’s defence minister said this week that Greece could not accept.\nAnother politically sensitive demand concerns reforming labour laws that would make it easier for businesses to impose collective dismissals. The government — which wants to restore the minimum wage to pre-crisis levels — had said it had convinced creditors to delay labour reforms until the economy had recovered.\nBut Dragasakis on Tuesday said that the government was considering making additional concessions in six areas, including pensions and labour rules.\nEurogroup President and Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem talks to journalists at the Binnenhof in The Hague, The Netherlands.
