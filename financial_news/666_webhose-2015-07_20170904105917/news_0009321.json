Photo: Eddie Jim\nBHP Billiton's decision to shift its treasury functions breaches the \"spirit\" of the conditions the federal government applied when the mining giant was born as part of a merger in 2001, according to Victoria's shadow treasurer Michael O'Brien.\nSpeaking after BHP announced it would shift its treasury staff to London on Tuesday , Mr O'Brien said the move appeared to be at odds with the conditions that then Treasurer Peter Costello applied to the merger through the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB).\nMr Costello, through FIRB, had ruled that BHP's chief executive, chief financial officer and the company's headquarters must have their \"principal place of residence\" in Australia.\nBut BHP Billiton on Tuesday confirmed the company is reducing staff numbers at its Melbourne headquarters by up to 25 per cent over the coming years.\nAdvertisement Almost all of the company's treasury staff will be based in London by Christmas.\n\"This move certainly appears to be against the spirit if not the letter of the agreement that BHP entered into when they merged with Billiton,\" Mr O'Brien told Fairfax Media .\n\"The company needs to explain how taking all of its treasury functions to London is consistent with what it agreed to.\"\nMr O'Brien also took aim at the state government saying it should take some action.\n\"It is a devastating blow for professional jobs in Victoria. BHP has been a cornerstone of Melbourne's financial and mining community and some 25 per cent of the positions sent offshore is a real blow to this state,\" he said.\n\"Where is the Victorian treasurer? Where is Tim Pallas?\"\nBHP has said the shift of treasury staff to London would not impact \"key supporting functions\" and that the company is in full compliance with its FIRB commitments.", "external_links": ["http://www.smh.com.au/business/mining-and-resources/bhp-treasury-unit-to-shift-to-london-20150729-gim8w5"], "published": "2015-07-29T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T14:37:10.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
