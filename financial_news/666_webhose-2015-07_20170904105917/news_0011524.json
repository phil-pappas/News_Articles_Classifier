Sahlan Hayes Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Primrose Riordan A speech by Malcolm Turnbull on national security was a \"remarkable\" attack on Prime Minister Tony Abbott that revealed tensions within the Coalition, Shadow employment minister Brendan O'Connor said.\nBut other Liberal MPs and Mr Turnbull denied the speech criticised the government. In the speech, at the Sydney Institute on Tuesday night, Mr Turnbull argued overstating the role of ISIS can play into the hands of terrorists . He criticised a \"with us or against us\" approach to national security.\n\"Denouncing those who question the effectiveness of new national security measures as 'friends of terrorists' is as stupid as describing those who advocate them as 'proto-fascists'\", Mr Turnbull said.\nMr Abbott has previously accused Labor of \"rolling out the red carpet\" to terrorists in questioning the legality of laws aimed at stripping terror suspects of their Australian citizenship.\nSpeaking minutes before Labor Leader Bill Shorten's appearance at the royal commission, Mr O'Connor said Mr Turnbull's \"remarkable comments\" spoke directly to Mr Abbott's approach.\n\"Mr Turnbull has effectively said if you criticise a person for having a different point of view on proposed national security legislation, you are stupid if you call them friends of terrorists. That is a clear attack upon the way in which the PM has conducted himself,\" he said.\n'Ongoing division' Mr O'Connor said it was an example of ongoing division within the Coalition following the attempt at a leadership spill earlier this year.\n \"Malcolm Turnbull… a senior Cabinet Minister, a former Liberal leader no less, has attacked the PM in the way in which he is conducting national security.\n\"We're watching a public display of senior minister and a PM having a fight through to the prism of leadership tensions,\" he said.\nMr Turnbull indicated the comments were not directed at Mr Abbott and said he thought the government had \"got the balance right\" between the rule of law and national security\n\"The Prime Minister has been very measured in his comments on all these things… I think the government has got the balance right, I'm not sure everyone else has,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, Liberal Senator Scott Ryan said: \"I don't see any inconsistency between what Malcolm and the Prime Minister have been saying\".\nLiberal chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Dan Tehan came out with a similar message. \"I think Malcolm is very much being part of government's approach,\" he said.\nMr Turnbull also declined to end speculation over whether he would cancel his scheduled appearance on the ABC 's Q&A program, and obey Mr Abbott's order that no frontbencher appear on the show until a new review is completed.\n\"Time will tell, stay tuned… We'll see what the position is next Monday but really I have nothing more to say on Q&A,\" he said.\nAsked if he supported the government's boycott he said: \"The prime minister Minister is, like Barnaby said, the chief executive\".\nAs of 7pm on Tuesday night the program was advertising him as a guest .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/QandA/status/618339952204460034", "https://twitter.com/primroseriordan", "https://plus.google.com/117519411493153561016"], "published": "2015-07-08T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:57:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
