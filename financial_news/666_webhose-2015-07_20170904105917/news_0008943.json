A growing economy should lift the muni market in the second half of 2015, said Lyle Fitterer, portfolio manager for the Wells Fargo Advantage Municipal Bond fund. \n\"You have a little bit of income, a little bit of price depreciation in the marketplace,\" said Fitterer. \"Longer term it looks pretty attractive on a relative value basis so we are looking for slightly positive returns by the end of the year.\" \nThe Wells Fargo Advantage Municipal Bond fund , which has a trailing twelve month yield of 2.7%, is up 6 basis points so far in 2015, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. The $3.2 billion fund has returned 5.5% on an annualized basis over the past five years, better than 89% of its Morningstar peers. \nWhile Puerto Rico's financial problems are capturing headlines, Fitterer said the island's troubles are not weighing on the national muni market. In fact, he said Chicago and New Jersey's problematic paper are having more of an impact than Puerto Rico. \n\"A lot of people have had a chance to sell Puerto Rico,\" said Fitterer. \"I think most people think it's cheap, and they buy it and then it gets cheaper. We think it's too hard to analyze.\" Fitterer said his team does not immediately run from municipalities with legacy pension issues , instead taking each bond on a case by case basis. For example, he said he owns a lot of Chicago debt despite recent downgrades by the ratings agencies. \"You need to differentiate Chicago from a Detroit or Puerto Rico by looking at the economic backdrop,\" said Fitterer. \"In Chicago the economy is actually growing. It's a microcosm of the U.S. growing plus or minus 2% per year. Population has shifted. Its growing again. They are starting to become a technology center for the U.S. and commercial real estate has gone up substantially for the city.\" Check Out Our Best Services for Investors \nPortfolio Manager Jim Cramer and Director of Research Jack Mohr reveal their investment tactics while giving advanced notice before every trade.
