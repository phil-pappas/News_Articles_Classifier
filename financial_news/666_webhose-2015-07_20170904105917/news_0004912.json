The shares were halted at HK$3.91.\nThe manufacturer of solar production equipment last week said it plans to challenge a decision by regulators to suspend trading indefinitely. Hong Kong’s securities watchdog is seeking audited accounts of Hanergy’s parent, as well as details on loans of Chairman Li Hejun amid concern the company failed to keep investors properly informed.\nLi argues that he can’t provide the documents the regulator is seeking as they belong to the listed company’s closely-held parent, both of which he controls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T13:05:33.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
