It's definitely worthwhile, otherwise we wouldn't still be here after six months,\" she told SNA in a telephone interview on Monday morning. \n\"We get mostly people booking overnight trips, we don't really see many people booking two or three days on the boats, usually it's from the hotel where they are staying such as Constance Ephelia to Moyenne overnight or further away would be to La Digue or Praslin,\" she explained. \nFerreira, who is a South African national, says the majority of her clients are from South Africa and Russia, adding that despite the economic slowdown in the Russian economy and subsequent drop in Russian visitor arrivals to the Seychelles, the Russian side of her business has not thus far been affected. \nSpeaking to SNA in a telephone interview on Monday morning, the manager of the Seychelles Yacht Club, Eleanor Scharfenberg, said she had noticed that the archipelago was becoming increasingly popular as a destination for visiting yachts. \n\"We cannot talk about the charter business as all the yachts we have here are privately owned, but what I can tell you is that we are seeing an increase in the yachts in transit from other countries,\" she said, adding that for some years previously foreign yachts were rarely seen in the Seychelles because of the threat of piracy, but said this was now starting to increase rapidly. \n\"Now they come from countries such as Reunion, Madagascar, Mauritius and all around the world - even as far afield as Mexico! This shows that the way to Seychelles is much safer,\" she said. \nThe yachting season in the Seychelles runs from November to May. In addition to providing a relaxed refuge for the super-rich, yacht charters are also popular among game fishing enthusiasts, an increasing number of whom visit the Seychelles only to make the most of the Seychelles' abundant sea-life. \nSeychelles has two luxury yacht marinas, Eden Island Marina and the Wharf Marina, both found on the coastline of Mahé, the main island of the Indian Ocean archipelago, where boat owners enjoy a degree of anonymity and tranquility, as the remote location of the islands are valued as an exclusive yachting destination. \nThe recent inauguration of the country's first national boat show in June was an indicator of the yachting industry's economic potential, as a wide variety of yachts, leisure craft and other vessels came out on display to the general public at the Eden Island marina on the main island of Mahé. \nWhile touring the boats on show, the President of Seychelles, James Michel told local media that he believed the Seychelles could soon become a centre for yachting in the Indian Ocean as another facet to the tourism and blue economy sectors.
