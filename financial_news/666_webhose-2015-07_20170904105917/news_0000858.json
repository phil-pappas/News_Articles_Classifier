Barbie brand dolls are arranged for a photograph. Mattel Inc. sunk to a loss for its second quarter, compared with a year-ago profit, pressured by a continued drop in sales of its Barbie brand. El Segundo-based Mattel (Nasdaq: MAT) posted a loss of $11.4 million, or 3 cents per share, in the second quarter, compared with a profit of $28.3 million, or 8 cents per share, a year ago. Sales fell 7 percent to $988.2 million and was flat when adjusting for currency exchange rates. North American sales were down 3 percent while international sales fell 10 percent but was up 5 percent in constant currency terms. Worldwide sales for Mattel girls and boys brands fell 3 percent in constant currency to $601.8 million, with sales for the Barbie brand were down 11 percent. Consistent with the first quarter, year-to-date retail sales for Barbie are up slightly, driven by strong performance in the United States, but were partially offset by a decline in international markets, Mattel said. Sales of the company’s Hot Wheels and Matchbox brands were up 26 percent in constant currency, while Fisher-Price sales rose 9 percent to $336.8 million. American Girl Brands sales increased 1 percent to $84.2 million. \"In the second quarter, we made solid progress as we work to return Mattel to improved growth and profitability,\" Chairman and Chief Executive Christopher Sinclair said in a statement. \"Our financial results in the quarter largely met our expectations, and we are encouraged by improved performance across our core brands, as well as strong momentum in emerging markets like China and Russia. Although we are still early in our turnaround effort, I believe we are taking all the right steps to be more competitive in the growing global toy industry.\" Mattel shares fell 3 percent to $24.31 a share Friday. \nWant Los Angeles Retailing & Restaurants news in your inbox?
