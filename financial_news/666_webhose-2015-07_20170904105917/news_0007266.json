Gentlemen, Start Your Budgeting \nSmaller brewers are facing this issue as well. Sierra Nevada, Lagunitas, Oskar Blues, Green Flash, Stone and New Belgium are all West Coast or Rocky Mountain breweries that have opened brewing facilities a bit farther east in recent years. While Sierra Nevada and Oskar Blues have made a point of putting the names of their new North Carolina homes on the cans and bottles of beers brewed there, the role that California and Colorado play in those brewers' respective narratives hasn't diminished. \nThere are many ways that brewers can complicate their relationship with a beer's place of origin. They can buy a brewery that exists elsewhere and start producing that brewer's brand in their own facilities. They can opt to employ another brewer beyond their local offices to brew beer that they don't have the facilities or manpower to brew themselves -- a practice known as contract brewing. Or, they can open a secondary facility in another city, state or country that produces beer under the same brand in a different location. \nHowever, as the Beck's example makes clear, there may be consequences to using those strategies in the future. Just to give you some examples of how complicated “local” beer branding can be, we've assembled just 12 examples of beers associated with one region, but brewed in entirely another. The labeling varies for each, thanks to the Treasury Department's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which allows beer companies to label beers with either their their brewery location, place of production or “principal place of business. ” Of course, “a TTB officer may disapprove the listing of a principal place of business if its use would create a false or misleading impression as to the geographic origin of the beer,” but the basic gist is the same for the following brews.
