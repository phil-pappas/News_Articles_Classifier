Bloomberg by Naomi Rovnick Barclays has announced the departure of chief executive Antony Jenkins, saying its board had decided the bank needed a \"a change of leadership\".\nThe bank is now searching for a new chief executive to fill Mr Jenkins' role. In the meantime, chairman John McFarlane will become executive chairman.\nMr McFarlane said in the bank's statement: \"I respect and endorse the position of the board in deciding that a change in leadership is required at this time.\nDeputy chairman Sir Michael Rake added: \"Notwithstanding Antony's significant achievements, it became clear to all of us that a new set of skills were required for the period ahead.\"\nMr Jenkins has run the bank during a period when its investment banking profits dropped and it was fined $2.4bn for rigging foreign exchange and other markets over five years.\nIn March, Mr Jenkins hailed significant progress for Barclays and said it was in its best shape since the financial crisis.\nHe will receive his current salary of £1.1m per year until July 7 2016, and a pension allowance of £363,000, as well as \"other benefits\".\nMr Jenkins would also \"remain elegible to be considered for a pro rated 2015 bonus\" .\n Mr McFarlane will not get a pay rise, but will keep receiving the £800,000 annual fee he earns as chairman of the bank. Mr McFarlane previously served as chief executive of ANZ Banking Group in Australia for 10 years until 2007.\nMr Jenkins said in the Barclays statement released on Wednesday: \"In the summer of 2012, I became group chief executive at a particularly difficult time for Barclays. It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago both for our industry and even more so for us. I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then.\n\"Our capital position is much stronger, our business model is more balanced, we are much more disciplined on cost management, we have made good progress in rebuilding our reputation and we are seen as a leader in the application of technology to our business. While the external environment has continued to be, and will remain, challenging the group now has the resilience to overcome these challenges.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T13:47:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
