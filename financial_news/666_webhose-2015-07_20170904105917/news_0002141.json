The first phase of this relocation was announced in early April. \nIn yesterday's (13 July) letter, the groups said management has ignored several request for collective bargaining, dismissed one representative and mobilised policemen to oppress the peaceful strikers. \n&quotWe are now making a solemn appeal to you … to bear the responsibility of ensuring that Artigas complying with Chinese law, with respect to labour and human rights,\" the letter read. &quotRefusal to negotiate with workers regarding big changes in the key terms of the labour conditions and unpaid the law-mandated social insurance premiums, are indeed breaching China’s Labour Contract Law and Trade Union Law.\" \nThe groups urge all existing clients and potential clients of Artigas urge Lever Style to pay the severance payments and social insurance contributions in arrears to all the affected workers, ensure no retaliation to the strikers, and intervene in the case until it has been fully settled. \nIf Artigas continues to ignore workers' demands, the groups say a number of trade unions and global labour groups will protest against the outlets of those brands which have purchased OEM products from Artigas on 15 July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T14:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T16:26:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
