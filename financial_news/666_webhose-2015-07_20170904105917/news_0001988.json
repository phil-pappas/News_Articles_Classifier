The group said all in sustaining costs for both the June quarter and 2014-15 were set to come in at the lower end of guidance which was in a range between $1050 and $1100.\nCost metrics are becoming increasingly important at a time when the gold price is looking more likely to trend lower. Reg Spencer from Canaccord revised lowered his medium- and long-term forecasts on Monday with projections between 2015 and 2018 being lowered by about 4 per cent.\nHowever, having also reduced his AUD/US dollar forecasts, the impact for an Australian gold producer such as Northern Star isn't substantial. Over the next three years the most significant realignment of the Australian dollar gold price is in fiscal 2016 where Canaccord lowered its estimate from $1649 per ounce to $1582 per ounce.\nTo illustrate the significance of these changes on a company such as Northern Star, there is still a margin of about $500 per ounce based on an all in sustaining cost at the upper end of management's guidance.\nIt is worth noting UBS recently predicted a sub-70Â¢ Australian dollar over the next six months and a number of analysts have pitched their foreign exchange projections over the next three years at levels some 5 per cent lower than Canaccord.\nWith production in excess of Hartleys forecasts and costs coming in lower than expected the broker remained positive on the stock with an accumulate recommendation and 12-month price target of $2.45.\nTrevor Hoey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T11:01:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
