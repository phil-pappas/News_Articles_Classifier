Or so University of New South Wales psychologist Joanne Earl believes.\nThe test is intended to head off bad decision-making in those people suffering the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\nEarl is working with a cohort of SMSF trustees to come up with a simple computer-based test that could help trustees and the families track mental fitness over time.\n\"My dream would be that people who are managing large, complex portfolios are volunteering to take cognitive assessments every year in the same way they do an eye test to update their prescription,\" she says. \"That way they could spot problems early on.\"\nSMSF trustees in Australia control a large and growing pool of wealth – about $900 billion or one-third of all superannuation assets. Statistics show that three in 10 will suffer dementia if they live beyond 85.\nThe ATO emphasises that the decision to become an SMSF trustee \"is a big responsibility\". In fact, PWC has previously proposed, unsuccessfully, that only sophisticated investors, as defined by the Corporations Act , should be permitted to set up SMSFs.\nDavid Williams, a financial planner who describes himself as a \"longevity analyst\", says given the tax breaks afforded to super and the fact anybody who goes broke is likely to end up on the pension, all Australians have skin in the game.\n\"The community as a whole should be taking an informed view on how to deal with this,\" he says.\n Most SMSF trustees are aged over 65. By definition they tend to be more financially literate and confident, but how to tell when the onset of dementia begins to impinge on decision-making?\nEarl's research so far suggests people with higher levels of general mental ability and financial literacy also report a greater sense of control over their lives.\nImportantly, shying away from social and other activities for fear of publicly exhibiting signs of dementia can deny older people the stimulation their brains need to ward off dementia.\nSuccession planning Nerida Cole, the managing director of financial advisory at Dixon Advisory, says succession planning is already on the minds of most SMSF trustees.\n\"There is an ageing bubble of people for whom these considerations are very important,\" she says.\n\"They want to know when to get the kids involved.\n\"We've also had trustees to whom we've said, 'Why don't we start conferencing your son into the discussion so he can keep up to date with what's going on and you've got that sounding board.' \"\nA paper by Earl to be published in the Australian Journal of Management notes that there is evidence that our ability to deal with novel problems under time pressure peaks in middle age.\nOther studies of investor behaviour suggest skill in picking stocks peaks at the age of 42 and drops off significantly from the age of 70.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T14:04:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
