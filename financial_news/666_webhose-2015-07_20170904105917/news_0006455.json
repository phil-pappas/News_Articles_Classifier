Koester also worked from 2004 to 2010 at Goldman Sachs Group Inc as the co-head of specialty finance and prior to that as chief risk officer at mortgage insurer PMI Group Inc. \nBarclays and Koester declined to comment. \nKoester's hire comes after Barclays announced April 28 it hired three other New York-based managing directors in its U.S. investment banking unit. They include Liz Jacobs and Justin Evans, who, like Koester, have joined Barclays' financial institutions group (FIG).
