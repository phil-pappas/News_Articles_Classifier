Debate has erupted since a U.K. online banking service provider called Intelligent Environments announced it is introducing an emoji passcode system . The system will allow users to use codes from a selection of 44 emoji options, an advent the company is calling the \"world's first emoji-only passcode.\" \nSome seem to be embracing the prospect of an emoji password system, especially amid increasing concerns over financial security breaches . On the other hand, some are not so keen on using smileys to protect their money. \nOf course, a whopping 64% of Millennials regularly communicate using only emoji. While the likes of a winky face, a strawberry and a champagne glass might have superseded conventional text messaging of a certain age group, these juvenile, cartoonish symbols may just be the future of online banking security.
