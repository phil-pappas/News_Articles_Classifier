As of 14:00 BST, the FTSE 100 (NasdaqGS: Z - news ) was trading 0.2% lower at 6,727. \nShares (Frankfurt: DI6.F - news ) in defence and aerospace engineer Meggitt (Other OTC: MEGGF - news ) rose following a report in the Financial Times that a merger with Cobham (Other OTC: CBHMY - news ) might be on the cards . Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers , said he sees the rationale of a tie-up between the two as a defence play. \nAstraZeneca (NYSE: AZN - news ) gained as its Iressa drug, which is used in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration . Iressa is already approved in 91 countries for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive NSCLC, which is the most common type of lung cancer. \nSky (Other OTC: BSYBF - news ) surged as analysts at Deutsche Bank (Xetra: 514000 - news ) upgraded their rating on the stock from 'hold' to 'buy' and raised estimates for 2017 by 20% more than the wider consensus. In a note to clients, Deutsche Bank said the European satellite TV giant was the best positioned in Europe to capitalise on growth areas related to online video. \nMeanwhile ITV was under the cosh in early trading after Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to 'sell' from 'hold' . \"We find the upside case of retransmission fees, Liberty takeout and cash returns/dividends unconvincing,\" said the bank. \nThis seemed to outweigh a note from Morgan Stanley (Xetra: 885836 - news ) on the media sector that picked out ITV (Other OTC: ITVPF - news ) as one of its favoured stocks, while also downgrading Pearson to 'equal weight' from 'overweight'. Pearson's shares fell around 1.8% by mid afternoon. \nShares in housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey (Other OTC: TWODF - news ) , Barratt Developments (LSE: BDEV.L - news ) and Persimmon were all knocked lower as Mark Carney told the Treasury Select Committee that the bank rate may be headed higher a little bit sooner than markets anticipated. \nRisers Sky (LSE: SKY.L - news ) (SKY) 1,115.00p +3.43% Meggitt (MGGT) 480.80p +2.19% Morrison (Wm) Supermarkets (MRW) 180.10p +1.18% Sainsbury (J) (SBRY) 265.40p +0.87% Reed Elsevier (Other OTC: RUKEF - news ) (REL) 1,094.00p +0.83% Glencore (GLEN) 252.40p +0.80% Unilever (ULVR) 2,903.00p +0.76% Direct Line Insurance Group (DLG) 348.30p +0.66% Tesco (TSCO) 213.85p +0.64% British American Tobacco (BATS) 3,639.00p +0.61% Fallers Taylor Wimpey (TW.) 185.40p -3.39% Persimmon (PSN) 1,958.00p -2.78% Barratt Developments (BDEV) 624.00p -2.73% GKN (GKN) 317.10p -2.28% TUI AG Reg Shs (DI (KSE: 003160.KS - news ) ) (TUI (Other OTC: TUIFF - news ) ) 1,066.00p -1.93% Weir Group (Other OTC: WEIGF - news ) (WEIR) 1,595.00p -1.73% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 402.50p -1.61% Johnson Matthey (Other OTC: JMPLY - news ) (JMAT) 3,005.00p -1.48% Hammerson (HMSO) 652.50p -1.44% Marks &Spencer Group (MKS) 540.00p -1.37%", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T18:29:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
