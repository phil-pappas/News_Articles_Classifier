The CFPB said that Honda would set up a toll-free hotline for consumers to submit loan details to see if they qualified for a refund.\n“The CFPB is committed to creating a fair marketplace for all consumers, and other auto lenders should take note of today’s action,” said CFPB director Richard Cordray. “Honda’s proactive decision to move to a new pricing and compensation system demonstrates industry leadership and represents a significant step toward protecting consumers from discrimination.”\nAuto loans are the third-largest source of outstanding household debt in the U.S., after mortgages and student loans, the CFPB said.\nIn In an investigation that began in April 2013, Honda’s auto lender set a risk-based interest rate, or “buy rate,” that it conveyed to auto dealers, the CFPB said. Honda then allowed auto dealers to charge a higher interest rate when they finalized the deal with the customer, the consumer agency said. The “dealer markup” gave auto sellers them the discretion to charge consumers different rates regardless of consumer creditworthiness, the CFPB alleged. The agency said that Honda permitted dealers to markup consumers’ interest rates as much as 2.25% for contracts with terms of 5 years or less, and 2% for contracts with longer terms.\nAmerican Honda Finance Corporation said it will put new measures in place to address discretionary auto loan pricing and compensation practices, according to the federal agency. Honda will reduce dealer discretion to markup the interest rate to only 1.25% above the buy rate for auto loans with terms of 5 years or less, and 1% for auto loans with longer terms, according to the CFPB.\nIn December 2013, the CFPB and the Justice Department ordered Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank to pay $80 million in consumer restitution and an $18 million civil penalty for similar discrimination against 235,000 minority auto loan borrowers in a similar scheme.\n ", "external_links": ["http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201507_cfpb_consent-order_honda.pdf"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T07:43:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
