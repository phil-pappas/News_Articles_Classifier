Louie Douvis by Fleur Anderson Some 7500 pages of new tax rules have been imposed since the election of the Abbott government, which promised to cut $1 billion a year of unnecessary regulation from the economy.\nLaw firm Mills Oakley has created its own index for tracking the amount of new tax legislation and regulations introduced each month by federal, state and territory governments and has found that while red tape might be being cut in other areas, the volume of new tax rules has not let up.\nThe firm's private advisory partner, John Storey, said after a slight lull in the volume of new tax laws after the last federal election, the amount of tax compliance continues to increase.\nWhile state and territory government revenue offices account for some of the paperwork, the federal government is the biggest offender, according to the Mills Oakley Tax Compliance Index.\n\"It's this constant stream of new tax rulings – but I'm only talking about tax; in other areas of red tape it might be doing better,\" Mr Storey said.\nSince the index began in October 2012, 15,000 pages of new tax rules have been imposed on taxpayers.\n\"After the change in federal government, there was a lull in the number of new rules, but it seems in the last 12 months to have returned to the longer trend,\" Mr Storey said.\n\"For taxpayers and tax advisers as well, June is our busiest month because of end-of-financial-year planning at all the things that have to be in place.\"\n For the past three years, June has seen the biggest spike in extra tax red tape, with 1077 pages of new tax rules introduced last month because that is when federal governments try to pass their May budgets.\n\"Exactly when you are really busy they slam you with all these new rules,\" Mr Storey said. \"Overall, the Commonwealth is the worst offender, but it's spread across the whole country.\"\nThe federal government's own measurement of its red tape reduction efforts found it had cut compliance costs across the economy – not just in the area of tax law – by $2.45 billion by abolishing over 10,000 legislative instruments and 1800 Acts of Parliament last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-23T13:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:00:03.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
