Raise it with a chief executive and their eyes will light up in a way that tells you they think they must, at the very least, give the appearance of enthusiasm. “What? You think rival X’s data is big? Wait till you see the size of mine.” And so on.\nRaise it with a more tech-focused executive, such as a chief information officer, and you will more often see a knowing eye roll, which says, “OK journo, let’s get this bit over with.”\nTruth be told, while organisations of all kinds benefit from big-data concepts, the vast majority are talking a much better game than they play. The definition of big data can change depending on who is speaking and the topic has filled a cloud-computing-shaped hole at the apex of the pile of tech topics to introduce in a conversational lull. That isn’t to say big data is a meaningless fad – rather that it is a poorly named idea which has captured imaginations before organisations have thought about the reality.\nAt its core, the concept is about getting the most value out of the data available to your business. It should not be about organisations seeking extra data to find amazing insights yet; it should involve working out what you want to achieve and what data you are sitting on in order to investigate potential insights.\nAt a recent lunch with executives from a leading management consultant firm, one of the partners made a good point (shocking, I know) which was, in short, that most companies should stop talking about big data and start thinking about medium data and important data.\nMost Australian businesses are sitting on so much data already and they don’t know what to do with it. So setting off blindly, hoping for answers, will cost a lot and not deliver much. CEOs and marketing, sales and finance executives are right to be excited about the topic, because better use of data offers huge potential benefits for all of them. But you have to know what you are looking for.\n All the data in the world won’t provide you with anything usable unless you are posing relevant queries. How big is your data? As with anything, ask a silly question and you get a silly answer.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/0/101552183386293013225/posts", "https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/SaysSmithy"], "published": "2015-07-04T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T04:11:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
