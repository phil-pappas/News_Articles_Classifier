Plan sponsors may expect significant changes in retirement plan service providers' business practices and offerings if the final regulations, which the DOL is expected to issue before President Obama leaves office, are similar to the proposed regulations. \nCurrent Definition of Investment Advice Fiduciary \nUnder ERISA, a person who renders (or has authority or responsibility to render) investment advice for a fee with respect to the assets of an ERISA plan is a fiduciary of that plan. (In general, ERISA fiduciaries must act in the best interest of the plan and its participants and beneficiaries and may not engage in transactions involving the plan on behalf of a party whose interests are adverse to those of the plan or its participants and beneficiaries.) Current regulations provide that an adviser does not render \" unless advice is given or recommendations made on a regular basis and pursuant to a mutual agreement, arrangement or understanding with the plan or plan fiduciary that the advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to plan assets and will be individualized based on the particular needs of the plan. \nProposed Definition of Investment Advice Fiduciary \nTinvestment advice” with a much broader definition under which an investment-related recommendation or asset appraisal is investment advice if the adviser renders the advice pursuant to a verbal or written agreement, arrangement or understanding that the advice is individualized for, or specifically directed to, the advice recipient for consideration in making investment or management decisions with respect to securities or other property of the plan or IRA. (An adviser that directly or indirectly represents or acknowledges that it is acting as an ERISA fiduciary would also be an investment advice fiduciary.) According to the preamble to the proposed regulations, this new definition of fiduciary investment advice “better reflects the broad scope of the statutory text and its purposes and better protects plans, participants, beneficiaries, and IRA owners from conflicts of interest, imprudence, and disloyalty.” \n\nseller's carve-out” for advice provided to a plan fiduciary with financial expertise –'s length counterparty transaction provided by the counterparty or a representative of the counterparty to an independent plan fiduciary who exercises authority or control with respect to the management or disposition of plan assets is not investment advice if the adviser does not receive direct compensation for providing the advice and certain other requirements are met. If the independent plan fiduciary manages less than $100 million in plan assets, the adviser must obtain a representation that the plan has 100 or more participants and must know or reasonably believe that the independent plan fiduciary has sufficient expertise to evaluate the transaction and determine whether it is prudent and in the best interest of plan participants. \n–’s recommendations. \n–'s normal compensation in connection with the advice. \n–\"without regard to the individualized needs\" of the plan or its participants and provides a written disclosure to the plan fiduciary that it is not providing impartial investment advice or giving advice in a fiduciary capacity. A platform provider that also provides selection and monitoring assistance to the plan does not provide investment advice if it “merely identifies investment alternatives that meet objective criteria specified by the plan fiduciary” or “merely provides objective financial data and comparisons with independent benchmarks to the plan fiduciary.” \n– \n– \n\n“retirement investor”) that discloses any material conflicts of interest and provides that the adviser and financial institution are fiduciaries and will provide investment advice that is in the retirement investor's best interest. \nwould allow advisers and financial institutions to receive compensation for services provided in connection with the purchase, sale or holding of certain assets as a result of investment advice given to plan participants or beneficiaries, IRA owners or sponsors of non-participant-directed plans with fewer than 100 participants. (Advisers to larger plans may take advantage of the seller’s carve-out.) In addition to entering into a contract with the retirement investor prior to providing investment advice, the adviser and financial institution would have to comply with complicated disclosure and recordkeeping requirements. \nwould allow advisers and financial institutions to buy or sell certain debt securities in a principal transaction with a retirement investor. The debt securities would have to be liquid and have a credit risk that is “no greater than moderate,” and the adviser and financial institution would have to believe that the purchase or sale price is at least as favorable to the retirement investor as that available in a transaction that is not a principal transaction.
