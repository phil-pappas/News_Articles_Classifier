Wood coatings may be formulated using various types of resins such as acrylic amino polyester polyurethane and nitrocellulose. However the market may be broadly classified into four based on coating technologies: solvent-borne water-borne radiation-cure and powder coatings. Wood coatings are used on furniture decking flooring and joinery.\nTechNavio's analysts forecast the wood coatings market in Europe to grow at a CAGR of 5.71% over the period 2014-2019.\nGet More Details on this Report and a Full Table of Contents at \nThe report analyst commented \"Vendors in the chemical industry are making concerted efforts to employ sustainable processes that have minimal impact on the environment. Such activities include the development of eco-friendly products which also help vendors gain a competitive edge. R&D of eco-friendly products is not a new concept in the industry; however the sources used for developing these products provide new dimensions for the growth of vendors. The use of bio-based or renewable monomers such as diols is being explored in UV cured wood coatings for exterior applications.\"\nAccording to the report MDF is a composite panel manufactured by combining wood fiber and resin. Many solvent-borne and water-borne MDF coatings are available in the market. However recent technological advances have made it possible to use powder coating products on MDF. MDF vendors are increasingly opting for thermoset powder coatings over liquid-based alternatives as they offer better durability and design freedom. Additionally life cycle assessment studies have found that powder-coated MDF has a lower carbon and ecological footprint than solvent-borne and water-borne coating systems. Powder-coated MDF products are used in end-use markets such as office furniture institutional furniture and kitchen cabinets.\nFurther the report states that the lack of product focus in the market is hindering the market growth.\nThe key players in the Wood Coatings Market in Europe are Akzo Nobel DAW Jotun PPG Industries Sniezka Tikkurila Oyj and Valspar while other prominent vendors include Benjamin Moore Drywood Coatings Feyco Treffert Helios ICA Group IVM Chemicals KAPCI Coatings Renner RPM International Sherwin-Williams Sirca and Weilburger Coatings\nThe study was conducted using an objective combination of primary and secondary information including inputs from key participants in the industry.
