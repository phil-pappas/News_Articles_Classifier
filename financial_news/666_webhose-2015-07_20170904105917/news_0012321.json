Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) are planning to raise funds through the External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) route in a bid to diversify their funding requirements. Earlier this year, Indiabulls Housing Finance had tapped the market and recently Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) also announced similar plans. Tata Capital Housing Finance and Dewan Housing Finance may also tap the market for the first time this year. ECB is an instrument used by corporates which facilitates access to foreign funds and it includes bank loans, buyers' credit, suppliers' credit, securitised instruments, credit from official export credit agencies and commercial borrowings from the private sector window of multilateral financial institutions. “Yes, we plan ECBs this year, but it would be too early to disclose any further details on the same,” said Harshil Mehta, CEO, DHFL. Similarly, R Vaithianathan, managing director, Tata Capital Housing Finance said that if good opportunities comes up then the company may raise funds through ECB. “This is the first time we are planning to do this. The funds will be deployed in affordable housing projects,” said Vaithianathan. HDFC is set to raise $500 million through ECBs for which it has received the approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In March, Indiabulls Housing Finance had raised $150 million from Qatar National Bank Group under the ECB route for low cost and affordable housing. “There has been a downward trend in pricing and that is making companies go for ECBs. The costs have come down by about 50 basis points in the last one year for well rated borrowers. More than lower costs it is because of diversifying their funding pool. Costs have been coming down because of dearth of supplies,” said an international fund arranger.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:14:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
