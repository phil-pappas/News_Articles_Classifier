It will put serious focus on what these lobbyists are doing in Australia to pervert democracy today.\"\nAn Adani spokeswoman repeated earlier statements that the company had worked positively with five governments of various political persuasions during the past five years.\n\"Any contact in relation to Adani projects with government ministers or officials stringently adheres to the relevant laws and requirements,\" she said.\nMr Menadue, like the Greens, also believes there should be a five-year cooling off before former senior officials and ministers can take roles in industry that have links to their previous job in government.\n\"I think it is a major problem that has to be addressed,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T01:03:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
