The airline’s Athens hub and main base grew 26%, driven by additional frequencies to traditional main source markets.\nOver the past six months, Aegean added 16 new destinations in nine countries as well as increased frequencies to existing destinations.\n“During the first half of 2015—and despite unique challenges—we have proven our resilience and ability to contribute materially and consistently to Greek tourism. Investment in new aircraft, new routes and new services all aimed to expand our ability to compete in quality and efficiency and grow within a challenging environment,” MD Dimitris Gerogiannis said in a statement.\nOver the past three weeks—and since the imposition of capital controls—Aegean was initially faced with a significant loss in net bookings for both domestic and international travel for July onward. The capital controls—in connection with a temporary closing of Greece’s banks—have made it difficult for consumers to access their bank accounts and transfer larger amounts of money. “We responded immediately with fare offerings, despite being in peak season, and with significant cost to our yields. Our effective response, albeit costly, combined with the promise of gradual return to normality evident during the last few days have borne fruit.”\nFor the first half of July, the Star Alliance member achieved a 30% increase in international traffic to Athens, equal to the additional capacity it invested. “Using offers, we have even managed to have marginal growth in domestic traffic, which was even more severely affected. Naturally, further normalization of conditions is required to keep the positive dynamic we now experience,” the airline said.\nOver the past six months, Aegean added seven aircraft to its fleet, including three Airbus A320ceos , which was delivered at the end of June and early July. The three new aircraft deliveries are part of a total seven Airbus aircraft order valued at $300 million, scheduled to be completed by March 2016.\nAegean operates to 134 destinations in 45 countries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T04:21:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
