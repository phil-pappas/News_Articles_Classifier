Nic Walker Share on twitter by Perry Williams Asciano chairman Malcolm Broomhead will hold talks on Friday with investors who are seeking reassurance over Brookfield Infrastructure Group's $9 billion takeover offer for the ports and rail group after one estimate suggested up to half the proposed bid price could be offered in shares.\nBoth Mr Broomhead and Asciano chief executive John Mullen are travelling overseas, but Mr Broomhead has scheduled at least three separate calls with investors on Friday, according to sources, to discuss the potential deal and allay any concerns over the lack of detail within Brookfield's offer.\n\"He's aware that this may have caught investors by surprise, so it's really just a chance to answer any questions and in the absence of a formal bid reiterate the company's strategy going forward,\" one source close to the company said.\nBrookfield, Canada's largest alternative asset manager, lobbed a non-binding cash-and-shares offer on Wednesday valuing Asciano at $9.05 a share, a 36 per cent premium to the $6.65 the company's stock closed at on Tuesday before details of the bid were revealed by Street Talk.\nBrookfield has offered Asciano shareholders units in the US-listed Brookfield Infrastructure Partners fund along with cash, but has yet to specify the value split between the two.\nMacquarie has flagged that the scrip component of the deal could be a major issue for Australian investors.\n\"Our analysis suggests that Brookfield Infrastructure Partners scrip could be as much as 49 per cent of the bid price if BIP were to acquire 100 per cent of Asciano without consortium partners,\" Macquarie said in a research note.\n\"The main issue here would be that Australian investors would be left holding paper in a company with a structure that has long gone out of fashion\" – namely a fund that is externally managing assets such as the rail and ports group, charging a base fee of 1.25 per cent of their market value (including preference shares) without an option for shareholders to end the arrangement.\n UBS analyst Simon Mitchell echoed a similar concern, saying the use of scrip by a foreign company with low liquidity will present a challenge to Asciano investors.\nJakov Males, head of Australian equities at UBS Global Asset Management and an Asciano shareholder, said a rival bidder with a greater cash component may look to pounce now that Brookfield's bid has been made public.\n\"These assets are in play now and I think for this kind of infrastructure there would have been a lot of people sitting and waiting and biding their time,\" said Mr Males. \"So I think there will be interest from other parties and possibly parties that can pay a bigger cash component.\"\nMacquarie has also called for an 80¢-a-share special dividend to be included in any firm bids for Asciano to ensure the company's franking balance does not go to waste.\nMacquarie said Brookfield's proposal would see Asciano placed into a trust, and the franking benefit would be lost to Australian shareholders.\nThe quickest way to rectify that problem would be for Asciano to negotiate a special dividend as part of any offer, which Macquarie said would need to be about 80¢ a share to get the franking balance to zero.\nMorgan Stanley said the 17 per cent lift in Asciano's share price on Wednesday to $7.77 indicates the market is implying a 50 per cent chance of the deal being completed. Asciano shares closed 8c or 1 per cent higher to finish at $7.85 on Thursday.\n\"In addition to risks around deal completion, given the unclear scrip component, we also see the potential for a discount factored in by equity holders with an Australia-specific ownership mandate,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Nick Markiewicz said on Thursday. Funds bound to invest in local shares would have to sell their Asciano shares as they wouldn't be able to hold Brookfield units.\nMr Mitchell also noted the risk to the deal of another bidder emerging for some parts of Asciano's business given the company has been looking for merger partners for its Patrick container terminals business , and has been holding talks with Chinese conglomerate China Merchants over the past year.\nAfter spending some $4 billion improving Asciano's port and rail infrastructure over the past few years, including spending between $500 million and $600 million on the automation and expansion of Port Botany, Mr Mullen said last month he wanted to get strong returns from its investments.\nIt's expected to take Brookfield six to eight weeks to run due diligence on Asciano, and a similar period for Asciano to assess the offer.\nAsciano is capitalised at $6.3 billion while Brookfield Infrastructure Partners has a $US7.2 billion market value.\nGoldman Sachs and Gresham are advising Asciano.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/perrybwilliams"], "published": "2015-07-02T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:09:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
