The remarks come after he and fellow policy maker David Miles said on July 14 that the time was approaching to raise the key interest rate from 0.5 percent, where it’s been since March 2009.\n“With rates markets only fully pricing tightening by the second quarter of next year, the comments should keep the pound under appreciation pressure,” BNP Paribas SA analysts including Steven Saywell, the London-based global head of foreign-exchange strategy, wrote in a note published on Friday. “Our positioning analysis signals that, while rates markets have become more upbeat on the Bank of England, FX investors do not hold a sizable long-pound position.”\nA long investment is one that benefits from the asset’s appreciation.\nThe pound appreciated 0.1 percent to 69.62 pence per euro as of 8:30 a.m. London time, and touched 69.44 pence, the strongest since November 2007. It has climbed 3.3 percent this week, the biggest gain since January 2009. Sterling rose 0.4 percent to $1.5665 on Friday.\nCarney Comments “The decision as to when to start such a process of adjustment will likely come into sharper relief around the turn of this year,” Carney said in a speech on Thursday in Lincoln, England. “The need for bank rate to rise reflects the momentum in the economy and a gradual firming of underlying inflationary pressures.”\nInvestors don’t foresee an increase until May 2016 at the earliest, according to forward contracts based on the sterling overnight index average, or Sonia. That compares with August as recently as last week. Implied yields on short-sterling futures contracts expiring in March 2016 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 0.91 percent, up from 0.83 percent at the end of last week.\nU.K. government bonds were little changed, with benchmark 10-year gilts yielding 2.08 percent. The price of the 5 percent bond due in March 2025 was 125.405 percent of face value.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T10:47:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
