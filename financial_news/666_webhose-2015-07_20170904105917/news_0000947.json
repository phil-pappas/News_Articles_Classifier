One key factor was the entry of Ovo Energy into the league tables for the first time, coming in at number 13 on the list. \nNonetheless, utilities firms still came bottom of the list of 13 industries ranked by the ICS. Its index score came in at 71.4 out of 100 well up on the 69.4 recorded in last July’s survey, and climbing towards 12th-placed telecoms firms, whose index score fell to 71.7. \nAt the other end of the table, non-food retailers saw their score slip from 82.2 to 81.6, while food retailers’ score fell from 80.9 to 79.7. The tourism sector, in third place, also declined a touch from 79.8 to 79.3. \nThe ICS said this shows some businesses are failing to keep up with customers’ rapidly increasing demands for better service. \n\"Customer expectations in the UK have increased for a number of reasons. Consumers have more choice than ever and customer service is a key differentiator where products are broadly similar. In banking for example, where traditionally it was difficult to change providers, new account switching rules mean that people can vote with their feet if they don't like the level of service they receive,” said the Institute’s chief executive Jo Causon. \n\"The increased use of technology, with personalisation and social media means that customers now expect to be able to communicate directly with organisations and there is a demand for immediacy and efficiency when they do so.” \n\"Overall we are seeing the move away from a transactional economy to a relationship economy, where customers expect dialogue, not monologue. The organisations that adjust to this new environment quickest are the ones we see providing the best levels of customer service achieving business success,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T08:26:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
