Low-rise and Class B offices are now commanding rents in the mid- to upper $40s range, while high-rise rents are reaching well past the $90 per square foot range, according to second-quarter research from commercial real estate services firm DTZ . Class B office rents are up 21 percent from last year in the Financial District, 12 percent in the North Station region and 20 percent in South Station, DTZ said. “It’s also worth noting that nearly 25 percent of Boston’s office inventory has traded hands in the past 12 months,” the research report said. Meanwhile, Cambridge also maintained its post as the strongest real estate market in Massachusetts, with $2.2 billion in sales activity. That’s more than half of the overall $4 billion in total sales volume so far this year, according to recently released second-quarter research from JLL (NYSE: JLL). Direct average rents rose more than 5 percent year-over-year in nine out of 12 of Boston’s submarkets, topping out with 16.3 percent growth in East Cambridge, JLL said. Some 80 percent of office tenants were looking to grow their footprints in Greater Boston in the second quarter, with tech tenants comprising 23 percent of large leases across the region, JLL said. The market saw a total of 733,765 square feet of net absorption — or total square footage leased by tenants — in the second quarter, with 1.2 million square feet of space absorbed since the start of the year. Greater Boston’s 164 million-square-foot total inventory is 14.1 percent vacant, the JLL report said. And in the suburbs, office rents closed out the first half of the year at $22.62, up four percent in the past year, DTZ said. As the popularity of mixed-use developments — including Assembly Row in Somerville, Stations Landing in Medford, Market Street in Lynnfield, Northwest Park in Burlington 1265 Main and CityPoint in Waltham and Arsenal Street in Watertown — continues to rise, DTZ expects office rents to follow suit. \nWant Boston Commercial Real Estate news in your inbox?
