Great. Do you even know that that means? \nIt isn't hard to identify mutual funds and fund managers who’ve outperformed the stock indexes in the past. Greg Vigrass, chief executive of Folio Institutional, notes that it's future performance that matters and that it helps to know what market index you're looking at before tracking your fund's progress against it. \n“I think people need to actually understand what it means to 'beat the index,'” Vigrass says. “They look at the S&P 500 or broad market index and say 'I want to beat that.' But are they picking a fund for which that is the correct benchmark?” More Headlines 10 Best Destinations for an Affordable Late-Summer Vacation \nIn essence, don't rely on past performance and gut instinct if you aren't even able to answer the most simple questions about your mutual fund. What index is it pegged to? Over what period of time are you expecting it to beat that index? Are you being realistic in terms of timeframe? What is your tolerance for risk. Yes, you can look at a fund's 3-, 5- or 10-year history and see how it performs in up or down markets, but that isn't the difficult part. \n“What’s hard is identifying those who have the best chance to outperform in the next 10 and 20 years,” says Frank Congemi, an investment advisor in Deerfield Beach, Fla. \nThe first step seem counterintuitive, but involves being a little cheap. With actively managed mutual funds, high-cost funds are worth avoiding. Their fees cut eat into returns over the long term and are placing investors well behind their counterparts who've put their money into cheaper funds. 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T08:45:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
