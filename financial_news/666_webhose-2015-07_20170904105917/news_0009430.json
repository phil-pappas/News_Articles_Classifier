He was misinterpreted for whatever he wrote... And I think at that moment when people are not understanding what a person is saying, it's always good to retract your statement and I think that's what he did ,\" he told PTI.\nPulkit, who shared screen space with Salman in \"Jai Ho\", said the star did not write anything against the judicial system of our country.\n\"But he (Salman) made it very clear that this is what he meant and it wasn't about being against the judiciary because he has faith in the system.\n\"I think what he meant was that if somebody else was getting hanged for the sin done by somebody else, give him an another trial and listen to his plea and just make sure you are not hanging an innocent,\" he added.\nPulkit will be next seen in upcoming comedy satire \"Bangistan\", opposite Riteish Deshmukh.\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nFor more interesting Bollywood news and pictures follow us on Pinterest>>> timesofindia\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on G+ >>> The Times of India Entertainment\nWATCH: Security deployed outside Salman Khan's house - TOI\nPublic Appearances of 49 Salman Khan greets his fans on occasion of Eid in Mumbai, on July 18, 2015.
