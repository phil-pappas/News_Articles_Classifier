says Australia's AAA credit rating is \"premised on our expectation that further progress will soon be made\" on budget repair. by Jacob Greber Mark Ludlow Australia has been put on notice that the government is running out of time to repair the budget through spending cuts or tax hikes without threatening its AAA credit rating.\nNew York-based Standard & Poor's on Friday reaffirmed the top-notch rating, but pointedly cautioned Canberra that further budget reform cannot be delayed indefinitely.\nThe agency's warning landed amid fresh signs the budget will come under additional pressure in coming decades if predictions by Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens that the economy's fundamental growth rate has fallen below 3 per cent from around 3.25 per cent come true.\nIn an assessment just days after a fledgling accord on a broad range of reforms was agreed by federal, state and territory leaders, S&P said there were good signs that momentum appeared to be building for badly needed political compromises.\nHowever, Craig Michaels, the agency's chief ratings analyst for Australia, said the current credit rating is \"premised on our expectation that further progress will soon be made\".\n\"We continue to believe that there is political and community consensus for prudent management of public finances, and we see the current impasse on some budget measures as reflecting disagreement on how this should be achieved,\" he said.\nA cut in the rating could undermine business and consumer confidence, and drive up the cost of servicing the growing burden of federal and state debt.\nFormer Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin suggested that even a small downgrade in economic growth would devastate future tax revenue and drive up welfare payments.\n \"If you reduce growth by a half a per cent it has a massive impact on revenue flows,\" he told AFR Weekend . \"Tax collections drop, spending outlays go up because governments have to do more spending on the transfer side.\n\"Small changes in growth rates can have large effects over a decade.\"\nIn a landmark speech on Wednesday , Mr Stevens echoed concerns often heard around the world's advanced nations that potential economic growth rates have been cut because of weak productivity, aging populations and softening income growth.\nWarning on falling asset prices\n\"Bad productivity and falling real wages don't make for strong economic growth,\" said economist and former Labor minister Craig Emerson, who said he worries that a future of lower economic growth is likely to push more retirees and savers into ever-riskier financial assets such as shares and negatively-geared housing in Sydney.\n\"The Reserve bank is really warning that this [low-growth environment] is setting savers up for a really big fall,\" Dr Emerson said. \"Because if those asset prices fall, which they inevitably will, they will lose a lot of their capital.\"\nS&P's warning also comes as the government's independent reform adviser, Productivity Commission chairman Peter Harris, said Australians should expect national income growth at half the level enjoyed over the past 50 years.\n\"There's good evidence … that a secular slowdown in productivity has occurred over the last decade,\" he wrote in an article for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\nDr Harris said depending on how quickly baby boomers retire, there is likely to be a thirty-year decline in workforce participation – another drag on productivity.\n\"Of course, some of us will still prosper,\" he said. \"There will be some income growth, but it's likely that more of us can't expect to enjoy rising real incomes.\n\"And the competition for a share of our slower-growing wealth could be a corrosive social issue if poorly handled.\"\nDr Harris urged the government to show leadership on productivity reform. \"If it chooses inaction, there's an implicit signal that all will be right, eventually.\n\"But the nature of the challenges listed above – lifting productivity, improving our terms of trade and addressing the issue of our aging population – suggest there's a vital role for government.\"\nInterest rate cuts not the answer\nProfessor McKibbin, who is based at the Australian National University, reiterated his criticism of investors and policy makers who believe further interest rate cuts will solve the economy's problems.\nHe said the Reserve Bank's interest rate cuts are the result of governments failing to stoke productivity.\n\"Australia's monetary policy stance is a stance of last resort,\" he said. Glenn Stevens has been cutting interest rates \"not because he wants to but because he needs to bridge the gap between the commodities boom bursting and the next cycle\".\n\"But you need structural reform to make that a sustained bridge. Policy makers haven't done that, governments haven't done that, the opposition hasn't done that.\"\nS&P, in its annual review of Australia's rating, highlighted how growth prospects, prosperity and the credit rating are exposed to a growing dependence on trade with China.\n\"If demand for Australia's resources were to weaken sharply, a range of disorderly dislocations in the economy could occur, including in its labour and property markets.\n\"However, so long as robust demand for its commodities continues, we believe Australia's economic prospects over the forecast period will remain favourable.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T13:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:04:40.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
