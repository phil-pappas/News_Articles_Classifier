With the U.S. Justice Department investigating possible collusion among domestic carriers, “there was some uncertainty whether they would still be communicated.”\nThe Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index jumped as much as 4.2 percent, the biggest intraday advance since May 7, following American’s seat-cut announcement. Investors have been urging carriers to curb seating-capacity expansion as average fares fall, and Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. said last month they were reviewing their plans.\nAmerican said its U.S. capacity will expand 1 percent to 2 percent, down from an original forecast of as much as 3 percent. The change pares global expansion to 1 percent in 2015, down from an already-lowered April estimate of 2 percent.\n“This is the first ‘official’ reduction by a major airline and should be well received,” Helane Becker, a Cowen & Co. analyst, said in a note to clients.\nBusiness Fares Fares on last-minute flights -- typically a rough measure of business travel -- have declined recently, carriers have said. Offering fewer seats helps airlines match their supply to travel demand, strengthening pricing power.\nWhile analysts have lamented a surge in airline-seating capacity this year that’s outstripping U.S. economic growth, the Justice Department said last week it’s investigating whether carriers are colluding on plans to curb growth.\nAll 11 carriers in the Bloomberg index climbed, a boost for a gauge that tumbled 18 percent this year through Thursday. Fort Worth, Texas-based American rose 3.7 percent to $41.12 at 1:33 p.m. in New York.\nAmerican said second-quarter passenger revenue from each seat flown a mile fell 6 percent to 8 percent, in line with its forecasts, and that pretax margin excluding special items will be 16 percent to 18 percent.\nAt an investor conference last month, Delta President Ed Bastian said the carrier was reviewing domestic growth plans with a “bias” toward a reduction. Chicago-based United said it was looking “very closely” at seating and flight plans for after the summer travel season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T20:37:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
