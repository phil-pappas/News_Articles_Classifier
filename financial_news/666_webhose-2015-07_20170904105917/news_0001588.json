It said no but my premium doubled' By Sophie Christie | Telegraph – 44 minutes ago 33.59 +0.17 \nA reader ended up paying more for his home insurance even though he was told that fallen trees weren't covered \nWhile John Chaundy and his wife Christine were on a sailing holiday in Malaysia earlier this year, two large trees at the bottom of their garden, about 100 feet from the house, blew over. \nAfter skimming through his policy papers, Mr Chaundy couldn't determine whether the removal of the fallen trees would be covered by his buildings and contents insurer, RAC (Taiwan OTC: 2237.TWO - news ) . So, using the insurer's \"claims helpline\", which provides \"help and advice\" to customers, Mr Chaundy asked whether the removal of the trees would be covered. \nThe operator said it was unlikely, but that he would check. There was no mention that, whatever the outcome, the \"claim\" would be recorded as a \"loss\", Mr Chaundy said. \nA letter from RAC received shortly after the phone call confirmed that \"as the fallen tree or branch has not damaged your building, we are unable to assist you on this occasion\". Mr Chaundy assumed that as the claim was outside the scope of his policy, as the RAC had confirmed, there would be no \"loss\" recorded against his policy. \n• Martin Lewis: my system for getting the cheapest home insurance \n• ' Insurer tried to halve our £128k payout then insisted on receipts' \nHe said: \"I thought that this was the end of the matter and did not query the use of the word 'claim' on the letter as being more than an office administrative reference. No mention was made that although the fallen trees were not covered, the incident would be recorded as a loss. \n\"In fact, there was no financial loss either to the insurers or to ourselves. In due course a friend and I used our chainsaw to cut up the trees. Branches were burnt on our land and we are using the logs for our wood burner, so you could in fact say there was a gain.\" \nBut the couple, who live in Lymington, Hampshire, became concerned about the \"claim\" when they tried to find out their renewal premium. They were told by the RAC that there was a delay as the underwriter, RSA, was still considering a renewal quote because of the recorded \"loss\" on their account. \nMeanwhile, they sought comparable insurance elsewhere. One insurer initially quoted £200 a year for home cover, but after the couple disclosed that there was a claim on their record, and that it was recorded as a loss, the insurer doubled the premium to a little more than £400 a year. The couple reluctantly accepted the offer. \nMr Chaundy complained to the RAC that he was not told that his initial query about the removal of the trees in his garden could result in a loss claim being put against his name, and he went to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) for a final ruling. \nBut it rejected the complaint, stating: \"RSA has acted reasonably by recording the claim you made as a loss against your policy and by not recording it on any external databases.\" \nInsurers typically use a central database, the Claims & Underwriting Exchange (Cue), to record claims in order to prevent fraud and non-disclosure. The FOS said RSA had confirmed that Mr Chaundy's claim/loss had not been recorded on any external database so it should not affect his ability to get insurance in future. \nIt continued: \"However, you should always answer any questions posed by an insurer to the best of your knowledge and most now want to know about incidents, losses and claims as well as anything which may or may not have given rise to a claim. \n\"This does not necessarily mean it will be taken into account when calculating the premium but this will vary from insurer to insurer.\" \nA spokesman for the RAC said: \"As a general rule of insurance, the more claims made by a customer, the higher their risk profile, which in turn can lead to a higher premium. However, some insurers we work with also look at whether notifications of loss have been made, even if these have not led to a claim. \n\"For some insurers, a notification of an incident may negatively affect a customer’s risk profile as they may be deemed more likely to make a claim in the future. As Mr Chaundy informed us of the fallen trees in his garden, his insurer believed a similar event might happen again. This may be one reason for the increase in his premium.” \nEarlier this month, Telegraph Money reported that a couple from Edinburgh had had their insurance premium raised simply as a result of asking their insurer, Direct Line, about replacing a damaged door panel in their property. \nGraeme Trudgill of the British Insurance Brokers’ Association said: “Different Insurers have different approaches to claims and notifications. But where nothing was ever claimed an insurance broker will be able to find many insurers who would not penalise a customer for a mere notification that was never claimed for.” \n• Get the best of Telegraph Money on Facebook , Twitter (Swiss: TWTR.SW - news ) and in our weekly newsletter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T14:20:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
