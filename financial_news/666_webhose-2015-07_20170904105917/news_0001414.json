Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! KOLKATA: Bandhan Bank has roped in former chief economic advisor to the finance ministry Ashok Kumar Lahiri to head its 10-member board and stuffed as many as four former top bank executives in the board aiming to raise its stake in the bottom of the pyramid customers even as the established ones from State Bank of India and ICICI Bank are in a race to have more customers from the unbanked population. Chandra Shekhar Ghosh , the founder of Bandhan Financial Services which started as a mirco finance institution in 2001, will be the managing director and chief executive officer of the bank. \"We have selected board members who have knowledge and experience in grassroot banking,\" Ghosh said Thursday after announcing the formation of the board and unveiling a logo designed by Ogilvy. \"Our primary focus will be the eastern region where banking penetration is still poor,\" Ghosh said. The members of the board are Bhaskar Sen, former chairman and managing director of United Bank of India , and B Sambamurthy, former chief of Corporation Bank . The board gets representation from private banks as well: Axis Bank's former deputy managing director SK Chakrabarti and former executive director Snehomoy Bhattacharya have joined as directors. The bank will be formally unveiled on August 23 in Kolkata by President Pranab Mukherjee . The company has 67 lakh micro finance borrowers at present and the accounts will be transferred to the bank. The bank would start its journey with a Rs 10000-crore strong loan book. Ghosh said multilateral financier International Finance Corporation and the Singapore government-backed GIC would invest Rs 500 crore between them directly in Bandhan Bank before it starts operation on August 23, taking the networth to Rs 3,200 crore. ET was first to report it on its June 19 edition. GIC, IFC and Small Industries Development Bank of India invested Rs 1,020 crore in the Bandhan Financial Holding Company - the bank will be under it following Reserve Bank of India rules - in May. Ghosh said that Bandhan Bank would provide four basic services to start with - deposit, credit, insurance and remittance. It is yet to finalise its insurance partners. About 64% of its proposed 600 branches will be in the rural locations.
