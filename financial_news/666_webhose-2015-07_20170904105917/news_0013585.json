Prices of metallurgical coal have been undermined by excess supply and slowing demand from China.\nWilliam Stanhouse, a spokesman for Birmingham, Alabama-based Walter, declined to comment.\nThe creditors also are offering to back a loan that would fund the company’s operations during bankruptcy proceedings, the people said. Creditors would ask for union support of their plan in exchange for the financing, known as a debtor-in-possession loan.\nThe senior lenders want Walter to file for bankruptcy by July 15, when the grace period on a $19 million interest payment due to junior bondholders ends, the people said. The company elected to miss the June 15 interest payment as it negotiates with creditors, it said last month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T02:56:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
