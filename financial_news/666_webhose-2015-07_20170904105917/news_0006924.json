\nIn Brussels, the EU source said on Friday \"there has been positive evaluation of the Greek programme\". \nThe EU's bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, was ready to consider putting up 58 billion euros, plus 16 billion euros from the International Monetary Fund, for what would be a third Greek debt rescue since 2010, the source said. \nThe latest plan seems to have brought Athens closer to sealing a deal to save it crashing out of the euro, but it will face opposition in Brussels where some eurozone nations fear Greece could turn into a black hole for any new loans. \nThe Greek proposals also fail to meet international demands on some thorny issues, including tax breaks for its islands and cuts to military spending. \nSpeaking ahead of an EU summit called Sunday for a final decision, Tsipras admitted mistakes had been made but insisted the new proposals were the best possible deal for Greece. \n\"The loan deal... entails many proposals that are far from our pledges, from what we feel is right for the recovery of the economy,\" he said. \nStill, the premier said it was \"marginally better\" than proposals put forward by the creditors last month that did not offer relief from Greece's suffocating 320-billion-euro mountain of debt. \nSunday's EU summit comes a week after Greeks decisively rejected creditor demands for more austerity in return for fresh EU-IMF bailout funds in a historic public referendum. \n- Euro, markets soar - \nEarlier, France and Italy welcomed the new proposals, with French President Francois Hollande calling them \"serious and credible\" while cautioning that \"nothing is decided yet\". \nItalian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi declared himself \"more optimistic\" that a deal would be done. \nBut Germany said the outcome of this weekend's crisis talks was \"completely open\". \nBerlin leads a bloc of hardline eurozone nations saying that, after two bailouts over the past five years totalling 240 billion euros, and 107 billion euros in debt forgiveness in 2012, Greece is looking like a bottomless money pit. \nThe possibility of a breakthrough sent stock markets soaring in Europe, Asia and the US on Friday, while the euro briefly rose above $1.12 for the first time in July. \nAlthough Greek voters last Sunday roundly voted \"No\" to accepting tough austerity terms for a bailout that expired June 30, they are alarmed at capital controls that have closed banks and rationed cash at ATMs. \nSome 8,000 people gathered in Athens ahead of the parliamentary vote on Friday to protest against more austerity, police said, although most overwhelmingly want to keep the euro. \n\"The government has to find a deal with its European partners no matter what. We didn't vote 'No' to leave the eurozone,\" said a pensioner in Athens, Nikos Eftekidis. \nBut another pensioner, Giorgos, said the \"government's proposed measures are very tough, I wasn't expecting that\". \n\"That's not what the Greeks voted for.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T10:23:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
