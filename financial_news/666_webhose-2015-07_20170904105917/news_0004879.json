Photo: Peter Braig\nThe hotel and accommodation sector has thrown down the gauntlet to governments at all levels – federal, state and local – to formulate a new regulatory framework to protect the interests of guests and property owners in the wake of the growth of the \"share\" economy.\nThis is now being generalised under the Airbnb banner, which is not in the sights of the hotel sector, but rather the hotel operators believe it is much more extensive, with investors buying up \"bundles\" of apartments and then letting them out as short-term accommodation.\nOnce more than two or three apartments are used in this manner, it is seen as a commercial enterprise, which the hotel industry says needs to become more regulated.\nRenting out an apartment for a short time is different from renting out many under the one name. Hotels have strict guidelines such as fire doors, disability access and the appropriate insurance, among many others, that are not required for apartments. To lump a lot of apartments together and rent them as hotels, flies under the radar of the appropriate rules.\nAdvertisement Tourism Accommodation Australia (TAA) believes the recent ruling by Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT), which found owners' corporation (OC) rules prohibiting the practice were invalid, ignores the numerous issues involved with allowing unregulated short-term accommodation.\nIn particular, TAA believes landlords proposing to offer rooms or apartments for short-term rental should meet guidelines relating to health and safety requirements for their guests. They also need to have adequate liability insurance, pay appropriate taxes and council charges, and need to be compliant with building codes and strata management regulations.\nThe TAA has made a submission to the federal opposition's discussion paper Sharing the Future, saying property owners in apartment blocks should not have to bear the dangers and costs that come with other owners conducting a commercial short-stay business when the body-corporate agreements state that such arrangements are not permitted.\nTAA acting chief executive Carol Giuseppi said turning apartment blocks into quasi-hotels when they are not designed for such uses needs to be regulated to ensure the interests of guests and owners are properly addressed.\n\"We are not looking at individual apartment rentals or Airbnb-style accommodation, but we are concerned when there are many flats bundled together and rented as short -erm accommodation which become a commercial enterprise,\" Ms Giuseppi said.\n\"We want to see a transparency of supply and see if we can get a standard around the legislation.\"\nIn the submission, the TAA says the uncertainty that has resulted from the VCAT ruling means it is essential that governments address the issue and establish a new framework that requires registration by potential short-term accommodation providers based on them meeting specified health, safety, tax, insurance and regulatory requirements.\n\"There is a major difference between an individual letting out a room in a house to a fully commercialised operation involving renting out apartments as a business,\" the submission says.\n\"TAA is not seeking to prevent the short-term letting of a room by an individual, if this is controlled, but to prevent the commercialisation of this activity.\"\nIn order to address this, TAA recommends the introduction of model legislation agreed by state, territory and Commonwealth governments, and that this model legislation requires the registration of premises that are used for commercial short-stay accommodation but are not meeting a range of health, safety, tax and regulatory requirements.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-18T07:34:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
