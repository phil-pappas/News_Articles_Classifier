Reuters by Matthew Stevens BHP Billiton's second round of US onshore gas writedowns and a further serious pruning of its annual capital allocation to shale drilling can be filed securely in Andrew Mackenzie's shrinking to greatness file.\nBHP's confirmation of the $US2.8 billion ($3.7 billion) impairment taken against the gassy parts of a key member of its US onshore share family carried with it discretely camouflaged evidence of the Global Australian's very long-term retreat from the unconventional petroleum business.\nOver recent time both BHP CEO Mackenzie and his petroleum president Tim Cutt have publicly seeded expectations of this strategic shift in indicating that the US onshore shale game might well be just a 20 year phenomenon for BHP.\nThis shared conclusion is based on the increasingly obvious ubiquity of fabulously productive gassy shales in the US and on a belief that the combination of geology, infrastructure and markets that have shaped the US shale story are unavailable anywhere else in the world outside of Russia. And BHP is simply not prepared to punt on anything Russia.\nFor all that BHP might want to deny it, the fact that the Hawkville shale accounts for the \"substantially majority\" of this second batch of onshore impairments is informative of a significant change in long-term strategic priorities.\nThis is the first impairment taken on anything acquired in this defining second-step of BHP's $US30 billion (and counting) plunge into US shale. It brings the total impairments taken so far against US onshore to $US5.84 billion and just about every dollar of these charges have been taken against BHP's gassier fields.\nThe Hawkville arrived as one of the four shale plums that justified BHP's $US12.1 billion Petrohawk acquisition in 2011. It sits just to the west of the best of the Petrohawk plays, a collection of tenements in the liquids-rich Eagle Ford, and just to the east of the future of BHP's shale program, a pair of plays in the Permian shale the dusty fringes of West Texas.\nUnlike other prospects in the Petrohawk portfolio, Hawkville is essentially a gas play. Its liquids production is limited to liquid natural gas and it arrives at volumes far lower than the gassier parts of the Eagle Ford or the Permian.\n BHP's narrative is that the Hawkville impairments are more specific than macro, that they are the product of a slightly disappointing appraisal program and some very particular landowner obligations. Apparently the appraisal drilling suggests that some corners of BHP's Hawkville are not as productive as had been anticipated while the carrying costs of the acreage in question has been made higher by the fact that Hawkville licences carry continuous drilling obligations. This means simply that comparatively more capital has been deployed to retain the ground but that, in the end, the geology has not returned BHP's confidence.\nThe context here is that BHP's rights in other regions do not carry similar drilling obligations. So, for example, it can withdraw rigs from its dry gas prospects in Louisiana without risking tenure just as it can slow progress in the liquids rich Permian of West Texas without pain.\nBut whatever the specifics of the Hawkville are, the shaping generalities of US and global oil and gas markets are unavoidable in any sensible assessment of BHP's changed circumstances. To be very blunt, this was not how BHP's shale investment was supposed to go. BHP does not spend $US15 billion acquiring a production footprint and then devote a further $US15 billion or so in sustaining and growth capital on what might prove to be a 20 year business. The horizons of BHP's pillars are supposed to be a good deal more inter-generational than that.\nSo what's changed? So what has changed between BHP's 2011 embrace of the shale revolution and now? Well, the deflating devils here are, to some degree, exposed in Wednesday's detail.\nFor example, having signalled necessarily the board's sign-off on these impairments BHP provided, with no particular context, an oil and gas price deck that implies it will struggle to meet a promise of long-standing that the onshore business would be cash flow positive by the end of the next financial year.\nBHP noted that it needed an oil price of $US60 a barrel and a gas price of $US3 a unit to be cash flow positive, as promised by the end of FY16. Right now the US oil price is circling $US53 a barrel and gas is pouring into the market at $US2.80 or so. And there is very little on the horizon that says we should hope for anything much better. The return of Iran to the mainstream of the international oil trade has been received as a medium term negative for the oil price while the Saudi's have embraced their new world of open markets with increasing alacrity and continue to steadily increase production.\nThe other thing that is now driving the onshore business to the point that it can support itself is a massively trimmed capital program. It is far easier to be self-sustaining when you spend less.\nOver its first two years on the shale frontier, BHP threw better than $US5 billion annually at drilling and installing new processing and delivery infrastructure. That was supposed to drift to more sustainable $US4 billion annually over the longer haul. But the FY16 capex number has been trimmed to $US1.5 billion. And pretty much all of that is being allocated to the liquids-rich targets.\nBHP will operate 10 rigs through FY16. Six of them will walk their way around sites in the Eagle Ford while three more will march their way around the Permian. The Hawkville will host the final rig and it will be work on only wet gas targets. Once again, there will be no new wells drilled in BHP's bits of Louisiana. There BHP's dry gas resources are being locked-in to wait a better day.\nLooked at through a rosy prism, this is illustrative of the differentiating strength of BHP's petroleum business. Unlike its minerals and metals operations, petroleum can be managed pro-cyclically. Which means that, in US onshore petroleum at least, BHP can find itself comfortably aligned with Ivan Glasenberg. Shale production can, and is, being turned on and off to meet price signals that reflects short and long term demand curves. And that is why impairments of BHP's gas-heavy Hawkville shale play will come as not particularly surprising to the informed market.\nBut there is another more structural way to look at all of this and the view from there is far less encouraging.\nBHP is sitting on a whole lot of the most productive gas shales in the US. While there have been dramatic improvements in productivity across the shale business, the irresistible mathematics of shale mean that if you are not drilling then you are retreating. But BHP is not drilling for gas so it is not replacing production. It is not drilling for gas because current and forecast future gas pricing mean that onshore gas is not competitive in BHP's internal race for capital.\nThe $US30 billion question, then, is whether the ubiquity of US shale supply locks gas into current levels of marginal pricing over the longer term. If it does, then gas will be permanently cheap and its extraction and sale to the US domestic market would seem to hold very little attraction for BHP. If that is the case, the original investment case for shale simply has, all too quickly, failed the test of time.\nRBC not RBSâ€¦ Doh!
