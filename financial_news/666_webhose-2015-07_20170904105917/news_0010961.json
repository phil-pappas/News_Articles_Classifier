Nic Walker Share on twitter by Jacob Greber China's positive influence on the Australian economy appears to have officially peaked, say economists who caution that the lack of alternative drivers of growth escalates the need for an urgent rethink about making companies and workers more competitive.\nAustralian Bureau of Statistics figures showed on Thursday that the trade deficit narrowed in May to $2.8 billion from a record $4.1 billion.\nWhile initially seen as an improvement, the numbers confirmed an ongoing decline in the dollar value of shipments abroad of resources, particularly to Australia's biggest trade partner.\nExports of iron ore and coal to China peaked at a record 6.8 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2013, and have since fallen to around 4.8 per cent, according to Barclays economist Kieran Davies.\nMr Davies said the share still makes Australia the Western country most exposed to China.\n\"But the influence has likely peaked and we think the share could edge lower as export prices fall further,\" he said.\nThe trade numbers are the latest in a spate of poor economic data over recent days, which includes evidence of an accelerating contraction in the manufacturing industry.\nMany economists are increasingly forecasting further Reserve Bank of Australia interest rate cuts unless sectors such as services can help fill the gap left by falling resources income.\n A study by ANZ Bank economists led by Jo Masters and Justin Fabo predicts the nation's real national income per capita will fall for a fourth straight year in 2015, the worst performance since the early 1990s recession.\nWith resources accounting for around 50 per cent of total exports, Australia has been left exposed to the vagaries of commodity price swings, they warned.\n\"An economic challenge is to broaden the export base and exploit Australia's proximity to the fast-growing markets of Asia,\" they said.\nHowever, they indicated the current structure of the economy made it less diverse and less complex than most other advanced economies, and on par with nations such as Trinidad, Kenya, Chile and Zimbabwe.\nThe spectre of renewed concern about Australia's narrowing economic base, which will revive memories of Paul Keating's famous 1986 \"banana republic\" statement, was echoed by Andrew Charlton, the former economic adviser to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and director of consultancy AlphaBeta.\nIn a report published on Thursday, Dr Charlton calculated that the dominance of exports over the rest of the economy is almost unique among developed economies, with Nepal and Tanzania enjoying greater diversity.\n\"Is Australia still a developed country? Of course we are,\" he said. \"We have one of the highest per-capita income levels in the world.\n\"But it should be very concerning that, measured by our export base, we have more in common with the banana republics than the high-income countries.\"\nDr Charlton warned that for a decade, Australian governments have been operating on the assumption that once the mining boom passed, low interest rates and falling dollar would be enough to revive non-mining sectors from their graves.\n\"Unfortunately no such resurrection is occurring,\" he said.\nThe remarks came as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry lashed out at a Grattan Institute call for the government to redouble its efforts at budget repair.\nJohn Osborn, ACCI's director of economics, defended the government's decision to slow the pace of budget repair, saying calls to raise taxes are misguided and would damage economic growth and productivity.\n\"Taxes as a share of the economy are already rising each year and exacerbating the problem will make it harder to kickstart growth,\" he said.\n\"The reality is that Australia will only return to higher long-run growth rates or better if we break the reform paralysis and secure necessary changes to tax, workplace relations and red tape.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-02T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T00:59:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
