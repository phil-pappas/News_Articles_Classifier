ROBERTSON Published: 7/5/15 10:00 am EDT - Updated: 7/5/15 10:04 am EDT \nRALEIGH, North Carolina â€” Republicans at the General Assembly who once soured upon a foundation that used to get half of North Carolina's national tobacco settlement money may be coming around to embrace it, or at least accept it. \nThe Senate budget the chamber approved last month would give $20 million annually to the Golden LEAF Foundation after two years in which it received nothing. \nKey GOP lawmakers at the Legislature had been skeptical of the foundation's effectiveness, especially when largely under control of Democratic appointees. \nSen. Brent Jackson of Sampson County is a top budget-writer. He says Golden LEAF has done a good job helping rural North Carolina for the most part. \nThe House didn't provide funds to Golden LEAF. The two chambers will have to work out that budget difference. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T17:35:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
