Bobby Jindal's administration has so far interpreted the new law in industry-friendly terms. \nThe association's president Will French says he hopes to have the law amended before the cap is reached. \nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T19:51:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
