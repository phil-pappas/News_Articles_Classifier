Each kiosk stocks around 2,000 items made from sterling silver. \nThe company, which targets the affordable luxury market, competes with expanding rivals Danish firm Pandora (Copenhagen: PNDORA.CO - news ) and Germany’s Thomas Sabo. \nThe Tel Aviv-based company will join a growing list of Israeli enterprises floating on London’s markets including digital advertising firms Matomy Media and Marimedia (LSE: MARI.L - news ) and trading site Plus500 (Stuttgart: P55.SG - news ) . \nThe company is currently owned by Israeli private equity firm Markstone, which last year was forced to tap investors for an additional $81m (£50m) to survive. Markstone used the cash call to pay off the debts in its other portfolio companies in order to keep Magnolia in its hands. \nMagnolia has kiosks in busy shopping centres \nA spokesman said that Markstone was not using the listing process to cash out and the new money raised would be used to grow the company. The private equity firm will also be prevented from selling shares for at least a year after listing. \nMagnolia is being advised by boutique firm Spark Advisory Partners while Daniel Stewart is its broker. \nThe jeweller reported sales of $57m (£36m) last year, gross profits of $36m and $5m in adjusted earnings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-11T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T22:50:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
