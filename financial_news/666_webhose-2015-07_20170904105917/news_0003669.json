Here's how Use your key for the next article Turning influencers into brand ambassadors Flickr, Creative Commons: photo by Scott Beale / Laughing Squid \nMost startups have limited budget assigned to promote their brand using above the line advertising strategies like using TV, get celebrity endorsements or use print media like newspapers. One of the increasingly successful ways to do advertising aside from social media is to tap into the influencers . \nInfluencers generate awareness for startups, according to Roxanne Varza, editor in chief for TechCrunch France. They can also boost sales of the startups, A survey from Burst Media revealed that companies received $6.85 in media value for every $1 they spend of influencer marketing . That’s quite a nice cost-per-user acquisition. \nIf your target market involves millennials and stay at home moms, their influencers are people they look up to and they make spending decisions based on what their influencers recommend. These influencers are often bloggers and mini (social) celebrities. They have high social media following and getting these influencers on your side can be a great way to generate awareness and interest in your startup. \nMalcolm Gladwell, described mavens in his best selling book, The Tipping Point , as those who are considered as influencers and experts in their respective fields. People who are influenced by these mavens often buy the product or service their favorite mavens recommend. \n1. Research \nOne way to be successful in influencer marketing is to actually spend most of the time on research. Find the most relevant people to help promote your business. It should be someone whose image and values are aligned with your business. These influencers should also genuinely believe in your business and will want to promote it themselves, even without any monetary compensation. \nFor example, Shoes of Prey wanted to scale up their growth using microinfluencers in 2010. Instead of using celebrities, they partnered with 16-year-old beauty blogger, Blair Fowler. With their great campaign on YouTube, the company has dramatically seen 300% increase in sales ! \n2. Develop great relationship with the influencers Once the relevant influencers are identified, the next best step is to plan on how to engage with them and develop good relationship with them. Think of a marketing plan that’s beneficial partnership for both your business and its prospective brand influencers. Ask them how they can work with your startup. Would they want to invest in it personally? Will the arrangement be a series of campaigns to promote the business? If they like you and your startup, they will passionately promote your brand and influence their followers to avail your product and service. \n3. Turn them into brand ambassadors In 2014, startup travel and lifestyle company website, Adventure.com, tapped into their twitter followers to freelance photojournalists that eventually became their community ambassadors. \n4. Track your campaign's success \nMake sure your startup can track how successful were the influencers in generating sales for you and improving awareness. These numbers can also include your social media profiles. Did it receive a spike after getting your target influencers to your side? \n4. Remain ethical \nFinally, remain ethical. Make sure full disclosures are done when you work with influencers as these people have their integrity and popularity to protect. By kickstarting an authentic and genuine relationship with influencers, they will not only help boost your company’s traffic and sales, but also provide as a great example on the power of technology on how it could bring community together towards a common goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T13:39:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
