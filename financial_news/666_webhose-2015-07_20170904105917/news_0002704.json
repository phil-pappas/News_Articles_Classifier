David Rowe Share on twitter by Tony Boyd When Australia's 2015 profit reporting season starts in about three weeks time, most of the large listed companies in the United States will have already reported their June quarter numbers.\nSome of the largest companies in the Western world will have had no difficulty providing investors with accurate financial performance numbers within a few weeks of having ruling off their books.\nAnd yet the largest companies listed on the ASX will struggle to get the earnings numbers out by the end of August.\nIs it not time for Australia to drag itself out of the dark ages of disclosure and adopt quarterly reporting? Whenever this suggestion has been made in the past it has been greeted with a barrage of negative comments. That is sure to happen again.\nThe critics will say quarterly reporting is bad because it encourages short-term thinking. The three-monthly numbers are seen as a gift for hedge funds trying to profit from disaster or fuel for high-frequency traders making a 1Â¢-a-share turn on stocks within the narrow window between 10 am and 4 pm.\nQuarterly reporting is allegedly an insidious force that infects boards of directors and encourages them to abandon long-term thinking. The critics abhor the increased costs involved in meeting the global benchmark for judging a company's performance. It is claimed that making financial data available every three months instead of every six months will overload the back office and somehow harm the efficient running of companies.\nWhen Chanticleer put the idea of quarterly reporting to the CEO of an Australian bank this week he was horrified.\nBut when pushed he admitted his bank already provides extensive quarterly financial data to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. It publishes the information in Pillar disclosure documents. APRA also publishes loan data every month.\n The bank CEO admitted he gets daily updates on movements in the bank's loan book and deposits. He knows the financial performance of each division thanks to flash reports received four to five business days after the end of each month.\nKeeping up with the miners Australia's big four banks are now in the habit of providing quarterly trading updates in between their six-monthly financial reports.\nThe mining industry has been used to quarterly reporting for decades. Three monthly numbers are the norm in that industry. That was forced on the industry after many scandals.\nWhen South32 was spun out of BHP Billiton there was never any consideration of abandoning quarterly financial reporting.\nSouth32 is listed in Australia, South Africa and London. London investors have been big sellers of South32 stock but they would have kicked up a stink if the company had abandoned best practice in financial reporting.\nCompanies in the States are in the habit of providing quarterly data. That pattern of behaviour has not stopped the US from having some of the most thoughtful long term investors in the world.\nWarren Buffett is one of many investment gurus who invests for the long term both in terms of equity portfolio investment and at the board level of companies he owns such as reinsurance group, Gen Re.\nVolatility in financial markets and rapidly changing market structures are good reasons why institutional and retail investors should be given more frequent dumps of financial data from companies.\nThink about the impact of digital disruption and it inevitably leads to the conclusion that investors should have the most up to date financial data.\nTwo good examples of the intersection between digital disruption and financial disclosure can be seen in the recent announcements by Nine Entertainment Corp and Flight Centre. Both companies made unexpected market announcements about their financial performance in June.\nStructural decline The market has concluded Flight Centre and Nine are both experiencing a structural decline in their respective industries. It is not clear that quarterly reporting by both companies in April would have made any difference but it is possible the market would have had a feel for the momentum in the businesses.\nWhile US companies prepare to brief the market next week for the second time since February, Australian investors are forced to wait until the middle or end of August to hear from companies which have not said anything since February.\nMany leading companies are using the six-month period between results as an opportunity for strategic updates. These strategy days are incredibly useful but they lack up to date financial information. That often leads to the painful cut and thrust between analysts and managers as some of the best minds on the sell side try to pin down squirming chief financial officers.\nIn some sectors of the market there has been a backlash against quarterly disclosure even though it was found to be worthwhile and price sensitive.\nIn retail, it was standard practice for every major retailer to release quarterly sales data but gradually over time companies stopped doing it.\nFunds deliver Whenever Chanticleer writes up a fund manager in a positive way the emails come flooding in claiming it was a puff piece and not worthy of this column's 40-year heritage of scepticism towards all things. It is, therefore, pleasing to report that two fund managers Quote: d on more than one occasion over the past year are delivering what they promised.\nAlex Pollak, who manages the Loftus Peak Global Change portfolio, has just delivered a return of 29.33 per cent before management and performance fees for the year to July 1.\nThe fund outperformed its benchmark, the MSCI AC World Net Total Return Index in Australian dollars, by 6.2 per cent. Its top five stocks are Apple, Google, Comcast, Amazon and Gilead.\nOver at Morphic Asset Management, Jack Lowenstein has just released performance numbers for the Morphic Global Opportunities Fund. It delivered a return of 14 per cent in the 12 months to June 30 after fees.\nThe long short fund beats its index, the MSCI AC World Net Total Return Index in Australian dollars, by 1.9 per cent. Both funds benefited from the tailwinds of the falling Australian dollar. But the core message is that investing offshore can deliver higher returns than the domestic market.\nTONY BOYD\nTwitter: TonyBoydAFR\ntony.boyd@afr.com.au", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TonyBoydAFR"], "published": "2015-07-10T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-11T02:09:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
