The index had fallen as much as 8.20 percent in morning trading. \nThe Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, slid 3.88 percent, or 74.99 points, to 1,857.84. It fell as much as 4.20 percent in morning trade. \n\"Selling of blue chips dragged down the Shanghai market this morning,\" Zheshang Securities analyst Zhang Yanbing told AFP. \n\"Investors started selling heavyweight blue chips as there is no liquidity left in the small company stocks, which means there are very few of these companies they can sell,\" he said. \nThe latest falls came despite the government announcing new measures to support the market, including allowing insurance companies to invest more assets in stocks and a programme to buy the shares of smaller companies. \nIn Hong Kong, equities plunged 4.74 percent in the first few minutes of trade, tracking Shanghai's losses and on fears about Greece's future in the eurozone. \n\"China's stock market rout is now spreading to other financial markets, creating a sweeping sense of panic and liquidity crunch,\" said Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co. \nChinese insurance companies will be able to invest up to 10 percent of their assets in a single \"blue chip\" stock, up from the previous five percent, the official Xinhua news agency said. \nThe state-backed China Securities Finance Co. will \"increase\" stock purchases of small- and medium-sized companies, Xinhua said separately. \nThe People's Bank of China, the central bank, also pledged to support the \"stable development\" of the stock market. \nIn the wake of the stock market slump, at least 1,249 companies have halted trading on mainland Chinese exchanges, accounting for 43 percent of total listings, Bloomberg News reported. \n\"With so many companies suspending trading, it will hurt market liquidity and cause the risks to collect in the rest of the firms still trading,\" Yingda Securities analyst Li Daxiao told AFP. \nOn Sunday, the government said the central bank would provide funds to the state-backed China Securities Finance Co. to help \"protect the stability of the securities market\". \nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) also said there would be a temporary halt to initial public offerings (IPOs), which tend to drain funds from the rest of the market, hurting prices and sentiment. \nA day before, China's 21 largest brokerages said they would invest at least 120 billion yuan ($19.3 billion) in so-called \"blue chip\" exchange traded funds (ETFs). \nBy mid-morning Shanghai was down 31 percent from its closing peak on June 12, when it had risen by more than 150 percent in 12 months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T06:17:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
