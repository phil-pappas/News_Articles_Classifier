It made S$30 billion of new investments and a record S$19 billion of divestments, taking advantage of liquidity driven market rallies.\nChief Executive Officer Ho Ching, who has been on a sabbatical since April, oversaw an increase in investments in China and recovering economies in North America and Europe. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 10 percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 19 percent in the year to the end of March, while the MSCI China Index rallied 20 percent.\n“This was the most active year for us since the global financial crisis,” Temasek Chairman Lim Boon Heng said in the statement.\nThe total shareholder return, including dividends, increased to 19.2 percent from 1.5 percent in the previous fiscal year.\nThe total shareholder return averaged 16 percent since inception in 1974. It was 9.6 percent over three years, it said.\n“The internationalization of Temasek’s equity portfolio is bearing fruit,” Sven Behrendt, managing director at Geneva-based GeoEconomica, which researches sovereign wealth funds, said before the results were released. “They are becoming an increasingly important global player as opposed to their previous focus on Asia and especially Singapore.”\nConsumer, Life Sciences Founded in 1974, it originally owned shares in former state-owned companies and began directly investing in foreign equities in 2002.\nThe value of its new investments was the highest in seven years at the end of March and focused on consumer, financial services and life sciences and agriculture, it said. Almost half of the new portfolio additions were in developing Asia, followed by North America and Europe.\nThe state firm’s divestments included the sale of Hong Kong-listed shares of China Construction Bank Corp. Temasek ended the year with an undisclosed net cash position.\nSingapore remained Temasek’s largest country exposure at 28 percent, though it narrowed from 31 percent of its portfolio previously, the investment firm said. Temasek is the biggest shareholder in about a third of the 30 members in the Straits Times Index, including Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. and DBS Group Holdings Ltd. The index gained 8.1 percent in the year to March 31.\nChina Exposure Investments in the rest of Asia rose to 42 percent of assets from 41 percent,\nThey climbed to 17 percent from 14 percent in North America and Europe. In North America, Temasek continued to invest in life sciences, including in biotechnology company BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nIts European investments included Deutsche Post DHL, an international logistics company, and engineering company Gaztransport & Technigaz SA, a global provider of membrane design for LNG transport and storage.\nTemasek said it increased its exposure to China to 27 percent and broadened its investments from earlier ones in banks to include insurance, consumer and technology companies, which are likely to benefit from the shift in the Chinese economy to become more reliant on consumer spending.\nFinancial services accounted for 28 percent of its assets as of March 31, compared to 30 percent in the previous year, according to the statement.\nUnlike GIC Pte, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, Temasek almost exclusively invests in equities and has few restrictions on how much it can hold. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest, isn’t allowed to own more than 10 percent of any of its portfolio companies and seeks to have no more than 60 percent of its portfolio in equities.\nTemasek had 67 percent of its portfolio in listed assets as of March, down from 70 percent in the previous year, according to the statement.\nNet income was S$14 billion versus a restated S$11 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T10:41:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
