Free cash flow may be negative at 150 million pounds and reach 150 million pounds at best, down from an earlier plan of as much as 350 million pounds.\nEast, an engineer who has worked in the semiconductor industry, is halting the 1 billion-pound share buyback program at the halfway mark and said that the company will need to deepen a restructuring at the marine unit, which has suffered as the slumping oil price prompts customer in the offshore industry buy less equipment.\n“I am clearly disappointed by today’s announcement and the impact this will have on our investors and employees,” East said in the release. “Notwithstanding the market developments, it is our responsibility to build a business that is sustainable and resilient no matter what is thrown at us and this will be my fundamental priority for the next few years.”\nThe jet-engine unit, Rolls-Royce’s largest by revenue, has been challenged by an engine transition on the Airbus A330 wide-body airliner, the company said. In addition, lower-than-expected demand for engines to power business jets and a softening regional aftermarket will also adversely impact profit. Those effects will lead to a 300 million-pound hit on profit at the subsidiary in 2016.\nEast took over from John Rishton, who stepped down after several profit revisions on his watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-06T14:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-06T09:50:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
