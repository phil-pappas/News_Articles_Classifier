Darrian Traynor Share on twitter by Christopher Joye As we forecast last week , the major banks have embarked on their massive equity raising campaigns, with Westpac mooted to be first cab off the rank with a $750 million hybrid offer targeted at retail punters on the Australian Securities Exchange.\nI expect the banks to try to slug investors with some dud deals to minimise their cost of capital and engage in hard-core game theory to nose ahead of competitors in what will doubtless become a bona fide equity-raising war.\nThe Australian Financial Review reported on Wednesday that Westpac will be promoting an Additional Tier 1 (AT1) equity capital security at a skinny margin of less than 400 basis points above the bank bill swap rate (or a total return of approximately 6.15 per cent).\nIt will be interesting to see whether the private bankers, financial planners and stockbrokers advising mums and dads have learnt any lessons from the parlous performance of the banks' AT1 hybrid sector. This has been exemplified by the 6 per cent to 9 per cent capital losses suffered by investors in CBA's $3 billion Perls VII (ASX: CBAPD) hybrid issue last year.\nInvestors in Westpac's most recent hybrid, called Westpac Capital Notes II (ASX:WBCPE), which listed in June 2014, are sitting on a 4.4 per cent capital loss that was as large as a 6 per cent loss only last month. There are several problems with the potential Westpac offer, which on the proposed pricing looks like \"equities for dummies\". This is arguably true by definition insofar as buying Westpac's ordinary shares gets you a far more attractive grossed-up dividend yield of 7.6 per cent and voting rights. The hybrid has no voting rights, is perpetual in term, and offers investors an entirely discretionary distribution that is not interest or a legal liability of the bank.\nA second issue is that investors in Westpac's most recent hybrid, called Westpac Capital Notes II (ASX:WBCPE), which listed in June 2014, are sitting on a 4.4 per cent capital loss that was as large as a 6 per cent loss only last month.\nAnother challenge is that Westpac Capital Notes II was as recently as mid-June paying investors a healthier 4.1 per cent margin above bank bills (CBA's Perls VII was returning as much as 4.5 per cent above bills).\nSo it is perhaps surprising that Westpac thinks it can convince mums and dads to part with $750 million-plus at a margin inferior to the returns afforded by similar ASX securities with shorter maturities.\n Normally if you are issuing equity or debt you incentivise investors to take up the offer by presenting an attractive discount to recent valuations. NAB successfully did this with its $5.5 billion equity issue, which was sold at a 16.7 per cent haircut to the prevailing share price.\nBut banks are in the business of raising money as cheaply as possible, if they can get away with it. Last week we warned that \"equity and hybrid investors will suffer from a surge in supply\" because both these securities count towards the banks' Tier 1 capital ratios, which are currently too low.\nAt a total cost of around 6.15 per cent, the perpetual Westpac hybrid is much cheaper loss-absorbing capital than the ordinary shares, which trade on a 7.6 per cent dividend yield. And a bargain for Westpac is tautologically an expensive deal for investors.\nThe major banks are ruthless in competing with each other for capital and I would not be shocked to see one shortly announce a rights issue or discounted dividend reinvestment plan, which ANZ flagged as a possibility on Tuesday.\nThis could create further complications for the Westpac hybrid. An ordinary share issue would offer a substantially superior dividend yield to the hybrid and inevitably cannibalise the finite pool of demand for these risky equity securities.\nWhile more expensive, issuing shares has one crucial advantage. In contrast to a hybrid, the shares count towards the bank's all-important Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, which is regarded by investors and regulators alike as the most reliable form of loss-absorbing capital.\nIn Australia the major banks are sitting on pro-forma CET1 ratios of circa 8.7 per cent according to Morgan Stanley. They need to raise about 130 basis points of additional equity to get over what UBS describes as the 10 per cent \"line in the sand\" for CET1 that ensures the majors remain among the best capitalised banks globally. \"Unquestionably strong is a very high hurdle and we do not believe that ... CET1 of less than 10 per cent would come close to satisfying it â€“ to us this appears to be a line in the sand minimum,\" said UBS's top-ranked bank analyst Jon Mott this week.\nThe silver lining is that higher-ranking securities, including bank deposits and bonds, will benefit from wider equity buffers that materially reduce their risks.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cjoye"], "published": "2015-07-22T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T21:10:26.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
