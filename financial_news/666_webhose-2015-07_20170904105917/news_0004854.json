Draghi used the opportunity to emphasize that the ECB always operated under the assumption that Greece would remain a part of the euro.\nThe most crucial news was the ECB president’s decision to raise emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks by 900 billion euros ($982 billion) without toughening the rules governing the collateral the banks must post in return for the funding. That gives Greek banks, which have been closed for more than two weeks, some breathing room, though capital controls are likely to remain in place for some time.\nThe move was a recognition of the Greek parliament’s approval of the tough austerity measures demanded in return for a third bailout, as well as the agreement in principle by eurozone governments on a bridge loan that will tide Greece over until its bailout is up and running—and would allow Greece to make a €3.5 billion repayment due on July 20.\n“The decision to grant bridge financing as well as today’s ECB decision to increase ELA are no game-changer, yet, but at least a symbolic leap of faith,” said Carsten Brzeski, eurozone economist at ING in Brussels\nThe ECB bought Greece more time with its decision to raise the amount of emergency liquidity available to the country’s banks, but Draghi used his bully pulpit to give Greece a vote of confidence while simultaneously highlighting the euro’s deep design flaws.\nEurozone finance ministers agree ‘in principle’ to Greek bailout .\nDraghi described the monetary union as “imperfect, and being imperfect is fragile, vulnerable and doesn’t deliver…all the benefits that it could if it were to be completed.” Draghi said the situation underscored the need for further economic and political integration in the eurozone.\nDraghi also took the opportunity to join the International Monetary Fund in singing from the debt-relief hymnal. Draghi told reporters that the concept of debt relief has always been “uncontroversial” and that the only question has been about how to accomplish it within Europe’s legal framework.\nThe IMF has argued that Greece’s debt load is unsustainable and must be trimmed, signaling it could walk away from a third bailout if debt relief isn’t offered. Germany, meanwhile, has insisted that the scope for debt relief within the rules governing the eurozone is very limited.\nLive blog recap: ECB boosts emergency lifeline to Greek banks .\nIt was Draghi’s pledge in 2012 that helped pull the eurozone from the brink. The statement, followed by the development of the never-used Outright Monetary Transactions program, was credited with quelling a panic in a credit markets.\nNow, Draghi is offering fewer assurances about the solidarity of the currency bloc. After almost single-handedly saving the euro, he’s now signaling that it’s fate rests with Europe’s elected politicians.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tr-know/"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T21:30:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
