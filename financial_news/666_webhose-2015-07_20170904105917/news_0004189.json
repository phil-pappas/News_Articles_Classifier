While the world is a bit audacious, when “Minions” opens this weekend it will help continue Universal Studios’s box office domination. \n“Minions,” a prequel based on the adored characters from 2010’s “Despicable Me,” has garnered talk of possibly passing the opening-weekend box office revenue of “Toy Story 3,” according to Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan. He said it’s opening weekend should fall within the $100 million to $110 million vicinity. “Toy Story 3” ranks as the second highest opening weekend for an animated movie with $110.3 million, according to boxofficemojo.com. \nUniversal Studios, owned by Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.52% has had an extraordinary and record breaking year so far. “Jurassic World” had the largest movie opening ever at $208.8 million, and has grossed $556 million domestically. Universal’s $1.3 billion in box office revenue leads all other studios and has been helped, in large part, by the gross revenues of “Furious 7” ($351 million), “Pitch Perfect 2” ($182 million) and “50 Shades of Grey” ($116 million). \nAlso read: Universal Studios has a grip on domestic box offices so far this year \n“And it has ‘Minions’ right on deck and it’s already doing very well overseas,” said Rentrak Corp. RENT, +1.60% analyst Paul Dergarabedian earlier this week. Boxofficemojo.com reports that “Minons” has grossed $141.7 million in foreign markets already. “They’re like the marshmallows in a box of Lucky Charms, everybody wants them and they can’t get enough.” More from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T04:05:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
