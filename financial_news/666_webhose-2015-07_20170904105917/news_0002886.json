A failure by the ECB to act might have forced Greek banks to immediately curtail depositors' daily withdrawals to less than €60 per a day. \nThose signs of progress in the Greek crisis and optimism surrounding growth prospects in the US and UK bolstered market sentiment and also drove gains in the pound and the US dollar. \nThe Footsie ended the session up by 42.70 points to end the day at 6,796.45. \nAmid rioting outside of the parliament, last night Greek lawmakers voted overwhelmingly in favour of the package of reforms demanded by Brussels in exchange for further aid. \nEuro-area integrity damaged That came amid an increased focus among Eurozone officials on just how much aid or debt forgiveness Greece was likely to require. \n\"The integrity of the Eurozone has probably been damaged rather than strengthened by the latest negotiations,\" analysts at Exane BNP said in a research note sent to clients. \n\"We believe that Grexit is more likely than not over a 1-3 year horizon. We suspect that Grexit would have only modest initial negative effects on euro area growth, given policy backstops - but long-term risks of renewed euro area strains would escalate,\" analysts at Citi chipped in. \nTemporary Grexit might be best Speaking to Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said a 'haircut' on the nominal value of Greece's debt is incompatible with the country's continued membership of the euro, adding \"but this would perhaps be the better way for Greece\". \nCompanies news Shire (Xetra: S7E.DE - news ) got a leg up as Berenberg re-initiated coverage of the stock with a 'buy' rating and 6,300p price target. The German bank said the ambitious guidance of $10bn sales by 2020 announced in mid-2014 is more than achievable and is rapidly becoming outdated as the pipeline expands and products from the recent NPS acquisition achieve sales accretion. \nWolseley (LSE: WOS.L - news ) extended Wednesday's gains, which came as JPMorgan Cazenove upgraded its rating on the stock to 'overweight' from 'neutral' and hiked its price target to 4,800p from 4,100p, due to improving profit margins. \nDixons Carphone (LSE: DC.L - news ) posted a 21% rise in pre-tax profit in its final results and said its integration was progressing well. For the 13 months to 2 May 2015, pre-tax profit came in at £381m from £316m last year, on revenue of £9.9bn, up 6% from 2014 on a like-for-like basis. The numbers were better than analysts had expected. \nImperial Tobacco (LSE: IMT.L - news ) is setting out plans to sell a further stake in its Spanish logistics unit Cia. de Distribution Integral Logista Holdings SA, Bloomberg reported. \nCredit services company Experian (Other OTC: EXPGF - news ) said full year expectations were unchanged, but warned of currency headwinds in an update. The FTSE 100 firm said in a first quarter update group organic revenue growth was 3% at constant exchange rates, but at actual exchange rates total revenue was down 6%. Experian said the difference related to foreign exchange movements against the US dollar. \nImperial Tobacco was also on the up, as it laid out plans to sell a further stake in its Spanish logistics unit Cia de Distribution Integral Logista Holdings SA. Rio Tinto (LSE: RIO.L - news ) received a boost after revealing in a second-quarter update that iron ore production was 9% higher compared to the same quarter in 2014 and 7% above the first quarter of 2015. \nHowever, sector peers Fresnillo (Other OTC: FNLPF - news ) and Randgold Resources were both in the red, tracking lower metal prices across the board. \nMarket Movers techMARK 3,192.47 +0.47% FTSE 100 6,796.45 +0.63% FTSE 250 17,765.37 +0.73% FTSE 100 - Risers Weir Group (WEIR) 1,661.00p +4.20% Pearson (PSON) 1,263.00p +2.85% Smiths Group (Other OTC: SMGKF - news ) (SMIN) 1,164.00p +2.19% Ashtead Group (LSE: AHT.L - news ) (AHT) 1,078.00p +1.99% Wolseley (WOS) 4,384.00p +1.86% Anglo American (LSE: AAL.L - news ) (AAL) 890.30p +1.82% Capita (CPI (Other OTC: CPICQ - news ) ) 1,320.00p +1.69% RSA Insurance Group (RSA) 432.20p +1.62% BHP Billiton (NYSE: BBL - news ) (BLT) 1,253.00p +1.58% Aberdeen Asset Management (Other OTC: ABDNF - news ) (ADN) 409.10p +1.56% FTSE 100 - Fallers BP (BP.) 422.00p -1.19% Fresnillo (FRES) 668.50p -1.18% Randgold Resources Ltd.
