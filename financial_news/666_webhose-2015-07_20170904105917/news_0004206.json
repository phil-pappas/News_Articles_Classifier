Dennis Daugaard said in a written statement that \"Citibank is an important corporate citizen and the Governor is glad to have this issue resolved.\" \nThe case goes back to a 2012 claim from Citibank for a $30 million refund for state bank taxes paid between 1999 and 2002. The Internal Revenue Service in 2012 reduced Citibank's taxable income for the earlier period, which lowered the state bank franchise tax payment since that is based on federal taxable income. \nSouth Dakota's Department of Revenue rejected Citibank's claim, and the state has argued that the firm didn't request a refund until after the three-year statute of limitations passed. Citibank argued that it complied with state regulations and filed a timely refund request after the federal tax agency finished its review of the financial group's books, when it learned its final tax outcome. \nThe Department of Revenue told the justices during oral arguments that Citibank should have asked for the refund within the statute of limitations — even though the federal audit wasn't finished — in order to comply with state law. \nCitibank said in an emailed statement that it accepts the court's decision and that it has enjoyed \"a mutually beneficial relationship\" with the state since it came there in 1981. \n\"We are committed to working with legislators and other South Dakota banks on key tax statutes so that other taxpayers do not find themselves in this situation,\" Citibank said. \"Though we're disappointed the two parties were unable to arrive at an agreement to refund the overpayment, we look forward to continuing our strong relationship with the state.\" \nA circuit court judge had dismissed the bank's appeal of an administrative appeal in 2013 before Citibank brought the case to the high court. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-30T20:20:42.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
