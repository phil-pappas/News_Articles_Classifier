Because the response was so strong and many of the same inefficiencies exist with JSON compliance we knew we could apply this approach for JSON-enabling COBOL programs as well. From there it was a natural extension to package them together as a complete solution for enterprises needing both JSON and XML capabilities.”\nThunder takes the complexities out of XML and JSON by automatically generating COBOL and C code enabling companies to go to market faster. The Thunder toolset creates Readers and Writers in three easy steps. The first two steps – derive and bind - determine the program fields and XML/JSON structure as well as the mapping between them resulting in a Handler Design that is used for the third step to generate all of the source code required to read write and validate XML or JSON messages.   \nBecause it uses a model-driven approach to code creation Thunder makes it easier to respond to changes quickly and implement new schema versions with minimal effort which frees up developers’ time to focus their expertise on the business logic in their programs. \nA truly comprehensive platform-independent solution for JSON and XML-enabling COBOL and C programs Thunder supports HP NonStop z/OS iSeries (AS400) Unisys RM COBOL ACUCOBOL Micro Focus COBOL CA Realia COBOL-IT HP-UX and many more.\nFor more information about Thunder Suite JSON Thunder or XML Thunder visit or call (905) 712-3840.\nTo start a free 30-day trial of Thunder Lite and experience the power of a model-drive approach to code creation that JSON and XML-enables COBOL and C programs visit or .\n \n##\nCanam Software Labs Inc. is a Mississauga Canada based global information technology solutions company providing innovative application development products and services to blue chip organizations around the world.\nCanam Software Labs Inc. was established in 1994 to create automated software development solutions for enterprise application development.
