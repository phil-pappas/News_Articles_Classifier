Even as new capacity comes online, Brazilian producers are shipping cargoes to the United States as the import window widens. \nIn the first five months of the year, the United States exported 377 million gallons of ethanol, up 6 percent from the same period last year, government data show. \nSince it started ethanol production six years ago, Valero has only sold a domestic grade, traders said, but the company spokesman said it was eyeing a bigger export presence when it bought and revived a 110-million-gallon plant in Mount Vernon, Indiana, last year from Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings. \nThat plant, its 11th ethanol facility, gave it access to the Ohio River. \n(Reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Peter Galloway) Commodity Markets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T11:20:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
