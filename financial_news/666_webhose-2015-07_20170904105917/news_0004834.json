Announces Final Results of Its Self Tender Offer July 15, 2015 16:12 ET | Source: P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. TONTITOWN, Ark., July 15,   P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. (NASDAQ: PTSI ) (the “Company”) today announced the final results of its modified “Dutch auction” tender offer to repurchase up to 150,000 shares of its outstanding common stock, which expired at 12:00 Midnight, Eastern Time, on Thursday, July 9, 2015. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the tender offer, the Company has accepted for purchase a total of 298,566 shares of its common stock, representing approximately 4.0% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares, at a purchase price of $59.00 per share. Payment for the shares accepted for purchase under the tender offer will be made promptly, at a total cost to the Company of approximately $17,615,394, excluding fees and expenses related to the offer. Based on the final count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (“Computershare”), the depositary for the tender offer, an aggregate of 1,453,607 shares were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn at the final purchase price of $59.00 per share. Because more than 150,000 shares of common stock were properly tendered and not properly withdrawn, the tender offer was oversubscribed.

The Company will promptly pay for the shares accepted for purchase and return to tendering shareholders any shares tendered and not purchased. The Company expects to have approximately 7,145,574 shares of its common stock outstanding immediately following consummation of the tender offer. The total amount of shares purchased in the tender offer reflects the Company’s right to increase the tender offer by up to two percent of its outstanding shares and includes 149,962 shares tendered by the Chairman of the Board of the Company, Mr. Matthew T. Moroun, 3,040 shares tendered by the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Daniel H. Cushman, and 2,054 shares tendered by a director of the Company, Mr. W. Scott Davis.
