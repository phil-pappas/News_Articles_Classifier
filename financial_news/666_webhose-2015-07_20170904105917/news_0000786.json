In later weeks, Greece will have to open to competition industries that have long been protected, such as the energy sector. Labour laws will be made more flexible. \nIf it meets these requirements, it will get a three-year rescue program and a commitment to restructure its debt, which is unsustainably high at about 320 billion euros or 180 per cent of annual GDP. \nTsipras argues that because of these concessions Monday's deal is, despite the tough austerity, actually better for Greece than the proposals Greeks voted down just a week ago. \n\"We managed to avoid the most extreme measures,\" he said. \n\"Greece will fight to return to growth and to reclaim its lost sovereignty.\" \nTsipras said he had managed to avoid a demand by some creditors to transfer Greek assets abroad as a form of collateral and to avoid the collapse of the banking sector. \nGreece's banks, which have been shut for two weeks, were still closed on Monday and limits remained on cash withdrawals. Without a deal, they faced the prospect of collapse within days as they are steadily drained of money. \nWhen the banks will be able to reopen will depend on whether the European Central Bank decides to increase emergency credit to Greek banks now that a bailout deal has been clinched in principle. \nIt was unclear whether the ECB would make such a decision on Monday or after Greece passes its first batch of reforms. \nFrench President Francois Hollande said the Greek parliament would convene within hours to adopt the reforms called for in the plan and he celebrated Greece's continued membership in the euro. \nLosing Greece, he said, would have been akin to losing \"the heart of our civilisation.\" \nOther European officials were less emotive. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Greece reaches new deal with creditors AAP \nGreece has finally clinched a bailout deal with its European creditors that, if implemented, will secure its place â€¦", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T16:09:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
