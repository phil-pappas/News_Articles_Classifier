Sam Bennett by Trish Power With interest rates at record lows, borrowing to invest in real estate is now cheaper for many Australians. The property market is booming in many Australian states and the property spruikers are out in force securing cash for new property developments. The latest get-rich-quick promotion from spruikers involves buying a property via a self-managed super fund, using borrowed money.\nCuriously, the spruikers are generally not targeting existing SMSF investors but targeting new investors by promoting new property developments as an attractive investment and then encouraging an investor to set up an SMSF to buy that property. The key message is that the investor can then access the deposit and purchase costs for the investment property by using existing superannuation savings and borrowing the balance from a bank.\nThe financial services regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has already penalised several unlicensed spruikers for promoting property investment via SMSFs. The Australian Tax Office is also monitoring loan arrangements used by SMSF investors, especially the arrangements linked to property spruikers.\nThe federal government has made noises about imposing a ban on SMSF borrowing when investing in fund assets. Nothing about SMSF borrowing was mentioned in the May 2015 federal budget, and at the time of writing, SMSF borrowing is still permitted.\nGetting the fundamentals right\nAnyone considering buying a property using an SMSF needs to step back and ask at least three questions. The first is whether a self-managed super fund is a suitable retirement planning vehicle for your personal circumstances, taking into account the cost of running an SMSF, the time needed to run such a fund and the expertise to manage your fund's investments. A popular option is to outsource the administration of the SMSF. In some cases, trustees outsource the fund's investment management as well.\nOnce an SMSF is set up, the SMSF trustees need to formulate an investment strategy that takes into account the risk profile of each of the fund members, the need for diversification, the tax implications of any investment and the cash flow needs for the super fund. Now that the SMSF's investment strategy has been created, the trustees can then decide on the fund's asset allocation.\nThe second question is: can a direct property investment, such as a house, apartment or office, be a suitable investment for your SMSF, considering your fund's investment strategy, including taking into account proper diversification? If the answer is yes, then the third question is: what property will your super fund select to purchase?\n Now, not so fast. The process involved in borrowing money to invest via an SMSF is more complex than simply signing a contract and arranging a loan with a bank.\nStrict rules for SMSF borrowing\nBorrowing to invest is not a new concept, especially when investing in property. Very few people have sufficient cash resources to pay for a property outright and a loan to pay for a large chunk of the purchase price is usually secured through a bank or other financial organisation.\nBorrowing to invest via a super fund, however, is a relatively new trend. Before September 2007, SMSFs were not permitted to borrow money for investing except in very limited circumstances relating to short-term cash flow issues. Since 2007, SMSFs can now use a special type of borrowing, known as a limited recourse borrowing arrangement (LRBA). Limited recourse means if you default on your loan repayments, the bank lending your SMSF the money can only take the asset secured against the loan, rather than take the other assets owned by your SMSF.\nLRBAs don't come cheap, however, so you can expect to pay higher costs for an LRBA, compared with a regular loan, because the lender (bank or other financial organisation) is taking on greater risk lending to an SMSF via an LRBA. If the SMSF trustees default, the lender can only claim the secured asset for the outstanding loan balance, which means the lender will grade the loan as higher risk. In some cases, lenders may seek personal guarantees from SMSF trustees in the event of loan default.\nAnother quirk with SMSF borrowing is that while the LRBA is in place, the asset is not owned directly by the SMSF, even though the SMSF is repaying the loan. The SMSF trustees receive the beneficial interest in the asset purchased, but the legal ownership of the asset is held on trust in a holding trust. Seeking specialist advice is essential to ensure your fund complies with the specific arrangements required for an LRBA, and for asset ownership.\nYou also need to be mindful of other important restrictions when borrowing to buy an asset via a SMSF. You can use an LRBA to purchase a single asset such as one property, or a collection of identical assets, such as a parcel of shares from the same listed company. If you want to borrow to invest in more than one property or other type of asset, then your SMSF needs to have separate LRBAs for each purchase.\nYou can use LRBA money to maintain or repair the property associated with the LRBA, but you cannot use the LRBA cash to improve the property. The ATO provides a lot of guidance on the meaning of \"improve\" compared with \"repair or maintain\". For example, replacing guttering or painting the house is considered repair or maintenance, while adding an extension to the property is considered an improvement.\nYour family members cannot use or live in a residential investment property that your SMSF purchases, and this restriction applies whether the SMSF buys the property outright with cash, or uses an LRBA, or uses an alternative purchase arrangement. If your SMSF purchases a commercial property however, then different rules apply and fund members or related parties can use the commercial property.\nAny SMSF trustee considering a borrowing strategy should chat to an accountant about the tax implications of using borrowed money for SMSF investments, compared with investing outside the SMSF, and the ongoing costs of such an arrangement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T05:41:53.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
