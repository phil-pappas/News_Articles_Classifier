It praised her work but said a new, more \"client friendly\" era is starting at the tax office. \nVida was one of six Hungarians banned from entering the U.S. because of suspected links to corruption. The U.S. government never named those people but Vida made public in November that she and colleagues from the tax office were on the list. She denied any wrongdoing. \nUnder pressure from Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Vida sued a U.S. diplomat, M. Andre Goodfriend, who implicated the tax office but the case was dropped because of his diplomatic immunity. \nThink your friends should see this?
