It is a celebration to overcome fear and blackmail,\" he told a crowd of 30,000 as they roared oxi, oxi - \"no, no.\" \nThe 40-year-old Tsipras is gambling the future of his new left wing government on Sunday's snap poll - insisting a \"no\" vote will strengthen his hand to negotiate a third bailout with better terms. \nIf he loses, Tsipras has strongly indicated he would step aside. \nAthens' high-stakes stand-off with lenders saw Greece default on debts this week, close banks to avoid their collapse, and lose access to billions of euros after an existing bailout deal expired. \nThe EFSF, the Eurozone's rescue fund and Greece's largest creditor, said Friday it considered the country to be in default. \nAt Friday's \"no\" rally, Athens resident Maria Antoniou held a handmade sign, reading \"oxi\". \n\"We have to strengthen Tsipras. It's not his fault we are bankrupt,\" she said. \nThat is a message the \"yes\" voters refuse to believe. \nPolice said about 22,000 people gathered outside the nearby Panathenian stadium for the \"yes\" rally, waving Greek and European Union flags and chanting \"Greece, Europe, Democracy.\" \nEvgenia Bouzala, a Greek born in Germany, said she was considering shutting down her olive oil export business because of the financial turmoil. \n\"I don't think we can keep going. Look at what happened in the last three days. Imagine if that lasts another six months,\" she said. \nRallies for both campaigns were also held in 10 other Greek cities on Friday, and the drama remained high in the final hours of campaigning. \nThe country's top court stayed in session till the late afternoon before rejecting a petition to declare the referendum illegal. \nA series of polls published on Friday at the end of a frantic week-long campaign showed the two sides in a dead heat, with an incremental lead of the \"yes\" vote well within the margin of error. \nThey also showed an overwhelming majority of people - about 75 per cent - want Greece to remain in the euro currency. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Japan pledges $6.1 bn aid to 'Mekong Five' in bid for influence AFP \nJapan on Saturday pledged $6.1 billion in financial aid to the \"Mekong Five\" countries as it pushes infrastructure …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-04T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T11:50:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
