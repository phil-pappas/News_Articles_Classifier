Drax attacks 'costly and unreliable' wind and solar power By Emily Gosden | Telegraph – 25 minutes ago Print \nYorkshire-based biomass power plant sparks row within green energy industry after attacking wind and solar \nBritain’s fleet of wind and solar farms will fail to supply even 1pc of the UK’s power needs “with reasonable regularity”, Drax has claimed, as it argued biomass should be “central” to the UK’s energy mix. \nThe Yorkshire-based power plant company, which is in the process of switching from burning coal to renewable biomass, sparked infighting in the green energy industry on Tuesday after using its half-year results statement to issue a stinging critique of rival renewable technologies. \nDorothy Thompson, Drax chief executive, said the UK’s wind and solar farms were “increasing the instability of the grid”, with “mounting” cost implications, citing forecasts suggesting the bill for balancing supply and demand would rise from £1bn this year to £2bn by 2020. \nYet “aggregate wind farm and solar output in the UK can be expected to fall below 1pc of total electricity production with reasonable regularity”, she argued. \nBiomass, unlike wind and solar, was “reliable” and “comparatively affordable”, Drax claimed in a presentation , and should therefore “play a central and long-term role in the future energy mix of the UK”. \nThe comments prompted an angry response from wind industry body RenewableUK, which said Drax was “wrong to accuse wind of increasing instability on the grid” and “misleading to claim that wind output regularly falls to low levels”. \nDrax power station (pic: Bloomberg News) \nDr Gordon Edge, Renewable UK’s policy director, said: “The renewable energy sector as a whole is facing a very difficult time after a series of negative Government announcements. Renewable generators shouldn’t be attacking other green technologies we should be concentrating our fire on Government, which has put a torch to all policy certainty.” \nDrax was also critical of the Government on Tuesday, attacking the Chancellor’s “shock” announcement in the Budget to end the climate change levy exemption for renewables . \nMrs Thompson said this was “an about-turn in a well-entrenched policy”, costing Drax £30m this year and £60m next year. \nThe move is the latest in a series of Government decisions to scale back planned financial support for biomass , which have hammered Drax shares over the past year. \n“Like many in our sector, and indeed business in general, we long for a stable regulatory framework which will allow us to invest in our country's infrastructure with confidence,” Mrs Thompson said. \nThe comments came as Drax reported an 18pc rise in half-year profits to £120m, driven by increased biomass output, which helped to offset the rising costs of the carbon tax on its coal generation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T17:54:28.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
