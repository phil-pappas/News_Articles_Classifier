Cash withdrawals remain limited and strict capital controls are still in place, but the reopening is an important stage in the return to some sort of normality. It was made possible by the European Central Bank’s decision on Thursday to permit an extra €900m ($975m) of “emergency liquidity assistance” from the Bank of Greece to the banks. This was in turn facilitated by the Greek parliament’s vote earlier that day to back reforms demanded by euro-zone creditors as a condition for talks on a third bail-out agreement. The vote also paved the way for a fund backed by the whole European Union to provide Greece with temporary finance worth €7.2 billion. That will enable it to redeem bonds worth €3.5 billion held by the ECB that come due today, plus €700m of interest. Another peril avoided.
