John Woudstra by Maximilian Walsh Last week at a lunchtime speech on leadership , Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief Ian Narev told his audience Australia needed \"large-scale financial institutions\" to confront challenges ahead and take advantage of opportunities.\nMr Narev didn't mention the four pillars banking policy, which the banking sector has been chafing about since 1990. However, it is difficult to visualise the emergence of large-scale institutions as long as the four pillars policy remains unchanged. Mr Narev said: \"The country needs vibrant competition. It needs entrepreneurship. It needs smaller companies as well, but it needs large-scale institutions. They are and will be a critical part of the economic prosperity of Australia.\"\nConsidering the devastation we have witnessed during the past eight years across the global financial landscape, especially among the ranks of the mega banks, Mr Narev's vision of the financial future might well be built on shaky foundations.\nHad Australia's financial system gone down the same path of consolidation as the US and Britain after 1990 it is highly likely that our damage would have been all the greater. As it is, and was before the global financial crisis, Australia has a justifiable reputation for running one of the world's best banking systems.\nThere are many metrics that can be deployed to measure the comparative performance of the 117 banking systems that have been defined as functioning members of the global system. A magisterial study of global banking published late in 2014, Fragile by Design, ranks national banking systems by stability and credit generation since 1970.\nThe authors were Charles W Calomiris, professor of financial institutions at Colombia Business School, and Stephen H Haber, from the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Only six of the 117 countries they surveyed – Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Malta, New Zealand and Singapore – met the authors' threshold of being both credit abundant and crisis free.\nNot as diverse What do these \"very successful six\" countries have in common? Three of them – Hong Kong, Singapore and Malta – are city-states or small islands rather than large countries. Their economies are not as diverse as countries with larger systems.\n The three other countries on the list of the \"very successful six\", Australia, Canada and New Zealand, share two features.\nFirst, they were all part of the British Empire. Indeed, all six are former British colonies. Second, they are among the world's most stable and long-lived democracies. The authors then deploy a metric, known as the polity score, to measure the extent of democracy and autocracy in a given country.\nFrom 1925-2010, Australia, Canada and New Zealand all scored the maximum, 100. The average polity score worldwide for the same period was 52.6. The authors identify what they see as something else that Australia, Canada and New Zealand share – the structure and political histories of these three countries tended to mitigate the ability of populists and bankers to form coalitions that disadvantage everyone else.\nThe authors put it bluntly: \"Banking is all about politics and always has been.\" In fact, the 570-page book is subtitled \"The Political Origins of Banking Crises and Scarce Credit\".\nReading the case studies of Calomiris and Haber leaves one with the realisation that the expression \"safe as a bank\" is actually ironic. For example, the Worlds Bank's financial structure database shows that only 34 of the 117 nations that make up the global banking system were crisis free from 1970 to 2010. Sixty-two countries had one crisis and 19 had two crises.\nThe 19 countries were Chad, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Uruguay, Spain, Sweden and … the United States.\nPolitics did it How did the United States find itself in such bad company? Politics, in many different forms, did it. In the early 1990s, state laws in the US encouraged the consolidation of existing banks, leading to the emergence of mega banks. The incentives to become a mega bank were many. In addition to making conventional banking more efficient, IT investment enabled mega banks to launch their own range of \"products\".\nThe bailing out of the Continental Illinois bank in 1984 on the grounds that it threatened a financial contagion created a new category of \"too big to fail\" banks, which, in effect, provided free insurance cover from the Federal Reserve.\nTo gain clearance for a US banking merger, it was also necessary to qualify under the \"good citizenship\" rules of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). This had been around since 1977 as a politically inspired subsidy to borrowers that had been red-lined by the banks.\nPresident Bill Clinton embraced the idea of CRA commitments as part of his belief in the \"third way\". To rack up good-citizenship points, merger-driven banks formed coalitions with urban activist groups. These coalitions committed more than $US850 billion ($1.15 trillion) in credit to be channelled through the activists.\nThe banks directly committed an additional $US3.6 trillion in CRA lending to under-served areas or low-income communities. Clinton's \"third way\" might not have caused the sub-prime crisis, but it was a significant contributing factor.\nCitibank, AIG, Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and Countrywide Financial either failed or had to be rescued by the government.\nWithin a few years of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act that knocked down the last barriers to interstate banking, the US banking system was consumed with merger mania. JPMorgan Chase, for example, was created out of the merger of 37 banks, forming a mega bank with 220,000 employees and $US2 trillion in assets.\nBanking systems are political, complex and evolving by nature. As the global crisis demonstrated, size can be as much vulnerability as a defensive asset.\nCommonwealth Bank's Mr Narev might have donned the cloak of super-banker, but he will have to come up with more than saying \"trust me\".\nMaximilian Walsh is deputy chairman of Dixon Advisory and a former editor and managing editor of The Australian Financial Review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:35:59.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
