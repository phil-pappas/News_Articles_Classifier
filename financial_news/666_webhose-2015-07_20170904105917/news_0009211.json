Novak Djokovic, the defending champion, a dream machine, excellently engineered, so efficient, he makes it appear routine. Roger Federer, tennis' very own David, flawless in construction and better still in execution, is a work of art on legs.\nThe No.1 and 2 ranked players, aged 28 and 33, in the summer and September of their careers, evidently dance to different drummers. Motion and emotion.\nDjokovic won that emotionally-charged final against the veteran Swiss 12 months ago, in five sets. He has also won two of their three encounters this year, all of them Tour finals. Still there's a buzz around the grounds in this London suburb, a feeling, not without reason, that tennis' very own magician is about to pull a rabbit out of the hat.\nFederer entered his 10th Wimbledon final displaying outrageous form. He was so good in his semifinal against home-hope Andy Murray, it was illegal. The soon to be 34-year-old, father of four, struck 56 winners to 11 un forced errors, sent down 20 aces, winning 84% of his first serve points and faced just one break point in the last-four clash.\nFederer, chasing an epic 18th Grand Slam title, and an eighth Wimbledon crown, is also looking to become the oldest man to win the title in this picturesque arena (in the Open era). The much-adored Swiss pointed out that there was something about the place and surface that brought the best out of him.\n\"Clearly this tournament has given me so much,\" he said, sitting in his relaxed orderly fashion, not a hair out of place. \"The same with the crowds, my game translates very well to this surface. Maybe the moving part, the serve, the half-volleys. I don't know. I'm just able to figure it out very quickly on grass.\"\nThe 28-year-old Djokovic, coached by a grasscourt heavyweight German Boris Becker, and coming off a gut-wrenching loss in the French Open final, credited his Sunday's opponent with making him a better player. \"In the matches against him, I went through a lot of different emotions that allowed me to understand what I need to do to become a better player and to win against him and win Grand Slam trophies. He's so good and so consistent. He's the greatest ever. This is where he plays his best tennis.\nThe Centre Court of Wimbledon, seven titles. It's his court.\"\nFederer, mindful of his age and stage of his career and the tournament itself, refused to be carried away by his Frit day evening show, saying, he still had a match to play.\n\"Novak has had unbelievable success throughout his career, more so in the last few years. He's been dominant, especially on the hard courts,\" Federer said.\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >> @TOISportsNews http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Wimbledon,Roger Federer,Novak Djokovic,Grand Slam,Boris Becker Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-07-12T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-12T10:52:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
