But the future of Europe is not at stake. The future of Europe would be at stake if we forgot who we are and what makes us strong: A union based on the rule of law and responsibility. If we were to forget that, the euro would fail and Europe with it.”\nWhile Greece has the right to hold its planned referendum on July 5, the other 18 euro-area member states have the right to take positions that reflect their interests, Merkel said.\n“Being a good European doesn’t mean seeking an agreement at any price,” she said.\nNo new negotiations can take place before the referendum, since Germany’s lower house, or Bundestag, must vote on opening any aid talks according to the rules of the European Stability Mechanism, Merkel said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T15:18:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
