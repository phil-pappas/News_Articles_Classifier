He also ordered the foreign ministry to conduct a full review of bilateral relations.\nHe ruled out the possibility of armed conflict, but described recently elected Guyanese President David Granger as a \"hostage of Exxon Mobil.\"\nExxon, consulted about the issue in the past, has said its policy is to follow host countries' and international law, and that border conflicts are a matter for governments to resolve.\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday offered to help resolve the dispute.\nThe Essequibo, a sparsely populated region of thick jungle, encompasses an area equivalent to around two-thirds of Guyanese territory. It functions in practice as part of Guyana and shows no discernible trace of Venezuelan influence, according to visitors to the area.\nGuyana says Caracas agreed to relinquish the Essequibo following a ruling by an international tribunal in 1899, but that Venezuela later backtracked on that decision.\nVenezuela says the 1899 ruling was unfair and insists the territory is still in dispute. Maps in Venezuela usually describe the Essequibo as the \"reclamation zone.\" (Reporting by Brian Ellsworth; Editing by Lisa Shumaker )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-07T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-07T04:34:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
