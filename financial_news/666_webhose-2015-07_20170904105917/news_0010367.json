Other members of the committee have said her travel was not authorised by them and they never received an official report from her.\nOther attendees at that wedding, including Tony Abbott, wrongly claimed expenses but repaid the money. Mrs Bishop is refusing to do so.\nMrs Bishop's office said her claim of $288 to attend Ms Gambaro's wedding was legitimate, as she met with an academic in the same field of a parliamentary committee she was chairing - who she said wants to remain anonymous.\nThe spokesman said committee chairs do not need prior approval for travel and do significantly more work than committee members.\nHe also said Mr Morrison did not say he did not support her.\nMr Turnbull took to Twitter to show himself using public transport to travel from Melbourne to Geelong, the same journey Ms Bishop chose to take by helicopter for a Liberal Party fundraiser.\nLabor leader Bill Shorten said \"the soap opera has to stop\".\nHe said Mrs Bishop was Mr Abbott's captain's pick and he should have acted straight away.\n\"Mr Abbott has to act, Bronwyn Bishop has to go,\" he said.\n\"This mess has infected both of them.\"\n.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm/status/626141116111294464", "https://twitter.com/NBN_Australia", "https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm/status/626165458547269632", "https://twitter.com/SHendersonMP", "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bronwyn-bishop-under-pressure-to-explain-travel-claim-to-mirabella-wedding-20150727-gilqgf.html", "http://t.co/PWJI7dBNAD"], "published": "2015-07-29T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T07:13:15.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
