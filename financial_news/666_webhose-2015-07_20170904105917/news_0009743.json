Alex Ellinghausen Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by Laura Tingle The states should take responsibility for early childhood and school education, and hand higher education and vocational training to the federal government, according to South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill.\nAhead of the federal and state leaders' retreat in Sydney later this month, Mr Weatherill argued the states and territories \"are the next frontiers for reform\", nominating education responsibilities as one of four areas that needed to be addressed.\nThe time had arrived for Australia to consider \"major, not modest reform, at this leaders' retreat\": improved productivity and effectiveness of the health system, better education systems, unlocking infrastructure investment and improving home ownership.\nMr Weatherill said states and territories should take over \"the education of children from birth to the end of secondary schooling, [with] the federal government dealing with everything beyond, including higher education and vocational education and training\".\n\"Under this split, state governments like mine would be the sole manager of early childhood development, prevention and early intervention services, primary and secondary education,\" he said.\n\"This would involve the transfer of responsibility for childcare from the Commonwealth to the states. We'd deal with policy regulation and delivery of public services.\"\nHowever, Mr Weatherill was not necessarily proposing any clear shift in funding arrangements, saying \"current Commonwealth spend on those services would either continue through single block funding grants to states\" or some other ongoing funding arrangement.\nStates 'lose sight of children' \"All this should take place in the context of my state's and the Commonwealth's continuing commitment to the Gonski funding arrangements,\" he said.\n\"At the moment, state governments engage with children from birth to about the age of one through a range of antenatal services, health checks and immunisations. If a child is healthy and developing to the age of four, most of their contact will be with the Commonwealth-subsidised childcare sector, with the occasional visit to the family doctor.\n\"This essentially means that states lose sight of children between the age of one and four, unless it's through the episodic contact with specialist services. As a result, it's often the case that by the time they re-enter the state pre-school and schooling system, learning and other difficulties have deteriorated or become entrenched. The long-term costs of addressing these issues often are borne by the states.\n\"It would be so much more rational if we had one level of government taking responsibility for the way in which a child develops right from the start.\n\"Given that the principal focus of the Gonski funding was the bottom 20 per cent of students who have learning difficulties, making sure that their learning needs are addressed, reform of this nature will be profoundly important to reduce the size of that task and make a massive contribution to the effectiveness of that task of educating our children when they come into our schooling system.\"\nOn health, Mr Weatherill said federal and state governments had to accept there was no obvious demarcation of responsibilities.\n\"South Australia proposes a sharing of responsibility between the state and federal governments across the continuum of healthcare services,\" he said.\n\"This reform would involve a basic shift in emphasis away from illness and episodic care towards wellness, early intervention and prevention\" at a time when the cost of Australia's four most common chronic diseases accounted for about 36 per cent of all healthcare spending.\n\"In the future, healthcare services should be increasingly provided in primary and community care settings or in a patient's home, rather than in hospitals for [chronic disease],\" Mr Weatherill said.\nRoad user overhaul on agenda On infrastructure, the Premier proposed a radical restructure of road user charges to generate the funds needed for new projects. \"The fundamental problem is a lack of a market-based funding system like we have for almost all other forms of infrastructure.\"\nHe is proposing a national heavy vehicle road user charging system run by the Commonwealth, under which state-based registration and federal-based fuel excise charges are replaced by a charging regime \"based on mass, distance and location\".\nMr Weatherill offered to make SA the trial site for different elements of the heavy vehicle road user charging regime.\n\"My plan has the potential to reduce pressure on government budgets, as the efficient use of revenue from user charges would cut the cost to taxpayers of the construction and maintenance of roads,\" he said.\n\"This initiative would also put rail and road on a more even playing field, which would encourage more efficient allocation of freight between road and rail.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/latingle", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/108650647776677996559"], "published": "2015-07-08T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T00:56:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
