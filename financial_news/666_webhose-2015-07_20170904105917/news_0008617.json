Photo: Rob Homer\nHere's three questions to ponder as the market continues to struggle.\n1) WILL THE PROFIT SEASON REBOOT THE MARKET?\nProbably not. The June 30 profit reporting season kicks off at the end of this month, and earnings forecasts for the companies that make up the S&P/ASX 200 index are about 1 per cent lower in aggregate than they were in December last year.\nThe latest forecasts if confirmed would see industrial share earnings rise by about 5 per cent overall, and mining company earnings to fall by 33 per cent. The forecasts take \"confession season\" earnings downgrades in recent weeks into account, and are unlikely to be wildly wrong.\nA much weaker than expected demand response to low interest rates and a lower Australian dollar and continued weakness in metal and energy prices as the commodity boom unwinds have however produced much heavier downgrades of expected ASX 200 earnings in the next two financial years.\nEvans and Partners portfolio manager Mike Hawkins estimates that forecast earnings for the year to June 30 2016 have been wound back by 8.8 per cent since early December.\nIn December, the ASX 200 companies were expected to set a new earnings high in the year to June that has just begun, beating the previous earnings high in 2007 by about 5 per cent. Earnings in 2015-2016 are now expected to be about 4 per cent below the 2007 high.\nA new high is expected to set in the year to June 30 2017, with ASX 200 earnings beating 2007 earnings by about 5 per cent. Hawkins says however that earnings forecasts for that year have also been wound back since December, by about 8 per cent.\nIt is not hard to see where the earnings downgrades are coming from. Bank earnings are being pressured: bad and doubtful debts are more likely to edge up from very low levels than edge down, and the banks are being told to back up their lending with more capital.\nIn the resources sector no significant upturn for commodity prices is in sight. Big companies including Woolworths have issued profit warnings, and in the economy at large, economic growth is below what was thought to be the long-term trend, and, according to Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens, possibly settling into a new, lower-growth channel.\nThe sharemarket's slide from almost 6000 points in late April has brought valuations back in line with the long-term average. The ASX 200 index was just under 7 per cent lower than it was in April on Friday, and valued at 14&frac12; times expected 2015-2016 earnings.\nWe need earnings growth to carry it higher, however. The profit season is not likely to deliver enough of it, and if guidance for 2015-2016 is weak, earnings estimates will be cut again.\n2) WHEN WILL THE FED JUMP?\nNext week we get more hints about when the US Federal Reserve will begin raising US interest rates, and how steep the rate-rise curve will be. They are the key pieces of missing information for the markets this year.\nThere is no chance that the Fed will announce a rate after it meets on July 28 and July 29. Fed watchers will however be looking at the announcement the Fed makes to see whether the language it has been using to describe the US economy and its stance on rates changes.\nThey will also be looking to see if the statement flushes out any dissenting votes from members of the Fed's rate-setting Open Market Committee (FOMC). A dissenting vote from hawkish FOMC member Jeffrey Lacker would for example suggest that the Fed was looking at a relatively market-friendly rate-rise programme. A dissenting vote from dovish member Charles Evans would be a sign that the trajectory might be more aggressive than the market desires.\nMarket calls on the timing of a rate rise currently stretch from September to December. The belief, supported by Fed commentary so far, is that that the rate rise curve will be shallow, and that rates will not go as high as they have in previous rate-rise cycles. Any diversions from that in the Fed's commentary next week would be dynamite.\n3) DOES LABOR'S NATIONAL CONFERENCE MATTER?\nFor the markets, not really – or at least, not yet. Significant policy shifts are always more likely when Labor is in opposition. It is far from assured of an election victory, and the conference as usual will be broad-brush.\nBIll Shorten declared in his opening speech on Friday that Labor would take on the government on climate change and introduce an emissions trading scheme in government.\nIt would be a big macroeconomic change if it happened, and an important one for energy-intensive companies. The detail including carbon pricing and compensation levels is what matters to the markets, however, and the conference won't be going there.\nAnthony Albanese also successfully moved on Friday that Labor consider the \"Buffett rule\". That would impose a minimum tax rate on high-income earners – but the key word there is \"consider\".\nLabor's agenda for infrastructure development is also up for discussion, in theory at least.\nShorten is aware of the opportunity low Commonwealth bond rates are creating, and the option of borrowing for infrastructure development has been raised outside Labor circles, by the Productivity Commission for example, and by Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens. He said last month that using public debt to fund infrastructure that earned a return was \"perfectly sensible\".\nThe conference will hear that Labor want to lead and co-ordinate infrastructure investment – but would a Labor government actually be prepared to risk borrowing more at low rates to directly invest in a major infrastructure projects? I am not expecting an answer.", "external_links": ["http://images.theage.com.au/2015/07/24/6712775/mucci.jpg?rand=1437730449189"], "published": "2015-07-25T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-25T22:27:15.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
