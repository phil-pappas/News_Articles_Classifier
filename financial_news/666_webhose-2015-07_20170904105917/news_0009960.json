Did we pay those that have passed through the due process? The answer is yes. Did we pay without approval? The answer is no,\" Mr. Ogiri told PREMIUM TIMES. \n\"I don't need permission from the MD to pay anybody because everything that comes to me gets prior approval from him first and foremost. \n\"The MD is not always in the office and if we have to wait for him, we would not see projects being commissioned. It is the ED Projects and myself that are running that place.\" \nWhen reminded that mostly contractors from Rivers and Delta states were paid, he denied the allegation, saying that it was Mr. Abia that is trying to create a wrong impression about the matter. \n\"Listen to me, I am not the one that awarded the jobs to the contractors we are paying. Most of the jobs were contracts which were awarded by previous boards. \n\"You know we inherited over inherited over N300billion debt. Rivers State is where the NDDC is domiciled and by logical implication, more contractors are bound to do jobs in the state. \n\"Again, the former chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on the NDDC, Mutui Nicholas is from Delta State and the former Senate Committee Chairman, James Manager, is also from Delta State. \n\"These are influential members of the National Assembly. Sometimes, they get more projects in their constituencies and they have a lot of jobs. Besides, most of the jobs that are being done in Rivers State are not done by indigenes of the state.\" \n\"People get letters from different parts of the country to do jobs and when they come, they look at them and say go and do one kilometer road in Port Harcourt. They are not awarded by Henry Ogiri or Tonye Omatsuli. The contracts were not awarded by us. \n\"This is a man (the MD) that is never in the office. Would we have to sit down and wait for him to sign things when he had already given his approval? Everything that comes for payment, he has given an approval.\" \nReminded that the MD might have been going out on official duties, he retorted, \"Which official duties are you talking about? Alright if official duties takes him out of the office, then he is not in the office. \n\"Why didn't he complain about the projects that we paid in Akwa Ibom for people he recommended? Why didn't he complain about them?\" \nMr. Ogiri vowed to sue any journalists or media organisation that publishes any unsubstantiated report about him. \n\"Where will I pack document to and from where. The board is not dissolved. Today, I left the office after 5pm. \n\"The ED Project and I were there. The board is not dissolved for us; it is dissolved because the executive management is still in place. \n\"When I got this job, they gave me a letter from the Presidency through the office of the SGF. When I will be terminated, they will be a letter stipulating that my appointment has been terminated. \n\"And if my appointment which is tenured for four years according to my letter of appointment, then the government will have to pay me for the remaining period. I didn't even know this but I was told in Abuja. \n\"They told me that if they terminate my appointment earlier than the period specified, they will pay me for the remaining period of my tenure. \n\"We are still working until a new board is in place. Don't follow those who say the board was dissolved and we were all carried away. Yes, the board was dissolved but it is the chairman and the state representatives that were dissolved while the executive management is still in place. \n\"If we were asked to go, then the government would have appointed an acting MD or any of the directors to act as sole administrator. I don't think any sole administrator has been appointed sole administrator for the NDDC.\" \nMr. Ogiri said he had nothing to hide but noted that the NDDC is a big mill that manufactures packages and distributes rumour. \nHowever, the Director of Communication in the office of the Head of Service of the Federation, Haruna Imrana, disagrees with Mr. Ogiri. \nIn an interview with PREMIUM TIMES, he said with the dissolution of government's boards, executive directors can no longer function in their respective offices. \n\"Mr. President has dissolved all boards unless of course those that have constitutional diary,\" he said. \n\"All chief executives of those organizations, even though they served on the board, will still maintain their jobs. \n\"If the president is removing chief executives, he will state very clearly that he is removing chief executives, but when he removes the board, it does not affect the chief executives unless it is so specified. \"The MD still retains his job until the president states otherwise. If the other directors were inaugurated as a board, then they have to discontinue their work, but if their job is of a permanent capacity, then of course they remain. \n\"If they were constituted as a board with the chairman, then those ones have been dissolved, but if they were directors in working capacity in the organisation, they are still active.\" Nigeria \nNigerian President Muhammadu Buhari's visit to the United States last week offered an opportunity for both countries to … see more » Copyright © 2015 Premium Times.
