Mohammed || The Economy Times \nStakeholders in Ghana’s cocoa management are highly optimistic that there will be an increase in output in the next season, despite the huge shortfall recorded in this year’s cocoa season. \nSome cocoa farmers say, the next main crop season will no doubt outstrip the disappointing 2014/15 season, adding weight to the forecast by government that next season's output will rise to around 900,000 tonnes. \nGhana's cocoa regulator COCOBOD has purchased 652,986 tonnes of cocoa in the 2014/15 season as of June 26, Deputy Finance Minister CassielAtoForson told parliament, last week. \nThe amount is significantly down on last season but is sufficient to service the US$1.7billion cocoa loan taken by COCOBOD last year, because the regulator forward-sold just 624,500 tonnes as collateral, Forson said. \nGhana's output this season falls short of its initial forecast of more than 1 million tonnes, a fact that has rattled the global cocoa market -- given that the West African country is the world's second-largest producer behind Ivory Coast. \nInvestors confidence in Ghana's ability to forecast its cocoa output took a hit this year, when the regulator, COCOBOD, revised an initial prediction of more than 1 million tonnes made at the start of the season in October to around 700,000 tonnes. \nApparently, some farmers believed that the failure to make enough inputs, such as fertilisers and pesticides, available early in the season is another factor. In their absence, diseases such as black pod flourished, causing cocoa pods to wither on the trees was the major cause of the decline in output. \nThe shortfall and its notice with little warning has hit hard on global cocoa markets because Ghana is the world's largest producer after Ivory Coast. \nHowever, some agriculturalists have asserted that, the rains recorded earlier in the year have yielded a good crop of the flowers that should turn into cocoa pods given the right conditions. \nThey are therefore anticipating that in the (next) main crop the country will experience a bumper harvest. \nDouglas Amankwah, a buyer outside Kumasi in Ashanti Region had expressed that, \"the application of agro chemicals last season was late so it did not have an impact on 2014/15. These agro chemicals will have the result on the 2015/16 main crop,\" he said. \nHis comment was echoed by farmers including Lawrence Adu who pointed to the budding cocoa flowers on the trees on his 13-acre farm at New Tafo, Eastern Region. \"The weather is encouraging,\" he said, because of rains that fell in June and the sun,\" he said.\nAdu estimated that his farm could produce around 25 64-kg bags of cocoa in the season to end in 2016, up from around 21 bags total this season and 23 bags the season before that. \nFarmers cited a variety of reasons for the drop in production this season including old trees, lack of pesticides and other inputs that caused diseases such as black pod and insufficient farmer education about crop maintenance. \nThe government is hoping to get some $1.8 billion loan to fund its cocoa purchases for next season, up from $1.7 billion in 2014. \nThe country saw growth slow sharply in 2014 due to lower global commodity prices and economic instability including a sharply falling currency, damaging Ghana's reputation as one of sub-Saharan Africa's boom markets. \nAt the same time, several farmers in four regions also said prospects for the light crop looked good after a disappointing main crop. \nOverall light crop production, however, would be reduced because of a decision by Cocobod to delay its official opening. The light crop produces only around 10 percent of the total output for the October-September season. \nThe relative failure of the main crop was the reason for the delay, farmers said. A spokesman for the government-run Cocoa Research Institute in Tafo declined to comment. \n\"The light crop will be better (than last year) because we can see the pods shooting up ... but they (COCOBOD) are starting it too late,\" said Yao Kei Adu, a farmer in Maase village outside New Tafo. Cocoa beans were spread out to dry on the ground outside the buyer's office where he sat. \n\"Cocobod sold forward total tonnage of 624,500 and not 900,000tonnes (as targeted). So far we have been able to buy 652,986tonnes, so we should be able to service our obligations as and when they fall due,\" Forson said. \nSome analysts have expressed concern that Ghana may have forward-sold more cocoa than it can produce, jeopardising its ability to repay loans. \nHowever, analysts say forward-selling could also affect the regulator's calculations for next season, for which government has requested a US$1.8billion loan. Ghana's output for next season is forecast at 900,000 tonnes, Forson told Reuters. \n\"Traders have stated they have an obligation via forward contracts to sell 150,000-200,000 tonnes of cocoa in excess of production. These contracts must be rolled forward at an expense to COCOBOD,\" Eurasia Group said in a research note. \nCOCOBOD usually sells-forward around 60-70 percent of its projected crop estimates. The regulator has blamed weather and cyclical factors for the shortfall in production this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T16:30:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
