China's market is largely isolated from other world exchanges, but there are worries the financial damage could hurt the broader Chinese economy, which is the second-largest in the world. There have been signs of overheating in China for a while. Shares in Shanghai more than doubled over the past year, despite evidence the Chinese economy is slowing. Chinese economic growth fell to 7.00 per cent from January through March, the slowest quarter since 2009. And, state-owned media has encouraged ordinary Chinese for months to buy shares. Many borrowed heavily to buy stocks, taking out so-called margin loans. Rising stocks encouraged companies to raise money by issuing shares and to use the proceeds to pay down debt. In the first half of 2015, the Shanghai stock market led the world in initial public offerings: 78 companies issued shares in Shanghai, raising $US16.6 billion ($A22.36 billion), according to a study by the accounting firm EY. Hong Kong was No 2 with 31 deals that raised $US16 billion. Shenzhen was No 5 with 112 deals that raised $US7 billion. Now analysts say the flood of new shares is overwhelming the market and helping to push prices down. Moreover, the government began to worry the market had reached dangerous levels, and Chinese regulators have started to tighten rules on margin lending. After hitting a peak in June, Chinese stocks have been in free-fall. Originally, investors in China and abroad treated the selling as a much-needed release from a market that had soared 150 per cent over the past year. As the losses have deepened, though, worries have increased and officials have taken direct action to stem the selling. Over the weekend, 21 Chinese brokerage companies announced they would create a $US19 billion \"market stabilisation\" fund, and would continue to buy Chinese stocks. Any companies who were going to go public suspended their plans. The selling continued, so Chinese officials announced that major shareholders in companies and executives were banned from selling their holdings for six months. But that's made things worse, and now the selling is affecting Asian markets like Hong Kong and Japan. US stocks also fell sharply Wednesday. Most anxiety-ridden investors have turned to purging stocks that act as a proxy or have direct exposure to China, with most of the damage happening in Hong Kong. The territory's Hang Seng index dropped 5.8 per cent Wednesday, its worst one-day drop since the financial crisis. The Hang Seng China Enterprise Index, which is an index of so called \"H-Share\" companies, or mainland Chinese companies that trade in Shanghai and Shenzhen as well as Hong Kong, fell 6.1 per cent. Outside investors have had directly to Chinese stocks. They've only been able to access the Chinese stock market since October, and that required purchasing stock in Hong Kong. To buy directly in the Chinese stock market required a special licence. While outside investors have limited exposure to China's market, there is still money there. And, institutional investors have pulled $US22 billion out of Chinese stock funds this year, according to EPFR Global. \"Institutional investors have been taking money off the table most of this year and part of last year,\" said Cameron Brandt, director of research at EPFR Global, which tracks fund flows around the world. \"My sense is that they've been expecting something ugly from this retail frenzy that has been driving Chinese markets.\" The biggest concern is whether the drop in China's stock market will cause the country's economy to slow. A weaker Chinese economy could result in lower sales and profits for international companies that do business with China, such as Australia's resource companies. Will they be hurt? Frankly, it's too soon to tell.
