Make sure you compare agents, don’t just go with the nearest on or the first one you meet.\n2. Make sure the agent you choose is qualified and an expert in the area and style of property you are selling.\n3. Discuss thoroughly how much you want to spend on marketing and commission fees before you go ahead.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=How+to+open+your+door+to+a+top+sale&c=SELLING+your+house+is+a+major+event+in+anyone%26%238217%3Bs+life+and+it%26%238217%3Bs+important+not+to+choose+the+first+real+estate+agent+you+meet+if+you+want+a+top+price.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-sell-your-home-for-more-in-a-matter-of-days/story-fnagkbpv-1227454419782?sv=3fa4da4653f330b2c36e31e4d59afa3e", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-sell-your-home-for-more-in-a-matter-of-days/story-fnagkbpv-1227454419782?sv=3fa4da4653f330b2c36e31e4d59afa3e&h=How+to+open+your+door+to+a+top+sale", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-sell-your-home-for-more-in-a-matter-of-days/story-fnagkbpv-1227454419782?sv=3fa4da4653f330b2c36e31e4d59afa3e", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-sell-your-home-for-more-in-a-matter-of-days/story-fnagkbpv-1227454419782?sv=3fa4da4653f330b2c36e31e4d59afa3e", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-sell-your-home-for-more-in-a-matter-of-days/story-fnagkbpv-1227454419782?sv=3fa4da4653f330b2c36e31e4d59afa3e&title=How+to+open+your+door+to+a+top+sale", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/how-to-sell-your-home-for-more-in-a-matter-of-days/story-fnagkbpv-1227454419782?sv=3fa4da4653f330b2c36e31e4d59afa3e&title=How+to+open+your+door+to+a+top+sale"], "published": "2015-07-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-23T17:42:08.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
