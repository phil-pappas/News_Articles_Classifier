Speaking at a public rally here, he asked the people to make the best use of information technology. \"Now the beneficiaries of the old-age allowance scheme would not face any difficulty in availing benefits of the social security pension,\" he said. As the administration has been made more efficient, the pace of development has been accelerated, the chief minister said. \"Soon 50,000 employees would be recruited for which applications are being sought,\" he said. He assured that recruitment would be done in a transparent manner and only the eligible candidates would get jobs. Khattar also urged the people to support the Digital India initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \"The state government is also taking steps to make the best of digital technology,\" he said. The government has also started use of digital technology for e-disha, e-registration, C-form and 24 other services. This will check corruption and ensure time-bound delivery of services, the chief minister said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-08T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T16:41:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
