It is unclear whether it will affect the fiscal year ending March 2015. \n\"In some cases top management and division leaders appeared to have shared a common objective to inflate profits,\" the panel said. \n\"Employees were pressured into inappropriate accounting by postponing loss reports or moving certain costs into later years.\" \nBest known for its televisions and electronics, including the world's first laptop personal computer and DVD player, Toshiba has more than 200,000 employees globally and also operates in power transmission and medical equipment. \nAmong the divisions affected by the inflated profits are the infrastructure, audio-visual and semiconductor businesses, the summary said. \nTanaka is reportedly expected to resign on Tuesday over the scandal, while Norio Sasaki, who served as Toshiba president between June 2009 and June 2013 -- covering most of the period during which the company inflated the profits -- is also expected to step down. \nThe embarrassing findings come less than two months after Japan adopted a long-awaited corporate governance code that backers hoped would usher in a new era of transparency for shareholders in Japanese firms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-21T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-21T08:10:54.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
