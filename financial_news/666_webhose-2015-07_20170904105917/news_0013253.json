Photo: Bloomberg\nThe Australian economy will continue its listless growth in the new financial year as the transition away from mining investment drags its feet, top Australian economists say. But there are signs of life.\nSt George chief economist Hans Kunnen said economic growth was \"lacklustre\" as the transistion from mining to non-mining investment-led growth proved to be a slow process.\nBut he sees bright spots in the economy including the booming housing construction sector, which was benefiting from the nation's record low interest rates, Mr Kunnen said.\nEconomist Michael Blythe says the low interest rates might be counterproductive to capital investment.

It will make us the biggest exporter of LNG in the world, and when you take those export trends and even at today's low commodity prices it translates to an income boost that's worth about 4 per cent of GDP,\" he said.\nThe two interest rate cuts in the first half of this year have kicked along consumer spending and dwelling investment, Mr Kunnen said.\n\"Despite historically low interest rates, businesses are reluctant to invest and waiting to see a sustained pick-up in demand. The process has become somewhat of a vicious circle, as lacklustre economic growth and slow wages growth are keeping consumer demand in check,\" he said.\nThe interest rate cuts haven't had enough time to feed into the economy, and Mr Kunnen said the latest Federal Budget measures supporting small business may be the circuit breaker needed.\nMr Blythe forecast the key cash rate to remain at 2 per cent for an extended period, but noted the cheap rate environment may also be hindering the pace of much-needed capital expenditure.\n\"As the Reserve Bank lowers cash rates and the banks lower their deposit rates companies are coming under increasing pressure [from shareholders] to pay high dividends,\" he said.\n\"The risk is that some of that increase in dividends is being paid for by cutting back capital spending, so rate cuts may in fact not be very helpful at all,\" he said.\nMs Emmett said high hurdle rates - hurdles posed by the minimum returns needed from investments to make them viable - and the short timeframe in which businesses need to recoup their investments were also weighing on business spending.\n\"This is despite the sharp fall in interest rates over recent years, and so it is not clear that even looser monetary policy would help stimulate activity,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:12:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
