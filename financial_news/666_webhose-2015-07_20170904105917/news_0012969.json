But if we do give them money, they'll never give it back.\" \n- 'Lesson in democracy' - \nThousands of Greece supporters have rallied in Barcelona, Paris, Dublin and Frankfurt. \nIn Lisbon, Isabel Pedro, 48, said she was worried about the \"domino effect\" of the crisis, while Nelson da Rocha, 61, said Greece had given \"a lesson in democracy to all Europe\". \nIf Italians were called to vote like the Greeks, 51 percent would support tough measures imposed by Europe to avoid crashing out of the euro, a recent Ipsos (Paris: FR 73298 - news ) poll showed. \nBut some were already looking beyond Sunday's cliffhanger. \nUniCredit (Milan: UCG.MI - news ) analyst Erik Nielsen said the referendum was \"virtually irrelevant\" for the financial markets. \nInstead they are fixed on whether there will be a new Greek government and a July 20 deadline for Athens to repay a big loan to the European Central Bank, he said", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-05T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-05T18:41:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
