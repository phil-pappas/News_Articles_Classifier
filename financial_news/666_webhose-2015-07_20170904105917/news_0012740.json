Jessica Shapiro Share on twitter by James Thomson Brookfield's $9 billion tilt at infrastructure group Asciano is the Canadian giant's biggest play in Australia – but only just.\nThe Toronto-based asset manager, founded in 1899 as a builder and operator of electricity and transport infrastructure in Brazil, acquired the Roberts family's construction group Multiplex in 2007 in deal that valued the company at more than $7 billion, and put the Brookfield name on building sites all over the country.\nAccording to Brookfield's most recent corporate update, the company has $17 billon worth of assets under management in Asia and Australia, and 2500 employees across seven offices.\nThe bulk of that is invested in commercial property – a total of $US8.6 billion ($11 billion), including office towers, apartment buildings and a portfolio of hotels.\nA further $US5.7 billion is tied up in infrastructure (before the Asciano deal, of course) with the Dalrymple Bay coal terminal in north Queensland Brookfield's flagship asset. It also owns more than 5000 kilometres of rail network in the south-west of Western Australia.\nThe construction group retains a strong presence in the Roberts family's home state of Western Australia. Its marquee project is the new Perth Stadium, for which it will provide design and construction services and the finance.\nThe company also operates a local private equity arm.\nAcross the globe the big Canadian has more than $US200 billion ($260 billion) of assets under management, most prominently in the United States, where it owns a range of infrastructure, property and energy assets, with a big focus on renewable power.\n Buying spree planned for some time The asset manager has been preparing for a buying spree for some time. In May, Brookfield Asset Management chief Bruce Flatt told shareholders in a letter that the company was looking to raise about $US21 billion across 2015 and early 2016 to fund a massive buying spree.\nIn addition to raising private funds, the company issued $US1.225 billion worth of stock to add to its war chest.\n\"We are entering an investment phase that will offer us a number of great opportunities,\" Mr Flatt said in the letter to shareholders.\nHe said the focus of the investment spree would be on \"acquiring assets in out-of-favour markets, or assets that have been burdened with too much financial leverage.\n\"In 2009, we invested most of our capital into the US. Today, we are not investing substantial capital in the US but instead are seeing many opportunities in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Asia and Europe.\n\"Each situation is different, but they generally arise due to a market suffering lack of capital, a company that needs to deleverage or they come from out-of-favour sectors or countries.\"\nAsciano might not need to desperately deleverage, or be in an out-of-favour sector, but the ports business is clearly tough, and the end of the commodity boom has hit its rail division.\nBrookfield shares closed at $US34.93 in New York on Wednesday night and are up 20.6 per cent in the past 12 months.\nNow read Chanticleer on the Asciano bid .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mrjthomson"], "published": "2015-07-01T11:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T10:10:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
