More Osborne raises income tax thresholds \nSo far this year, thousands of investors in several commercial property schemes deemed to have abused BPRA rules have been hit with a wave of official demands to repay associated tax reliefs they received. \n“If you were an investor prior to 2013, even if you had done all of your due diligence, there would have been no indication whatsoever of any issue with BPRA,” said Michael Avient, personal tax partner at accountants UHY Hacker Young. \nFollowing the clampdown on arrangements deemed to be tax avoidance, not least film investment schemes, “it was one of the few tax-efficient investments that seemed acceptable,” Mr Avient added. \nBPRA was introduced to encourage the renovation of disused commercial premises as part of policymakers’ efforts to revive deprived areas of the UK. Investors can claim tax relief up to their total qualifying investment. \n“Most BPRA structures really have been involved in the regeneration of cities like Liverpool, creating construction jobs . . . and later employment and tax,” said David Andrews, executive director at wealth manager HFM Columbus. \nIn 2013, HM Revenue & Customs indicated it saw problems with arrangements involving BPRA, drawing parallels with abusive avoidance schemes, and a year later added them to its public “Spotlights” list of arrangements it says taxpayers should avoid. \nGraham Webber, director of WTT Consulting, a tax advisory firm, said the scale of certain projects, such as more than £70m in BPRA funding to convert a Birmingham warehouse to a data centre, prompted closer scrutiny by the government. \nWhere tax relief was not granted to taxpayers before 2013, the Revenue has in most cases withheld it, said Mr Avient. “The Revenue clearly saw a situation where certain structures were stretching the rules too far.” “It is like changing the speed limit on London Bridge from 30 to 20 [miles per hour], then issuing speeding tickets to those who went 25” \n- David Andrews, HFM Columbus \nThis year, it has issued a raft of accelerated payment demands to repay disputed tax to BPRA scheme investors. These tax bills cannot be appealed. \n“People are genuinely very surprised to have received these things relating to BPRA . . . when there are many more aggressive [avoidance] schemes out there,” said Paul Noble, tax director at law firm Pinsent Masons. “A lot of people feel these were rather benign investments done for good purposes.” \nMr Avient said there is a need to distinguish between arrangements that sought to comply with the spirit of BPRA rules, and schemes that pushed the letter of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-14T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T15:19:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
