But the future of Europe is not at stake,\" Merkel told Germany's Bundestag lower house of parliament. \nAfter the call, Eurogroup chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem made clear there were \"no grounds for further talks at this point\" because of the Greek government's refusal to call off the referendum. \nThe ministers \"take note\" of a letter from Tsipras that emerged Wednesday telling creditors he was ready to accept terms they offered at the weekend. \nThe letter added however that any deal would have to allow Greece to maintain a 30 percent VAT discount on islands and postpone a 2012 pension reform until October 2015. \n\"We will simply await now the outcome of the referendum on Sunday and take into account the outcome of that referendum,\" added Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister. \n- Referendum standards 'fall short' - \nBut there were signs the crisis was opening rifts in Europe's united front, with France's leader Francois Hollande urging an \"immediate agreement\" after six months of stalemate with the radical leftists in Athens. \nAhead of the referendum, an opinion poll on Wednesday showed the 'No' camp in the lead with 46 percent, against 37 percent for 'Yes' and 17 percent undecided. The 'No' vote share was down compared to before capital controls were introduced Sunday. \nMeanwhile, the Council of Europe, a pan-European group which promotes the rule of law, said the vote fell short of its standards. \nIt said the referendum was organised too quickly and that the question was not clear. \nThe European Central Bank's governing council was also meeting Wednesday to discuss the crisis in Greece. \nIt was the ECB's decision on Sunday to refuse to increase emergency funding for Greek banks that pushed Athens to close lenders and impose the capital controls, and it is thought likely to stick with its current stance. \nGreece faces further big repayments to the ECB on July 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-01T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-01T22:12:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
