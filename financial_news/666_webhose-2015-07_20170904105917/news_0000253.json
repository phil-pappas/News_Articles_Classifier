These fees vary from country to country and MasterCard's rules prevent retailers from benefiting from lower fees in other countries.\nThe Commission also says fees charged to merchants when non-European card holders shop in Europe \"may not be justified.\"\nMasterCard says it is \"working with the European Commission on the issue as part of an ongoing constructive dialogue.\"\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-09T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-09T23:29:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
