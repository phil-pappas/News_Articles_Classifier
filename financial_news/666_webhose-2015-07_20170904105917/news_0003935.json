The mission is to help start or advise to start a centre of excellence for the field of cancer, which the country really needs. \nWhy do you think it is important for the country to have such a centre? \nIf you really go to see the country you have about 45 million people with 55,000 cases of cancer and 35,000 have been detected and only 5,000 of them have been treated. \nThis means 30,000 of patients die without being treated. So the potential to treat these cancer patients is tremendous. At the moment we got the centre in Dar es Salaam, called Ocean Road Cancer Centre, which treats about 5,000 to 6,000 new cases a year. We have got another centre in Bugando, which also takes cancer patients. \nBut the need for the whole North East area and North West area is huge. The main idea is that it could also help cancer patients coming from other countries cross- by. \nCan you elaborate, what are major cancer cases are affecting Tanzanians. \nThe main cancers in Tanzania depend upon the sex, that is; whether one is male or female. In males, there are prostate and esophagus cancers. You have also lungs, which are very common and colon cancer which is on the rise. In female, the most common cancers are still breast cancer and cervix cancer in addition to other types of cancers mentioned for males. \nGoing by these statistics, what urgent measures should be done to arrest the situation? \nMajority of patients come in stage three and step four. So the most important thing to be done now is to start excellent various cancer centres first. \nAt the same time educate the people about primary cancer detection, do much awareness programme, have immunisation against certain virus and develop cancer centers where surgery, chemotherapy can be given to the patients. \nThe move aimed at constructing the cancer centre by VIP Engineering and Marketing Limited is in good shape following the support expressed by the regional authorities in Kagera. What do you think VIP is now required to do? \nThe first thing to do is to acquire the right piece of land meant for hospitals with all facilities with proper road facility, which is the most important thing. Easy access to the area is very important. There should have their own electricity set up, including heavy duty generator. \nThis centre should be accessible or very close to the airport, like the Bukoba Airport, which is being proposed because you will have patients coming from the entire world, you will have patients coming from other countries in the near future. \nI have learnt that VIP Company needs about 100 acres of land for construction of the cancer centre. It appears this is very big area. . \nI am not thinking in terms only a cancer centre. What I would advise what to do is to start with the cancer centre, you need also to have a multispecialty hospital attached to the centre to treat other diseases because cancer patients may get heart attack, can also get ecological problems can also need plastic surgery. \nSo, you require all facilities under the same roof. At the same time, you have to receive other patients coming from far away requiring lodging facility for them to board. Then you have to build enough buildings for those people to accommodate for long treatment schedules of six to eight weeks. \nAt the same time you have international patients who will come in. You will require better lodging facilities for them. So you will require small hotels, camping facilities, store houses and quarters because you will have doctors and nurses staying in the campus and not far away. \nSo you will require building many quarters for doctors, junior staff and for nurses. All the period of time you will require even nursing college to be built to improve the quality of care. \nFinally a medical school, for which you will require again a land for editorial, for hostels, for guardians, for water treatment plans for roads and all these things, should come from the same area and, thus the 100 acres would be the most suitable. \nYou proposed the cancer centre to be built in Bukoba Municipality. What were the reasons for your selection? \nI have gone by roads from Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Dodoma, Shinyanga to Bukoba and crossed the lake to Mwanza. I went to Arusha, Moshi, Tanga and back to Dar es Salaam just to study the whole country. We have gone to the most remote areas and studied the primary health centres and thus I am confident enough to recommend this place. \nThe reason is that Dar es Salaam has a cancer centre, which could deal with the patients coming from the South. Cancer patients should not travel more than 200 kilometres for treatments. You cannot travel 800 km everyday and every second day when a patient is in pain. \nSo looking at the map, Bukoba is at the centre between the five other located countries, like Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Kenya and DR Congo. So this is the most ideal location to start a cancer centre. Secondly, even in major cities it is difficult to get piece of land. \nFor example, Dar es Salaam is fully occupied. Bukoba is the most ideal location with ideal climate and is close to the airport. It is also very important to bring in medicines, isotopes and doctors coming from outside. So an airport is a must and should be very close to the hospital. \nTo get a huge piece of land next to an airport is impossible to other cities. This is the most ideal place. Finally, the most cancer cases are coming from lake area. So it will be an inconvenience for them to travel long distances for treatment. \nWhat is the economic impact behind the construction of the cancer centre not only in Kagera Region, but also Tanzania as a whole? \nIt is a big boom for the country. Most of cancer patients are going abroad. There is no cancer surgery in the country. There is no cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There is only one center that is Ocean Road Cancer Centre. But it does not have adequate facilities as was expect for a cancer center to have today. \nThese patients go abroad, but what would be the costs; a patient has to go with three other people to care for him or her. Imagine costs of tickets, staying and medicine. \nTo some extent, the government has been taking steps to fight the disease. You could see efforts made to improve services at Ocean Road Cancer Centre. But these efforts have not been successful enough... \nI congratulate the government for the efforts, but these efforts must be focused and that is the place where they have not concentrated. \nThey have made just general efforts to improve cancer care, but they need to go for proper screening for the country to maintain a cancer registry, to have immunization programmes against cancer, having awareness programme is lacking in the country.
