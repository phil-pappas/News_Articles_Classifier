Peter Braig Share on twitter Share on Google Plus by John Kehoe Trade ministers from 12 Pacific Rim countries including Australia are on the brink of striking a preliminary deal on a major new trade and investment pact that would boost trade across the fast-growing region and cement America's leadership in Asia.\nResistance from a stubborn Canada and protectionist Malaysia are emerging as the biggest hurdles ahead of a crucial Trans-Pacific Partnership meeting starting in Hawaii on Tuesday.\nTrade negotiators believe sealing ministerial-level deal on the TPP on the island of Maui is critical, because further delays risk negotiations dragging the talks into the US election season where populist anti-free trade rhetoric could jeopardise any deal.\nTrade sources say that an in-principle TPP deal at the Maui meeting would allow time for legal documents to be prepared for leaders like US President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Tony Abbott to officially sign at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in the Philippines in November.\nMatthew Goodman, a former international economic adviser to President Obama and now an Asia Pacific adviser at Washington think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said trade ministers like US Trade Representative Mike Froman would make a concerted effort to \"get an initial agreement done in Maui\".\n\"I don't think Froman would have called this meeting unless he thought he had a good shot,\" said Mr Goodman, who has been speaking to government officials from the countries involved in the talks.\nCanada, Malaysia biggest obstacles The meeting of trade ministers at Maui beginning Tuesday may drag on beyond the scheduled Friday finish into the weekend, people close to the talks said.\n The TPP is a proposed accord that would cover more than 40 per cent of the world's economy and set sweeping new rules for trade, investment, intellectual property, state-owned enterprises, labour and the environment.\nThe 12 TPP countries are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. Notably, it excludes China, which was unable to meet the rules seeking to level the playing field for private companies against favoured state-owned enterprises.\nThe TPP is central to the Obama administration's \"rebalance\" to Asia. The President has championed the mooted deal at home as a way for the US to set the economic rules in the region, to trump emerging rival China.\nThe most contentious issues in the TPP chapters are on agriculture, intellectual property rights and state-owned enterprises. The US is aggressively pushing to strengthen IP protections for its pharmaceutical, technology and entertainment companies.\nTrade and investment Minister Andrew Robb will represent Australia at the talks. Better market access for Australian farmers, including sugar in the US and dairy in Canada, are likely to figure prominently in Australia's final push.\nHowever, Canada is a potential stumbling block because the conservative government is reluctant to open up its protected dairy and poultry sectors ahead of an election in October.\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper needs to secure votes from rural farming districts cosseted by the severe limits on foreign imports. The ruling Conservative Party's caution was amplified by a shock loss at the Alberta province election in May.\nComplicating the final TPP stages, the scandal-plagued Malaysian government is resisting reforms to state owned enterprises and opening up government procurement contracts to foreign firms. Some trade officials are privately discussing the possibility of Malaysia being left out of the pact.\n\"Canada and Malaysia are the real problems in trying to get a deal done at Maui,\" Mr Goodman said.\nJapan on board More promisingly, the US and Japan, the TPP's two largest economies, have virtually agreed to a deal on cutting tariffs and other import restrictions on their respective agriculture and automotive markets.\n\"Japanese and US agreement on multiple issues in early July makes a broader agreement by all 12 countries more likely\" said IHS country risk senior analyst Alison Evans.\n\"Both US President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have used political capital to push their respective trade policies.\"\nPresident Obama is required to give Congress 90 days notice before he signs a deal and must publicly release the agreement 60 days before signing.\nGiven this timetable, achieving a ministerial-level agreement in Maui would allow time for a deal to be formalised in a legal document ahead of the APEC leaders meeting at Manila on November 18-19.\nAustralia likely to agree to ISDS Australia has told the US it will not jeopardise the government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by giving into demands on unfettered IP rights for American drug companies.\nHowever, Mr Robb has signalled Australia is willing to agree to a Investor State Dispute Settlement mechanism, an international arbitration procedure giving a foreign investor the right to sue a foreign government over a law, regulation or court ruling.\nThe ISDS is contentious because it has been criticised by the Productivity Commission and Reserve Bank of Australia board member Heather Ridout, who warned this month that Australia would regret signing away its rights. The Labor opposition has also voiced concerns about ISDS .\nMr Robb was on leave last week, but Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said ISDS provisions provide safeguards for foreign investors against \"government expropriation of investment without compensation or discrimination against foreign investor\".\nThe White House and congressional leaders are aiming to push the TPP through Congress before the 2016 election year begins.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Johnkehoe23", "https://plus.google.com/https://plus.google.com/u/2/b/117110503471959828934/105888713093633772087/posts"], "published": "2015-07-26T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-26T06:17:22.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
