Originally built in 1994, the Chico Walmart project will expand existing grocery and general merchandise sales and create about 85 new jobs for the local community. \n\"Having been a part of the Chico community for over 20 years, we are always looking for better ways to serve our customers,\" said Chico Walmart Store Manager Kim Turner. \"Our customers will be excited about the changes coming to their Chico store. It will allow us to offer our customers greater selection and service, and create new jobs for the community.\" \nABOUT THE PROPOSED CHICO WALMART REMODEL The remodel project includes additional food and general merchandise sales floor area, additional stockroom, office and support areas; a new drive-through pharmacy, fueling station and a drive-through grocery/merchandise pickup service. The store's pickup service allows customers to order groceries and/or general merchandise online from Walmart's website, and conveniently pick up their products at the store. The plan calls for increasing the size of the store by approximately 64,386 square feet for a total store size of approximately 190,275 square feet. \nIn addition, the interior and exterior of the store will undergo a complete renovation, including parking lot lighting and signage, and landscaping. The proposed project will maintain solar panels that currently exist and incorporate sustainability features in building and site design with the goal of reaching a building efficiency rating that is greater than the Title 24 requirement. \nPOSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES The store will be part of a local solution to create new jobs and economic opportunities, and bring about 85 new job opportunities to the community, plus construction jobs. \nWith more taxable goods on the shelves, the store will generate additional tax revenue to help fund important public services like police, fire, parks and neighborhood services. \nIn 2015, Walmart announced bold new Associate Opportunity Initiatives to help associates in the U.S. earn higher pay and advance their careers based on the skills they learn and the customer service they provide. Many Walmart associates have long careers with the company. In fact, nearly 75% of Walmart's store management team began their careers as hourly associates. \nThis past Memorial Day, Walmart announced an expansion of its veterans hiring commitment, guaranteeing a job offer to any eligible U.S. veteran honorably discharged from active duty since the original launch of the Veterans Welcome Home Commitment on Memorial Day 2013. The previous commitment was for veterans within 12 months off active duty. \nSince Memorial Day 2013, Walmart has hired more than 3740 veterans across California. For more information about Walmart's Veterans Welcome Home Commitment please visit: www.walmartcareerswithamission.com . \nWalmart offers competitive benefits, including health care coverage, 401(k) plans, career training programs, performance-based bonuses and opportunities for advancement. \nAs of April 2015, the average wage for regular, full-time hourly associates in California is $13.33 per hour. \nSERVING LOCAL CHARITIES AND CAUSES In 2014, the Chico store contributed $13,000 to local organizations that support youth education and sports, and children services, public safety and animal welfare. Also in 2014, the Walmart Foundation's California State Giving Program contributed $35,000 to Jesus Provides Daily Bread for their community farm job-training program. \nAn architectural rendering of the proposed project is available upon request. \nFor more information Walmart Media Relations, 800-331-0085 or http://news.walmart.com/reporter Walmart information online: www.corporate.walmart.com ; merchandise sales: www.walmart.com \nAbout Walmart Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.
