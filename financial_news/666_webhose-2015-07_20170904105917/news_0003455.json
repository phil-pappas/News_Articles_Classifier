Overnight, the parliament in Athens passed a second set of economic reforms asked of by creditors, paving the way for negotiations on a third bailout package to start. \nThat came as Greece and its creditors worked to finalise a new Memorandum of Understanding. \nEuro/dollar ended the day at 1.0987, up by 0.56% at the end of the day, and gained another 1.19% to 0.7081. UK retail sales volumes shrank by 0.2% month-on-month in June, undershooting forecasts for a rise of 0.3%. \nMore significant, in an exclusive interview with Market News International , which was released after the close of trading, Ian McCafferty said the MPC's \"clear cut\" decision not to hike Bank Rate at its July meeting was taken when there was maximum uncertainty over Greece. \nThe rate-setter, a well-known hawk on the MPC, placed weight on the strength seen in total UK earnings - including bonuses that is - especially within the private sector, while emphasising the central bank should not fear an appreciation in sterling in reaction to a rate hike. \nCable came off by 0.63% to finish at 1.5517. \nStrong data Stateside also proved a drag, as weekly initial unemployment claims fell to 255,000, their lowest since November of 1973. \nNonetheless, economists at Barclays (LSE: BARC.L - news ) explained how they \"only took a partial signal from the drop in initial claims, given the large weekly change in the seasonal adjustment factor and the seasonal retooling of auto plants.\" Dollar/yen slipped 0.09% to reach 123.88. \nThe Aussie retreated 0.28% to close at 0.7357.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T20:05:33.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
