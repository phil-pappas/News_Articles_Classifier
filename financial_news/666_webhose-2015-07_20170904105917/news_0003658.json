The industry has over the years created employment for millions of Ghanaians and serves as a major source of foreign exchange earner for the country,' Mr Avedzi said, stressing that cocoa production in the country has been increasing, reaching an all time high of over one million metric tonnes in the 2010/2011 crop season. \nHe indicated that the increase in the levels of production requires substantial financial resources to enable the Ghana Cocoa Board to finance the purchase of cocoa beans. \nThe ranking member of Finance, Dr Anthony Akoto Osei asked COCOBOD to use the money for the intended purpose so that the target of 900,000 tonnes would be achieved. \nHe also called on COCOBOD to properly account for monies used to construct ‘cocoa roads’ in the country. \nLast two weeks, the ranking member of Food, Agriculture and Cocoa Affairs, Dr Owusu Afriyie Akoto asked the Minister of Finance in Parliament why the government came to House for $1 billion syndicated loan to purchase about 850,000 metric tonnes of cocoa for the 2014/2015 crop season but bought only 650,000 metric tones. \nThe ranking member expressed dissatisfaction with the government for not paying much attention to the cocoa industry which has been performing badly over the past six years. \nBy Thomas Fosu Jnr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T22:44:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
