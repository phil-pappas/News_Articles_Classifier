Peter Braig/Fairfax Media by Carrie LaFrenz Patrick Johnson never thought there was would be much of a market for his bespoke suits in hot and sweaty Singapore – but clicks on social media sites such as Instagram made him realise otherwise.\n\"We are small but can get our brand out the world via social media,\" Johnson says of his label P.Johnson Tailors.\n\"Singapore is not a market we thought about heading. We did one trunk show and it went well. Our customers in Asia… especially Singapore and Indonesia are really focused on social meda,\" he says. \"It's very effective there.\nFrom start-ups to large corporations, brands are using social media to find new customers offshore and develop strong brand awareness. Piqora, which helps companies track usage on sites such as Pinterest and Twitter, found that a pin on Pinterest – which signifies that a user likes a photo – generates on average 78¢ in sales and drives page views for several months.\nInstagram has been a weapon of Australian brands Frank's Body Scrub and swimwear label Triangl, which has 2.7 million followers. US giant Williams-Sonoma, which also owns West Elm and Pottery Barn, used social media to launch its Melbourne West Elm store 2013.\nRob Blythe, a former Macquarie retail analyst and one of Johnson's business partners, says they picked New York – where P.Johnson recently opened a showroom – and Singapore after their brand got traction in those markets via the web.\n\"I thought when I first went to Singapore no one had a suit jacket on and I thought 'what have we done?' But there are an emerging group of guys who want to dress better,\" he says.\nThe brand has been built on word of mouth and has never used paid advertising. P.Johnson also uses its 29 trained tailors or apprentices who actively play a part in building the network.\n But it's not all about Instagram. Johnson warns there needs to be \"many facets to your brand communication\". Some aspiring retailers get so obsessed with posting shots on social media they forget the main game.\nManhattan-based Johnson, who this week picked up the prestigious Woolmark prize for his menswear range, says the focus now is about pushing the business into the US.\n\"We are the first Australian menswear brand to open in Manhattan. It's time for an Australian clothing brand to get there and take over, and I think we can do it.\"\nGina Lednyak is the chief executive and founder of L&A Social Media which advises companies such as Nudie and Sol Beer. She agrees with Johnson that you can't just use social media to talk to your customers.\n\"Social media is a way to really target your audience through storytelling, rather than just selling them product,\" she says. There must be an integrated approach to the way you market your business. Social media is a net that underlays your marketing activities. Only part of our lives are online.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T13:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:14:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
