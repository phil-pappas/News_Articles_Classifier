Source: Supplied\n“He told me he really needed this job to turn his life around and he did everything but beg but he just didn’t present properly.”\nThinking he would use his many years of experience to offer job seekers some important advice, he posted a note to a local community noticeboard on Facebook.\nIt included the following:\n“Probably wasting my time here, but if I can help one person then I will take the risk that I am probably going to get some haters over this,” he started off.\nHe went on to advise applicants to put some effort into their application and take some time selling themselves if they really want the job.\n“Don’t just send a resume with no cover letter and avoid using template forms that simply require you to cut and paste your name”, he wrote.\n“And if you do make it to the next step, make it count.”\n“Show the interviewer that you give a dam and yes you WANT this job. DONT eat and drink at the interview, talking to someone that is sucking on a milkshake screams to me zero interest,” Mr Carlsen advised.\nBut some people didn’t like what they saw. And the online hate rolled in.\n“I actually took it down because of the haters, unfortunately because it got to the point where it just turned into a manhunt at the end,” he said.\n“I got attacked where people were having a go at the employer about their rights and what the employers should be doing for them and it got quite nasty.”\nPeople who been unsuccessful in the past also took the opportunity to tell Mr Carlsen to ‘go f--- himself’.\nBut it’s not just Mr Carlsen who is seeing this trend.\nJane Lowder, career coach and founder of MAX Coaching, said the issue of poor preparation and execution during the application process seemed to be an ‘odd phenomenon’.\nA lack of career counselling in schools that help prepare students for the workforce and a way into it could be partly to blame, Ms Lowder said.\nMax Coaching founder and career coach Jane Lowder.

We are so attuned to beige connecteds to our smart phones or our devices that they consume our attention and we’re not very got at being in the moment,” Ms Lowder said.\nQuestions to ask in a job interview 2:05 Play video\nDavid Koch says job hunting is a two-way street so be prepared\nnews.com.au 28 Oct 2014 Lifestyle/Money Saver HQ Lifestyle/Money Originally published as How not to turn up for job interviews ", "external_links": ["http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/sydney-business-owner-attacked-on-facebook-for-offering-job-seekers-interview-advice/story-fnkgbb3b-1227451103513?sv=1e9679a4b8047c57416964cb9f67c13&title=How+not+to+turn+up+for+job+interviews", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-business-owner-attacked-on-facebook-for-offering-job-seekers-some-logical-advice/story-fni0cx4q-1227450969272", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/sydney-business-owner-attacked-on-facebook-for-offering-job-seekers-interview-advice/story-fnkgbb3b-1227451103513?sv=1e9679a4b8047c57416964cb9f67c13&title=How+not+to+turn+up+for+job+interviews", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/sydney-business-owner-attacked-on-facebook-for-offering-job-seekers-interview-advice/story-fnkgbb3b-1227451103513?sv=1e9679a4b8047c57416964cb9f67c13", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=How+not+to+turn+up+for+job+interviews&c=IT%26%238217%3BS+NOT+good+form+to+turn+up+to+a+job+interview+in+dirty+clothes.+But+one+Sydney+business+owner+has+been+slammed+on+facebook+for+giving+some+well-meaning+advice.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/sydney-business-owner-attacked-on-facebook-for-offering-job-seekers-interview-advice/story-fnkgbb3b-1227451103513?sv=1e9679a4b8047c57416964cb9f67c13", "http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/sydney-business-owner-attacked-on-facebook-for-offering-job-seekers-interview-advice/story-fnkgbb3b-1227451103513?sv=1e9679a4b8047c57416964cb9f67c13&h=How+not+to+turn+up+for+job+interviews", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/ZmbDRkcToSVsc6K3bYzsgnDJgdNXwGWz/promo238720381&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/sydney-business-owner-attacked-on-facebook-for-offering-job-seekers-interview-advice/story-fnkgbb3b-1227451103513?sv=1e9679a4b8047c57416964cb9f67c13"], "published": "2015-07-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-22T13:29:16.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
