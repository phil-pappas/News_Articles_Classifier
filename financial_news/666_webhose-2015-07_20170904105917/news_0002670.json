Authorities have been taking preemptive steps since last November when the People's Bank of China (HKSE: 3988.HK - news ) , the central bank, made the first of four cuts to benchmark interest rates. \nIt has also reduced bank reserve requirements in a bid to boost lending. Such measures can take time to affect growth. \nChina's total trade declined in the first half of this year, official data showed Monday, falling well short of the government's targets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-15T06:46:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
