TUI said it did not currently have any customers in the country.\nA total of 38 people were killed when Saif Rezgui opened fire on holidaymakers at the resort of Sousse two weeks ago. In March, two gunmen killed 24 people dead, 21 of them foreign tourists, in an attack at the Bardo museum in the Tunisian capital Tunis.\nThe cancellation of holidays to Tunisia could prove costly for TUI and Thomas Cook.\nHolidays in North Africa account for about 10 percent of their total passengers, with Tunisia about a third of that.\nShares in the two tour operators have fallen over the last two weeks, hurt mainly by the deadly attack on tourists at Sousse and the cost of cancellations and rebooking.
