It’s just that I have neither the time nor the inclination to take on that task myself. My solution for many years consisted of one of two time-tested methods: (1) I asked my wife if she could do it (and I asked really, really nicely), or (2) I paid a dry cleaner to handle the chore (no niceties involved). More often than not, I opted for the latter, which resulted in hundreds of dollars in cleaning bills on an annual basis.\nCharles Passy modeling one of his $18 wrinkle-free shirts from Costco. But for as long as I can now remember, I’ve gone the wrinkle-free route. That is, I only buy shirts that come out of the dryer without needing any tending. In the past, I’ve spent about $40 to $75 for such shirts. These days, I get them at Costco — for under $20 a pop. They last at least a year and have become the cornerstone of my cheapskate wardrobe.\nI’m hardly alone in this regard. Over the past couple of decades, such shirts have become a standard in menswear (and to some extent, in women’s clothing, too), with major names, from Sears to Brooks Brothers, offering them. (A few years back, Brooks Brothers reported that the wrinkle-free category constituted 70% of its shirt business.) Little wonder that the dry cleaning business has been relatively flat lately: From 2009 to 2012, industry revenue climbed by a mere 0.2% to $22 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\nI can’t say enough about the shirts: They not only retain their shape from wash to wash, but also hold up during the course of a day — even a sticky summer day when every other item of clothing seems destined to look like a wilted piece of lettuce. And not having to go to the dry cleaner is about more than saving money; it’s also about saving time. You know those groggy mornings when you have to get dressed and head to the cleaners just to pick up the clothes you’ll actually wear that day? They’re a distant memory for me.\nOK, OK, so I’m a fan of non-iron shirts. But who isn’t? Well, it turns out, a lot of folks are fairly skeptical about the merits of going wrinkle-free. For starters, they don’t like the fact that the shirts are the apparel equivalent of trans fats or Teflon pans — meaning something a step removed from nature. Sure, the shirts can be made of 100% cotton, but that doesn’t take into account what they’re treated with to have the necessary stiffness and resilience: formaldehyde (the same stuff used at your local mortuary for embalming purposes). That has led to concerns the shirts could pose a health risk — formaldehyde is indeed a “dangerous chemical,” as Scientific American reported in a story on wrinkle-free apparel. But since we’re talking small amounts of formaldehyde, the concerns have generally been dismissed. At worst, users may find that the shirts irritate their skin, but “the vast majority of us … can wear this apparel sans worry, sans any ill effects,” Scientific American noted.\nStill, that’s not to say the shirts always deliver on their promise. They may stay wrinkle-free, but they can have a host of other issues: Some critics say they’re too stiff, others say they’re too clammy. And even fans of the shirts admit the garments sometimes fail to hold their shape, particularly the cheaper versions. “It is my experience that non-iron shirts are not created equally,” says Ramsey A. Bahrawy, an attorney in North Andover, Mass., who wears a dress shirt to work every day.\nSo, what’s the final verdict? I talked to a dry-cleaning pro, Jerry Pozniak, owner of Jeeves New York, a high-end cleaner that charges $12 a shirt, who’s actually a big fan of wrinkle-free apparel. The key, he says, is definitely not to go super-cheap: He likes the Charles Tyrwhitt non-iron shirts, which can be had for around $70 apiece. Oh, and he also says the shirts should be pressed — at least occasionally. As he points out, wrinkle-free isn’t quite the same as “crisp,” and you only get that freshly ironed look when a shirt is, well, ironed (or pressed). But the advantage that wrinkle-free shirts still have is that “they stay nicer during the workday,” Pozniak says.\nI’m probably not going to take all of Pozniak’s advice. The under-$20 Costco shirts are fine by my admittedly plebeian standards. But I might now be inclined to take them to the cleaners to get them pressed at least once every few months. Or I might even reacquaint myself with my iron — if only I could remember where I put it.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T03:25:31.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
