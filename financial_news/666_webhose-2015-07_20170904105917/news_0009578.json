Michele Mossop Share on twitter by Jacob Greber Fears of a cost of living crisis are hugely overblown, shows official data that indicates typical prices paid by workers, pensioners and welfare recipients are growing at less than a third of the historical average.\nIn figures that will weaken union claims for above-inflation pay hikes, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said prices paid by a typical wage earner rose by an annual 0.9 per cent in the June quarter.\nThat was well below the 2.9 per cent average annual increase of the past 16 years and a far cry from the 4.8 per cent recorded at the height of the boom era in 2011, when commodity prices hit record levels.\nPensioners and welfare recipients faced similar benign cost hikes as working households, with self-funded retirees paying 1.2 per cent more for their expenses compared with a year earlier, one of the softest increases on record.\nThe data supported the view that the economy was starting to adjust to the realities of life after the resources boom, which had been marked by a falling terms of trade, soft wages growth and tame inflation that had given the Reserve Bank of Australia scope to cut official interest rates to a record low of 2 per cent, with further easing still on the table.\n\"This is what happens in the shadow of a very large boom that drove up a lot of those costs,\" said Stephen Walters, chief economist at JPMorgan.\nIndicators 'coming down' \"The whole suite of nominal indicators is coming down – the terms of trade, cost of living indexes, wages growth – everything is settling at lower growth rates.\"\n On Wednesday Mr Walters downgraded his estimate of the economy's potential growth rate from 3.1 per cent to 2.75 per cent, after last weeks' warning by RBA governor Glenn Stevens that the economy's effective natural rate may have slowed since the financial crisis.\nThe economy would grow 2.5 per cent this year, which was 0.3 percentage points slower than previously forecast, and 3 per cent in 2016, said JPMorgan.\nMr Walters said the decline in cost of living index growth was significant because such indicators were often cited by trade unions seeking to negotiate bigger wage gains.\nEmployment Minister Eric Abetz seized on the figures to attack the Commonwealth Public Sector Union's 12 per cent wage claim over three years, which he described as out of touch with the economy and a threat to employment.\nMr Abetz said the CPSU had often used the cost of living index to portray previous wage offers unfavourably.\n\"Unlike the CPSU, Australian Public Service employees understand that the government needs to live within its means,\" he said in a statement. \"It is simply not possible to agree to the CPSU's claims without it resulting in 10,000 job losses across the sector.\"\nCPSU national secretary Nadine Flood, said workers want real wages and rights protected, with border protection workers standing to lose $8000 a year in take-home pay.\n\"The Minister can spin as hard as he likes, but an $8000 cut is not being better off,\" she said.\n\"Minister Abetz has consistently trotted out his excessive pay rise line and the more he says it, the angrier public sector workers get.\n\"They know they're facing massive cuts to their current pay packets and they also know the minister has refused repeated requests to sit down with the union and discuss a sensible settlement to this dispute.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobgreber"], "published": "2015-07-29T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T16:37:33.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
