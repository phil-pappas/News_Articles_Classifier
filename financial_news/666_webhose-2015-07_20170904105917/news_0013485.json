Those interest payments are increasingly crowding out more efficient public spending, and already represent the seventh largest expense item in the budget.\nIn 2015-16, the government will spend $15.561 billion on interest payments — 14 times the annual budget of the ABC.\nThe report, “ Canberra’s debt problem: Where’s the money gone? ”, argues Australia has already lost control of its ballooning public debt burden, and that the public debt load is unsustainable — not in the future, but right now.\nWhether public debt is unsustainable is determined by comparing the actual budget balance achieved by government versus the level of budget balance needed to stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio.\nIn 2014-15, Australia needed a budget surplus equivalent to 0.5 per cent of GDP, and recorded a deficit equivalent to 1.7 per cent of GDP. For the following year, the deficit is equivalent to 1.2 per cent of GDP.\nThat means despite its talk, the Abbott government did not achieve the budget surplus necessary to stabilise Australia’s public debt trajectory in the long run.\n“We have found empirically that Australian federal government debt is unsustainable,” IPA senior research fellow Dr Mikayla Novak said. “It’s unsustainable now, not in 10, 15 or 20 years time, because our economy isn’t growing fast enough.”\nThe $129 billion splashed out on ongoing expenditure and transfers was a “story of missed opportunity”, she said. “Federal public debt is in part being used to fund ongoing payments and transfers by the government.\n“That flouts a basic rule of public finance: if you go into debt, you need to spend the borrowing proceeds on capital works and infrastructure.”\nFormer Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief economist Saul Eslake said while he agreed that successive governments had failed to bring the budget under control, he didn’t agree the current level of debt was unsustainable.\n“There’s a difference between unsustainable and undesirable,” he said. “It would be desirable if public debt were lower.”\nMr Eslake agreed governments of both parties had baulked at significant cuts in areas they regarded as politically sensitive to them. “I think it’s fair to say that insufficient attention has been given to reining in recurrent spending,” he said.\n“And as the IMF pointed out last week and [Reserve Bank governor] Glenn Stevens two weeks before, it might have been more conducive to better economic performance if successive governments had been willing to do more infrastructure spending, either themselves or via the states.”\nFinance Minister Mathias Cormann said since coming into government, the Coalition had been able to reduce spending growth and get the budget “on a believable track to surplus”.\n“Labor in government spent too much, locked Australia into an unsustainable, unaffordable spending growth trajectory and wasted way too much taxpayers’ money,” Senator Cormann said.\n“As well as reducing spending growth overall, we have redirected a significant proportion of recurrent expenditure into investments in productivity enhancing economic infrastructure.”\nfrank.chung@news.com.au\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.newsvine.com/_wine/save?popoff=0&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-129-billion-budget-black-hole/story-e6frflo9-1227426080690?sv=c6705ed44b9462edb0a2a6b79c42ee1c&h=The+%24129+billion+black+hole", "http://www.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=postto&t=The+%24129+billion+black+hole&c=AUSTRALIA+has+splashed+%24129%26nbsp%3Bbillion+in+borrowed+cash+on+welfare+handouts+and+other+payments+since+2008+%26%238212%3B+and+we+can+no+longer+afford+it.&u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-129-billion-budget-black-hole/story-e6frflo9-1227426080690?sv=c6705ed44b9462edb0a2a6b79c42ee1c", "http://www.kwoff.com/submit.php?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-129-billion-budget-black-hole/story-e6frflo9-1227426080690?sv=c6705ed44b9462edb0a2a6b79c42ee1c", "http://www.ipa.org.au/portal/uploads/2Jul15-MN-Canberra_debt_problem_wheres_the_money_gone.pdf", "http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-129-billion-budget-black-hole/story-e6frflo9-1227426080690?sv=c6705ed44b9462edb0a2a6b79c42ee1c&title=The+%24129+billion+black+hole", "http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-129-billion-budget-black-hole/story-e6frflo9-1227426080690?sv=c6705ed44b9462edb0a2a6b79c42ee1c", "http://digg.com/submit?phase=2&url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/the-129-billion-budget-black-hole/story-e6frflo9-1227426080690?sv=c6705ed44b9462edb0a2a6b79c42ee1c&title=The+%24129+billion+black+hole"], "published": "2015-07-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T21:19:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
