Other parts of the world face similar problems: antiquated infrastructure and water loss. Touching on the issue of water scarcity, Rickards said that the volume of water in the world never changes; it is clean water that is running out. \"That's what happened in California,\" he said, referring to that state's lengthy drought .California Gov. Jerry Brown has ordered communities to reduce water use by about 25% to address falling reservoir levels. A preliminary study in May by the University of California, Davis estimated the drought would cost approximately $2.7 billion in economic losses this year. The drought is entering its fifth year with few signs of ending. \n\"Yes, we are talking about a water scarcity crisis, but, we're talking about, I would argue, a finance and capital crisis at the same time,\" he said. \"Why when interest rates are so low, are more investments not being made?\" \nRickards also said he would be watching gold prices , which have been slumping in recent months. \n\"If U.S. GDP is strong, and the Fed raises rates, we're looking at probably not too much movement in the gold price.\" \nKitco spot gold stood at $1155.20 an ounce, down $2.30, as of 4:59 p.m. New York time.
