It last stood at $0.7585, down nearly 1 percent on the week. Key support is still at $0.7534, a six-year trough reached in early April.\nAustralia’s retail sales rose 0.3 percent in May, short of the 0.5 percent increase forecast. The previous month was downwardly revised to a fall of 0.1 percent, the first monthly decline in 11 months.\nThe Aussie also underperformed its peers, particularly against its New Zealand counterpart which pulled away from a near two-year trough. The Aussie fetched NZ$1.1305, down from the peak of NZ$1.1429 earlier in the week.\nIn contrast, the kiwi was steady at $0.6718 and looking for a quiet end to a tough week after the U.S. dollar was briefly unsettled by U.S. jobs data. {ID:nL1N0ZI0OH]\nThe kiwi plumbed a five-year low of $0.6664 overnight and is down 1.7 percent for the week as sliding dairy prices and falling business sentiment built the case for more rate cuts.\nAnalysts are now predicting the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will undo all of last year’s tightening and take its cash rate back to 2.5 percent by 2016.\nThe kiwi’s outlook has faded accordingly.\n“Momentum is negative and there is little solid support ahead of the mid-2010 lows around $0.6580,” BNZ senior strategist Kimberly Martin said in a note.\nShe said the kiwi’s best chance for a pick-up was if there were serious doubts about whether the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise rates this year.\nNear-term support is the overnight low with $0.6780 capping the topside.\nHow both Antipodean currencies perform next week hinges on the Greek referendum, which could decide the country’s future in Europe. On Thursday, the International Monetary Fund warned of a huge financial hole facing Athens.\nWith caution dominating sentiment, government bonds were in favour. New Zealand government bond yields eased 2 basis points across the curve.\nAustralian government bond futures were slightly firmer with the three-year contract 3 ticks higher at 97.900. The 10-year contract edged up 3 ticks to 96.8750.\nFirst Published on July 3, 2015 8:49 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T09:05:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
