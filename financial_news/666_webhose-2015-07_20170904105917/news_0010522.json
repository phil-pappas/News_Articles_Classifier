The Standard & Poor’s 500 index of large U.S. stocks fell 0.2% in the second quarter, its first quarterly decline since the fourth quarter of 2012. \nThe three companies, which together manage $688 billion in assets, have churned out profits as they sold holdings into rising markets, a trend that peaked last year. Private-equity firms globally reaped a record $428 billion in 2014 asset sales, a 30% jump from the previous year, according to Preqin Ltd. The companies struggled in the second quarter to keep pace with last year’s earnings, when rising markets lifted gains in their funds. \n\"Appreciation and new investments have a tough time offsetting\" last year’s sales, Bill Conway, Carlyle’s chief investment officer and co-founder, said Wednesday on a conference call with analysts and investors. \"It’s a little concerning\" that high prices are preventing Carlyle from making new investments at the same pace that the firm put money to work in the past. \nThe value of a private equity firm’s buyout and real estate holdings affects economic net income, or ENI, because the metric in part depends on quarterly mark-to-market valuations of those investments. Accounting rules require the firms to value their portfolio holdings every quarter. Unique drivers \nThe three firms’ results were also each affected by unique drivers. \nCarlyle on Wednesday said losses in its hedge funds, international real estate and certain energy holdings played a part in its 24% decline in second-quarter profit. The Washington-based firm’s funds appreciated 3%, compared with 5% a year earlier. \nApollo, run by Leon Black, also reported results Wednesday. The New York-based firm, which aggressively sold private equity assets from 2011 to 2014, said profit fell 25% in the quarter as its pace of sales continued to slow and its buyout holdings gained 2.7% versus 5% a year ago. \nBlackstone, the biggest of the alternative asset managers, earlier this month reported a 62% drop in profit as certain companies it had taken public took a hit during the quarter. Stakes the New York-based firm owns in PBF Energy Inc., Travelport Worldwide Ltd., Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. and Brixmor Property Group Inc. were down between 13% and 18%. \nShares of Carlyle rose 0.3% to $26.09 and Apollo advanced 1.6% to $20.69 at 10:20 a.m. in New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-29T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-29T20:58:33.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
