The loonie extended declines after Canada’s policy makers lowered borrowing costs to stimulate an economy struggling with the declining price of oil, its major export. The Australian currency also reached a six-year nadir on Wednesday.\n“We could see further easing from all three central banks,” Bipan Rai, director of foreign-exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit, said by phone from Toronto, referring to Australia, New Zealand and Canada. “The signals we’re getting from global demand just aren’t the same as they were in the heyday for commodity exporters.”\nNew Zealand’s dollar was at 65.64 cents as of 9:16 a.m. Tokyo time. Canada’s dollar, known as the loonie for the image of an aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, slid 0.1 percent to C$1.2931 per greenback, after reaching as weak as C$1.2958 on Wednesday.\nAustralia’s currency lost 0.2 percent to 73.68 U.S. cents.\nWeaker prospects for dairy prices are an economic headwind, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said when it cut rates last month. Data released Thursday showed the country’s inflation held below the RBNZ’s target band for a third quarter.\n“Growth momentum across commodity economies remains weak, and outright growth is likely to slow further,” said Atul Lele, who manages $2 billion as the chief investment officer of Deltec International Group from Nassau, Bahamas. “That may ultimately lead to deleveraging across housing and other asset classes, all necessitating increasing monetary stimulus.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-16T08:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T03:43:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
