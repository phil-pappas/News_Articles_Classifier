There were about 30 people in the factory when the blast occurred, and all five near the blast were injured, two critically and three seriously, he added.\nA local TV station showed pictures of shattered glass, debris and a collapsed ceiling at the low-rise facility close to the Idaho border. News reports said the blast was felt as much as a mile away.\n\"It was almost like a sonic boom that went through the community,\" Schaeffer said.\nRuptured pipes sent many thousands of gallons of water mixed with chemicals rushing down streets, Schaeffer said, and emergency crews built a dike to stop the water from reaching storm drains and the nearby Pend Oreille River.\nZodiac, based in Plaisir, France, said in a statement that it was still investigating the cause. \"Our first thoughts go to our colleagues who have been injured in the accident and have been evacuated to local hospitals,\" the company said.\nZodiac is a major global supplier of aircraft seats, interiors and other components, and has come under scrutiny recently for production problems at its cabin interiors and seats factories in the U.S.\nThe problems caused delays in deliveries of Boeing and Airbus jetliners, and prompted Zodiac to warn recently that its profits would fall short of earlier targets.\nBoeing and Airbus said in statements that they were monitoring the situation though it was too early to tell what impact, if any, the explosion would have on their operations.\nZodiac's cabin interiors division is responsible for galleys, lavatories and other structures and components used in aircraft cabins.
