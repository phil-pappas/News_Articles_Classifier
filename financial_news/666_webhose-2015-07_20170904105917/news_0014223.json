A daily close above the 14.6% Fibonacci retracement at 0.6679 exposes the 23.6% level at 0.6791. Alternatively, a move below channel resistance-turned-support at 0.6601 clears the way for a challenge of the July 16 low at 0.6497. Risk/reward considerations argue against entering long with prices in close proximity to resistance . On the other hand, the absence of a defined bearish reversal signal suggests taking up the short side is premature. We will remain flat for now, waiting for an actionable opportunity to present itself.
