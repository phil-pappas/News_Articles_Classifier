The new vessel is expected to serve the biggest trade lane into Ghana – that is Far East to West Africa. \nThis is the second time Maersk Line has named a vessel after a Ghanaian city. The first was in 2011, when MV Maersk Cape Coast was christened after the famous and historical Ghanaian city. \nMV Maersk Tema, according to Mr Zafar, was named after the country’s premier port city primarily due to the significant and important role Tema plays in Ghana. \nTema, which was once a small fishing village, has since independence metamorphosed to become the industrial and logistical hub of the country. \nThe “Harbour Town”, as it is popularly referred to, is home to several light and heavy industries which include oil refinery, agro/food processing, steel works, aluminium smelting and fishing. \nMaersk Line is the leading shipping line in Ghana with over 20 years of experience. The Line’s global network has more than 500 ships, 46,000 ports of call and representation in over 125 countries. \nThe carrier currently operates 2 fixed weekly services into and out of Tema from the Far East, Middle East, Europe, Africa and the America’s. The carrier also has a fortnightly service into and out of Takoradi. \nMaersk Line has the widest coverage in the market with offices in Tema, Takoradi and Kumasi. The Line’s goal is to help Ghanaian business grow by exploiting the opportunities global trade has to offer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-13T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-13T04:51:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
