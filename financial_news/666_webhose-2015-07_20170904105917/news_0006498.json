Morgan Chase & Co. intends to pay at least $125 million to settle probes by state and federal authorities over its collection and sale of credit-card debt, people familiar with the matter said.\nThe settlement, the latest by regulators to crack down on credit-card and debt-collection abuses, also includes about $50 million in restitution, the people said.\nJ.P. Morgan JPM, -1.51% the largest U.S. bank by assets, has been accused of relying on robosigning and other methods of collecting debt from consumers that they may not have owed and providing inaccurate information to debt buyers, an area regulators have scrutinized in recent years at several financial-services firms.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 47 states and the District of Columbia are expected to announce the settlements as early as Wednesday afternoon, the people said. The states are slated to divvy up around $95 million, while the CFPB is expected to receive $30 million, the people said.\nReuters reported the expected settlement with J.P. Morgan on Tuesday.\nJ.P. Morgan disclosed the CFPB probe in an August 2013 regulatory filing. The CFPB issued a warning earlier in 2013 to the financial industry that it would scrutinize alleged abuses in debt collection, such as falsely representing the size of debt and failing to post payments made by borrowers.\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-to-settle-credit-card-probes-for-125-millionsources-1436321426?mod=mktw"], "published": "2015-07-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-08T17:25:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
