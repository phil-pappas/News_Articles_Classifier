But the challenges of high unemployment, stagnant wages and record levels of student debt are keeping many non-wealthy 20- and 30-somethings from saving.\n“They do have the desire to save, it’s just the question of having the means,” said Claes Bell, a banking analyst at personal finance site Bankrate.com.\nThat desire is likely a result of coming of age during the financial crisis — possibly a better scare tactic than any lecture from a parent or a financial services company to illustrate to young people of all wealth levels the importance of saving. And nearly 60% of affluent millennials said they expect another financial crisis to occur, according to Linked In and Ipsos.\n“They saw how their parents and grandparents have dealt with these challenges in the economy, so they’re ready for it, they’re more prepared,” said Menaka Thillaiampalam, the head of financial services at LinkedIn.\nBut good intentions can be thwarted by the economic reality facing most millennials. While 36% of this group overall expect another financial crisis, they’ve struggled to save and prepare. Just 42% of young people are saving more than 5% of their income compared with 54% of Gen Xers and 48% of baby boomers, who are saving more than 5%, according to Bankrate data.\nLinkedIn / Ipsos “When you have a millennial who is trying to get on their feet, they do have a full-time job and they are starting to enter the workforce, they’re thinking do I put that money in a retirement account or do I use it to pay down that debt?” said Jen Mishory, the executive director of Young Invincibles, a young-adult focused advocacy group.\nSo how do the 15.5 million rich millennials studied by LinkedIn manage to avoid the obstacles faced by most of their age group? Between 2007 and 2061 this group will get access to $59 trillion as wealth transfers to them from previous generations. Getting free money from your parents is a proven strategy for young people to get a leg up in their financial lives. More than half of young home buyers received help from their parents both in paying for college and making a down payment on a home paying for college, according to Zillow data cited by The Atlantic , but just 3% of millennials overall fit into this so-called “ double lucky ” category.\n“If you have less income, that makes it tougher to save,” Bell said.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.zillow.com/research/the-doubly-lucky-3-percent-10061/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=emm-0715_prdigest-0708millennialstextcta", "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/millennials-with-rich-parents/398501/"], "published": "2015-07-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T15:52:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
