Foreign investors remain active, accounting for 35 per cent of transactions year to date compared with 19 per cent over the past 10 calendar years.\nThe part transaction (37.5 per cent) of International Tower 3 at Barangaroo to Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) accounted for one-third of the $1.7 billion of assets bought by foreigners during the quarter.\n\"NSW continues to attract the most capital among the states, having recorded the highest volume of transactions for four consecutive quarters,\" Mr McNabb said.\nThis comes as ownership of the Investa platform enters the next stage in the coming week, where the potential bidders will start talking in earnest to vendor Morgan Stanley and the Investa senior management.\nIt is said the final stage has five interested parties, Brookfield, whose infrastructure arm made a $9-billion bid for Australia's largest ports and rail operator, Asciano, last week; Cromwell, which has teamed up with South African real estate company, Redfine Properties; private equity giant Blackstone; DEXUS Property and its partner, the Middle Eastern fund, ADIA; as well as LaSalle Investment Management, which has teamed up with the Chinese Investment Corporation.\nBids for Investa's $6.5-billion platform, which comprises a portfolio of directly held assets, being a range of the country's best known skyscrapers including 400 George Street, Sydney, a management platform that spans the balance sheet assets, in addition to listed entity Investa Office Fund and its unlisted stablemate Investa Commercial Property Fund (ICPF), are due on Tuesday, July 7.\nThe mood among the bidders and the vendor is said to be cordial, but any new owner will have to negotiate a minefield of cross-ownership and pre-emptive rights of assets before any sales can occur.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-04T16:09:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
