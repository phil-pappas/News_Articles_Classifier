With markets declining in response, many questions come to mind — including these two: Why are markets reacting as though the result is a surprise? And what does this mean for American investors?\nThe first question has no obvious answer. Sadly, I think Greece’s financial crisis will hurt American investors. But I am hoping that this damage will be limited to the extent of the leveraged bets by U.S.-based hedge funds who wagered that Greece will remain in the Eurozone.\nI say sadly because unlike the 2008 financial crisis for which American subprime mortgage lenders and borrowers are the guilty parties, America is only responsible for the Greek financial crisis thanks to its decision to trade with Europe.\nIt was Europe that in January 1999 launched the euro, a single currency zone in which 19 countries now participate under the European Central Bank’s supervision, with the idea that sharing a common currency would create economic incentives to end the deadly political conflict that has riven that continent for centuries.\nBut the Euro experiment was not thought through very clearly.
