This is the highest quarterly concentrate production since operations began. \nGold concentrate production was 238,000 ounces, more than double the 113,000 ounces in the second quarter of 2014. \nTurquoise Hill repeated its previous forecast for full-year output of 175,000 to 195,000 tonnes of copper and 600,000 to 700,000 ounces of gold in concentrates. \nIn May, Mongolia and Rio Tinto reached an agreement that paved the way for work to resume on the $5 billion mine that is expected to drive growth for the country and company. A crucial next step for the expansion is securing finance. \nOyu Tolgoi started production in 2013.
