But uncertainty abroad has increased and it is difficult to assess the consequences of the situation in Greece,\" the bank said in a statement. \n\"In this uncertain environment, monetary policy needs to be even more expansionary to ensure that inflation continues to rise towards the target of 2.0 percent,\" it said. \nThe Riksbank has been trying to lift inflation since it stalled at the end of 2012, and has kept the repo rate in negative territory, which encourages spending, since February. \nSweden, like the neighbouring eurozone, has been concerned about the threat of deflation. Long spells of falling prices can be extremely destructive for economies if consumers start to postpone purchases in hopes of better deals, as that can set off a spiral of job, wage and output cuts that further reduce prices. \nThe Riksbank said its expansionary policy was having the desired effect with inflation, excluding mortgage rates, ticking in at 1.0 percent in May and expected to be close to 2.0 percent by the end of the year. \n\"Prices of goods and food are increasing in line with historical averages, while the rate of price increase on services is rising from a low level,\" it said. \nThe bank said economic activity was also continuing to strengthen and the situation on the labour market was gradually improving. \nIt also said it was extending the purchases of government bonds by a further 45 billion kronor (4.81 billion euros, $5.32 billion) with effect from September and until the end of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-02T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-02T12:25:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
