(\"Citigroup\") announced today the expiration and final tender results of its previously announced cash tender offers (each, an \"Offer\" and, collectively, the \"Offers\") with respect to each series of notes set forth in the first table below (the \"Any and All Notes\") and the second table below (the \"Maximum Tender Notes\", and together with the Any and All Notes, the \"Notes\"). \nThese Offers, in which Notes totaling approximately U.S. $1.54 billion are being accepted, are consistent with Citigroup's liability management strategy, and reflect its ongoing efforts to enhance the efficiency of its funding and capital structure. Since 2013, Citigroup redeemed or retired U.S. $26.8 billion of securities, excluding exchanged securities, of which U.S. $4.7 billion was redeemed or retired in 2015, reducing Citigroup's overall funding costs. Citigroup will continue to consider opportunities to redeem or repurchase securities, based on several factors, including without limitation, the economic value, potential impact on Citigroup's net interest margin and borrowing costs, the overall remaining tenor of Citigroup's debt portfolio, capital impact, as well as overall market conditions. \nThe final Settlement Date (the \"Final Settlement Date\") is expected to occur on June 17, 2015 for all series of Notes. \nAs the Expiration Date for the Offers was June 12, 2015, the deadline for tendering Notes pursuant to the Offers has now passed. \nOn the Early Tender Date, Citigroup accepted an aggregate principal amount of U.S. $250 million of the 6.125% Subordinated Notes due 2036, and purchased such Maximum Tender Notes on the Early Settlement Date. The Holders of such Maximum Tender Notes that validly tendered their Maximum Tender Notes on or prior to the Early Tender Date received the applicable Total Consideration, inclusive of the Early Tender Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Early Settlement Date. Because the aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Subordinated Notes due 2036 accepted for purchase on the Early Settlement Date equaled the upsized Maximum Series Tender Cap for such series of Maximum Tender Notes, Citigroup did not accept for purchase any additional such Maximum Tender Notes tendered after the Early Tender Date. Any of the 6.125% Subordinated Notes due 2036 that were tendered after the Early Tender Date and on or prior to the Expiration Date will be returned to the Holders of such Maximum Tender Notes. \nOn the Early Tender Date, Citigroup accepted an aggregate principal amount of approximately U.S. $222 million of the 5.875% Subordinated Notes due 2033 and purchased such Maximum Tender Notes on the Early Settlement Date. Citigroup has accepted all such Maximum Tender Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date, but on or prior to the Expiration Date, of approximately $265,000 aggregate principal amount. Holders of these Maximum Tender Notes are entitled to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration which is equal to the Total Consideration applicable to such Notes less the Early Tender Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Settlement Date. \nOn the Early Tender Date, Citigroup accepted an aggregate principal amount of approximately U.S. $1.06 billion of the 3.375% Notes due 2023, the 5.850% Notes due 2034, the 5.875% Notes due 2037, the 6.875% Notes due 2038 and purchased such Any and All Notes on the Early Settlement Date. Citigroup has accepted all Any and All Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Date, but on or prior to the Expiration Date, of approximately $1.9 million aggregate principal amount. Holders of these Any and All Notes are entitled to receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration which is equal to the Total Consideration applicable to such Notes less the Early Tender Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the Final Settlement Date. \nThe following tables set forth the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes that were validly tendered and accepted for purchase on or prior to the Expiration Date. \nRead the complete release with tables . \nThe Offers were made pursuant to the offer to purchase dated May 15, 2015 (as amended or supplemented through the Expiration Date, the \"Offer to Purchase\"), and the related letter of transmittal (as amended or supplemented through the Expiration Date, the \"Letter of Transmittal\") which set forth in more detail the terms and conditions of the Offers. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement shall have the meaning given to them in the Offer to Purchase. \nCitigroup retained its affiliate, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., to serve as the sole dealer manager for the Offers. Global Bondholder Services Corporation was retained to serve as the depositary and information agent with respect to the Notes. Copies of the Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal may be obtained at no charge from Global Bondholder Services Corporation. \nThis press release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation to buy any of these Notes nor is it a solicitation for acceptance of any of the Offers.
