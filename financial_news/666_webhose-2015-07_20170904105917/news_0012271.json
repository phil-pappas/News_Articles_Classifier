Australians fear of invasion at 50 year low. Supplied Share on twitter by John Kerin Australians are the most relaxed they've been about being invaded by another country in 50 years but hold grave fears about the threat of terrorism and being caught up in a terror attack.\nThe findings come in an aggregation of public surveys of defence and national security attitudes included in a public discussion paper of a defence white paper released this week.\nThe paper finds fewer Australians fear an invasion by another country than at any time since modern polling on the topic was introduced in 1965; even China is being viewed more as economic opportunity than a security threat despite sabre rattling in the South China Sea.\nBut Australians hold grave concerns about the threat of terrorism and being involved in a terror attack in the wake of the advent of the war on terror in 2001 and this has been reinforced by the emergence of the murderous Islamic State/Daesh in Iraq and Syria and the homegrown terrorist threat.\n\"Since the high point of the early 1980's perceptions of a security threat from another nation State have declined,\" the report said.\n\"Currently less than one in four see a [nation state] security threat to Australia, the lowest figure recorded since the question was first asked in an opinion poll in 1965,\" the report said.\nAccording to the report fear of a Russian invasion reached its height after the 1979 Cold War invasion of Afghanistan when 40 per cent of Australians feared such a consequence but fear of a Chinese invasion was actually higher at the time of the Vietnam War in the late 60's and early 70's than it is now.\nAbout 16 per cent of respondents in the latest surveys feared a Chinese invasion, which is consistent with the findings of a Lowy Institute of International Affairs poll released this year that found only 15 per cent considered China to be a military threat â€¦ though 39 per cent considered it could become one in the next 20 years.\n Fear of terrorist attack However, based on more modern terror surveys carried out since 2007 the report said \"there is widespread concern among the public that they or a close family member will be the victim of a terrorist attack\" with between 44 per cent and 49 per cent very concerned or somewhat concerned about the prospect.\nMore than half or 56 per cent believed there would be a terror attack in future.\nThe advent of Islamist terrorism with its macabre spectre of the lone wolf terrorist kidnapping a bystander and executing them has seen Australians sense of personal security plummet.\nThis year's Lowy Institute poll saw the proportion of Australians considering themselves \"very safe\" plunging to its lowest level in the polls' 11 year history to just 24 per cent down from 42 per cent in 2010.\nThough Prime Minister Tony Abbott has pledged to boost Australian defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP or more than $50 billion a year by 2022-23, the survey shows the public supports extra defence spending only in times of increased threat and would prefer more money is spent on health and education than defence when government spending is tight.\nWhite paper community consultation expert panel chairman, Dr Peter Jennings said the public consultation process revealed \"people seem to treat having a defence capability like an insurance policy\".\n\"The lack of concern about invasion might simply come from knowing it's there without knowing much about it and we need to raise awareness of what defence does,\" he said.\nDr Jennings said the paradox when it came to China was well put by Prime Minister Tony Abbott when he suggested dealing with Beijing for Australia represented striking a \"balance between fear and greed\".\n\"It's pretty resident in Australian thinking. People are aware of how China underwrites the economy and the troubles in the South China Sea might be just a bit remote for most Australians,\" he said.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/https://twitter.com/JohnKerin2"], "published": "2015-07-02T13:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-03T01:00:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
