Today Walmart is kicking off Back to Class Cyber Days online and on its mobile app featuring 30 percent more Rollbacks and hundreds of special buys timed to a historical spike in traffic when customers start the bulk of their back-to-school shopping. \n\"When the calendar changes from July to August, it's like a switch flips in parents' minds,\" said Steve Breen, Senior Vice President of Merchandising for Walmart.com. \"We can literally start to see it happen with a traffic spike on July 31, and this year we're timing thousands of the season's biggest Rollbacks to when we know our customers are coming to our site to check-off their back-to-school shopping lists.\" \nNew Rollbacks Offer Lowest Prices Ever \nOn top of thousands of Rollbacks, Walmart took online prices to an all-time low on the top 10 items searched in the weeks leading up to Back to Class Cyber Days. This aggressive pricing action ensures that customers can find the most popular back-to-school items at unbelievable prices. Walmart is further extending its commitment to these lowest-ever prices by making certain that if supply runs out on any one of these top 10 items, a new Rollback on a like item will be added. And Rollbacks last for 90 days, so Walmart is making it more affordable for parents and students to shop from now until after the first bell.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-31T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-31T08:33:26.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
