The New York Department of Financial Services has asked Deustche Bank DB, +0.65% to answer for a suspected bribe paid to one of its employees in Moscow, the Financial Times reported on Monday. The request comes as the agency continues to investigate whether the German bank made $6 billion of trades for Russian clients as part of a money laundering scheme. The bank disclosed in June that it was conducting its own investigation, one that resulted in the suspension of several Moscow employees. The trades, called mirror trades, allowed Deutsche’s Russian clients to move funds out of the country, possibly illegally. The Financial Times reports that the Russian central bank is also investigating the trades and the German financial regulator, BaFin, as well as the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and the European Central Bank are also involved.\nBaFin is already investigating what was previously reported as potentially criminal individual behavior by Deutsche bank employees related to Libor rate manipulation and lying to the central bank by senior executives. Deutsche paid a record $2.5 billion penalty in April for manipulation of the Libor and Euribor inter-bank rates to U.S. regulators and the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority because the bank tried to mislead regulators and hamper the investigations.\nLaw firm Baker and McKenzie’s Dan Goelzer writes in his monthly update to clients that the competition between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board over who should mandate audit partner disclosure should be resolved in favor of the SEC. Goelzer is a former general counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a founding board member of the PCAOB. “In light of the SEC’s broad statutory responsibility for disclosure-based investor protection, the issue of whether and how this type of information should be disclosed would seem to fall squarely within its jurisdiction,” he says. He goes on to say that any disclosure of the audit partner name to the public will result in more work and more costs for audit committees. Audit committees would now need to be aware of litigation, restatements or similar events arising in other audits led by their engagement partner. “Audit committees will have to focus on the engagement partner’s record with respect to other engagements, and that is something that many audit committees aren’t much aware of today,” he said in an interview.\nThe U.S. Treasury released on Monday a version what happened last October 15 when the Treasury market experienced its version of the flash crash. On that day last October the 10-year Treasury experienced a 37 basis point trading range, one of the biggest swings of all time, without any real news driving the volatility. MarketWatch reported on Monday that a joint report prepared by Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the New York Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found no single cause. One curious finding: There also was a high percentage of so-called self-trades — when the same entity is taking both sides of the trade. Self-trading in 10-year U.S. Treasuries reached 14.9% for cash and 11.5% for futures. Bloomberg reported on Monday that “much of the day’s events remains a mystery…Meanwhile, the degree to which liquidity, or ease of trading, in the vast U.S. Treasury market has deteriorated remains the ultimate enigma.”\nThe House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing on Tuesday morning to discuss transparency and accountability at the Federal Reserve, in particular the Federal Reserve’s refusal to comply with Congressional investigations and requests for information from Congress. That involves a leak of sensitive information from the Fed to Medley Global Advisers.\nThe European Union is investigating countries suspected of offering sweetheart tax deals to multinationals , the Financial Times reported on Monday. Apple AAPL, +0.37% issued warnings that its penalty could be “material” if Ireland is forced by an EU decision to claw back the money given in allegedly preferential tax deals. Amazon AMZN, +3.04% and Apple were targets of the recent LuxLeaks document leak scandal which revealed cozy tax deals in Luxembourg arranged by global accounting firm PwC. Amazon is also facing a pending IRS decision after going to trial last November in Seattle over a potential multibillion dollar penalty for its alleged Luxembourg tax avoidance scheme.\nMore from MarketWatch", "external_links": ["http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/2691fda0-296c-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html??ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/FirstFTEurope/product#axzz3frgQz65J", "http://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks/explore-documents-luxembourg-leaks-database", "http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/Joint_Staff_Report_Treasury_10-15-2015.pdf", "http://www.taxanalysts.com/www/features.nsf/Articles/402790BB1F5BACFE85257AFE006D8FED", "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/32e6a5c4-1a80-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996.html#axzz3frgQz65J", "http://www.bakermckenzie.com/files/Uploads/Documents/Publications/NA/nl_washingtondc_auditupdate22_jul15.pdf", "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-13/here-s-what-we-learned-from-the-official-report-on-the-flash-crash-in-u-s-treasuries"], "published": "2015-07-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-14T22:06:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
