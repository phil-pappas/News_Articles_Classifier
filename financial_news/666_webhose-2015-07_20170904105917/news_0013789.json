But it remains to be seen whether there are enough backers at the ALP national conference for it to be included in the party's platform. \nThe draft platform only states the party will promote the \"sound, sustainable development of Australia's energy resources\" taking into account \"the need to ensure security of domestic energy supplies including gas\". \nFederal Labor resources spokesman Gary Gray has argued intervention in the gas market would dampen investment and jobs. \nIn June, the West Australian coalition government signed an agreement with the Woodside-led Browse joint venture whereby it will quarantine 15 per cent of production from the state's 65 per cent share of one of the project's three gas fields for the domestic market. \nThe South Australian Labor government has been critical of domestic reservation saying producers would be more likely to keep the gas in the ground rather than sell below world prices. \nThe peak gas body, the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, says reserving gas will imperil jobs and investment in the sector. \nManufacturer Alcoa has argued that in the absence of governments backing more domestic gas production, a reservation policy is essential for energy security. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook PM backs Joyce despite anger over mine AAP \nPrime Minister Tony Abbott has again excused Barnaby Joyce's outburst over a Chinese coal mine in his NSW electorate, …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-10T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-10T04:11:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
