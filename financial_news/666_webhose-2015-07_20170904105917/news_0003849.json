Reuters by Karen Maley Investors have been put on notice again to expect a US interest rate rise in 2015, with US central bank boss Janet Yellen saying the world's largest economy has improved \"a great deal\".\nIn her semiannual testimony to US Congress, Yellen pointed to the benefits of rate rises coming sooner rather than later.\n\"If we wait longer, it certainly could mean that when we begin to raise rates we might have to do so more rapidly,\" she said. \"An advantage to beginning a little bit earlier is that we might have a more gradual path of rate increases.\"\nOne reason for Yellen's optimism about the US economic outlook is the improvement in the jobs market, with the US unemployment rate down to 5.3 per cent in June.\nBut Yellen was also confident US consumers would begin soon to open their wallets, arguing that \"households have both the wherewithal and the confidence to purchase big-ticket items\".\nAs a result, Yellen showed no inclination to wait until 2016 to start increasing interest rates \"if the economy evolves as we expect\".The US Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been stuck close to zero since December 2008.\nYellen's comments put her at odds with the International Monetary Fund, which cautioned the Fed earlier in July that it risked stalling the US economy if it raised interest rates too soon.\nToo much uncertainty Instead, the Washington-based fund called for the Fed to delay a move until 2016, saying that there was still too much uncertainty regarding inflation and employment to warrant a rate rise.\nBut though most market participants are factoring in a US interest rate rise in September or December, not everyone is convinced.\nHigh-profile bond manager Jeffrey Gundlach, the head of DoubleLine Capital, poured scorn this week on the idea that the US central bank would raise rates in 2015, arguing that although the Fed had a strong desire to raise rates, the US economy was not strong enough to permit it to do so.\nGundlach told a conference in New York this week that the Fed had over-estimated again the strength of the US economy. When the weakness in the US economy became evident, the data-dependent US central bank would be forced to delay increases, he said.\nGundlach also argued that the market was misinterpreting Yellen's words.\"When Yellen says she will raise rates if economic growth improves, people hear 'she will raise rates'.\" But \"that's not what she said\", he cautioned.\nThe question of if, and when, the US central bank will raise rates is of key interest to bond market players. When US interest rates start rising the price of bonds will probably fall – perhaps steeply. This is because the coupon rate on the bond will be less attractive to investors and as a result they will not be prepared to pay as much for it.\nThis is less of a problem for investors who plan on holding their bonds until maturity. They will continue to receive regular coupon payments on their bonds and, barring a default, will have their principal repaid when the bond matures.\nNo choice But it's much more of an issue for bond funds because these tend to trade bonds rather than hold them until maturity. Bond funds also face the risk that fund investors – worried about falling bond prices – decide to head for the exit, giving managers of the fund no choice but to sell bonds to meet redemptions.\nBut some analysts warn that the ripple effects of a US rate hike will spread beyond bond markets and could create turbulence in other markets.\nOne of the world's most powerful hedge fund managers warned earlier in 2015 that the Fed risked triggering a 1937-style sharemarket slump by raising rates prematurely,\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, which manages almost $US170 billion ($229 billion) in assets, said in a note sent to clients in March that he was avoiding large financial bets for fear the Fed's expected tightening could have unexpected consequences.\n\"We don't know – nor does the Fed know – exactly how much tightening will knock over the apple cart,\" the note said. \"We think it would be best for the Fed to err on the side of being later and more delicate than normal.\"\nThe note pointed to the similarity between US financial conditions now and those that prevailed in 1937. In both periods, interest rates fell to zero and monetary stimulus sparked a rally in asset prices and a recovery in the US economy.\nHowever, once the Fed started to tighten monetary policy bonds sold off and the sharemarket slumped by more than 50 per cent from its 1937 peak to a low in March 1938.\nBut others believe that the US central bank faces an equally serious risk – of fuelling an asset price bubble – if it delays raising interest rates.\nEarlier in July Esther George, the head of the Kansas City Fed, argued that economic conditions were ripe for a modest rise in short-term interest rates, adding that \"we would be wise to act modestly but act now\".\nGeorge, who is seen as one of the more hawkish Fed policymakers, added that by moving too slowly in 2004 the Fed – run then by Alan Greenspan – had fuelled inflation and caused labour markets to overheat \"amid one of the most historic credit bubbles in US history\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-17T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-17T23:03:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
