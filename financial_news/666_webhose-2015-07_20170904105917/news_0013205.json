These sales include those to 665 third-party-owned Skechers retail stores outside the United States.\nAt company-owned stores, total comparable sales rose 12.9 percent in the second quarter, driven by demand for shoes such as the Skechers men's relaxed fit and Skechers GO line for women.\nAt the end of the quarter, Skechers had 461 company-owned stores, of which 95 were in international markets.\nAnalysts on average were expecting same-store sales to rise 6.1 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.\n\"We believe that our accelerated growth trend will remain through 2015 and into 2016,\" Chief Executive Robert Greenberg said in a statement.\nNet earnings attributable to Skechers rose to $79.8 million, or $1.55 per share, in the three months ended June 30 from $34.8 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of $1.01 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet revenue soared to $800.5 million, handily beating the average analyst estimate of $736.4 million.\nUp to Wednesday's close, Skechers' shares had risen about 133 percent since the start of the year.
