She did not provide details. \nPetrobras said in an emailed statement that the company was operating normally despite the strike. \n\"We have taken all the necessary steps to guarantee the production of oil and gas the supply of products to the market. \nThe union also opposes planned legislation that would strip Petrobras' right to be the sole operator of huge offshore reserves located off Brazil's southeastern coast. \nMost of these fields lie more than a mile below the ocean's surface and under another 2.5 miles of earth and salt. \nPetrobras is currently embroiled in a massive corruption-kickback scandal that prosecutors have said involves at least $800 million in bribes and other illegal funds. Some of that money was allegedly funneled back to the ruling Workers' Party and its allies' campaign coffers. It also allegedly included the payment of bribes to Petrobras executives in return for inflated contracts. \nPetrobras is Brazil's biggest company and is in charge of tapping big offshore oil fields and creating wealth that leaders hope will propel the country to developed world status.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-24T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-24T19:42:10.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
