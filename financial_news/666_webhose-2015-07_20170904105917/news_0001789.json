The building's owners have been fighting a losing battle to stop apartment owners offering short-stay accommodation.\nAnother effort to curb short-stay operators in Melbourne's apartment sector has failed after Victoria's planning tribunal ruled owners' corporations cannot make rules to ban the practice.\nA final twist in the long-running saga involving the Watergate apartment in Docklands was played out in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal last month when the building's manager sought an order restraining owners from renting their units for less than 30 days.\nTribunal member Linda Rowland found the Watergate owners' corporation did not have power under state legislation to make or enforce a rule prohibiting short stays.\nThe ruling clears the way for operators throughout the state and is a blow to apartment owner-occupiers worried about unruly behaviour, parties and property damage from transient tenants leasing via US-based websites like Airbnb and Couchsurfing.\nStrata Title Lawyers principal and Watergate owners corporation solicitor Tom Bacon said the the building's managers were considering appealing the VCAT decision.\nA decision on an appeal would be made within the next two months, he said.\n\"The VCAT decision does shut the door on any owners' corporation in Victoria either enforcing a rule or passing a rule to curb short-term stays,\" he said.\nThe restraining order targeted Watergate apartment owner Paul Salter, who along with his partner Belinda Balcombe runs Docklands Executive Apartments which leases 11 units in the building to short-stay tenants.\nMr Salter told the tribunal in 8&frac12; years of operating he had 3500 bookings and 10,500 guests and only a small number of negative incidents.\nShort-term guests were no more disruptive than the long-term tenants, he said, and in the event of a serious incident, he was able to immediately evict his guest.\nThe owners' corporation said 90 per cent of apartment owners were opposed to short-term letting and were concerned about guests jamming lift doors with luggage, loitering and breaching the building's security.\nLate last year Mr Salter won a long-running and costly Supreme Court case against the City of Melbourne, which argued short-term stays breached building regulations.\nThe issue has been tested in the Building Appeals Board, Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and now VCAT.\nMr Bacon said, aside from an appeal of the VCAT decision, only changes to City of Melbourne zoning laws or the introduction of state legislation would stamp out the practice.\nConsumer Affairs Minister Jane Garrett in February appointed a seven-person panel to look at the impact of short-term letting and make recommendations.\nThe government's decision is expected this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-16T05:11:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
