Image by Barbara Roman \nThirty blocked emails? Twenty spam reports? You just may have a bad reputation. \nSchool girls and public figures aren’t the only ones who have reputations. Every email marketer has one too. The question is, is it a good reputation or a bad one. Did you know that your emailing history is visible by the ISPs (the AOLs, the Gmails, the Hotmails and the like) and can affect your email’s deliverability? \nA study by Return Path shows that 83% of the time, sender reputation is the major factor for emails being filtered as spam and not reaching the Inbox. \nHere are the current top ways to keep or re-gain your good reputation: Only send to those who have given you permission. A confirmed opt-in process is helpful as it doesn’t allow someone to sign up another person's email address without their knowledge, and makes the subscription process more memorable. If a recipient doesn’t remember signing up, there’s a good chance they’ll hit the Spam button when they receive your emails. Be sure the “from” line of your emails is recognizable. For example, if you sell shoes, it would help your recipient recognize your companies emails if they were coming from The Shoe Shopper as opposed to MIC International. Keep subject lines clear of sales words and special characters like “$”, “% off” “Save”, “Sale”, and “Free”. Remove your bounces. Continuing to send addresses that bounce your emails is a spam-like behavior. \nA bad email reputation won’t result in whispers and giggles in the locker room, but it will get your emails blocked from the Inboxes and greatly reduce your success. \nSo do what your momma told you. Do your chores. Brush your teeth. And protect your reputation. \nBy the way, your list isn’t too small to start email marketing ; there’s no such thing as too small of a list.
