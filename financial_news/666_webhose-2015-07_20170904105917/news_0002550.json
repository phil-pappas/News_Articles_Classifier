Financial services are the economic services provided by the finance industry. \nZimbabwe's position has not improved since a similar survey was published, largely because of policy and regulatory shortcomings. The country's financial services sector remains under-capitalised and constrained by a stubborn liquidity crunch. \n\"The restrictiveness of trade in financial services varies widely among African countries and is highest in Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Egypt. Zambia, Mauritius and Morocco have among the most open services trade regimes in the world,\" reads the report. \nThe report shows that restrictions are mainly caused by policy and regulatory shortcomings which inhibit the growth of the financial services sector in the African countries. \n\"A well-functioning financial system is critical to Africa's long-term growth, the financial sector can promote economic growth, stimulate investment and contribute to poverty reduction,\" the report says. \nMoyo said the report requires Zimbabwe to conduct self-introspection and compare itself with other countries in terms of performance of the services sector as well as policy differences. \nThe report says the formal financial sector in Africa performed poorer during the period 2009-2012 as monetary resources mobilised by the sector were 42,1% on average compared with 76,5% in other developing countries, with a world average of 72,3%. \nBetween 2009 and 2012 the services sector reportedly accounted for 32% of total employment in Africa. \nThe report recommends that African policy makers should place greater emphasis on how to move towards the provision of more sophisticated services where there is greater value addition, opportunities for technology transfer and linkage development with other sectors of the economy. \nFollow", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-18T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-19T06:16:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
