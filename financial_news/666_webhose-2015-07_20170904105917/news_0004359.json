Despite the strong competition from the likes of Apple and Samsung (I have a tablet by one and a phone by the other) it is actually an app rather than a device that has made me feel safer than anything else. But Uber is under attack from all and sundry. And that's because it deserves it. By STEPHEN GROOTES . \nI've always seen taxi drivers as people who hustle. Who push you, who sell their wares aggressively, who cannot be trusted. It's a feeling I've felt from the entrance to Ealing Broadway on the London Underground, at Washington DC's Union Station and at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. I still feel it at OR Tambo. Groups of men, milling around, almost always wearing black leather jackets, all trying to almost push you into their car. And always I feel like I'm going to be fleeced, I'm going to feel unsafe for a period of time, and will be lucky to actually arrive where I want to go.
