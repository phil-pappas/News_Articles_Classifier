Young people currently in year 12, who have been busy attending university open days, will receive a less generous package of support to the one their older siblings were offered – if they decide to go into higher education at all.\nThese grants for living costs have had two important characteristics. First, they are a deeply embedded part of the higher education system, existing in some form since at least 1962 (and arguably before then). They underpinned the shift from an elite to a mass system of higher education.\nAs the chancellor mentioned in his speech, maintenance grants were briefly abolished by New Labour when they chose to ignore the recommendations of the 1997 Dearing report . But that policy turned out to be temporary. The number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds did not change much, so the 2003 higher education white paper heralded the return of the grant.\nRelated: Maintenance grants scrapped and tuition fees to increase – your reaction\nTheir second key characteristic, as the name suggests, is that maintenance grants do not have to be repaid. They are paid out of the public purse to smooth over the fact that poorer households typically have a bigger aversion to debt and so might otherwise be deterred from pursuing higher-level study.\nThe reasoning behind today’s change is simultaneously obscure and obvious. At one level, it is hard to understand how replacing taxpayer-backed grants with taxpayer-backed loans reduces government spending. The money for the loans still has to be found upfront today, and even the government accepts that most graduates will not repay the loans in full. So there will still be a bill. But Whitehall’s accounting conventions mean not one penny of student loans appears in the figures for the country’s deficit, which is Osborne’s primary mission to eradicate.\nThe other reason for the change is that there has always been a trade-off between the cost of each university place and the number of students the country can afford to educate. Paying for more graduates via loans means the cost of each place is reduced (even if not all the money is repaid), especially as income tax receipts will go up when more graduates enter the labour market.\nMany people claim the policy will change behaviour and deter people from going to higher education. It might, but it is hard to know for certain. In 2010, one survey suggested 70% of students would not go to university if fees went as high as £7,000. In the event, they went up to £9,000 and the impact on demand for full-time study was barely discernible. If anything, the higher debts encouraged people to think more deeply about what and where to study rather than encouraging cheaper options.\nRelated: Almost half of English universities plan to recruit more students after cap is lifted\nBut perhaps there is a point at which bigger debts do become a disincentive. On the other hand, from this autumn universities will be allowed to recruit as many students as they like , so they will have less reason to shut people out than in the past.\nThe biggest problem with the policy may not be a behavioural one so much as a social or even moral one: the poorest students will emerge from higher education with the biggest debts. Ministers aim to neutralise that attack point by ensuring the higher loans deliver more cash-in-hand for the poorest students than the old grant-plus-loan system.\nThey may well get away with it: those who vehemently oppose the change have tended not to propose alternatives which recognise the government was democratically elected on a platform of abolishing the deficit by hitting unprotected departments, like the business department in which higher education lies.\nJoin the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.
