Treas. Notice 138 (July 20, 2015). Marketplace lenders, or “peer-to-peer lenders” as they are often referred to, are online platforms that match investors with borrowers. Some platforms cater to small business borrowers, others focus on consumer lending, and others focus on real estate lending, receivables factoring, student loan origination and much more. The marketplace lending industry originated $12 billion in loans of various types in 2014, two platforms have gone public, and several securitizations of these loans have been packaged and sold. Yet, the industry has remained largely ignored by policymakers and regulators on any systemic basis — until now. In the consumer area, there are a host of federal laws that apply to loans made to consumers, and many states also act to protect borrowers, regardless of who the lender is. Nevertheless, the state-by-state patchwork of laws and regulations, and the application of securities and banking laws designed for other purposes and generally applicable here, have caused slower evolution of this marketplace than would otherwise have been possible had the “rules” \nThe Treasury’ \nSome of the questions posed, however, reflect a complete misunderstanding of how marketplace lenders operate. Loans facilitated by marketplace lenders, which often use third-party banks to originate loans to consumers, are subject to the full panoply of federal and state consumer financial protection laws because they are typically originated by regulated financial institutions. In addition, investors in marketplace loans typically are investing in securities, thereby providing them with the protection of the U.S. securities laws relating Of some concern is the reference to how the government could help foster the marketplace lending industry. Governmental intervention in this space at this time could have the impact of increasing costs and compliance risks and restricting innovation. To date, Congress and the Obama administration have let marketplace lenders develop in a free-market manner. Nevertheless, even the hardiest free-market advocates recognize the need for governing principles and adherence to basic ethical standards, but the questions concerning “risk retention,” and their ilk, suggest that the requestors are thinking of these platforms as if they were banks, which they most certainly are not. There is no “promise” of the return of invested capital (as there is in a bank) nor a promise of any specific return (returns are a function of the underlying investments’ performance only — in that respect they are truly “peer-to-peer” The reference to requiring lenders to have “skin in the game” The Treasury’s Request will likely foster a discussion of the merits of government regulation of the marketplace lending industry. The best interests of the marketplace lending industry, which has few dominant players and no trade association, would be best served by thoughtful inte", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-07-28T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-07-28T00:18:03.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
